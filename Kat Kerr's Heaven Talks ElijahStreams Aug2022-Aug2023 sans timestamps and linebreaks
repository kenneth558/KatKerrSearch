This is the end of this video. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. Happy Wednesday, August 17, 2022. Welcome to the broadcast. It's going to be a great show today. We have Kat Kerr as always. It's going to be right an hour show starting now. She's got some other things she needs to do. This is the day before Eric Trump comes. So Eric Trump will be here tomorrow. Do not miss this. Be sure and text your friends. Call your friends and let them know. We've got some great questions for Eric. It's going to be great. Oh, by the way, yes. Thank you, Julie. It is 8 a.m. tomorrow. I would have forgotten that. It's 8 a.m. Pacific time. If you're on the East Coast, it will be 11. It's 8 a.m. in the morning. That's when we could get him. We're happy to do that. We did that one other time with General Flynn. It is 8 o'clock in the morning Pacific time. So there you have it. I'm just making sure I'm not missing any notes here. Before we bring Kat on, let's bring Mike and Lori Sally on. Let's talk about the wells. They are spearheading the whole thing, the whole project. I can't wait to hear all about it. So Mike and Lori Sally, take it away. Yeah, go ahead, Lori. We are so excited to update you specifically about the water wells in Uganda. I think one of your shows you shared about that we had had 300 salvations. Well, now it's up to over 800 people who have given their lives to Jesus because of these water wells. I was just in shock. Who knew that Jesus, we know he can turn water into wine, but who knew he was going to make these water wells and share the gospel in such an impactful way. People just be... I had always hoped that maybe a person or two would come to Jesus because of this, but I had no idea that this would be an evangelism tool where hundreds and hundreds, and we just think we're just getting started. We're just getting started. We're now doing a well a week. Every week, one well. So, wow. So we're up to 47 new wells that Elijah Streams has provided. 47. I was looking at the big organization that does work in Uganda and all of last year and then all they do is water. All they do. And they did 42 water projects, not even wells in the entire year. Really? Yeah. It's incredible the pace and the excitement of the people and I was surprised as well as how many people are coming to know Jesus because of this. It's crazy. It's not normal, actually. It's something God's doing. The anointing is all over this project and just the investment that people are making. It's incredible. I wanted to share one of the stories. So I was asking my team, like, tell me what does it look like? I mean, how is this happening? How are they sharing the gospel? Because, normally, I mean, pastors are out there sharing all the time and in this one particular area, so Elijah Streams, we are drilling wells in different parts of Uganda, not all in the same exact spot. So it's in different areas. One area that is really, really dry, it's a drought area and so it's kind of like the forgotten people. It's drought. They don't have a lot of government assistance. They don't have many organizations that are coming there to help and so what they've been doing is as the water company is coming out with their equipment, they're renting a speaker and hooking it up to a car and they're driving through the village and they're kind of announcing, hey, we want you to know what Jesus is doing. There's people that love Jesus, that are responding to him and they care about you and he cares about you and they want you to know about him and so then they start sharing the gospel and then right behind them, not very far, there's these huge, massive trucks that have these huge drilling implements and things and my team is telling me that not only are the water wells an amazing thing, but the fact that we're using this equipment, the technology that we're using to drill these wells is abnormal for them because normally when people come and drill a well, they do it by hand and we're thankful for those that are able to do that, but it's not as efficient because you can't go as deep, it's actually dangerous to do it like that, but people are in awe and imagine if it's not every day you see massive trucks coming in, you know, whenever they're in these villages, when strangers come, everybody stops what they're doing and they run and they want to know what's going on so they're using that first introduction of here's why we're doing this and then they're watching the process the entire time and then when they hit water, then when they hit water, they do a big commissioning and they gather everybody together and that's when their hearts are touched and they were telling me this story about this one woman, she's 71 years old and to me when I hear 71, that doesn't seem that old because I'm, you know, I'm in my 50s so 70 doesn't seem like it's that old but in Uganda that is old the life expectancy isn't that long, we know Jesus can do it 120 years more than that, but 71 she's considered an elder in her community and my team is telling me that she has zero faith, normally in Uganda you find people that are either, they adopt something, whether they're really born again or not and they say born again, we say Christians in the states but they always say born again and that means you're really born again she didn't believe in anything or she didn't really ascribe to any particular thing, she must have believed in a higher being because she testified that she used to say to whatever higher being she was talking to if somebody would come and solve this water crisis because I've been suffering, my parents were suffering my children are suffering, now my grandchildren are suffering and then whenever we came in and drilled this water and she saw the water coming she just started yelling God is alive, God is alive God is alive that's amazing she was so excited she truly was like the woman at the well because she then gave her life to Jesus people followed suit, they followed her, they thought if she believes in Jesus, I want the same Jesus and it was remarkable so Steve, over 800 people I can't I mean I do but it's like I mean I thought maybe a person or two would come to the Lord because of these wells, I had, I never saw this coming, not even close and we're just getting started one well a week it'll probably increase unless you run out of land to drill wells I don't think we'll run out of land there's a lot of people who contact us all the time really? oh yeah, all the time tell me about that for a minute do other people call and say bring a well here or what? I get emails every week from people that hear about what's going on with Elijah's streams and how we're providing this water can you do one for me here's somebody I know in this village that needs help here's a school that needs help I don't think we've gotten close to tapping out the potential yet and so it's pretty exciting just let those that are watching know it's not as easy as just people contacting and saying hey I need a water well here because we're trying to work with reputable well drillers that we can make sure that we're going to go deep enough and the water is going to be sustainable because you hear stories of water wells that were drilled by different organizations and maybe they're drilling it and go deep enough and then it ends up running dry and that's what we don't want that to happen so we're trying to do it through relations I know you brought a video your daughter Caitlin made this video so let's watch that video about it's kind of the latest I laughed because he said we're emptying hell and we're populating hell but you can populate but we understand what he means he said we're doing damage big time to hell I mean we are literally coming against hell so let's watch that video this year 2022 the recharge plants have been started so your denerasty is not only providing clean water but is emptying hell and populating heaven by souls coming to the kingdom and we talk about your Elijah's things so everyone prays for you and God bless you so very much Mike and Lorde Salle this is amazing before the launch of this power hall Moscow has been preached and about 15 people have accepted in Christ as Lord and Savior and even land has been donated to start a church in this place this is a testimony this is amazing these are 15 souls they have come to the kingdom of God today because of the donation of the power hall thank you very much it's so exciting he's like a kid isn't he well I'm like a kid you know I'm sitting here you guys are the same thing look what's going on I mean I can't believe it I do believe it but we are above and beyond anything I think any of us expected to happen wait to see what God is doing for sure well thank you both for coming I see Kat is now here so blessings to you both I appreciate it Mike and Lorde you're working with us very strongly to look into water situations that we will be talking about very very soon here in the states you are here and we're looking at a lot of different things related to the water so we'll be reporting that and a lot of people don't know we're helping a lot of other people even not related to the water but everyone who sows into this ministry receives a reward from him I mean without you know he says even if you give so much as a cup of cold water to one of these you will not lose your reward can you imagine the rewards God's passing out in heaven and on earth thank you to all of our viewers we appreciate it very much so thank you Mike and Lorde we'll see you soon and we'll bring on Kat bless you guys okay so without further ado let's do Wednesdays with Kat and Steve music and there she is hey Kat how are you I'm great thank you so good to have you back I got my Disneyland tie on and tell people why it's okay to still love Disneyland even though we hear some of these bad things you know I always look at the roots of something or the foundation of something and well we can even look at the throne of God Satan has taken many things that are actually some of the father's images the way he operates and he is on the earth polluted them and made them not good but that doesn't mean it's okay to partake of Satan stuff I'm just making an example Walt Disney was put on the earth by God at the time he was put on here and he was put here to create fun in family entertainment that's why people think well he doesn't care about entertainment well they have it in heaven people movies in heaven is all kinds of roller coasters because God knows we need fun and heaven I say is a good bit fun it is holy is pure there's nothing defiling there's no profanity there's no wickedness anywhere in heaven not in anything to create or make there but Walt had this passion in his heart to make a place that families could come and bring their children because even in those days there was a lot of craziness going on in the 60s and things weren't turning in the best direction in that time and so many things were going on that were not good he was determined and he really fought hard well in Orlando especially to get the land for Disney World but the reason he created that in those characters was so we could have something to laugh at and have fun and he is not happy himself right now with stuff that's going on but it is going to change and the father has adamantly told me it's going to change so a lot of maybe people might end up being removed and have this replaced there because I know when Walt was on the earth he was adamant about keeping it at a level that what was produced and the content that was produced not just at that time but for years to come could be enjoyed by family, by children and know that they were going to see something safe and when Disney World was open I actually went to the park here in Florida the first year they were open it was so many masses of people were coming to enjoy and talking about Disney I always appreciated was he always showed in his movies or any of the other things he created you knew the difference between good and evil and every time good would be the victor in the movies and any of the sets he made and he made sure that you knew that this was evil and it was dark and it was not good and yet this was filled with life and light and so I loved it the heroes always saved the day and it overcame every evil obstacle or thing that was in any of the movies or things he produced and so I always appreciated that with Walt and if he was here today that's exactly what would still be happening instead of compromise and darkness invading parts of that there are going to be some covert activities going on in there and no one's going to know anything about it except God himself but things are about to start changing in Disneyland and in Disney World and I don't know if that means something might close for a while or things are being changed or things there's going to be so many things accelerated in these days where darkness is going to be pushed back and that doesn't mean it might close completely but what it'll mean is darkness will be pushed out of places and out of entertainment especially and those who make wicked movies will bomb and they'll lose their shirt if they keep doing it when this whole thing shifts so I do appreciate Walt and all that he created for families if you ever go to either one of those places you can see his own personal comments on the walls in the place and he was so appreciated the people who helped to build the place and the ones who work there now his own comments about how he feels about them he appreciates all of their efforts to help everyone have the time to make it safe and he called them a team he never took direct credit for everything he always gave credit to everyone who was a part of what he did which I also admired in him that he considered everybody involved and he wasn't just the only one that was doing anything and then of course we know there's other people involved in that place now that is not Walt's plans or his ideas some of them that are being put out there now and even in the new things that are being made there's a whole entire different content in it that most believers or even good moral people would not appreciate but just wait and see that will also change I'm glad you see your Donald Duck it's such a special place they opened the doors the year I was born 1955 I met my wife across the street from Disneyland at the convention center on our honeymoon it's just a real special place and yeah there'll be some bad apples that'll get gone and it's interesting to hear what you just said but some people think well then this must be an evil place don't think that Walt Disney's DNA is still in that thing I remember hearing a story that that he and his brother Roy eventually ran the place after he passed but Roy didn't want to spend the money he didn't want to put gold on the top of the castle there's a point or something and so Walt waited until he was got a vacation or something and he went up there and had the people put gold up there I mean I assume it was gold paint but anyway he spent the money he wanted top notch anyway so fun listen I know we have to stop at the top of the hour because of things that people have to do but anything else you want to share before we get into questions I was thinking of something just a minute ago I did want to say one more thing about Disney World I think when you're prayed up when you go there you may have opportunities to minister to people I'm not saying everybody there is bad or wicked some stuff going on or being controlled by certain people who are not very good people and I'm not going to name names or anything I'm just saying keep it in your prayers I know Walt is declaring from heaven over it absolutely and that is something God gave him to create and he was very pleased with it he's not so pleased now but it's going to change I just want to encourage people to make sure and no matter where you go this is just for parents of young children make sure you always keep your kids with you make sure you see them and know who they're with please don't just drop them off at some friends house that you don't even know the friends or the family I would do that anyway I always was like that anyway I was always very careful with my children who babysat them but if we went to a big place we made sure we made rules to go in there to make sure we all knew where everybody was if a child was always with an adult that went with us and these days right now with all the stuff going on that would be a good tip for everybody really really really good alright well I have questions for you a whole list of questions here so let me just start with the first one Nathaniel asks and I hadn't heard of this before but here he goes he says I've heard that there are angels that stand at the four corners of our home is this true or are the angels all over our home in and out so that's his question I think it depends on where you put them where you post them you are allowed to say to the angels who are sent to protect you all the time you and your family they're sentries and they're posted here by your home and they pretty much stay around your home you have others that leave and go with you when you go places and I just tell them I'm going to post a sentry at each corner of my home I'm going to post so many over the home and even down the road and they actually go there and that's what they do they watch for anything of darkness coming they pull down strongholds they shred platforms trying to control us spirits of wickedness or whatever of darkness that want to control us or take things from us so they do both they will even march around on your property and watch it all the time or you can post them as sentries in certain places and if you have a second place you can also post sentries there and that is their number one job which will protect that area that they're assigned to that's really good you know I live on acreage that's not all my acreage there's actually a few hundred acres it belongs to the neighbors but in order to keep the dare out I'm involved inside the fence so they put a fence around it I didn't realize this about sentries this is the first time I've heard you say that that I can recall but I felt I was supposed to post sentries and I used that word at every post on the fence around all the property my neighbors as well I said if anyone gets anywhere near us to try to do harm I want them to see these sentries as and I said let them think they're police officers let them whatever if they try to do harm so I don't know what you think about that well you can actually also tell them to expose anyone who's coming, why they're coming and they actually can stop them from coming they'll actually stop them they'll actually interfere with someone trying to come in on the property and that might be appearing them that might be them saying something and even if they can't see them they would hear that so that's what sentries do is keep things away from you and to make sure that your life and your property is safe so you did the right thing by posting sentries that's really good I got really serious one day because there had been evidence of an invasion and I thought I'm not having this I went to town I took off after that alright Star is asking this question she says some of us write letters to God just simply write things down to Him, to God does the Father receive those letters and if He does how does He receive them there's several different ways that can happen I would encourage you if you wrote one read it out loud to Him you can do that when you're just by yourself in your prayer time or just in the time when you're walking or just doing something you can actually read it to Him say Father I have written this letter to you and read it to Him and it's going to hear you read that letter and they probably record it it's probably recorded in heaven they do a lot of recording there's angels that's what they do and they're sent for that they actually record things there's couriers, there's scribes who write things down or else they write things down and you say or they bring messages from heaven that are written I've had both of those happen to me before but absolutely I'm just standing in a spot and just say to your family member I love you, I just want you to know I haven't forgotten you I'm excited about one day being there with you then He'll make sure they hear that people think everything's so far away but especially the Father, the Son of the Holy Spirit if you wanted to really say something to them He loves, by the way writing that thing down is an MO it's a motive operations of the Father He does have we know He has the lamest book of life we know that He has a book of remembrance He actually has many and they're real books they're huge books and He does actually write in them, He likes to write things out Christ would rather say it but the Father writes things down you know He wrote a book about your life before you were even born so I would say you writing things down maybe a good thing would be to get a journal and if you think of something each day to say something to Him then you write down the date and what you wanted to say to Him and make sure He hears that and the other thing you can do with that journal is when He begins to answer you it may be that still small voice inside but you know it's Him answering because He's answering what you just said to Him so that way you can have a two-way conversation and you can record it in a journal and then you can enjoy looking at it later on or maybe leave that for your children one day and they might be surprised if that's said to you or what you said to Him so authorship is a really big thing in heaven everyone has written a book that represents God or heaven or just something really fun but decent they're already on library shelves and your books are already in heaven do you mean everyone's written a book whether they've written it here or not what do you mean by that you said everyone some people still write books in heaven do you but are you saying people that don't write here are actually in effect authoring a book there I'm not quite sure what you're saying what I'm saying is those who have authored a book here those books I saw my own books in a library in heaven so I do know and I was told those who become authors is so important because even when you're gone that book remains here and those words will still be read by people and it may be something spiritual or it could be something just a help book or just something funny that's really decent and people love to read and there's still people who read books at all so you can go get them out of the library or you can just request to have one yourself there in heaven and you have a place for a library in your own mansion so people still still love to read well I thought it was cool when Bill Johnson had my book in his library if my book is in heaven that's way cooler yeah that's very very cool okay let me come back for a moment to this just popped into my head I think I'm supposed to share it like so it's almost 15 years ago I didn't know you yet I hadn't heard about either sentries or hosts but I was a praying man and my oldest daughter got in trouble she gave her phone number to a guy in the market and I was furious not at her but that this would happen that he would have it and he started calling and I ripped into the spirit realm and I prayed every prayer every kind of emotion about I wanted God to take it take notice and take action and protect her does God pay attention to the the amount to me there was faith behind that emotion because I knew God would act does God pay attention to our how do I say this angry faith if I can put it that way angry against the devil is what I mean I would say that's called passionate you're fierce against what the enemy is doing of course the fathers can hear you I'm absolutely sure many times he's going to answer that prayer and it may not be the way you think it will happen but it will happen and I've also seen that but you know passionate people God those people who have a passion and you're expressing what you're feeling and what you're thinking especially if it's something that lines up with what God wants and he speaks in this word about protecting and guarding your words and keeping certain people away from you because he doesn't want your family life infiltrated by the enemy or a thing that the enemy could use against you so absolutely especially the words of a parent for the child he's absolutely going to pay attention to that that's kind of like you hear about mama bear I became papa bear I can't remember any time in all of my life I prayed that intensely for my daughter but I felt there was an urgency so I let it rip alright Margaret asked is God the father and or heaven going through time with us on the earth even though the father can move back and forth in and out of time is there a sense of past present and future to Jesus Holy Spirit and the people in heaven so I think I understand where they're coming from do they get a sense of time because we're in time I'm quite sure heaven is very much aware of what's going on in any time actually the father's omnipresent he knows exactly what's going on where's going on and everything so he he has to be aware of what's going on so he can send help or send words or scribes or couriers for whatever purpose so yes he is very much aware even though he's not held by time or bound by time and doesn't operate like the way we operate here in time we have hours we're awake and hours we're sleep they don't sleep in heaven they don't have to but he's still very much aware of what's going on and all over the earth at different times on the earth so yes he's like he's present all the time no matter where we are what's going on and of course he can still go into the past and see things he can go into the future and see things the Bible says he's been from the beginning there would be time from the beginning to the end there is a beginning of time that was right when he first made the earth the end of time is when he wraps it all up and then he makes the new earth and then we're just in eternity we'll be in eternity but during this time I said time during this seasons of our life where time is very much involved with us with heaven then they are seeing things all the time as it's going by but he also knows the end of things at the same time so it's like if we're agonizing in prayer for something to happen that we want or think we need or we do need and there is a sense where God will say it's not time yet for that he'll know that it's three months in the future so he does operate within that framework he knows that this is for three months from now that kind of thing he already knows that he already knows when things are going to happen and even what's going to happen even though people have wills of their own he's already actually been through all of time he's seen all of time already but right now as we're speaking he is watching and he's listening so he can be anywhere at the same time that's one of the great things about him so he's very much involved in our lives at the same time and even does know what that end looks like and I've already told people that he actually did show me when the end of time would be and it's not really a date it's an event and I've learned that about him most of the things he plans and things for on the earth he goes by those events that he has planned and those are things that will happen in the earth that he has planned are going to happen but he did tell me one time he said there will be a day that will come when time will be no more because I won't need time and you won't need time on the earth on the new earth we won't have a clock we won't have things like that going on we will be living forever and we will also plan things by events at that time on the new earth but when everything ends is when time will be no more because he doesn't need time on this earth the reason he needs time now is because he's sending those little spirits from him, that's where everybody came from you lived in him but this is what he said time will be no more when I have sent the last one from myself I won't need time that's good I have a question about time now that we're on the subject Manuel Johnson talks about he's been transported in the future and the past so have you well God took him in the past he transported him in the past he showed him what happened he was there and it brought healing to his soul because God showed him this and that I don't know the whole story because I'm probably not doing it justice but great healing came to him by God taking him back in time does God do that sometimes does he see a need to bring someone back in time I think that he probably does because I know several other people who have encounters like that and I have been taken back in time quite a few times it was all related to things that happened in the Word of God or the way he made heaven the way he made the earth it was always related to revelation when he takes me back in time like he showed me his son on the cross and what happened when he had his spirit leave he took me back and I saw paradise or Abraham's bosom while he was there with the thief I saw him also when he was in hell approached the gates of hell and they were taking him and I saw what happened on the third day I was taken back back in the book of Acts when the Holy Spirit came and invaded in the upper room I mean there's many times he's taken me back I was taken back to the tomb the very day that he came out of that tomb I was taken that day back in time and I actually felt myself traveling it was the one time I felt myself traveling through time and I told people it was like on Star Trek or Star Wars when you go warp speed and those like shoot past you it is exactly like that I know they probably got that idea from the idea zone in heaven about how it looks like when you travel but it actually did and I actually could feel myself moving whenever we got to the part of time God wanted me to see we stopped and my feet just touched the ground crazy and it's like a portal open and I was there I was literally there in that time and I saw Mary go into the tomb looking for him and she saw the person in the garden and she came out and she thought he was the gardener because Christ was actually standing in the flowerbed smelling the flowers when these things happen both that and all the other back in time to be very very clear you went in that time this wasn't a vision a 3D experience you actually were there during the time it actually I was actually there I was wide awake I don't sleep long enough to dream I almost never dream and I have sometimes visions but this is called an encounter an encounter is you are actually there he's not showing me a film my feet touched the ground outside the tomb I saw the stone had been rolled away it was actually quite a ways down thing I also saw Christ standing he has a back turn to where the tomb was and he was literally looking at the flowers because he loves flowers and he had just been through 3 days of you know what and so when he came out of there after thanking his father for all that he had done for him he wanted to be in the midst of the flowers and I actually say Mary surmised or thought he was the gardener and she spoke to him she said her name she knew instantly when she heard him speak that it was him and then he turned around and of course she saw him then and I saw that in person, in that time that's how it happens people and instead of bashing people saying why not ask God to give you an encounter and show you something powerful I've been taking it up many many times for me and I didn't take myself I have to make it clear I didn't take myself that God had purpose for me and he'd already told me we're going to take you back in time, forward in time we're going to give you revelation on the word revelation on the times you're in and show you things to come and if you remember in Revelation 4 he actually said that to John I will show you things to come and so that's one of the things that God does with his prophets and so I was literally there in person remember the feeling of the ground the smell of the flowers everything about that place amazing Bobby Connor tells a story about going to the crucifixion not a vision not a 3D idea he was actually there and he said the smells the sights, the sounds you know have you been to the crucifixion as well? I saw a part of the crucifixion it was more what I heard him saying and they were of course very upset that he had died but we know that he actually the thing about Christ was he was such a powerful being he had to lose his soul from his body he actually had to tell it to leave he knew he had to die and so they probably were wondering why in the world hasn't that guy died they even put the sword inside and everything but he finally knew that it was time so he just lost his soul from his body and his spirit man left his body and then of course he was there his body remained on the cross until they took it down they were wrapping it the women were crying John was but John remembered also the words Christ said that he would rise again and so it was a very powerful thing people in the city people I could hear crying in the whole area there that he had died because they loved him so much he had helped so many people and did so many miracles they said you couldn't even put him in a book there were so many people count the miracles it says if the books were written of all the things he did the books would go around the world like the planet people so he was non-stop all the time doing his work that God gave him to do and so it was an emotional time but of course I already knew that he was going to raise from the dead but I had visited that place and then of course I was taken back when he came out of the tomb and then I was taken back when he was down in hell and then I was taken back I was taken back in time when he actually was sent into heaven and one of the angels had this urn with his blood because he had to pour that out on the mercy seat in heaven and so he showed me these things and he showed me the reality of the word of God it was so powerful but yes I have encounters he clearly comes and takes me just takes me like in a second and it doesn't matter where I am really and I gave him permission so it might be better if you say I give you permission to take me whenever you want to or speak to me whenever you want to that encourages him to do it actually and I don't even say that to him when he told me this is what we're going to have you do commission on the earth as a revelator this is what you're going to do and I said I'd give you permission whenever you want to and I guess while we're talking about time okay now you got me I have heard you and others talk about okay he said to the thief that was saved that became saved he said I'm telling you this day today you will be with me in paradise he didn't say in hell he said in paradise I have not heard anyone say during those three days what did he do in paradise no one's ever really related that to me at least well the first thing he did was preach the gospel to all of them it said he it said that he took captivity captive the captivity that was it was called Abraham's wisdom and paradise it is the same place where the dead we died if you were faithful and knew God and believed in God himself this is before the Messiah came God counted that your faith as being you know you were just and you were faithful so he didn't send them to hell they couldn't ascend to heaven though because Christ hadn't gone back to heaven pour out the blood except of course we know Elijah and Enoch literally were taken to heaven in their bodies and they're still there in the physical bodies I believe that they were glorified when he took them up to heaven already because they didn't have to die and that was the Father's choice to do that but but it is quite a thing for God to trust you to do things and share things for him but yes but that's his choice to take me I don't take myself but he actually entered into paradise because he had to keep his word to the thief thank you Holy Spirit said the XT he had to keep his word and he didn't say I'll see you tomorrow he said this day that day that day and so when he died they actually I think he died before the thieves didn't they have to come break their legs so they would die I think so because they had to break the legs and all that with the thieves so Christ descended into paradise paradise was not a place with rocks and you think well it's in the earth there's a bunch of rocks sitting around it was a city it was a beautiful city God made faithful and that's where his friends he called Abraham you know that was his friend many others of back in the Old Testament were friends of God because they chose to be friends of God and he didn't send them to hell they still had to they had to descend though when you believe in Christ now and you die you don't descend at all you ascend into heaven that's where he does the big difference because Christ has been there he made the way back he cleansed it he put the blood on the altar showing that he had died for everyone's sins and so that changed everything about for those who died that believed in Christ it changed some things happen that change everything and so yes he did go down there he was talking to Abraham he was talking to Joseph who raised him he was talking to all those people the faith of David all of those were in paradise and at one point they all exited and left paradise is empty now there's nothing there it's still there people actually asked me would Satan take it over he doesn't have the ability to take paradise over that's like a holy place that God made for those who loved him and believed in him and no hell can't take paradise and use it people he's never going to get paradise so he would have taken Joseph the one who was sold in Egypt he would have taken David Solomon and he would have preached the gospel and said this is what it means to be saved this is what I had to do that kind of thing he would have told the whole story he literally changed the gospel as if you tell people that Jesus Christ gave his life that he gave his life so that we might have a way to go back to heaven where we all came from there had to be a prize paid there had to be a sacrifice made and he actually told all of them they had like a gathering and he just preached the gospel to everybody there and everyone there received him as their Messiah they had to receive him as their Messiah because that's what makes it possible for you to go you know to go into heaven and so he did he preached the gospel he said he preached the gospel and so then he took captivity he captivated them with his love and his sacrifice for all for all those who choose him and so they then eventually they did exit Abraham's bosom or paradise and they are all now in heaven they don't use that anymore it's not used but it is still there it had golden buildings it actually had a river now these are spiritual places because you're there in your spiritual body I will explain to people the difference of being in the flesh and being in the spirit you have a spiritual body and it looks like you but it looks a lot better you look young you're full of energy and life and so when you died you entered into this spiritual round place that was paradise or if you were wicked there's a great gulf that separates those places I think the people in paradise can see the gates of hell and they know hell if they come up to the gates can see like it's like I can't think of what you call it a balcony they see like this big balcony that they can see in a far distance because remember the dream that the wicked man had and he wanted the beggar to bring a drop of water and put it on his tongue burning in hell that dream was real that was real and that's a good way to explain you read that dream and see what happened there was a hell he was burning in hell and he was telling God please send someone to earth to tell them about this place it's horrible I don't want my family to come here and of course God's answer to him was it wouldn't matter who came they're wicked in their heart and they don't want it and he said so that but he would not send Lazarus who was a beggar who was a beggar on the earth and he was they could see that he's eating he knew they were eating there's like a king's table a feast set there you still eat in your spiritual body people in heaven and these people in paradise were eating they had buildings that they stayed in they had a beautiful river they even had a sky because it was a spiritual place oh wow okay of the year he wouldn't take his friends who actually believed in him and lived right he wouldn't send them to place it was a dark money place here you are in the middle of the earth sitting next to the lava that wasn't going to happen God made this place beautiful and it and it was beautiful let me ask this one last question because I know we have to stop at the top of the hour there was a great earthquake when Jesus was crucified and graves were open what have you seen if anything as far as that have you seen that event graves open the earthquake I know it didn't happen I know that the earthquake was shook and graves open and people saw I'm trying to remember I don't know if they gave a number or something but it was quite a few it was quite a few hundred I believe they were actually noted it was noted and written somewhere I don't know maybe Josephus or somebody wrote that down but it does mention in the Bible that they had an earthquake and the graves were opened and they saw people walk it was just another testimony that that was the son of God I mean a lot of people began to believe that was the son of God cross that was the son of God because he knows that couldn't have happened any other way so that really did happen people came up out of the graves and they walked around it was fascinating it was fascinating but you know it's interesting because you know it shows integrity on your part because you're not making it up if God didn't show you you're not saying God showed me you're saying I didn't see people walking out of the grave people walking out of the graves when there was an earthquake so that to me that adds credibility to you because you could make something out of it I wasn't taking and showing those people walking but I do know that did happen I do know that did happen they still talk about it in heaven sometimes wow I'd love to see a video of that and I guess in heaven we get to see replays that we want right if we want to see what that looks like absolutely can see replays awesome I like those are the kind of re-runs I want to see that if you will pray for the people before we go and just bless them if you will Father I thank you for this beautiful day I thank you for your holy son our king of kings I thank you for Holy Spirit who can be our best friend but is still God he was sent to come alongside us and then when we choose to invite him to indwell us he actually moves on the inside of us and then he'll never stop talking to us but I thank you for that that you are very much involved in our lives and you do care for everyone and I pray Father that people have to understand they need to understand that when they have someone who belongs to Jesus Christ and they receive Jesus Christ when they move to heaven it is a good thing it is a good thing for them that's why they celebrate in heaven they don't weep and cry when someone comes home they celebrate because God loves it when one of his children come home one of his sons or his daughters they come home to heaven they actually have a huge celebration rewards are given from the throne at that time and then all their family and friends go to see this person's mansion and then they get undone by how beautiful and amazing or adventurous even these mansions are so powerful thank you Father for thinking of us in the past now in this time and in the future you know where we are you know that we love you I thank you in these days set a table and the presence of everyone's enemies that would be the left that would be the liberals all those evil people colluding and flaming together to take over this world which makes me laugh ha ha ha because this earth was made by you and your son and it says the earth and the focus now belongs to Jesus Christ the earth is your footstool because you're ever watching us thank you for intervening in lives people have lost things like their property or their money is running low I thank you right now you take out of your own stock and you give to those people Father because they're trusting you they're believing you and they're staying excited I thank you for showing yourself strong on their path in these days right now in Jesus name so be it and everyone said amen and amen I just want to encourage people to go to revealingheaven.com cats two books are there and other products go to catcur.com that's the only place

You Welcome to Elijah streams. It happens to be Tuesday, August 16, but we're recording this for a week from Wednesday So whatever that date is someone can put that on the screen for me. I forgot to look that up, but August this is for August 24 Even though we're recording it on August 16. So we're on with cat. It's going to be good. So if anything she says happens to be Historically incorrect because more things have happened. You'll understand why so it's going to be a great show There's no I have no other announcement. So let's If you all are ready, I'm ready. So let's watch Wednesdays with cat and Steve. Here we go Well, hello, I don't know which to say happy Wednesday. I can't say that because it's not How are you doing cat you just I'm doing great. That's always gonna be my answer You got your you were just telling me got a brand new scarf and shirt. Is that we were saying I have everything new. Okay, the jacket which is really cool You can't see. There you go. You can see powers really beautifully engraved. I just got that yesterday in the shirt which I would have worn on the platform And my scarf and yeah I was going to the salon today and the Holy Spirit said you were in that brand new black shirt looks really nice and you wear the new jacket and I'm thinking I think it could get wet. You never know when you're going to go to salon was going to happen. He said no, go ahead and wear it. Not telling me why and I'm sitting in there in the chair at the salon and she's almost done with me When I get it when I get a call and say did you remember that you had to record something with Steve Schultz? No, I didn't but now I know why he told me to wear this. I walked in the door literally walked in the door and just sat in the chair so Holy Spirit needs to be your best friend. Let me tell you he'll let you know all kinds of things you wouldn't expect that he would And so here I am today and that's very cool. You know lately Darin and I have been practicing that every not I was I was about to say every once in a while very often now all of a sudden I'll remember something We went to bed and it gets cold in a certain part of our house even though it's summer and she went to bed and she and she said I think I might have left the heater on that little portable heater so she went out there and she said the Holy Spirit keeps telling me stuff but it's not like a voice necessarily she just all of a sudden she thinks about inside that's what yeah exactly so I keep saying thank you thank you Holy Spirit thank you, you know, I think him today. That's awesome. So, so it's I would encourage people when you suddenly remember something and it was important, say thank you Holy Spirit right. Yes, absolutely say thank you. You're so so good and he likes gratitude I found that out so. Yes, he does that that that will intensify the actual friendship one if you're thanking him all the time. Oh yeah, I do thank him all the time I think him the father of something I think I think I think them I think the Trinity. Sometimes it's the father of the Lord, most of the time the Holy Spirit is when he talks to me about every day stuff, or even reminds me of things and like I can't lose anything no matter what I can't find. He either shows me where it's at literally a picture of where it's at, or it just comes back. It just comes back. What do you mean it comes back what do you mean. If I found if I've misplaced something really important and I really need it. And I've looked a little bit for it. Well there's something I always say you all need to just learn this. If I can't find something I always say these words, and they always work. It's not the word is what you're saying. And I say Holy Spirit you know where everything is it was ever made that is made right now and never will be made. Please show me where and I say what it is where it is now. And in that moment he literally shows me like a vision of where it's sitting laying or even underneath something. He does it immediately and I say thank you so much for showing me where that is. Because I give him an opportunity to do something for me by saying that. So that's asking you have not because you asked not so I'm literally asking him. But first I'm telling them who I tell him who he is. And what he does know he knows everything that was ever made. No matter where it is in time he knows he knows what's made right now and he knows what's going to be made in the whole. The best person to ask first before you run around an hour looking say that first and just say I ask you to show to me right now. And he'll either show me or someone will yell I found whatever. Oh wow. But it's like it's something that's very quickly done immediately when I when I honor him for who he is and then I ask. I think that's that's one of the meanings where it says in the scriptures before you call I will answer. It's like he knows you're about to call he knows your words are forming and he already starts forming this picture. Lord show me that years ago and I and so when I ask him something I don't try to wait for a long time I try to listen to what the very first thought because before I call him he's going to answer so that's very very cool so awesome. Well you've got some thought maybe a few thoughts on your heart for when people will watch this so share that before we get into questions if you want to. I do actually. My husband was driving me to the salon and you know the traffic's backed up like crazy everywhere around here. They're building a few new things so the streets are backed up. And also if it's the time like when school lets out there's always going to be traffic somewhere in this city. And so we had a lot of time in line we were sitting in line in the traffic but I never complain when that happened. And so the father starts speaking to me immediately and then he took me from. I wasn't in the truck. I was taken to this place and shown something he wants me to share so I'm going to share it with everybody first time ever like just happened to me maybe an hour ago or so. He took me he caught me up and put me on this long winding road I didn't even know where I was at and in front of me was where I had been he said I want you to see where you've come from he said I'm going to show you a journey. And so I saw this long road in front of me and then all the way up where these red streaks he said that's the blood of Christ that never leaves you all the way up to my feet they came and then he said now you may turn and see where you're headed. And when I turned I saw still some more road because this is my journey remember I saw more road in front of me but it got more and more transparent and then I could see shortly in the distance the city of God which would be the throne room or all the beauty and splendor is in heaven I saw that and he said everyone who belongs to me needs to know that this is your destination he was saying not just mine everyone is a believer that is your destination this is what he said to me. Everyone should love one another now because I actually say the world will know you by your love for each other stop fighting. Stop arguing stop picking on each other stop saying things aren't even true about each other. He said you spend your time loving. So when you reach that destination, there will be an even greater celebration that you chose to love on another and be a testimony to who I am. And I was so undone because the splendor that looked just like the city of God that's what I call heaven city in heaven. It was like the city of God I saw all the time I could see streets of gold I could see the glorious buildings that were in the air they're not even on the ground I clearly knew where that was but that's what he was saying. Anyone who's a believer that's our destination we're all going to the same place. Okay this is what else he said your body may die but that's not you. That's part of your covering. He said your spirit man and your soul never dies so all those if you recently had someone passed to heaven I've had three really good friends recently like even in the last week somebody met passed on to heaven. And you know she was like in her fifties and yet she was not just ready her mansion was done and she went and I was celebrating I always celebrate when somebody goes to heaven so I have that I understand that is our home we will go there until he makes the way we were but this is our destination we're on a journey together that's what he's trying to say to me he was very adamant this is a journey you're doing together where you've been and then where you're going your destiny where you're going your destination is all the same destination. But what you do now matters it doesn't matter and having a matters how we treat each other matters if you if you know accomplish the mission he has given you but honestly part of our mission is to care about each other the Bible says to. You know to consider those are the household of faith or God first that means we should consider our fellow Christian members first we need to help them we need to honor them bless them and that is our goal that and let the world know us by our love how big of a deal that because right now I don't think they think the body of Christ or Christians are known because of our love for each other but it's going to happen and I will say this Jesus won't come back several years many years away actually before that happens but he's not coming back until we are loving one another because the Bible says the world will know us by our love for each other is one of the signs that that you know that we're getting close to him coming so we have some work left to do so people just forgive people just let it go loose out of your soul somebody wrong you and just love them anyway and the other thing you're doing is you're piercing Satan he does not want you to forgive people and love one he doesn't want us to love one another if we keep fighting whenever they even know who we are how can you operate in the power of God and speak for him on his behalf if you're trashing people who are the household of faith so this is a good time for you to just say I'm sorry father from this day forward I'm going to I'm going to do the very best I can and ask for more grace and get filled with your love and let this world see me love other believers and so that was the encounter I just have literally speaking to me I was gone in the second I was right back in the seat of the truck well of course I told my husband what just happened and he goes oh that's awesome he's not a man of many words but he was thought he thought it was a great thing and I said I'm supposed to share that I'm supposed to share that the next time not remembering even at that moment that it would be just a couple hours from them when I would do that so that is a word from the father if we are supposed to love one another care about each other help one another don't pick people's you know even if you don't have maybe you don't have a vision for what you're doing right now you don't pick other people's visions apart that's okay somebody happy and can I ask you a question so almost everyone has people that are I guess we would say they're in the body of Christ but they are so different than what we are there even some of them are off base but we know they accepted Christ but and then some are detractors and some are almost enemies and yet and yet they serve the Lord and what happens when we decide to just in our heart I guess it happens in our heart first just decide you know what I'm going to love them whether they ever know this or not I'm going to choose to love them what does something happen in the spirit when we do that. Yes, but I have to have to make clear what what what you're saying I understand what you're saying you make a decision with your soul, because your natural emotions aren't going to do it. You can even say, I make a choice with my will, no matter how you're feeling about it, you can actually do that that's actually something that is possible. You don't have to feel it for you don't have to feel it then you don't have to feel you don't have to feel you do not have to feel it. You're making what you declare and decree shall be established unto you and it is going to happen. I've had to do that several times actually, depending on what people had said have done done done to me or said to me. I say I choose as an act of my will to forgive them and my emotions certainly in that moment of time probably don't want that but you overrode your emotions. That's not like you're not being you that's using a part of you maybe you didn't use very often. Your will is the most powerful part of you. It's what it's what you display. I mean, know your will is what you choose to do your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you actually choose. And my husband has always said what you choose to do you will do. That's his famous quote. And he's very right about that so why not choose with your will the way the father decided to make it and say I choose as an act of my will not my emotions to forgive and say their name. And guess what the father he will write that down and he will immediately start working on the heart of the other person because you have forgiven them. That actually gives the father and Holy Spirit freedom to pursue that person for them to change no matter they're probably you're probably not the only one they're doing things to. If people are in fear or if they're in pain or if they're angry it makes them lash out I'm not giving an excuse for them I'm just telling you that's how it operates in your soul. As a man think it then his soul. So are you that's the heart of your being your soul. I had I had a situation. I don't know if I ever brought this up but there was a guy who went home to be with the Lord years and years ago. Okay so this is nothing current years and years ago but before he did that he tried really hard to destroy this ministry that I mean so it was a long time ago but it was this ministry. And I think or I feel like or I think I, I tried to forgive him okay I don't know which words to put, and I went to, you know, I had been really really sick many people know I was bed ridden my pastor. At that time thought maybe I was, I was depressed while I wasn't, but he said I want you to go to counseling so in deference to him I went to counseling for a few times. And I told this counselor a woman counselor and I told her about this guy that tried to destroy us because she was digging deep for anything that might be bothering me. And I said this happened this happened this happened and the guy's book was on her shelf so I knew she knew who he was. And so she said I want you to go up these stairs see yourself going up these stairs and open the door and it's the Lord, and you and him are going up there together, you're walking side by side up these areas. And I want you to tell the Lord what you think about him. You can imagine that was kind of, and all of a sudden now these emotions are coming up and all of a sudden I'm balling. And I said, it was like the Lord said what do you think about and he named the name and all of a sudden tears are just flowing. And I said he did the best he knew how to do he served you with, and that was sort of a combination cat of soul and emotion all mixed in there because I choose. I chose to do that talk about forgiving someone after they're gone, after it's too late to say it to them. You can. Well, number one, I do want to say the person who passed on. Yeah, they're immediately sorry for everything ever said or did you it just is a part of what happens. So when you die and step out of this body and your spirit man steps out, you know immediately what you did that, even if we're seeing, let's say I'm not saying murder or stuff like that. Maybe you were rude, maybe you were harsh to people, maybe you did something wrong against them. You know, immediately at that moment you're flooded with the life of God and you go, wow, I should have said I was sorry, you know, I should have said I was sorry for them what I did was wrong. I should have told them one day they feel still in need to tell you that. So they're basically at that moment saying they were sorry or repenting for doing it, even though you never heard it. Yeah, there is absolute forgiveness or actually a recompense for when at the moment someone dies and he's in heaven right now can't wait to see you and hug you when you get to heaven and say man, I should have been better to you. And you're probably saying these words, it doesn't matter anymore. But it would feel I can imagine it feeling good, really, really good to hear it. And also at the same time saying it doesn't matter anymore, you know, all at the same time all mixed in the same time you're really you're kind of happy. Yeah, they did it. They did understand. No, you can't you can't try to hide from truth when you're in the presence when you're in the presence there's no there's no hiding from what is true, you know what is true. And especially leaders in the body of Christ have a double accountability might as well bring this in your double accountability is leaders in the body of Christ and I'm sure the Lord may have something to say to you when you get in heaven he won't keep you from heaven. But I'm sure he may have something to say to you because the word does say that you'll be held calm for every wasteful word. It actually says that in the Bible. Can you clarify that you said that the other day in heaven, huh? You said that last time we were on the program about someone else you said he'll have something to say. Yeah. Can you postulate or even relate what type of thing he might say to someone like that? What do you mean he'll have something to say? I think that is done at a special appearance. I'm not saying that is necessarily done when you first arrive in heaven. Okay. Unless it was a special case, as was the case I saw the other day. Most of the time you'll be in heaven and you're rejoicing you're celebrating you're so happy the presence so powerful, but the more the presence begins to just invade your soul. You kind of know I probably should have handled this better. You don't feel guilty. There's no guilt. There is no guilt in heaven. Even when you come before the judgment seat of Christ and he will say things to you like, you know, I did ask you to do this. Like he asked, let's say he asked you to be a preacher. You decided to be a rodeo. Whatever. I'm just making a crazy. Yeah. And he did great at being in the rodeo, but you didn't ever pick up the call that he's dad. He will mention that to you. You'll have a conversation that doesn't mean he's going to kick you out or anything. But because in the Bible it says you'll be held accountable. So don't use waste wasteful words would be like bashing people being unkind to people saying rude remarks. And you're you're a believer, but you're still doing this stuff up into the day you go. You will realize, yeah, man, I should have not done that because truth begins to invade you. And when you kind of hear from that truth or you ignore that truth, that doesn't mean you won't go to heaven. That just means you are going to have a time to be talked to. Well, you know, I'll just end with this because I know you have the first question about something else or anything else to say. But I've talked about my father many times and he was in fact, he's with the Lord. He was in fact a major serial child abuser. He was OK. Then he got his heart right. And I know he's with the Lord. You said he's felt really good when I talked about he's with the Lord. You said that makes him happy when he hears that. So that was a major, major, major, major sin or set of sins or years of sin. So talk about the talking to that he might receive one day. I mean, how does that work? What would he say to my dad? Because he already knew he was wrong. I'm not even talking about actual sin. I'm not even talking about sin. Oh, that was sin. No, that was sin. His repentance of all that wiped it away. Oh, OK. So he's not talking about that. And he's not up there thinking about that anymore. He's thinking about how much he loves you and he's excited for you. And he knows that you're doing great things for God. Now, what I'm talking about are people who are like, even though they're believers, it's not really a sin to be rude. It's not nice. But those are wasteful words you're speaking. They are not necessary and you shouldn't be speaking on those things. He will talk to you. He will. He will talk to you about that, those kind of things. Sin is forgotten into the sea. No, there's no more remembrance of that. Like, no matter who's out there, if you sin and you're repented, don't bring that up to the Father again. If you're repented, he won't remember it. He won't remember it. But after you've been born again and repented, maybe you sin later, repent again, please. The God is not into freely sin at all. He is not in agreement with you to freely sin when you're a believer. That's not any kind of testimony or witness for him. And you just don't want to do it because people can see you acting like that and they'll think, why should I get saved? You act just like me. If you're sinning, if you have a lifestyle of sin, that's not a good thing at all. But what I'm talking about is just people's attitudes and the way they treat people. Those things, he will probably say something to them about because it does say, you will be held accountable for every wasteful word, words that shouldn't have been spoken, that were not necessary, that maybe hurt people or, you know, interfere with things in their life. Those kind of things. Because he said that in the word, he will talk to you about those things. But you're sin. I always thought, I guess I'm wrong on my thinking. I always thought those wasteful words and things you're speaking against people were, in fact, sins. Really? Wasteful is not sinful. There's a clear definition here. No, sins, the sins, the sins that you did in the earth, you have to repent, even if it's at the moment you die and Christ comes to you and says something. At that moment, you would have to say, I do truly repent because of the keys of hell, death and the grave. But the wasteful words have nothing to do with you getting into heaven or not. It's the attitude you have. It's maybe the witness that you're being. It won't keep you from being in heaven, but you could have probably had a lot more or done more for him because if you had treated somebody different. He's clearly saying that even when you're born again, watch how you treat people, how you handle people. He doesn't want people getting crushed or falsely or wrongfully accused. He wants that to not happen from a believer because you're actually messing with the testimony of what a believer is. Let's say sinners know you and they see you acting or mistreating people. They're like, why should I bother? You're almost interfering in more than just that. So those wasteful words that you shredded people with your mouth, that's not a sin. That's just a wasteful words that should not have been done. It's a waste of time to speak them. In other words, those he will hold you accountable. That doesn't mean you're going to be kicked out of heaven and he will let you know what that means when you get there. So no, he's not talking about sins. That doesn't mean sin. That's amazing. Well, what else do you have before we get into questions? Any other thing about current events or anything like that? I'm just excited about all the fraud exposure that's coming forth, which I'm sure everybody else is also. The legitimate many has meant other people coming forward to testify against the left who were a part of that. And I'm telling people to be the biggest, probably the biggest exposure ever in the history of the earth. Because of the exposure will be so deep and so wide and so complete. That everyone is doing anything to try to take over the world to stop our lives, steal what we have, or just stop the word of God from going forth. Anything that has an evil agenda on the left or the liberals, whatever they're doing, they are all going to be exposed and justice is going to be brought against them. And that's why I keep telling them that are doing that you better go. You better go be a witness and testify against what they're doing, because the day is going to come when the window will close and they won't need people's witness. They'll have so many witnesses that have been proven to be right that will legally cause legal action to take forth, come forth, whether it's from heaven or from the earth, but they're going to be exposed. And so that's just happened again. There are eyewitnesses that have come forth from all places. I may as well tell you because it's all over the place. It's FBI agents. I'm not saying to them to went into Mar-Lago or I can't even say the name. Trump's home to steal things or mess up things, which was what their agenda was. I don't know about them. I'm talking about ones who were a part of that and are no longer a part of that. They have got some of them who've come forward and are testifying, literally testifying, which God said on November the 4th, 2020, it would happen. So those things are beginning to happen and more and more people, you're not going to hear about it until it all breaks loose. And they have to say those famous words that the 2020 election was stolen. And it will be said on regular news and they won't want to say it because of the testimony and the witness and the evidence. They are going to have to say that people. And I can tell you those things are starting to come in. They're compiling up against the left and the liberals. I'm not doing it. It's happening because God said it would happen. And we just, they just had some more come forward and do that. So I'm always excited when truth is being told because it helps people. The truth makes you free. Are there people cat-like news anchors that we would recognize? Many of them who were told, you will not report. You will not say this because you will not say it was stolen that, that are going to come forward and say, they told me I couldn't talk about it. And commentators who wanted to tell the truth and they'll say they were, they told me I was not allowed to, well, that kind of thing all over the place. Definitely. Well, we're going to have all kinds of from every area from the business arena and the medical arena. I mean, everywhere from the financial arena, the media arena, there are going to be some from every one of those different areas because that's how far reaching the lie is and the deception is. And therefore people will come from each one of those arenas and they will testify because probably most likely they're not working. I mean, I didn't be working at those places right now because they were threatened with death. Most likely that that seems to be like, well, if we can't badger them or force them, then we'll just tell them we'll kill them. And I mean, again, this is truth. What I'm speaking is the truth that has already happened. And if they can't get these people who are in these positions to go along with them, they just take them, they just take them out. They threaten them. Truly they do. And some people won't talk about it because they're afraid for their own life. But there's going to come a time when they realize if they don't come forward and say something, this thing is going to come to an end where the people believe it or is or not. And you can't, no one can stop it from happening. It is coming to an end. And that whole foundation has already started crumbling under those people of the left and the liberals. It's already crumbling and they know it's crumbling. That's why they're being desperate, like, you know, raiding Trump's home and other things and saying, what else can we find or make up or lie about that will keep this thing going because it's failing. And it's failing big. So I just spoke the truth again. There are all these people from all those arenas and some people who are very high up in them, which is the testimony they really need. They need them to come forward and say that there's going to be a big witness protection program somewhere. But I can tell you right now it is going to happen. And so some of that just happened the other day and it's already being spread everywhere and it's true. They have had some come forward to that want to testify on behalf of what is right. So good. So good. I love it. I love it. Okay. Anything else before questions? I don't think anything else right now. I do have a question here that we can kind of start with. Yeah, start with that one. That'd be good. This is I love getting I love getting and let me tell you, I get so much mail. It's wonderfully outrageous. It takes me weeks and sometimes even months to go. If it's sent to me for me personally, I do go through it and look at it. And I do pray for a lot of people at that time. If it's something that's urgent, I will pray for them. But this little child who's nine years old, I'm just going to say her name is Andrea. And I'm not saying anything else about where it came from or what. Since God is making a new heaven and a new earth. And if you didn't know that, guess what he's going to. And the word does say that he is. So she is correct. Do you know what he's going to do with the moon? And I just love these children's questions. You know, they don't they don't hold anything back when they want to know something. They just ask what people think about what they say. Well, I'll tell you, Andrea, you can probably have it in your own yard on the new earth. I am quite sure the father can make you one. And so you will not miss the moon. And you know, he did make the sun and the moon. He made them himself. It says so in the Bible. Now, when he originally in the beginning, Genesis one, one in the beginning, when he made the earth, he lit it with his glory. There was no sun or moon lighting this earth when he made it the first time. And then in verse two, something has happened because he made it the first time and it was finished. It was done. He was done with the first time he made it. In verse two, it says that darkness is on the face of the deep and the water is covering the whole earth. Well, he didn't make it that way. He would have never made it that way. He made it the way it should have been. But then Saint was kicked out of heaven, fell to earth. He began to make the earth a wilderness. It says that in Jeremiah. And so God turned the light out. It also says that. He turned out the light. He took his glory off the earth and he broke the water vapor shield around the earth, which brought mist on it because it never rained in the very beginning. You need to know that too. Even scientists know that. And so it flooded the whole earth and then he made it darkness come upon it because he took the light out. So here's the earth sitting in verse two, right? It says he made it in verse one in the beginning. He made that means made means done, made the heavens and the earth. And then in the second verse, it's a mess. There's, there's, there's water covering the sky. That's the firmament. And it says in the Bible that he took the water off the firmament. He took it off of the land and began to redo the earth. It says that clear in the Bible. So then when he began to redo it in verse two, he starts that and he even says what he does. Okay. He replenishes the plans and brings them back. He puts the sun in the sky to light the day and the moon at night to light the night. It didn't say that in one one. And people go, well, how could this be millions of years people between verse one one, right? And Genesis one, two, there are millions of years. Oh, that's the first time I've heard you put it. No, there really is because it, there was no kind of time on the earth, right? The sun and the moon counted the days and the nights. When he started redoing the earth, replenishing is the correct word. The Holy Spirit just told me, we began to replenish the earth. Well, you can't read something. If you didn't do it before modeling your home unless you built it before. So you need to look at the words that are spoken unless people have written a new Bible and wiped them out and then just forget about it. Find one that isn't. It has not been changed. But so he made the earth in the beginning and it was done. It was finished. Beautiful. And it had a water vapor shield. He put around the whole earth that brought mist onto the trees, the flowers, but the light of God came from everyone who goes to heaven gets to see this. They go to this place and he lets you see him making the heavens and the earth light of God came from the ground and it would hit this water vapor mist. And part of that was part of what the rainbow. But the sky back then in Genesis one, one was a peachy pink. It wasn't blue because the sun wasn't present. They created that needed that to make the sky blue. So in verse two, it all changes when he takes the water off of the firmament. That's the sky. It takes the water off the land and starts to be replenished the earth replenish that the creatures, the plant life. I probably didn't say it in the right order, but he did. Then we know eventually on day 16, he made man. But that's this was a whole different sky. Same earth foundation. Everything sound glow was there, but he was replenishing it so man could live on the earth. Okay, so they could live there. And then he put the sun in the sky and it brought life by the day and then the moon at night. And it even says that so you could see at night. And so now we have the sun and the moon. The sky is beautiful blue normally in the daytime. And then the sky at night is dark and except the light from the stars and the sun. I mean, the moon, you can see it clearly. But my answer to Andrea's, I'm quite sure that he would be happy to make you a moon to be over your mansion or in your mansion. That's how cool God is. I could clearly see him doing that for you, Andrea. Very cool. Hey, on and creation, I've been asked this before. I don't, don't recall if I've asked you people have asked many times on the seven days of creation, were they 24 hour days? Yes. That's what I thought, but I wanted to double check. Because the Bible says it was today in the night. And then it was another day. It actually says that it says evening in morning, right? Evening in morning. 24 hour day. Yeah. Six. Because he's God. That's why he spoke it. The word stepped out and made all of it. They could do it. They could do that as fast as they wanted to do it. That's why if you send an angel on assignment, like, like the, the heavens army, you send an assignment, they're back in five minutes. They've already dealt with what it was that you prayed about. And because, because there is no time. There's no day, no night. There is no time. There's no calendars. So when you send them or you pray for something, they go do it instantly. And then they come back for another appointment. I've seen that happen in heaven because I've been to Michael's headquarters. This is a free, free stuff now. I've been there and Michael's headquarters when they were sent on the mission. And it seemed like, you know, they were back. They went and dealt with it in the spirit realm. And then they came back for the next set of orders. That's amazing. Now you said it's in the scriptures that God turned the lights out. Can you tell which one that is? I'm not familiar. People read the whole book and find it. You're not going to. He won't let me. Okay. People to find them themselves. Steve, church and they listen to their pastor say stuff, but they don't. Most of them don't even go check it out. I admire people that search out the word to find things and see what it says about truth. Well, I do have some. He lets me quote, like he lets me cope. The first John 227 to let you know that you have a weapon in you. You never use most of them. And that's called, you know, the anointing. Yeah. It says in the Bible in first John 227, when you receive Jesus Christ and become a Christian, you get a deposit of the anointing. What is that? The anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness. You get a deposit of it and it says, it lives in you. I carry the anointing. I release the anointing. The anointing grows so much that it's like a big cloud outside of me. And if I walk into a place that begins to affect people, that's what Peter did. That's what Paul did. They said Peter's shadow healed people. It was the cloud of anointing coming from him because he did get a deposit when he got Christ. Christ puts a deposit of the anointing in you and it never leaves you. But the more you give it out, the more you get back. It's almost like a bank account. It's like an investment account. When you release the anointing, it grows. So that's what you're supposed to do. You've never done that. Make sure you start releasing it into what? Go in the restaurant. You drink out of a cup. You say, I release the anointing. It'll never leave that cup. The next person, it never leaves that cup. No, never. Not through the dishwasher. No, it's not because it's a spiritual thing. It comes from you, release the anointing. It goes in that cup. Every restaurant I ever eat at, I release it in the table. I release it in the seats. And so there's John. We've seen some people sit down in places and they jump back up. They're like, I don't know what that was because it would be God. Maybe they're not, maybe they're not, maybe they don't know the Lord. Maybe they're doing wicked things. They sit in that chair full of anointing. They all have to jump up and go find another place to sit down. So if you anoint the seat, let's say the seat in the table. For the rest of the time that that table exists, people will sit down in the anointing. And that's not just KatKerrd. That's anyone. Any believer that when you got born again, go read 1st John. I'll say it slow. 1st John 2 27. You have it because you got born again. Jesus Christ literally takes a deposit of the anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness and he says, he puts it in you and it lives there to buy there. That means it's there. It's up to you to release it wherever you go, whatever you touch. I have my phone up here before I send the text. I type in, I put my hand on this, they're releasing anointing. When they touch that and read that text, it comes out and you get. Wow. Oh, we actually released it in the tires of our car and I see fire tracks because the anointing looks like fire. It looks like that. In the spirit. It looks like fire. And so when we drive our car, you see fire tracks and everybody who passes over those tracks, the anointing will begin to penetrate their car. You don't know how supernatural you are. There are so many things we don't know as believers unless we are told that. And the Bible says, I have not seen or you're hearing or entered in the heart or mind of man, but God has prepared for those that love him. Well, one of the things he's already prepared is the anointing you're carrying. We have testimonies from people that their brother couldn't stand them. He lost his job and they wanted to help him. And the one guy, the brother had the good, the brother that was living right had these cowboy boots that this other brother wanted all the time. And they went to my meeting and heard me say these words. And when they went home, they anointed the cowboy boots, released the anointing in them, both of them. And they called the brother said, why don't you come have dinner? And they said, we really want to pray with you. He lost his big landscape business and now he was really needing. He said, well, I guess I'll come. And he asked, can I mow your lawn to get some money? And they said, yeah, sure. So when he went to leave, they said, you've always liked these boots. Would you like them? And he goes, yes, I want those boots. Well, these are anointed boots people from them. They carried the brother and his sister while that they carried they put in those boots. A couple of days later, he called and goes, I don't know why I've been mad at you. Wow. Why am I mad? I care about you. I just thank you for these boots. And by the way, I just got a brand new contract. I got a whole new contract to do all these condos now. And now I've got money again. I want to thank you so much for blessing me. It didn't happen until it gave him the boots. He put them on and the anointing began to penetrate now. And do you have to be in person to lay your hands on for that to work? Can you send the anointing from a distance? That would be rare. That'd be rare. Okay. You can send them something. You can send them a card in the mail. Okay. I released the anointing and you mail it. And when they open it or touch it, they don't even go. So Kat, if I put the anointing on an envelope, really prayed for it, the anointing to be released on an envelope. It goes to the person and the person says, writes on it, refused, returned to center, but they held it. They touched it. That's all it takes, Steve. That's clever. I will leave places go. We'll say it's too late, everybody. And this is the best part. Any of those people have been watching me bashing me. It's too late. You already have the anointing in you because I put it in everything as we're doing these things. We annoy all of our stuff and put it in it. And you can anoint your computer before you send emails. And the email, when they look at that email, they open it, it goes in them. Even, even if you, even if they look at it for a second and said, I don't want to read this, but they see it. That's it. Wow. Okay. Let's ask one question about sending the host. Sometimes I think, well, I've really done my job. I've spent 20, 30 minutes sending the host all over the place. I'm still in bed. I'm doing it while I'm still in bed. And I've sent them everywhere and I've given them assignment. I think, well, I'm done for the day, but you're saying five minutes later, they're back. I always give them one more before I go to sleep because you know, that's seven a.m. I'm up 20 hours a day. So they've been getting instruction out at three a.m. I, I like to go outside. I just like to go outside. I don't have to, but I want to be near where they're at. So I go outside with my staff and every time I, I give them an order to command to go somewhere, which I'm allowed to do because Christ was, you know, we know he was the Lord of hosts. He commanded the army to things he did. We can do too. I'm not going to go through all that, but I do. And I'll take my staff and I hit it on the ground and I'll just say, I'm not going to be it. Go host, make toast. That means they're going after the dark, the spiritual darkness to pull it down, to shred platforms and they will do it. And you may not find out to get to heaven one day, but when you do that, you are having an impact somewhere. But back to the anointing thing for just a minute. When I used to speak, we had a whole meetings that were nothing but to teach people to, they knew now that according to the word, the anointing was in them. And I was like, right here in the core of your being, I'd had people stand up and say, okay, now you know you have it. Lay your hand on there and ask Holy Spirit to stir it up. And we would actually have them do that. And then I always had, I always did something so they could see that it actually did something. And then I would say lay hands on the person next to you and say, I released the anointing in Jesus name and people were falling out. They started laughing. The room was getting so full. I could feel the waves of anointing coming from everybody. And I finally would say, stop, stop, stop, stop. I can't stand up anymore. So I didn't have them. I actually trained them how to use it. And people used to go while they would, they would go and anoint the reservoir of the city, like stick their hand as close as they could to it in it. And they did things like they would go to the pizza restaurant. They worked in, they would touch every pan in the restaurant, the ovens in the restaurant, the pizza place. And we see anointing, which everybody who got a pizza made on that pan got the anointing. My goodness. Forever because it doesn't leave. It doesn't ever leave because it's a spiritual thing. It's a spiritual thing. Unbelievable. You can be doing all kinds of things. Yeah. I'm re-fired up. Okay. It's like our secret weapon. It totally is. Understand the word that clearly says it lives in you. What do you think? What did you ever think you were going to do with it? Yeah. What people, what did you think? It says the anointing breaks or destroys the yoke of darkness. That's the anointing you carry. And no matter where you walk, you can release it through your feet. I walk through the store, release it everywhere in the store. Every garment I ever look at on the rack, I will touch and go, I'll release the anointing, the anointing, the anointing. Everyone who buys those clothes will have that anointing on them. Goodness, goodness, goodness. You can be busy all the time, people, just for the anointing. I'm going to get busier all the time. I see myself getting very busy. Okay. I, I told this lady, no, well, I would ask this, but it's way too long to read. So I'm going to summarize what she's saying. She's totally into everything you're teaching even today. I'm sure. But her husband began to be. A detractor. Then he went from a detractor to. He didn't like it. Then he went from that to. To being biased against it. Then he went, then he became a cynic. Then he became a mocker. Now he is a hardcore mocker of everything she's doing. And it's hurting her marriage. And she's supposed, she feels like she's supposed to submit to him. What does she do? That depends on how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. God, God, God, God, God, God, God. And then how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. God never said, he never said, we had to submit to the abuse of our husband. It's just physical abuse. It hasn't been physical. I think she would have told me, but it's really verbal wickedness. I can tell you what she can start doing. You need to start laying your hands on everything he's got. Let me see. Go to his closet. Release the anointing and all of his clothes. Make sure all of his shoes gets the anointing. You will probably see a change because that anointing destroys the yoke of darkness. He literally has a yoke on him right now. And when you keep going and you get darker and darker, it's because you know what he's doing. He's feeding his own soul with what he doesn't like. And if he keeps feeding his soul, that's all that's going to be in the layers of his soul. And as a man think it's in his soul or his heart, that's how he's going to be. That's the biggest issue. He's saying all that. It's like people watching the fake news. They would start out great. They wouldn't like it. Then they'd be listening and they'd be like, well, you know that sounds plausible. Well, you know what? I don't like the other side. And now they hate him and they don't even know why they hate what's right because their soul is filled with the lies and deception, the hate that those people who are spewing it out, it's going in whoever's watching it. The anointing can pass into people listening, but the bad stuff can pass into you. Also, if you keep listening, it says to guard your heart. That is your soul. For out of that soul will flow the way you live your life. That's what the issues of life is. Your whole life will change by what you're listening to. And it can even be your own words trashing something all the time, which is what he's doing. So he's speaking against what God has put on the earth and even in you. So you need to come against that stuff. You need to maybe send the host against those spirits of wickedness and lies and deception to pull that stronghold off of him, number one. But make sure you're releasing the anointing. It's the best thing you can use. It's the number one thing we're given. Even at the day we got born again, you got that anointing. That's one of the powerful things he gave you. It's there. He said it's there. It destroys the yoke. So that should destroy the yoke that's now on him. And you say, I'm praying and declaring that that yoke of darkness will be destroyed off of my husband. It can be free to love and free to live and free to hear God. And that's releasing anointing in the food he eats, like in the whole refrigerator and everything. Anointing in his closet, everything he's clothing he wears will have the anointing. You are so getting him consumed with that anointing. And eventually there is going to have, something's going to happen. And you will see it when it happens. That's a good thing. I don't think it was this woman, but there was another woman who said, my husband has finally forbidden me to watch Kat on the air. What am I supposed to do? Any? The same thing I'm telling the other woman to do. Same thing. Same thing. The anointing destroys any yoke of darkness. It doesn't matter what it is. It destroys it. I know we say that the anointing breaks the yoke, but actually the real word, that real word that says breaks, it actually means destroys. So it destroys all those yokes of darkness, whether it's hate, if it's deception, if it's lies, if it's an anger or unbelief, those are yokes. And that anointing was given to us so that it would break it, especially in our own family. It has a great impact on that. And I even tell people, if you're still hugging family members, you can say quietly when you hug them, I release the anointing so they don't hear it said, but say it. But I'm telling you what, if they live in your home, you have every opportunity to lay on their bed, put it on their pillow, put it in their bed, put it in their clothes, put it in the food. There is going to be a major reaction to the anointing that's breaking and beginning to destroy that yoke that's on that person. We have seen it over and over the testimonies we have, and just because I used to train people to do that, it was the first thing he had me teach. Besides the fact, I talked about heaven all the time. Everything he said is you will teach him how to use the anointing. It is a weapon, and they get it the day they're born again. So when we hug our loved ones, anyone that's running from the Lord, I'll use those words with me, hug them. We just say, under our breath, I release the anointing. Yeah. And then make sure if they're going to eat dinner at your house, make sure you release it in the food they're eating, and the plates, you know, go lay your hands on all the plates in your cabinets and the cups and everything. It sounds wild, but it really does work. It works. Amazing. Amazing. I'm excited. All right. All right. This sounds like Malachi, Milachi, whatever. Can you explain what the kingdom of God is? For example, Matthew 633 says, seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. That's her question. The kingdom is the same thing Christ talked about. He talked about a spiritual kingdom. That's he, when he talked about the gospel of the kingdom, that is a spiritual kingdom. That is a real kingdom that operates in the spirit realm. You're not going to walk up to a castle here that says, it's not a flesh and blood thing. It is the spiritual thing. And the kingdom of heaven, of course, is part of that spiritual kingdom. But on the years you operate in it, by doing one of the things I just told you, that is a weapon. Clearly it is a spiritual weapon. And yet it says what it does. It clearly says in the Bible, it destroys the oath. You have that weapon. You can't see it or touch it, but it's in you. And when you begin to release it, it actually impacts that spirit realm. And you're operating in the kingdom. When you do that, because you're using a spiritual weapon it gave you, when you speak truth to people to break off deception to them, you're operating in the kingdom. Every time you pray, you're operating in the kingdom. When you declare you're operating in the kingdom, when you help people, you're operating in that kingdom that Christ talked about, that it was so valuable that you give up whatever you can to get that kingdom. It is a spiritual kingdom. When you get to heaven, you have the full understanding of that. But the weapons he gives us now here, it says our weapons of warfare people. Remember what warfare is? It's when you come against something. You fight against the darkness and the evil. And you think, I can't do anything. I'm just a little human being. Oh yes, you can if you're born again, because you will now, a new creation means you now have supernatural abilities in you. You have supernatural weapons to use in the spirit realm, that you will really mess up the devil's plans. You're going to mess them up. So that kingdom he talks about is, he said, you cannot see it with your human eyes. But it's there because you're here. You have a spirit man. You can operate through your spirit using these weapons. And you can do wonderful, powerful things against the enemy, which is one of our, one of the things that we're called to do as a believer. That's what we're called to do. We rule and reign with Christ when we use those weapons. There are spiritual weapons against the spiritual darkness. Spiritual darkness is always against every evil, wicked, human flesh person. They're wicked because they're listening to the evil spiritual realm, the evil spiritual beings, which you have power over all the power of the enemy. Our enemy is Satan. So any demons disembodied spirits, I can go through this whole long list about that for three years. I did nothing but preach about the darkness out there and how to come against it. I did that for a long time. And so it's in me. I do it automatically. But you as a believer are powerfully and wonderfully made. That's what the scripture says. He didn't leave you without help. Number one, the Holy Spirit is here to help you all the time. Christ will never leave you. When you invited him in, he actually does step in. He's in there. He's there to help you, to help guide you with the Holy Spirit. But he gave you weapons, people. The word of God, not the one with half the verses scripted out. Okay. I'm not talking about the one that wiped out the truth and they want to put their interpretation in there. I'm not talking about that. And let me tell you that's happening a lot everywhere. And make sure you get a Bible that has all the verses in it. Yeah. And not things. Some are removing chapters because they don't like what it says. They want to make everything okay for everybody, no matter how wicked or evil we are. Hey, that's the agenda of the left. Doesn't it sound like that? Totally is. They want everyone to accept evil and wickedness. That's why they're spreading it. That's why they will never make anything good because there's no good in them. They can't even think that way. All they can think is destroy, take, steal, crush. That's what they're all thinking. That's what that whole agenda is for them. And yet Christ came to bring you life and life more abundantly. So we're supposed to have abundant life with Christ. Regardless of what else is going on around us. And maybe if you start using the anointing for what it is, it is a weapon to come against the spirit of the darkness. You will begin to see things shift even for you. So good. He didn't owe us without his blood, the most powerful thing ever in all time. The only thing that wipe away your sins and give you entrance into heaven. Satan hates it. The word of God, the word spoken, the word written is so powerful in the spirit. Satan hates that too. He doesn't like the light of God in you, but he can't stop it from coming. The greater relationship you create with Christ, the more light you have in you. It says one time at one time, even the night will be light round about you. That's you going outside at night and seeing a light coming from yourself. It is going to happen in the manifest of sons and daughters. I won't just read the word. I actually believe it and I live it. I live that word. People who don't understand that have never lived or understood even what it was. Why is it written in there? It's not just a nice story. A bad thing that happened. It is an agenda of God to let you see yourself as a new creation. You get part of his DNA in you. You get a stone of fire that gives light to your spirit man in you. And you get born again. You get a deposit of the anointing. You are so full of God right now as a believer, but you have no understanding. Right. That. Yeah. Let me ask this. Okay. We just read seek first the kingdom of God. And then with that or. Okay. Put that aside for a moment, not aside, but let's change the subject where. God came to you and said in 20, I think it was 2012. You said the kingdom age has begun. What's the difference between seeking first the kingdom of God. And now suddenly living in the kingdom age. There's a very big difference because the word talk is about when things will actually happen. Things that will come that will bring change. It changed a lot. Okay. When John the Baptist started saying, okay, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Yeah. He understood. He probably was one of the few people that actually understood. He knew heaven was about 10 days. He knew the Messiah was coming. He knew that he would die for the sins. He knew these things. And that change started when Christ was born, when he was sent from heaven to earth and planted in the womb of Mary by Holy spirit. That did happen. That happened. Things begin to change when she began to achieve. He was being birthed, not birthed, but he was being, you know, growing inside of her. Angels would come and tell her things. She knew things were going to change. She knew they would be different. When Christ born, things really began to change even rapidly, more rapidly. And at that time, Satan knew somebody had come. That's why he tried to find out from the, you know, from the wise kings. He questioned the wicked king and questioned them. But Christ was hidden and hidden and hidden, even sent to Egypt for a while because he was bringing change to this world by who he was. And then when he began to minister, then openly people began to see how things changed when he was around. And it was so powerful that he gave his life for us. When he gave his life for us, he made a way back to the place we came from. We all came from heaven. We lived in the Father. He is our Father. We are His offspring. The Bible says that the real change to happen once Christ was on this earth, it began to demonstrate and manifest the power of God. He stopped the storms. He walked on water. He increased time or he slowed time down. He created food. He made regular water into heaven's wine. You saw one miracle after another. One miracle after another began to happen. They haven't stopped happening. As the days grow closer, where the kingdom, the kingdom age would be brought to this earth, we would know more and more about it. That's part of my job is to let people know what is this kingdom? What is this kingdom? Why is the kingdom age here? So you can operate in it fully, understanding who you are, what the weapons he gave you, that would bring hope for people's lives, help for people's lives, that they would see people walking the earth that didn't sin on purpose, that could hear the word of God and demonstrate his power throughout the earth. That was the purpose of the kingdom age and it did start in 2012. All the way up to that, being a seer and understanding the prophetic, I felt something stronger and stronger coming and a lot of people announced what came in 2010 or 2010. I think that's the right way to say it. They could feel it coming closer and closer, but until the day came, and we literally in time, in time, if you were a seer, we stepped from a threshold of time into a time we've never had before. And that is when the manifested sons and daughters would be seen in the earth. That's why the earth was interveiled for us to stand up and start demonstrating who he is. The miraculous, like that people would be raised when the dead that were created. I mean, miraculous things will happen in this kingdom age, because God is going to demonstrate that he really exists. He's going to erase the great area that says there is no God. Many things are happening in this kingdom age. And the kingdom will remain up until the time when Christ is seated on the throne in Jerusalem, even after the tribulation, which is a few years, people, a few years, and then Satan will be sitting on the bottom of the pit. Christ will sit on a throne in Jerusalem as king of this world. And some people won't even put that in the Bible. That's what I said. Make sure you're looking at the right Bible. They say that these things have already happened. None of these things have happened except the kingdom ages come. People begin to speak to the weather like Christ did, and it will obey. Things that we say will begin to happen because we serve Christ and we live here for him. If you had been... Well, I was going to say, Kat, if you had been the only person and the first person who ever said that, I thought, well, Kat's going to be off here because that's not like anything I've ever heard. But years before I met you, my spiritual father, Wade Taylor, said in 2012, when it was 2012, he told me the kingdom ages come. He was 88 years old when he passed a couple of years after that. And I thought, what is he talking about? And then I later found out that Arthur Burke had said the same thing. Also, he's gotten to be with the Lord. So when you said it, that's the voice of two or three witnesses have absolutely agreed that 2012 this thing happened. I don't know why he picked out that year. I mean, Obama was in office. I mean, what did he pick that year? But I don't know what you... He loves to pick years when adversity is there. And I'll tell you why. People will actually listen because they need help and hope. Yeah. And he knew all this stuff was going to happen. He knew it, but he has got to fully expose the evil. It's not just about the devil having a heyday taken over. God is letting them on purpose expose how evil and wickedness operates. Well, socialism really does to you, but communism really does so people can see for themselves. It's not good. That doesn't mean he's doing it to hurt anybody. He's not doing that on purpose, but he has to have a time when the evil is exposed. It will be crushed and it will be pushed back because in these glorious years coming on the earth, it will be like a whole new earth, not a whole new earth, but a whole new thing happening on the earth. And favor will be given to believers. And there's people out there that wouldn't even believe me. Well, that doesn't matter. Maybe you'll be in heaven. Don't have to be concerned with it. I didn't mean that. Anyway, you cannot stop the plans of God. They couldn't stop Christ from coming. They couldn't stop the Holy Spirit from coming. They couldn't stop it from raising from the dead people. They could not stop Jesus from going in hell and wasting it. No one can stop what's going to happen this time. God's timeline. He has a timeline and the events. They're not dates. I walked up there. I didn't see one day to solve events. I saw these events happening on the earth. He didn't let me see to the end. I saw things that weren't happened. Hasn't happened yet. In heaven, you talked about, excuse me, and described that God has an event calendar. Not a date calendar, this event. But on earth, there's actually dates connected to it. We just don't know what those dates are going to be. We never know it. And when we think we've guessed it, we're almost always wrong from what I've seen. Yeah, that's what I don't ever guess. Yeah. Guessing is like wasted energy. So. You have to believe that God, you have to trust him. You have to trust him. You know, trust is very important. If you, if you, you begin to believe something, you go from believing to trusting, you actually put forth actions where you're trusting God for something. So you believe and then you begin to trust him, but there comes a day. And when you step from trust and you step into faith, you are never the same again. Never. And I had believed in God for so many years and trusted him probably for several decades. And then at one point I felt a shift in me and I said, what has happened? And a prophet literally truth called me on the phone who lives in South Carolina and said, the father had me call you to say these words. This day you have stepped into faith. Wow. Can you try to put into words. What that feels like to go from trust into faith? Cause we thought, I always thought trust was one of the ultimate things, but you're describing faith as like the next step up. If you will, what, what, what does that feel like? And if you can even think of an example, so people could go, oh, that's what I'm striving for or contending for or believing for. You want to, you want to step into faith because faith, it makes it feel the most amazing feeling you're everything. I felt such freedom, like freedom came. Freedom because I had been obeying God and I've been obeying him and everything. You asked me, I obeyed it. No matter how silly it was or why would you ask, I don't even ask him why he does anything. I, that's called trusting. When you get to trust and God says, do this and you know it's him and you do it and how amazing your life will be for that moment. But when you step into faith, everything he says after that, you were already living it on the inside. It's like there's not even one ounce of doubt. It leaves you, doubt leaves you. Doubt can't even get in you. None of the stuff that left the saying, it can't penetrate me because I'm a living in faith. I've stepped into faith. So no matter what anyone says to try to stop me from saying anything, it's not going to work. When you get to the place where you're there and God says you're there, then no matter what he says, you know that you know that you know it's happening. It is happening because you have stepped from trusting. You stepped into faith. It's an actual place that you step into. And from that moment, your faith gets so huge. It's like it's unstoppable. Not that I must have a month, but whatever God says to me or shows me, I know that I know that I know this is happening. So when you know that, you know that, you know, is living in me, it's not somewhere up here. I'm trying to find it as an example. When you know that, you know that, you know that, you know, Trump is coming back. There's no, you've moved beyond trust to faith. It's so real that no one could talk you out of it. No, they can't talk me out of it because I know it's going to happen. It is absolutely going to happen people. It's going to happen. And the great thing is you, you're standing in that faith. You know it's going to happen. Nobody can try to take it is something they can't take away from you. It isn't just something you hurt when you're in faith. You already know it's going to happen. You know it, but I'm not out there blasting people wrongfully using people. I'm not using, you know, nasty words or hurt people. I'm just not doing it. I'm going to stay right where God has me. So my words have power. They have power for hope, for blessing, for greatness. They have power in them. Part of that power is the faith that I'm in now. But anyone who is a believer can go after that. This is nothing I'm doing as hell from you. It depends on what you want. What do you want from him? Do you want to know him more? You want more of him? You want more of his presence? More of his words? You have to pursue them. Yeah. Do you want to get blessed? Well, then bless other people because you probably won't get anything without blessing. Blessing is like a seed where there's money, where there's actual health. Do you help people with things or help give revelation to them? Or maybe you're just helping them do something they really need to do. That always does something to the heart of God. So if you want to be blessed, you will have to bless first because then you're trusting God. You're not doing it to get something. Right. You truly want to bless. Yeah. I love to bless people. I love to help people. It's like, it's a part of me now. And when that faith becomes a part of you and he says it, and I know people who have already gotten there, they know that he's saying what he's saying is going to happen. That's why Hank won't change what he's saying. He knows, he knows, he knows he's already in faith for that. God said it. He showed us that he knows it's going to happen. Yeah, when you go, when you went from trust to faith, now that you're in faith, it sounds very, very powerful. Will that faith grow? Will it get more? Or is it? It does. It does. It grows and grows and like the kingdom always, always, always grows. Right. It'll never stop growing. It increases. You're going to increase in every way because it says he desires above all things. Right. That you be in health. By the way, that's living in health. Right. He wants you to prosper. Number one, above all things, he wants you to prosper. Prosper doesn't just mean money. It means the way you're living, the things you're saying, the impact you're having on people, that that's prospering in all your ways. You're prospering. That means with your relationships, with what you're doing, if you own a business, what you're doing in the church or what you're doing to help other people, there's always going to be increased. That's prospering. That's an action of life itself. That's not just here's some money. He wants you to be in that place. And then even as you will prosper, even as your soul prospers, right? Right. He also wants you to prosper and live in health. BE means a way of life. Christ became poor that we might be rich. That's his plan. Poverty is not the father's plan. Okay. So it says even as your soul prospers, you will then live in health and you will prosper. Your soul has to prosper. So if you're feeling your soul with bad news or bad words that you're speaking, or you don't even like yourself, your soul can't prosper. We can't do those other two things. Your soul has to prosper in order for you to prosper and live in health. It has to prosper. It prospers by reading the word, speaking the word, saying God's promises, saying what God is wanting to do right now, not the left, not what your friend is saying, if it's not aligning with God, the more your soul prospers, the more life it puts out, not just gets in. The more you will prosper in all your ways and you will begin to live in health. That is called divine health. Let's use this as the last question since I've done two shows today. So I'm going to cut it a bit shorter, but I'm in health, but I'm tired. So a person, and I can put myself in this, but I don't really suffer a lot from this, but I suffer some from this, where people will say, well, I don't like myself. I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I, how much I weigh. I don't like the way, you can just list and listen to this, but you just said, if you don't like yourself, I don't consider myself a person that doesn't like myself. But I don't like certain things about myself. Talk to people and myself. How do you move that needle from, I don't really like what I see in the mirror. I don't really like what God did to make me, how he made me, to, to, to liking yourself so that you can prosper. Talk about that. I'll tell you right now, that's why you can't prosper because what is the whole thing goes back to as a man thinker in his heart. When he says that word heart, he's not talking about your human flesh beating heart. He's talking about your soul. Here's your soul. Right? This is your soul. Here's your soul right here. It's like this. There's a beautiful column with etchings and writings on it. That is your will. And on top of that is your spiritual mind, your mind, your will, and your emotions are all the layers of you, that's how you're made, and those emotions, and whatever you put in those layers, words you said about yourself, the more you feel what was the things you don't like, it's not going to change. It can't change because what are you feeding your soul? You're feeding negative things that you don't like about yourself. You don't like how you live. You don't like the way you look. You don't like what's happening to you. That's why that can't be changed. If you don't like who you are, stop saying the things about you you don't like and say, this may not be perfect when I look in the mirror, but God is going to perfect it. And I'm going to love the way I look, however way he wants me to look. I'm going to love what he does with me. I'm going to love what he says to me. My souls begin to prosper this day because I'm no longer beating it up. And I won't listen to people that beat it up because the other reason why you can't prosper is everyone around you saying negative things to you. You were just made that way. That's just the way. That's your destiny. You can't change that. You lose those words out of you. You cannot keep them in your soul. Not even words you said. You cannot keep them in your soul because that's what you will become. You will become what you were saying you think you are. And I have done this with so many people. It's almost not ridiculous, but it happens the same way every time. You have to say, I repeat for saying all those negative words about me. I lose everywhere those words from my soul, from my mind, my will, my emotions. I will not allow them to remain in Jesus' name. And then you say, I choose my will to like myself. I choose with my will to be blessed and to bless God for making me this way. I choose my will to be excited for whatever he has for me. You are then feeding power to your soul to change, causing your own soul. You don't need a whole world out there to do it. You don't even need a profit to do it. You watch over your own soul. You are the keeper and watcher of your own soul. You are. And the way you talk and the way you think, the things you choose to go watch. What are you watching? You watching murders? Are you watching things that are horrible? Are you watching profanity? Are you watching witchcraft? Because guess what? You're feeding your soul. You're feeding your soul profanity, witchcraft, and violence. Do you think that your soul is going to prosper? You need to take a whole, you need to look at a soul checkup, you need a soul checkup people. You need to see, what am I watching on a regular basis? What words are coming out of my mouth, okay? What have I looked at? What have I read? Is it negative? Is it bad? Is it wicked? Get rid of it, people. Because if you want your soul to prosper, and then you will prosper and live in health, you better be. That's what it says to guard it. You're guarding it. You don't let garbage in, and you don't put garbage out. Garbage comes out of your mouth, it goes in your own soul. Every time you blast someone, that goes in your own soul. You can't stop it. It's just the way we remain. Your soul, and what you put in it is what you will become, and no one on this earth is going to change that. You can change who you are. If you don't like the way you look, if you don't like the way of what's happening, if you're upset about everything else, you're feeding your soul those words. If you want that soul to begin to prosper and the light of God to grow in it, and you actually get happy, then start saying positive things. I'm not talking about positive, I'm thinking, you really be positive about things. Maybe you had a friend that you liked, but they always end up by saying something nasty to you. I lost all those words that were spoken against me, that were nasty, that were harmful, that were bashing. I lost everyone, no matter where they came from. If I listened to it or somebody said it, I lost everyone in the mind of your soul, Jesus comes and goes, and it's like they were never there. Yes, they're going to start to feel different. Then you begin to thank God. I thank you, God, for my life. I thank you for letting me be born this time. Thank you for letting me be great for you. Thank you for bringing happiness to me. Show me, Holy Spirit, what to say, and when to say it. I give you permission to remind me to say things that are positive. Then you are on the road for your soul to actually prosper. God can give you more, do more with you, and use you more, because He wants you to go up to a person, they go, oh, this is horrible, what's going on today. Now, these are not my own words. It's bad. Do you think that we're all going to go down a hole somewhere? Do you think I'd walk away in the store if someone said that to me? There is no way that's happening, because I'm not keeping their words in my soul. I say, well, let me explain to you something. There is a God, and He's alive, and I know Him. He's got great plans for this service, and this wicked stuff you see going on is all being exposed. He's going to move His hand, things are going to be going to happen, and you're going to be so happy with your life. So stop saying the words you just said. If I were right in front of Him, I choose to lose all the negative words, I plant positive words. I believe in the life of God, the presence of God. I know He's got great plans for us. I know these are powerful days coming on the earth, and they're watching you in the grocery store. That's good. Man, that felt good. That was so strong. Do you really believe that I said yes, and why don't you? I don't just listen to this negative garbage. It comes from hell, and sometimes I'll go, the words you just spoke, hell told you those words. If you're feeling bad, you don't like yourself, you're believing those words, and if you get stronger, you're actually repeating those words. So stop marketing hell. Why not market heaven? And that is my... Oh, God. Well, you know, this is one of those episodes that people, including myself, need to listen to more than once, two or three times. There's so much meat. You can bring hope in your day-to-day life, no matter where you go or who you see. You can bring hope by saying what is truth, and God does care, and He is doing something. You may not see enough, but you're going to see this happen, and I'll even tell people, you remember this day, when I told you things would be changed and they would be great, and you will be celebrating in the street when God brings in what He's doing this time, because He has judged the evil, and then I'll walk away, say something, people, say something that brings hope in life to people. They hear enough death and garbage everywhere. It's so good, so good, so, so, so, so good. Well, can't talk about revealing heaven.com and your other website before we close. Yeah, I do have two websites. I really didn't name either one of them, but you know, the father tells me what to say, and I always obey. He named my book, Revealing Heaven, so we made our first website, revealingheaven.com, and we have a lot of products there. We actually got some new things in already that will be taken with us to Nebraska. I'm excited about it. We have some new things that represent heaven, and that's another part of my job to reveal and create heaven on this earth, so that's what you find, revealingheaven.com, and catcur.com. That is a spiritual platform that doesn't listen to any negative or evil or wickedness. It gives you all kinds of revelation in there. We have videos you can watch. You can see interviews done by people who ask me certain questions that are really great. We have a gallery of things what they look like in the spirit realm, like I think you can see what an aquamanchen looks like that I saw in heaven. You can see how even in the transportation looks like in the spirit realm. You ride on beams of light, travel on paths of light. That's what Christ did when he stepped into the spirit realm and walked through the bodies of the people. When they were going to throw him off that cliff, he said he passed through the people. He didn't say he passed around. He took one little sidestep into the spirit realm, spirit realm supersedes this physical realm, and he passed right through the people and they never saw him. You see kinds of things like that in there. There's also all kinds of decorations and things that can train you to let you know things in a greater way. There's testimonies on catcur.com, and it's the only way to give to me online. No other person's Facebook or whatever is out there. I don't ask people to give me money in any of the videos, not on YouTube or Facebook. I'm not going to do that, but people will take my stuff. They say, well, you need to give money to this missionary camp. That's not going to be great to the pocketbook people. Other people asking me to get your money, and I'm not doing it. You have to ask to go to catcur.com, click on the treasury if you want to be a part of helping to support Heaven's plan to bring Heaven to Earth. So good. Cat, we love you. Love you. Love you. Thank you so much. Would you go ahead and pray for the people as we close out? I know you've got great declarations, so go for it. Yeah, Father, I thank you for this day, this glorious, beautiful day that you have made. A day for things to be great for us on the earth. A day for us to know you more, to hear you clear, Father. This is a wonderful day, and you have purposed this day. Satan doesn't own this day. His people don't own this day, even the person sitting in the highest seat of the land. That's stolen. But Father, we know what's going to happen to those people, and I thank you for your plan for all of that to happen. But right now, Father, I just impart the life of God, the presence of God, His will, His way. I evict all evil, every evil spirit. Get out of everyone listening to this broadcast right now in Jesus' name. I thank you for showing us how to rule and reign with Christ's Son, who actually the entire earth belongs to. If I serve, I will not serve another. There's nothing darkness in me. There's no evil in me. There's light, there's love, there's the power of the living God. Thank you, Father, for showing them and giving them a taste of you so they will run after you. Your Son died on that cross because you asked Him to pay a price, and He did. Our lives for all eternity will be great. They will be excited. There will be so many amazing things to do with you, and I'm looking forward to eternity. Right now, I'm on this earth, and I'm not going anywhere until you say I go. Father, I hope they know you that well, and can think of you that powerfully, that they know who they are in Christ. Christ in you is the hope of glory, and God is powerful. He's represented with the light of God, and the power of God, and it will cover this earth like the waters cover the sea one day. I hope you're carrying it. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much, Cat. You are a dear friend, and you and I just become better friends all the time.

happy Wednesday everyone August 31 2022 our apologies were much later than normal but we will recover it'll be so good it'll be worth worth the way pardon I still have a cough I got one cough drop left right here well we may do that I don't know how this cough comes and goes but it does but anyway I wanted to say to the group to the to our viewers as you many of you know we're off of YouTube right now we got notified either this morning or last night whenever whatever that happened so they decided one of our guests said something and that's strike two and and the notice I looked at today said one more strike and you're removed from the channel so we're trying not to do that but anyway we're not on YouTube today and I think I heard that it will be two weeks someone can mention that in my chat if it if it's two weeks but anyway we're off right now we're going to and yes it's two weeks at least it says so we will be emailing you daily to let you know that we're reminding you that we're not on YouTube so please please forward or text or email as many of your friends as you can and say they're here but they're on rumble only because of all of this junk that's going on you say it in those words or any other words but we are continuing to be flexible and flow with what happens so that if this goes down we have that right now we are on rumble we are on Facebook and we're on Elijah list calm so we try to be careful we're talking code today we don't have to be careful at all because we're not on YouTube so they're gonna probably in my personal opinion people will never forget all the times they were kicked off I doubt that YouTube will last but I'm not saying that as a prophetic voice but you know we're all looking for alternatives you know maybe when this gets over and they got new leadership maybe it won't matter anymore so all right let's show I want to to keep before you new ads that we're developing that shows the the wells the freshwater wells we're digging in Uganda we're over 50 freshwater wells we're digging a new freshwater well every five days there's been 300 salvations at last report which means there's more now and there've been eight church plants so this is because of your generous generous generous donations and as I've said before a significant portion of what you donate to this ministry not only keeps us going but we feel called by the Lord to to tide if you will that money into many freshwater wells it's a lot more than a tithe but God has blessed us for doing that so we've got a quick promo on that so without further delay let's go ahead and play that Emily you Thank you again so much for your donations to support this, these wells. The Lord thanks you. I can say by the Spirit, the Lord is thanking you. Great rewards, he says in the scriptures, even if you give so much as a simple cup of cold water to one of these, you will surely not lose your reward. So that's what the Lord said, not us. So thank you for doing that. I truly believe that the Lord has shown me that when you get to heaven one day, when it's your time to go, there will be little children, maybe hundreds of them will come up to you and say, thank you because of you. We had fresh water and because of fresh water, I received the Lord. So thank you. So that's an amazing thing. We really, really, really appreciate your giving. So thank you so much. We are in an intense time. We have about eight weeks, nine weeks maybe for the election. There are, this is not prophetic, but there are some people that say, are we even going to have an election because things are getting intense? I believe, I hope there will be an election if there is and when there is, be sure that you overwhelm the system by voting, but many of you, more of you voting than they expect to vote. You need to overwhelm the system because they can't recover from that. Greg Phillips was, of 2000 mules was on and last week or the week before and said, that's the way to do it. You got to overwhelm the system. So anyway, between now and then make sure the deep state is going to try and prevent this election. We know that that's what they want to do because they know they're going to lose if we get, if the election goes through, be sure your gas is full, keep your tank topped off, keep your groceries of non perishables. Don't just fill up your refrigerator because what if the power goes out? So make sure you have non perishable, we even have powdered milk sitting in there and canned goods and cereal non perishable things that you can open the can and make sure you have a can opener too. Because a lot of people have those electric can openers, which may or may not work if they do something serious. I'm not prophesying that I'm just saying make sure your pantry is as full as you're able to do it and extra for others if you're able to do that. So I just wanted to tell you that we are, these are not going to be a normal eight weeks between now and then the deep state does not like you and me and believers and conservatives. In fact, they, you've heard several of our guests say they basically want something like nine out of 10 or they want to bring the population down to 500 million, which is, which is the population is what that's what the population. I looked up what was the population at the time of Christ coincidentally it was 500 million. That's what they want to bring 7.5 billion down to is 500 million, which is, which means that it's their desire and we've said this on the air. This is not some shocking new thing. It's their desire to depopulate the earth now they're not going to succeed. We're going to bring Patricia Katker sorry on in just a moment and she has seen into the future. They are not going to succeed at that. And so we want you to know that, but we do know that they're going to want to try. So make sure your gas is full and you're in your pantries just full as you're able to do it. You have extra water, anything that you think you might need. If you can't go to the store for two weeks or three weeks, have it have a good supply there. All right. I think that's all for today. Thank you again for your support and let's bring in Katker. So it's Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Well good morning Kat or I guess you should say it for you. It's good afternoon in it back into Florida, right? Yes I am in Florida and I guess it's afternoon. One said that your clock was off today or something. It was all three of the clocks and it's not my job to replace batteries. Okay. I do sweep and clean the floors and clean up stuff and I mean, I do do that kind of thing a lot, but I don't put batteries in the clock. So none of them were right and they were one was an hour and a half off home was an hour off and one was like two hours late. And so none of them helped me and I have something to say and so yeah, go for it. Go for it Kat. The father wants you to know that you should fear never, not ever, never in this day. He didn't give anyone a spirit of fear in case you wonder if you have fear that's not from him. So there's number one point number one if you're in fear, I'm not saying maybe you're a little concerned about things, I'm thinking if you're in real fear, that is not God. God's not putting fear in you. He's not going to say fearful things to you. He made you powerful. Right. He gave us a spirit of a sound mind. Remember that right power, love and a second gave it to us. That's what he put in you when he made you. So therefore he told me to take authority over. So right now father take authority over all fear, no matter who's experiencing it, no matter where it is in this world. I cancel you, I evict you from everybody's home, from their soul in Jesus name and I impart the life of God, the love of God, the power of God, the will, his way in Jesus name, celebration, expectation of what you're going to do father, not what the devil has planned, who's the Lord of the Flies by the way, just remember that Jesus Lord of hosts, Saint Lord of Flies says about all the wills that he has, so we thank you this day father that fear is evicted, joy and celebration, which is what you talk about, it's okay to be practical, but don't ever let fear interfere in your life in Jesus name, amen, amen, amen, and don't take all the toilet paper, don't take all the toilet paper, I've been, I've been collecting it. We've been collecting it for a few months on, I mean, we have that much, but you know, we collect it while they had plenty, because I don't want to run on the TP. Yeah, it was a good plan, collect it while there's plenty. Isn't it amazing, what did we do in this world on the earth before we had toilet paper? You know, it wasn't that many years ago they invented that, they actually invented toilet paper. I don't want to think about it. Paul Harvey had a story where there was this train full of certain, it wasn't cut up, it was rolls or something, and it didn't make its destination, something went wrong, or the guy went bankrupt or something, and someone had the idea to cut these up into smaller rolls or something like that, and it became toilet paper, he said, let's make it toilet, yeah, it was something like that. I've tried to find that article or that audio by Paul Harvey, because you know, no one told the story like Paul Harvey, you know, and he goes, and now you know the rest of the story, you know, yes, and putting it into everybody will know the rest of the story. Yeah. Yeah. Now you don't see Kat, we know that the deep state hates us. We know that they don't, that they would like to depopulate, but what has God showed you is going to actually happen? There will be no gross massacres, there will be no mass killings or dying, nodded on this time. God sent, if you think about from the Father's point of view, he sent people to the earth that he needs here right now, he needs this many people, all the ones who are here now, he sent here specifically, he timed your birth on the earth, he needs you, and in these days coming months and years coming, there will be so much activity for the body of Christ to do, even good moral people to do, new inventions, he's still sending them people, so if it wouldn't be half wiped out, that wouldn't be possible, which is why, by the way, I want to say something, it isn't that they hate us people, it's that they're very afraid of us. Oh, wow. Quite a small correction in there, the Father says, Satan doesn't hate you, he is afraid of you. Wow. Wow. Satan is the doormat, we are not a doormat, we were given power and authority, he was not given power and authority. We have legions of angels, more of the hosts ever than there is a demonic, they fire out number them, they're bigger than them, and they're ready to do things in this time on our behalf, so more than ever before the activity, what you will see is activity of the host of heaven in this world, individually doing things for people, even in groups of people, you'll see a risk is being done that would not have happened in any other way, God is about to show off his power, Satan will not get his chance, now you need to understand God has a timeline, I've seen the timeline, we're not near the end, we're near the end of the way we will be operating because we'll be in authority, in power, we'll have the great positions, we'll have the inventions, that's what is planned for our lives by the one who made you, not the one who would like to wipe you out, the reason why he wants to kill, steal all of your stories, he's afraid, he knows this is not his time people, he knows he's trying to make a rush to take it early, and guess what, do you think the God of all creation is going to let the Lord of the Flies take over right now? I think he's about to get a lot of insect bites himself, let me tell you right now, what is going to happen is God's plan, not even man's plan, not wicked man's plan, not hell's plan, okay, I don't care what their plan is, it always fails, so don't let fear be the one thing that controls you, because Satan's really good at that, he knows how to use fear, if he can get you to think about all the negative all the time, then you probably will dwell on that, you're not supposed to, he's supposed to walk in power and authority, he's supposed to rule with Jesus Christ, I haven't seen that openly happening in many places, but it's going to be, to the point the Father said, that the world will want you as a friend or to know you because you're a believer, that is how different it's going to be if you want to see your future, that's your future, not running around afraid you'll starve to death, Satan's wicked armies will come to get you and drag you away, that is not, this is not the end, this is not the time of the perilous times, this is not the tribulation people, it's hundreds of years away, and I don't mind saying that because guess what, I'll still be here saying that and you'll be enjoying heaven, so you need to understand, you say God's will, God's way, God's will not mine, but his, because when you live his will his way, you'll have celebration, anticipation, expectation of greatness in you, you were sent here to be great, not to watch the parade go by, we're supposed to be leaders, we're supposed to be the ones people look up to for answers from heaven, and man's mindset and man's head knowledge cannot come up or equal revelation from the one who made us, he knows every thought of everybody, he knows where every wicked person is, every evil camp, every hidden thing, there's nothing hidden from him, but he's going to expose all of it, and then justice is coming, he is not changing what he's saying, if you're tired of listening, don't listen, go sit with the Lord of the Flies and get a big fly swatter. Cap, do you still believe that while the deep state, especially these last few weeks before the election, I'm probably going to try a lot of things, do you still believe we need to get our popcorn out and our cake out and enjoy the show, is this a time to enjoy the show? You know I'm still enjoying the show, I will live the way the Father talks to me about, you have a choice, I'm not going to make you take what he says, but it's so easy and simple to take what you see with your human eyes, when you don't have just human eyes and you see the spirit realm, you understand, they are scrambling, to hang on to anything they can hang on to, and that would be the spiritual wickedness and the physical wickedness. They know, some of them already know, this whole thing is going to fail, they know it's going to fail. They're not saying that to their own groups, but they're very afraid, because it hasn't turned out the way they planned, because this is, this earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof, it's His. He gets to say what happens, we need to agree with Him. I'm not ignoring evil, I just don't participate in it, and when you continually repeat all of the stuff going on, I'm saying all day long, someone says what do you think about what's going on, you should say I think God has a plan, I think He's in charge and I'm on His side, because when you keep repeating what the devil wants you to repeat, you're marketing health plans, make you afraid, make you weak, strip the hope away from you, the joy away from you, you don't want to lose your joy, that's why the celebrate thing comes in. I can tell you I'm sure that Noah, it's a good thing none of you are Noah, you wouldn't have never lasted 120 years and this thing won't take 120 years, but who won in the end? I can tell you this, the Father has a plan for you, not just your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great great great grandchildren, He has a plan for you if you're alive and breathing, He has a plan for you, and that is to market what heaven is, be a testimony of what heaven is, demonstrate the power of the living God in this earth, not waiting for months to go by, you have authority right now, open your front door, kick out the devil, kick out every word, sound, image, thought, frequency of hell, if you've been watching the fake news, there's no wonder you're having issues, why not make news for God and say what He's doing in this world, setting it up for the greatest days this world will ever see until Christ sits on the throne and Jerusalem and yes, He is going to do that one day. There are people whose families and friends, close family and friends are really on their case, I have a few of those myself. Mine gave up. They gave up. Okay, I was going to ask you about that, so how do I ask this question? Is God going to in a sense vindicate, you know, vengeance is mine and all that, we don't want vengeance on our loved ones and family, but justice comes and redemption comes, is God going to redeem, vindicate whatever word we might choose, those who have held strong towards. I will say what is word, it's in power. Okay. He's going to empower those with authority and dominion who have stood and not stepped back. They will be some of the greatest leaders in this world, people will look up to them because they'll know all the time, don't stop saying what God has said, you don't stop saying it, because He is looking to see who's saying and what they're saying. Okay, He doesn't have to convince me to do it. I've seen Him in person and heard Him in person and I've seen the future. I know what the future is going to be, regardless of what the devil's trying to do, he's trying to do his great big takeover right now. He already knows it's going to fail, but he's going to take as many as he can get and he does that by crushing your dreams, by stealing your destiny. Your destiny is still waiting for you. You have to say yes to that, no to the devil, open your front door and he did anything of hell out or wicked man evicted out of your home, make a habitation for heaven and heaven in the presence of God will flood your home all the time. You have a choice, you have a choice, you can follow the Lord of Hosts or Lord of the Flies. By the way, you really mean that, of course the devil can be evicted through your walls, but you really mean open your door and let him out. If you mean that. That way if people come in and told you all the bad stuff going on or they have predicted, I won't even call it, I won't even say that they prophesied it. A true prophecy comes from God, not man's mind, by the way. It's words God spoke. He spoke them. He spoke them to somebody and said, you say this, you will say this. He's not going to tell somebody to say something that's against what he's been saying. Something that's fear getting in, they let control get in, like you said, have talked about Steve, people trying to pressure you. No one does that to me now because they know what they're going to get. Hands laid out on them. That's what they're going to get. Maybe not in the way they want to. But I will tell you this, I'm not backing up. I'm not backing up one single word that the Father has told me to say. One single thing I have been shown, guess what's going to happen? What God wants. What His plan is and what people don't see because they don't really know Him like they should know Him. They can know Him. Let's change it. They can know Him. The more you know Him, you understand how He works. He is mysterious. He's never going to do it man's way. He doesn't necessarily have to make you understand. He just says, this is going to happen and then He does it. That's good. That's good. The gospel of the Prophet is different than just the prophetic. I love the prophetic that people can see and hear and say things. It's an office, it's a place you sit in and you have authority in. So I cannot say what man is saying. I cannot agree with what they're saying. I'm not going to agree if it's against what God has said because in the end, Steve, who do you think will be celebrating the most? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I think you know John- Well, I guess what everyone else will be celebrating right along with them and they will enjoy the victory that's about to happen for us. I have no problem keeping some extra graham crackers in your closet if you want it. That's perfectly fine to do that and this day and age, it might not be a bad idea to have a few extra things around, but I do know God's not going to let anybody starve or die from starvation. He's not going to allow that. Okay. Johnny Enlo says a thing. He said it many, many times, so it's not one off thing, but he said it for a couple years now. He said, God had told him we are about to be safe from things we don't even know we need to be saved from. Is that a perspective you have? In other words, there's things that if we knew how horrific it was that God was about to save us from, maybe we'd even look at things differently. What are your thoughts about that? I know some of those things. Okay. Things it's hard to even say. But the key word is this, saved from them. Yeah, exactly. So God's plan is not to wipe us all out when he has built generations on purpose, generations like I'm seventh generation of really God doing things the way he wants to. He's been building generations with people who believe and will believe what he says. He's been building them. He's not going to, why wouldn't he let them be wiped out Steve, that doesn't even, that doesn't make sense. Okay. Right. Exactly. He's not going to do it. He's not going to get wiped out, this will not be a communist country, no matter what they say. They don't rule this country. No one sitting in the left or the hidden or the evil or the wicked or the White House or the Pentagon, anywhere else, they don't rule this country. We the people are in charge of this country and we will have what we say will happen. We will have it. I'm not talking about the darkness. What we say, justice, liberty and freedom, that is who we are, right in this moment that you're breathing, you're still free. God's not going to let that all be taken away from us, no matter how many lies they put out, no matter how many pictures they show people and they've not created one good thing. Don't expect them to do it. Don't expect them not to try to steal, cheat and lie again, but it won't help them at all because God is going to do what he's going to do and they will be brought to justice. I will not stop saying that. I will not stop saying that because that is what is going to happen. I trust him. If you know how important it was to trust God, when you begin to trust him, you begin to actually believe him. When you begin to believe him this season, you will step into a level of faith you never thought you could have. Wow. And after that, you are given a spirit of faith, a high level of faith and no one will be able to convince you that what God has said won't happen. They won't be able to. There's no way they can because you're living and walking in the spirit and not in your flesh head thinking and assuming and expecting what man has said will happen. They're wrong. If someone is afraid and they're struggling and they're having a hard time believing that and you said, if you will believe God, does that, in order to get there, does someone say, I don't feel it. It's hard to see it, but as an act of my will, I choose to believe. Is that how they do that? Absolutely. Because you know what you put in your soul is what you are. As a man thinking in his heart, your soul is at the heart or core of your being. It is a position. When he talks about the heart, he's not talking about this human beating heart, which side is that? I don't know. Whatever side is tongue beating. He isn't talking about your flesh heart when he says, as a man think it in his heart. He's talking about a position, very core heart of your being is your soul. Your soul is in the center of your being. Your mind, your will and your emotions, you know, that's what the devil is going after. Because even if he doesn't really have to do anything except control that, control what you believe, control what you say, control what you watch, control where you go. That's what he wants to do. We let him do it. Well, I stopped doing that a long time ago. Okay. I'm letting the spirit of God share with me and show me and encourage me. It says encourage one another. So if you keep sharing what the left is doing or planning or their absolute stupidity of who they think they are, they can't run at McDonald's, let alone this country. They don't know anything. They only know what Satan is putting in their soul, what wicked, evil people above them who are there controlling and some of them are about to die. So just get ready for that. Yeah. Wait a minute. Some are about to die. Yeah. Okay. So you did repeat it. So who are the some that are about to die? Just to be clear. Because you said it. Okay. This is like an Ananias and Sapphira time is what you're saying some is and I think a lot of order crossed over the line of living or dying. It's too late for them. What about what, because we, you know, when we think of Ananias and Sapphira, because I'm the one that use that, we think of people in the body of Christ. Are there people in the body of Christ who are about to leave this earth because they have chosen to not walk with them? I do know some are leaving the earth because their time is over. Okay. So don't confuse that. Yeah. You know, a great leader of God who died, I was not talking about, I said the wicked, evil people. Okay. The wicked evil who are trying to control all this stuff. Some of them. Okay. You may not even know who they are, but you will find out. You may not know who they are. Some of them are about to die. Yeah. I saw on the news. By the way, I could recommend this, there's a site called Citizen Free Press. It's kind of like a new dredge. It's conservative. And on that same day, I think it was yesterday, it could have been the day before, but I think it was yesterday, two different celebrities at the age of 32 suddenly died. Now, someone could say, well, that was the Vax, I don't know, but God is in control of life and death. And it was weird on the exact same day. And we don't know by looking at that, was it the Vax? Did they, uh, did they cross the red line with God? You know, you know, I don't know what to think about that kind of thing. I also don't want people, I don't want like believers and other people thinking maybe they crossed the line. You didn't cross the line people. He's talking about the wicked evil and some of them are hidden with evil who are actually the ones controlling. Cause I can tell you the ones in the White House aren't really running things. Not the real stuff. They're not really running it. They're being told what to say and told what to do by very wicked evil people. Some of those people, and that will affect them because then they won't have them telling them what to do. So you'll see a major thing happening in the White House, uh, probably confusion, probably a lot of confusion, more than normal confusion and other things began to like, it may even be quiet for a while because they, some of them won't know what to do now that the, the ones who thought they were going to take over everything, some of them are going to die. It's just going to happen. Like I said, I won't let them out. I won't allow them to remain on the earth. That is, those are his words. Some will die. I will not allow them to remain on the earth. So those are the ones that I'm talking about. I'm not talking about people in the body of Christ who maybe are messing around or something like that. I'm not talking about them. These are wicked evil people, more wicked than the ones in the White House. Are you in, I wanted to ask you about that. Cause that was interesting what you just said, cause we know that there's people in the basement as it were, or on the, on the earpiece as it were, or in literal, are you saying that the people that are giving the orders to the fake people in the White House, are you saying the people that are carrying out the orders are in a sense less wicked than the people that are giving them orders? I have to say that they are because they are, I know you will think that they, I'm not, I'm not cutting any of them slack and I'm not going to minimize any of the evil wickedness they did, but there are sort of what you were talking about earlier. There are more wicked people who may not even be in this country, but they're about to die. Some are going to die and it won't be expected and it will bring confusion. That's what happens in the enemy's camp when, and guess what? Satan doesn't even care if they die, he probably killed them and then he'll take them to hell and torture them more than anyone else is what he does. So you don't get anything. You gain no prize in hell when you're wicked and evil people, you get no prize, none. There's no prize in hell for anybody. And so if you, if that's who you're planning to be a part of or you are a part of it, you better get out of that really quick because it's telling you justice has already been sent, it's already been sent here. A gavel has already been stopped and no one's going to stop what God is about to do at all. And some of that, starting of it will be some, a couple, I'm not saying a lot, I don't expect 50 people to die, but there will be a couple that will die that will shock people. Wow. And maybe that shock factor that it's like who would have ever thought that might be a clue that that's one of those that were removed. It probably may not be anybody you even have heard about, not generally like living here and doing stuff here because most of those people who are in this country are the ones who are allowing to be used, paid to be used, or do it because they love evil. There's people who are over this, I'm sure Robin knows about that, that are, that are even more wicked and evil than the ones who are in the White House. The ones in the White House don't have a lot of brain. I'm just being honest, okay. And their normal brain thinking of a normal human being who's been through the 12th grade wouldn't be trying to do the stuff that they're doing because you're not going to run anything. You're going to run the end of the ground, which by the way is what they want to happen. They want to run the country into the ground, people. If you voted for them, repent for voting for them, God's going to do anything against you. You thought you were doing the right thing because of the whichever side you thought you were on. I'm on God's side, people. That's the right amount of righteousness, righteousness, justice, liberty, and freedom. That's the side I'm on. And at this moment, it happens to be the right. Yeah. Yeah. It's not that the right is so righteous. It's not that the Republicans are that much more righteous than the Democrats as a whole, but there was a more correct stance against abortion to name the big one, to name the one. Well, I think also a lot of those people did want our country to succeed. Yeah. I mean, they may have attitudes and they may not always be thinking the right thing, but generally most of that side is not going to go ahead and go along with the evil at all. They don't like it. They don't want nothing to do with it. And even major businesses, not talking about, you know, the media and all that, major well-known businesses don't like what's happening because they don't want to lose their business. Right. They don't want to. And even some of those who've remained silent, are you there? The thing you're going to start saying, some who remain silent are about to start speaking up. And are there, have you seen is what got showing you people that were, how do I just ask the question that were, let's say just two years ago, hard core left and they believed everything that was being told to them about the Democratic and the liberal establishment, whatever, who God has been slowly but surely softening. Have you seen some of that? I think it's bringing clarity to their mind about their own life and future is probably what he's been doing. The Holy Spirit can speak to anybody, even if he can speak to people who aren't believers, it doesn't mean he'll live in them, but he certainly can say things to them. Good. And their own angels can say things to them, you know, in their mind, stuff like this, you need to get out of this. This is not going to end well. This is wrong. I think he probably says something. This all is wrong. I'm sure he says that a lot to them, but you're right, Steve. There are people who are secular people and they have decided to change what they're thinking because just themselves looking at their own situation, not really participating in anything, are going to start speaking against what's going on because it's horrible government. It's no government at all. Okay. It's just control. And that's what they want to do is control. They're not even thinking they're happy and they're on the wicked, the wicked in the White House. Let's just say that you're thinking how much money they've gotten, how much control they have, and they're really excited that this whole thing's paying off for them. What they don't know is they're sinking themselves deeper in a pit than they ever knew would happen because those who are controlling don't care about them. And when, if they ever went the way they wanted it to, they would be taken out too. So evil doesn't love anybody. They hate, they kill, steal and destroy. That's what their plan is. That's why that's what looks like it's happening in the White House is because their mind is so seared right now. They can't see what's right, but they themselves can't figure out why isn't this getting better? I mean, literally, as stupid as the things are that they put out there, they can't figure out why, why they're making that happen. They don't think it's them. And it is them because this wasn't happening until that happened. Yeah. Can't live on this. And some people keep saying what God said, he is at his limit, he's at his limit. God does have a limit, people, you remember he did things in the past when he reached, when he was done with the evil and the day thereof, it was dealt with severely. And so I would say, you know, you yourself though, what you can do is give hope to people anywhere in the store, what people talking about, what's going on, it's all going to end wrong. We're all going to hell in a handbasket. It was going to hell in a handbasket, be a big handbasket will be the wicked and evil. Yeah. And I know, I can see it, that there are people that are on that side that will call the wrong side, for lack of a better word, they, they hated Christians, they hated conservative values, they hated anti-abortion, they were pro-choice, and I see some of them watching right now, and they're now waking up, they're going, what have I done? But now look what I've done, how do I get out of this now that I've made my bed, you know, the expression, you've made your bed, now you've got to lie on it. What would you say to some of those people who are waking up and then going, what have I done? What would you say to them? I would say you need to repent to God. Okay. I mean, you repent to Jesus Christ, you know, if you ever belong to Him, the things that are going on now, they are not Him, this is not His plan, He comes to bring a life and life more abundantly, where do you see abundant life? Have you produced abundant life, are they talking about having abundant life? I'm talking about the government, the illegitimate government, okay? No, because they don't care what happens to anybody, they're going to use and control, use and control, until there's no more use and control, and if you have voted for them, or you're still siding with them, or you're helping to promote them, I would really seriously ask you to just repent for all the stuff you've been involved with, to lose all the evil wickedness out of your soul, repent to God, and tell Him you want to be with Him on His side, you want Jesus Christ as your savior, and joy will flood your soul, and guess what, your eyes will be fully open to the darkness trying to take over not just this country, but the whole world, and that won't happen until the perilous times come, and the perilous times, this is not the perilous times, I know people think it is, but it's not. I've seen some of the perilous times, I've seen some of the tribulation, I've seen some of Christ sitting on the throne in Jerusalem, I've seen part of the millennial, whether you like that word or not, the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ, which by the way the Father said, you're not going to stop that from happening either, so stop taking it out of the Bible. Let me, let me, you know, Kat, you know me, I don't ever interrupt in the middle of the show to, to pray, or almost never, because I've got, you know, we're, we're getting through it, but I feel led right now, there's people watching, and they're going, what have I done, I voted the wrong, I'm looking around, it's all falling apart, I voted for this, I wish I knew how to repent, could you pray for those people right now, because there's a bunch of them, and they're going, all I just, just need is someone pray and tell me how to get out of this. Yeah, like I said, the first thing that I would do is lead you in a prayer of repentance, because when you've done wrong, and when you side with absolute evil, and I tell you, even probably 13-year-olds, 10-year-olds know that what's being said is wrong, I mean, children know it's wrong, and when you have the heart of a child, there's no evil in them, there's nothing that, that you know that, that they've had, been taken care of, they've been loved their whole life, but they can look around, they listen to anything on the news, they know that there's a mess going on, and they know that darkness, they know what evil is, my grandkids know what evil is, okay, they're young, but they know what it is, and so if you're finally gonna wake up, because I know God is shaking some people right now to wake you up, okay, he doesn't want you to lose what he's got planned for you, he doesn't want you to miss your destiny, Satan wants to steal and crush your destiny, so right now we say, I say, we would just say this together, Father, I choose with my will, to repent of all evil, to repent of being involved in voting for evil, to repent in being involved in voting for evil, I change my heart this day, I change my heart to say, and choose with my will, and choose with my will, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, I receive his will, I receive his will, his way, his way, I want his plans for this country, I want his plans for this country, and for my life, and for my life, I evict all evil and wickedness, all wicked and evil and deceiving words, they were spoken over the fake news, they were spoken over the fake news, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White House, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White House, I will lose all of them for my soul, I will live according to the Word of God, I invite Christ to abide in me i want to hear his voice i want to hear His voice i want to walk in the Spirit not to walk in the Spirit and not the flesh and not the flesh I choose to bind to my soul I choose to bind to my soul the love of God the presence of God the presence of God the life of God the life of God His will his will, his way, his expectation, his expectation of greatness, of greatness, and righteousness, and righteousness to be in this earth, to be in this earth, in Jesus name, in Jesus name, this day, this day, I step into a new place, I step into a new place, and I step out of the darkness, I step out of the darkness, I now serve the Most High God, I now serve the Most High God, I will not serve another, I will not serve another, amen, amen, very, very powerful, a lot of people got touched, a lot of people, wow, so yeah, hey, you know what, some of you watching, be sure you send this program to friends of yours, because there's some people that they're like right on the edge, and they just, you know, that you've seen them beginning to waffle about what they have believed, send this broadcast to them, forward it to them, or give them the link either way to do that, so that'd be awesome, awesome, well, you know, we have time for a few questions, anything else you want to say before we do that? Well, I do have a question to answer that someone has given me some time ago, I didn't get to answer it, they asked me, what role does Melchizedek play in our lives? Okay. Well, Melchizedek is a real being, he's not a human who died and moved to heaven, and the Bible says Melchizedek has no father, no mother, no beginning or end, which means he has always been with the father, and actually, Melchizedek is the father's personal high priest, Jesus Christ is our personal high priest, but the father is, he has Melchizedek who is sent to the earth on different assignments, at one point he was the king of Salem, he's one who received tithes, you know, when the tithes were being paid for the first time, he was on the earth, he received the tithes, Melchizedek has flesh, he's always had flesh, there's a whole tribe of angels made after the order of Melchizedek, which means they had flesh put on them, probably before we were born, I love the way the father says though, about any of the angelic tribes or the host army, he said, yes, they were made before we came, but we existed before they were made, because we lived in him, and so that's who Melchizedek is, and I know, is that a storm warning, Jen? Okay, I take power over all the part of the enemy trying to control this storm overhead of us right now, and I command the host to have them get up there and shred that storm, I refuse and review all strong winds, there'll be no tornadoes in this area, no flooding in this area, I'm over the weather, now under the weather, and I say, get out of this city in Jesus name, you will bring rain and nourishing rain, no lightning strikes, keep it in the sky, and get out of here in Jesus name, amen. Praise God, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, so again, I don't know if I did, did you have a little, I can't remember if we interrupted your flow with that, did you, did we get it? Melchizedek, yeah, a lot of people, they assumed that he was like one of Adam's sons, or they say that he was someone else who died that lived on the earth, but clearly the word doesn't say that, they can't figure out who he is, there are some of the living creatures have always, always been with the father, he didn't make them one day because he thought about it was a good thing, they've just always been with him, there's no way really to get people to understand the father has always existed, he carries time inside of him, and so that's why he's the only one that knows when Christ will return, nobody knows with the father, because he carries time, he didn't appear somewhere in time, so he's always assisted the living creatures have, the 24 elders have always existed, they're spiritual beings that serve him in heaven and all around heaven, they're not people, they're not the 12 tribes of Israel, they're not the 12 apostles, I've seen Peter Paul, I've seen John in heaven, they're not sitting there with a crown around the throne of God, so those are spiritual beings, of course Melchizedek would also be there, and people just picture nothing ever existed, there was a time when nothing existed, that's not true, before time was, the father was, the word was, which is Jesus Christ, holy spirit has always existed, but along with them would be Melchizedek, the 24 elders, the seven spirits of God, which are also seven personal spirits that serve the father, so that's a little bit of understanding and revelation for you for this question about Melchizedek, so he's always been, he was sent to the earth on assignment, and so anyway, I think that was the most important one, so if you have some questions you can go ahead. Yeah, okay, so yeah, we're going into questions about heaven or important truth, so Daniel is a six-year-old, he wants to know do we pray in heaven, I think he means either if we died and went now, or later on when it all goes, when we're all in heaven, do people pray or do we pray in heaven when we, when we go? I know one place that they, that they do make decorations and pray, it talks about the, this talks about in the Bible the souls under the altar of God, who pray and declare before the throne, and I always pictured like an altar, like you know, if you were to do into a traditional charismatic church or probably even other churches, they always had an altar down front that was maybe six inches off the floor, and people go down there to repent and do other things, they serve communion there, but that's not the way it is in the throne, the throne is a whole structure, you can actually walk underneath the throne of God, and really massive altar, many people go under there and they declare over their families, they also say things to God, not that they can't go up to a stone and say it, but sometimes they just want to do it personally or whatever, so that that's one example that yes, there are people who declare and who do pray in heaven for things going on on the earth, you know, and usually though, it's in the throne room and there's this huge room underneath the throne of God, the throne is high and lifted up, so nobody's mushed down or flattened down, so yeah, there's places in heaven, they'll go to the portal, which has been made, they're all over heaven, people go there to watch their family's lives, they can celebrate with them and different things in their life, they go there every year on your birthday and sing happy birthday to you, they don't miss you getting born again, they don't miss anything important like your weddings, your babies being born, people go to these places and they will declare blessings over you, they'll declare things over your life from heaven, so they don't ever stop thinking about us here on the earth. And when you say they declare that, that's kind of the same thing as prayer, right? It is prayer, except they know what's going to happen. They know it's going to happen. What about that, you know, you talked about under the throne, there is that scripture that says they were under the throne, it almost seems like it uses the word martyr in it, and they say to the Lord, how long till you, and I think they say, Kat, you know this better than 90, how long till you avenge our blood, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, what's the deal with that, since there's no time in heaven, why are they in heaven saying how long till you get this I think you're not talking about like a date or a time, I'm talking, they're talking about like a season. There is going to be a season where a lot of that will happen, things that were done to certain groups of people and stuff like that, there will be a retribution brought for those people, because he wouldn't have made that place for them to go and declare that. So there are several different rooms underneath his throne, it's just, it's huge, I can't even explain or give it a measurement, but there are different people down there or groups of people down there, and there are, there are some of the martyrs, I'm not saying every martyr, there are some of the martyrs who really want for the father to redeem their life on the earth by bringing justice for what happened to them, and I'm sure that he will bring justice whenever he is, whenever he does that, it will happen, and it may be more towards the end than now, but he's not having them down there just saying that for no reason, is it hard to say it, he's going to let them say it, so I'm glad that he's going in the throne and that you see visibly when you go in there, but then there's some underneath the throne of God, where people are declaring, it says if you declare and decree a thing, it shall be established, doesn't it? A decree and a declaration is that you have a face to believe it's going to happen, it's something I will do. I was in Paris years ago and we stood underneath the Eiffel Tower, and the Eiffel Tower goes forever and ever, but you can walk underneath it because there's the post, so is that kind of what you mean? In other words, the Lord is high and lifted up, sort of like you might say the Eiffel Tower is way up there, but you can still stand underneath it and see its legs or its foundations, is it kind of like that when you say it's under the throne? Well, let's just say the throne is 80 feet high, I'm not saying it is, it is very high and lifted up because if there's not just steps, there's like there's steps, then there's columns, then there's a platform, then there's steps, that they can go up to the throne, but these are actually more private places, I don't think people see it underneath the steps and you can actually see the people, there's places where they go just to talk to God and pray and declare things, but there's people sitting on the steps sometimes, usually gifts on the steps, like people will leave flowers, Christ loves flowers, I didn't know that, sometimes you'll see desserts, because Christ loves green that's good, you know that's helpful because you know you think of the throne is high and lifted up and there's you know there's training fields of temple and all these different things, but you're saying, oh there's thunder and lightning in the throne room, trust me, people run to get struck by that lightning, it's like a myth, there's a lot of love, so there is all of that that talks about in the Bible, the living creatures are as high as the throne, I mean they're really really big and they have eyes in the front of their bodies and their heads everywhere, and they're always declaring over the over those, over those Father, Son, Holy Spirit, you know in heaven, obviously you're perfectly healthy, emotionally, spiritually, physically, no pain and all that, and yet, because I've thought about this many many times, if there's something that God gives you to drink from the throne, from the rivers of life, from the throne, the water that comes from under, however that goes, it seems like it would be hard to be edified more because you're perfectly edified, how, what would you describe as, have you been there and felt the feeling as it goes into war, how is it that that feeling is better than when you're already perfect? Well, it depends on, there's so much activity in the throne, depending on when you, when you're there, I mean you could be caught up maybe five times in your lifetime and see the throne will be there, but there's so much other activity, sometimes the river of life flows from him sitting on the throne, it comes all the way down the steps, people actually will lay on the steps and drink that, and then sometimes he'll open throughout the whole throne room and be like it runs through the whole throne room, then out into the city streets, depending on whatever he, whatever his purpose is for that, but I've been there seeing people actually drinking it as it's life, it's just, it's just, it's, it's, I can't explain it, it's like the greatest love you ever felt in your life and you just can't ever get enough of him, that's why Christ said, Christ loved his father so much, he was so happy when he got to leave hell and you know, came up and he was glorified and appeared back before his father, he was so happy when he was joined back to his father, but, but people who go there are undone, there's just so many things going on, but his presence is everywhere, but when you're there with him, is that you either watch a concert or you're in it, it's the same thing in the throne room, it's greater, the greater or the even the experience of it is greater when you're there in person, then just maybe seeing it from where your mansion is or being around heaven, but you're never away from his presence, but when you're there, a lot of people do, I keep watching the angels, I got to stop them. Well, you know, I was going to ask you that, Kat, because I thought you're watching, so I was about to ask you, what are you watching, because I've never seen you look up while you're describing it and you just can't watch it. There's an over top of me right now. Wow, because it was very clear to anyone watching that you were watching something, and so, what else can you say about what you're watching? I'm just watching, I'm watching part of the activity at the throne right now, and people are laying on the steps and the river pours over them, in them, through them, a lot of people just want to drink it, and it just makes you fall in love even more with the Father, and people love to be in the throne, and then the celebration, and you hear the voice of the living creatures in the whole stone room shakes, it shakes, and the seraphim dipping down out of the glory cloud, there actually is a real glory cloud that stays permanently around the throne, a little bit above the throne, and the seraphim live there, they live in that glory cloud, and they've been with him so long that their hair, long hair looks like blue fire, and just watching them dipping down over the throne, declaring over the Father and over the Son, it's amazing, I don't feel sorry for anyone who goes to heaven, I'm rejoicing with them, I'm celebrating with them, and don't ever feel like you've lost your family members if you belong to Christ, you will never lose them, they moved to heaven for a while, and then you will all be back together again one day, and all the things that happened to them in heaven, they'll be sharing them with you, they'll take you places to see in heaven, I just had someone just say to me, I know that my sister's up there, and I know that she's making a list of places to take me, and they had not even been to heaven, I said you're absolutely right, that's exactly what they're doing, they're not up there enjoying their life while everyone's suffering down here either, they know, all of heaven knows what is about to happen down here on this earth, they know the glory is going to engulf this earth, that people will actually carry it and release it everywhere around the world, they know the baptism in fire is going to be happening, they know that this earth for quite a while will be so filled with God, that's why there will be such a mass, the mass harvest at the end will be so huge, because of the glory, the love, the life of God, we will as manifested sons and daughters actually demonstrate the power of the living God to the people of this earth, either by rescuing things or changing things or commanding things that he tells us to say, you'll see it with your eyes, you'll literally see heaven activity with your eyes on this earth, and that's what's being set up, he's going to remove a lot of the evil on purpose, so justice is going to happen, there's no man greater than God, no devil more powerful than God that can stop any of that from happening, so I'm just celebrating my life all the time, I know I have expectancy in my heart, I don't have fear in my heart at all, I know who holds me in his hand, I know what his plans are and you can know too, because these are great days you're ending into, your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great grandchildren know they're probably adding up those years, don't try to, I don't ever try to add up the years, okay, I know God's going to do what's on his timeline, I know the greatness that's being sent to the earth, the babies being born right now are some of the greatest, the greatest prophets on the earth, some of the greatest apostles on the earth, the healings are going to be so miraculous that begin to happen, that's something else that's going to start happening, miraculous healings, regardless of what's going on around, the Bible says God sets a table that's his presence, his power, his joy, and his supply, even in the presence of darkness he's going to do that on purpose, I think that also is about to start happening. I need, I want to ask you, you said something a minute ago, I do not want that to pass because I think people would want to want you to say, this is what I meant by what I just said, you said a minute ago that they aren't, I may not quote this exactly, you said they're not out there enjoying their life while you're suffering on earth, what are you trying to communicate? I shouldn't explain to some people who don't really know God, they don't know Christ, they think he doesn't care, they don't care, and they don't see what's happening, that they want to happen, they want things to happen right now, I understand that's how you feel, but when God has a plan, if he's going to expose evil it's going to be done in this time, this would be the greatest exposure of evil on the years until the perilous times start happening and they're probably close, I can't even say a year, I know I've been taking 150 years in the future and guess what, there have been no perilous times of tribulation at that time. But our loved ones are in heaven enjoying their life, they're enjoying their life, and they're decreeing and everything, even while we are suffering. They're decreeing and declaring for God to intervene on your behalf, that you will not miss your destiny, a lot of them are after saying God, I declare they will not miss your destiny, they'll fulfill what you sent them for, that my heart is for them, that I'm up here declaring over them, I have expectancy for what you're about to do in the earth, this is them speaking to the Father about their loved ones on earth. Okay, good, good, good, I want to make sure we clear that. All right, Audrey asked, has Kat Siener interacted with John the Baptist, what is his appearance now on earth, he wore clothes made of camels here, also any idea what John the Baptist does in heaven? John the Baptist is sharing things that happened when he was on the earth, but with revelation of what happened in the spirit realm, everyone who goes to heaven, you will go and see what was going on around your life that God was doing, the things he was doing behind the scenes, the things that he did that you didn't know about, and even the apostles and the disciples all got to see that about their life, some every now and then would see angels or something like that, but their whole life lived out on this earth, when they tell their stories now, they can include, but God did this, God was doing this, and it just makes it even greater, more personal for them to share, so all those people are sharing the experiences and things that happen on the earth, but with revelation about them, that's what they're doing. And John the Baptist, his, as far as- Not wearing camels here, people. He's not wearing camels, and as far as we know, as far as we're told, his only gift was teaching and declaring, but does he, I mean, would John, even someone like John the Baptist have a hobby, a fun thing that he would do, would even he have a gift that would be different than declaring? I'm sure he probably would, it probably was something to do with the nature, maybe, because, you know, he was kept in the wilderness, isn't always being just desert, I'm sure there was maybe forest or something around him, and he loved that kind of thing, I know he didn't have a lot of time, he actually didn't hear God a lot, he had him on the back side of the desert, he would share with him things that would happen, and I can tell you this, those who told or shared, if they shared a lot in their life on the earth, they're going to share more things that they found out when they got to heaven, like I was just saying, but John is not wearing camel hair, okay, you don't wish he'd taken a bath five times, but when he was down on the earth, he was not the neatest person, I'm sure he was clean in all the other ways, but the camel hair he wore, because he had such revelation given to him, there was ways God would humble prophets, he was a prophet, Jesus called him a prophet, he also is Christ, he says, you know, he's his cousin, they hang out a lot, I see John the Baptist a lot with Christ, they were cousins on the earth, and I think he also liked sweets, I know that sounds wild, but he ate locust and honey, he loved honey, Christ loved honey, he ate it all the time, and it says in the Bible that he did like it, so I just see them a lot together in heaven, because they were related on the earth, and I can tell you this, John is not wearing camel hair, and the camel hair he wore was inside out, if you have never pet a camel, if you go to Israel, if there's a hand over there, ask him, can you touch the camel, and run your hand across that hair, man, I'm telling you, it's like little mini spikes, he wore that against his skin, it was to keep him humble, that's why he did it, it was to remind him who he was, and who God was, and you know, there was things God did to the prophets, so they wouldn't think of themselves above measure, mine is pink hair, I'll just tell you right now, I was not a pink hair person, I forget it's pink, I right now can't see my hair, and that was to separate me and make me, God wants people to notice me, okay, he wanted people to notice John Baptist, when it was his time to speak, he wanted him to look different, be different, and sound different, and I had to experience the same thing, although today it's pink hair instead of camel hair, I'm very grateful. So good, so good, I'm trying to decide which of these, because we're running out of time, so this person's saying, what do the evangelists do in heaven since their duty on earth was so winning, obviously there's no soul winning, do evangelists just have their own individual gifts, is that the point? I think some of them did, and well we know, we know that Paul did, Paul had great gifts, he worked with fabrics, he made beautiful things out of fabrics, it was a gift, and it was how he supported his ministries, how he supported himself, and people came from everywhere to buy those things, I'm sure he made robes, and scarves, and all kinds of things, beautiful things with fabrics, it does mention that in the Bible, and I'm sure when when he gets time, he probably still does, still does that, but I think that was Paul. Yeah, there you go, the best of the best. The Holy Spirit's like, excuse me, but we all know that God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest he had to put hair on, so yeah, I just love Holy Spirit though, he has no problem, you know, correcting me in the middle of everything, Paul worked with fabrics, and he did that, and he was very good at that, Paul, I'll tell you what, I see Paul quite often, he's always in the gardens, outside the throne room, there's beautiful gardens, and people come there to see him, they want to know what did you feel like when this happened, what did you think when this happened, see, is people asking questions more than anything else, and people, and of course they're going to share, so they share, they still share a lot, but they have things they like to do, some of them like to work with, some some of them like to cook or bake, some of them like to make things with their hands, I know that there were other of the disciples like Peter is still fishing, that was his gift, he fished, he fished before he became a disciple, and he fishes now in heaven, people can go fishing with him, my husband said he's going to be his new best friend just in case you wondered, and this has to be catch and release, right, this has to be catch and release because unless you get caught, unless you get, because you said they play tag or something, I don't know how you worded that, yeah, they do, and well you know I already said the creatures all talk to you, and that is no different with the fish you're trying to catch or the bull you're trying to ride in the rodeos, and someone will probably slam me for that, get over it when you get there, you want to ride one, and I'll forgive you for it, but but the creatures all talk, they have a voice, they talk to your pets, they'll talk to you a lot, I love that, it will be nice, and we just sent our mama cat went home to heaven the other day, oh wow, yeah, and this is just not strange, but just like God, my mom has a pet dog out in Arizona where she would visit her mom to her mom went home to heaven, her brother went home to heaven, but she has a pet dog out there, the same day that the mama cat went to heaven, her dog in Arizona went to heaven, oh my goodness, yeah that's not a coincidence is it, it's not a coincidence, it's not, it's not, and for anyone that's new, of course I think our poor family, we had lots and lots and lots of pets, a horse, two miniature donkeys, four dogs at one point, but a zillion's a cat, so those animals will be dispersed among family members I'm thinking, but every single pet is in heaven, and we all, there are pets right, yes, you have a big enough place for them to be in though, it's good that we're going to need acreage for that, so you'll need, you do get acreage, trust me you can have acreage, but by this time they've already made, by this time Steve they've already made friends, so they'll probably bring their friends over too, oh that'd be good, grandkids and pets, people go, you know what, they think of just nuts the way I top it, you know what, God is holy and powerful and so captivating, to be in front of the power that he carries and see him demonstrate it, but the love he has, he is love, I know Christ is love, I know that, but so is the father, you have to see that he is number one, a father with lots of children, when you come home to heaven, you come home, let's say you're married, you don't go home as husband and wife, you go home as god's son and god's daughter, you get your own mansion, it can be right next to each other, there's no problem with visiting or anything, but he, he is a father, is going to provide a place for you, and he made fun places on purpose because if you picture yourself as a dad, and let's say you have four kids, if you didn't have some way for them to have fun, you would really be. Now cat just froze on my screen folks, is it frozen on anyone else's screen? I'm listening to my staff, it's frozen on my screen, yes it's frozen, do you want to try and boot her out and have her come back? Well that was a new, we don't, that doesn't usually happen with cat, so could be the storm there, yeah they could be having a storm, so we'll see if we get her back, it's kind of at the end, if you guys are willing, want to just dismiss her, that's okay too because we're kind of at the time, if you say go ahead and, and Steve will say goodbye, just kind of let me know what to do, if anyone wants to tell me what to do. Texting chins, yeah you know I was talked about my own, my daughter had a cat, Ebony, he's a black cat, he was a black cat and he got sicker and sicker, and I was dying at the time, I was under 100 pounds, some of you have heard me tell that story, it was very near death and she was dying, and I didn't, it's not that I sat there thinking I'm dying, I knew I was very very sick and they hadn't figured out what's wrong with me, now, it'd be nice to have closer to that, under 100 pounds, but I, I remember talking to Ebony and I'd say someday, because I knew she was not going to be here really, so I was laying on the couch, sick sick, everyone's gone, Ebony's on the chair and I said someday in heaven, you and I, we're going to talk, oh their internet went out, he says they will try one more time, but I said someday you and I are going to have a conversation about all of all this, and I felt like honestly that I was communicating with Ebony a boy cat, he was a beautiful cat, but you know, because as he got sick and sicker, he couldn't clean himself, so he then became a beautiful dirty cat, but you know, it'll be fun to see what happened to Ebony and try and talk with him and say, do you remember that? That's what I think I see myself saying is to the pets, I'll say, do you remember when, if God gives me that memory, so, but we had so many cats, we were cat people and so now we've had a lot of dogs, so, well, you know what guys, it's 10 44, it went long and if they're still trying, I think probably this is a good time to dismiss it, it was a great, great show, we got good, good answers, so I'm going to go ahead and say to the people, thank you so much for the show, tomorrow we have Patel Patriot, who talked a lot about devolution, not evolution, but devolution, which has to do with the president redistributing authority to those people beneath him, so that the continuity of government can continue, he will talk about devolution and anything else God's put on his heart, he was great, this will be our second time, he's very, very popular on the internet, especially among patriots, so we remember that, so Patel Patriot will be tomorrow, it will be very, very, very good, so be sure and tell your friends, we will be, until further notice, we'll be on rumble only and when I say rumble only, I mean rumble and Facebook and theeligialist.com, just not YouTube, so with that, have a great day everyone, God bless you and we will see you again tomorrow, same time, bye bye. you

Well, happy Wednesday, September 7. We're recording this on Tuesday, September 6. So not to confuse you with the date is off behind us. I'm just changing a couple of things so this doesn't blink on us. Anyway, welcome to the broadcast. This is our second show today because we're recording this on Tuesday for Wednesday. So it's gonna be a great show with Kat. We just had a good one with Johnny, which you will have seen by the time you see this. But anyway, I just had a really neat time talking with Kat's mom. We need to have her. I can't remember her first name, but we're gonna have her on with Kat one of these times and get some of that wisdom from her. But anyway, without further delay, let's go ahead and watch Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. There she is. There's our lady. Your mom said the pink lady has arrived. So I just had a really nice chat with your mom sitting in your chair. So that was a delight. I haven't seen her since the cruise. We were on, I think so. Well, it's been a while. Yeah, it's been a while. So tell us about the clothes you're wearing. Cause you said there's something special about what you're wearing. Well, this shirt right here, we have our own women. We have a women's group and a men's group. The women's group is called Wonder Women, Doing Signs and Wonders. Awesome. And this is actually, this is the logo we made for it. It looks crooked on the camera, I don't know why, but it's not crooked. Anyway, it's a W and it's got purple and silver in it. But that's what it says. It says right here, Wonder Women, Doing Signs and Wonders. And there's some of the most powerful meetings we have. We probably have close to 800 women, maybe a thousand women come from all over the world. I think 30 countries came the last time. And I'm telling you what, they had no problem ruling, sending the host or anything. It's a really powerful event when we have it. The men is called the Dread Champions because hell will dread them. I love that. Hey, can women order that shirt? Is that for sale on your site? I would say it will be very soon. I'm just kind of showing you, this is the one that we had the last time that we, you know, we didn't have a Wonder Women meeting. It's been two years, but we're going to have a Heaven's invitation, which is our premier annual event we have. And we are going to have Wonder Women, a separate meeting. I don't have dates for those yet, but we'll get them as soon as we can. But yes, this is the symbol. We have a different color, some of the different colors and everything in it. But the women have a powerful time when they do come. And then the men, we actually bring a prophet over from England, who speaks with my husband. And they said, I still speak. I still speak, people still want me to speak. So I still speak to all the men, but my husband and Nick, they have powerful, I forgot what they call it. Respiratory or what? Workshops. Okay. Two, two-hour workshops during that event. And then my son-in-law opens for me, that would be Ben, the megamarked canvas that God calls a couple very fierce against the darkness. He opens my meeting every time I speak at the men's meeting, but then I finish it off. So you're going to get a lot, man, when we, you should be getting an email soon, because we're finally, now that we're moving though, we'll probably wait until the office moves to do that. So we're really going to get all of our emails started. We've already designed one for Wonder Women, one for Dread Champions, one for the host. We're going to have the Guardian Zone, and we're going to have a spirit force. I think spirit force, we may already have that one. So we are going to really go into high gear. Once we get into our offices, probably this year, or maybe the first part of next year, everyone else would say this year, please. Yeah. Wonder Women logo. And usually what we do, because when the daughters of God meet, he wants them to enjoy themselves too. We have powerful, a powerful event. We have activation, we have training, but we also do something fun. We actually, we actually get one of these, a lot, like a human size, big camera things, and we go, I'll take pictures together. And I know that may not mean much to some of you, but it's really a memory of the power of God and the life of God that you experienced at our meetings. And so we do that, and everybody has one to take home with them. It's really an awesome time. We have a luncheon too, so I can't wait to have that again. But right now, I'm heading to Colorado. You know, tomorrow, I'll be in Colorado. And then after that, I'll be, of course, in Nebraska. Are those venues full, or can people still come to the one in Colorado? I think the one in Colorado is totally full, except Saturday and Sunday. It's a women's event. It's their women's meeting. It's activation, not activation. Jen, what is the name of the event? Gateway on Mount Zion. What, again? Gateway. Gateway on Mount Zion. I'm so focused on even going. Gateway on Mount Zion is in Golden, Colorado, mile high in the sky. The women's thing is full. That's at Copper Mountain. But Saturday night, this Saturday night, and this Sunday, this Sunday morning, they're having, I will be speaking, both meetings in Colorado at that place in Golden, Colorado. There's a sanctuary where they got burnt. Oh, my goodness. But they have a huge tent outside. So it'll be outside. It's probably going to be in the 50s at night, so that might be enjoyable for everybody. This Saturday night, I'll be speaking there and this Sunday, and that is still open to people to come. Nebraska, I think they still have some seats left. It holds 9,000 people. I'm sure that they opened the heavenlies with Hank Kooniman. Wow. The event. I think they definitely still have some seats there. And I don't think it costs anything to come, but you have to register. So definitely go on Lord of Host and register for that event. That would be the 15th, I think, right, Jen? Is it 15? Yes. His mission is called Lord of Host Church, right? And he's in the- Lord of Host Church, yes. And he is in Omaha. Omaha, Nebraska. A couple miles down the street is the Mid-America Center, which is where they're holding it, it's being held there. And it's going to be huge. It's the 15th. 15, 16, 17, 18. Is that it? Well, the conference is the 15th, 16th, and 17th. And they're going to have Flashpoint Live there. They'll have Flashpoint Live on Thursday, I think, right? And then even Rod Parsley's coming to be one of the keynote speakers. Wow. He definitely does not believe us. The end right now, he's a powerful, live integrity man of God. And guess what? Well, King Christmas, I think, will speak that day also. And Phil Driscoll is coming to play his trumpet. Oh, man, I love that trumpet. He is amazing. I listened to him play live one time. Yes. And it's the only time, listen to this, it's the only time that I've ever listened to music when only the music, without words, obviously, all of a sudden, tears are streaming down. And it was like, it just completely overcame me. Heaven shows up. I know, I know he has family here. And I know them really well. And I'm telling you that man has never stopped for years. He's so powerful in the spirit. But he'll be playing, I know, for Rod Parsley's meeting, and maybe the one before that, he'll be playing, I think, that's Friday, Friday night. Saturday will be Brenda Kahneman. And then me, I'm speaking, Robin Bullock is speaking. And then Hank Kahneman speaking. Oh, my goodness. It's going to be a powerful time. That's amazing. And people can still get into that, you think. Yes, I'm pretty sure they can. And then Sunday is just their church, but I think they're holding their church there, I think. I'm not sure. But I think Sammy Rodriguez is going to be doing Sunday service. And man, he's going to knock it out of the bar, I can tell you. So it's going to be a very God, very, very prophet-oriented things from God with those powerful prophets all being together. And as far as you know, Kat, is he streaming that live as well, do you know? Will people be able to watch it online? I think you can sign up for the streaming, but you can check that out on Lord of Host in Omaha, Nebraska, that's his website, I think. But as of today, they have some seats left in the auditorium. Like I said, it holds 9,000 people. We're bringing 17 members just so we can have our products table. Geez, wow. There'll be so many people coming. And so I'm excited about what God's going to say. It is going to be life-changing. Well, I hope I know you guys will have it on tape. If there's something that ends up being recorded, maybe we can play a clip or something next time around there. I think that same weekend, I'm going to be reawaken America with Clay Clark and all of those. A lot of people, it's like a combination of they're all conservative, they're all patriots, but some are saved, some are not saved. And so there's a lot of evangelism that goes where Robin Bullock was there last time he didn't speak, but Amanda Grace goes every single time virtually. So this will be my second time at the reawaken. It's quite a patriot event. So that'll be fun. That's up in the Spokane area. I think it's very inspiring. I'm telling you, people, there are things that are going to be happening in this country. And I'm sure that you're going to find out some of that at that meeting, the men that Steve will be at. I know you'll hear a lot of that, too, where we're going to be, because I know the heart of Hank Kahneman and Robin Bullock has told me on what God is doing right now. And I know that's what their event with the Patriots is going to be just like that. But from the patriot point of view, this country wouldn't be anything without the Patriots. The Patriots stood in the beginning for this country, the freedom, and they're still standing for the freedom of this country. So awesome. It was an exciting time to be alive, and it really, really is exciting. Well, listen, while we're talking about jump off and share anything else you want to share, we'll have questions about heaven and things, but anything you want to share before we do that. We only have an hour today, because this is my second show. My in-laws are going to walk through the door, or my in-laws, so they'll be fun. The two boys are very rambunctious, so they'll come in. And so at that point, we may not be able to hear each other, so anyway, anything else that's on your heart about what's going on? I just know last night in the nighttime, I kept hearing the father saying to me that something was going to happen very soon. And normally, he doesn't speak to me like at night when I'm already in my bed, but I was still awake. And so I guess he decided to take advantage of that. I just saw him moving his hand over this country. Really? He didn't let me see what he was doing, but he was doing something. I'll tell you, I know that he said on purpose when I hit the gavel that last week, the gavel when it was hit, he said, justice was released then, and certain things are going to start happening very powerfully around this nation, and even overseas, that regards this country. And yes, he does love this world, and he has a lot of plans for this world, and his plans count, not the devil's plans. And we are going to see so much exposure. I know that's going to start happening. Like I already had said, there's going to be a couple of people die that are doing wicked evil stuff. I don't know who those people are. I do know that they will actually drop dead. And when that happens, you're going to know something significant is about to happen. How about that for a sign? That I want them to die, but these are God's plans. This is his world. He has plans for it. He's not allowing evil to take over, in case you wondered. He's not allowing it to happen. So all the things that have been said, this is what it's going to be. This is a new norm. No, it's not. Hell's trying to make it their new norm. They don't get a voice. They don't have a voice. They don't have authority. They don't have permission. They have nothing. They don't have anything to stand on. And even their foundation is crumbling. They've already been building. It's done cheaply. It's done with no intelligence whatsoever involved in it. You should know that by the reports coming up from Washington DC. I can just say, our lives are in God's hands. Our lives are going to be great, powerful, and amazing. That's what God has plans for all of us. So any of these events you can make it to, just make sure you stay tuned into Holy Spirit, if you can hear him. And if you don't have him, you should invite him inside of you, because let me tell you, he'll talk to you out here, or he'll talk to you in here. And then he never stops talking to me. So he's like coming into, I don't call them days of horror, or terror, or loss of everything. That's not going to happen. This is not the tribulation, people. The devil gets a couple of years for that, and it's not right now. And he knows it. And I tell you, I got a text saying that the left is threatening, saying that we should all be scared. I think they are the ones who should be scared, because the God of heaven and earth knows exactly what's going on, and he's going to do what he wants to in this time. So start thanking him for that. Yeah, I heard a major ministry got kicked off completely off of YouTube, and they keep trying to take more of us out. We have two strikes against us, but I don't have a lot of fear. We're on rumble. We may or may not be on YouTube for long. I think they're gunning for most of us, but their time is coming. Whoever's doing this stuff. They're afraid. Yeah, they're freaking out. They think if they don't get rid of us, the plan will fail. But God's not going anywhere, people. And he's the one in charge. And we all know he holds the air we breathe. Yeah, he does. And he should not have fear anywhere in you. I almost wore a shirt that said, don't let fear interfere, which is something Holy Spirit is always having me tell people. Do not let fear interfere in your life. Don't forget that. These are days of wonder and splendor and God's power in this earth. Well, and I think you were the first one that I heard. It was 2012, I believe, when God said, talk with you about let the show begin, was it 2012? It was pretty close to 2012. I think it may have been a little bit before that, because it's when the first elections were starting. The first elections that was won, actually won, and he got his seat. But I do know, let the show begin, was God knowing all this was going to happen. It was said before these days were in, it was before 2019, 2018, 17, God actually had me say, let the show begin, and guess what? He was talking about his show, not the evil show. Yeah, and back then we knew nothing. I remember you were, when you first said that, none of this stuff had happened yet. The selection hadn't been stolen, nothing had happened. It was just like, I just thought onward and upward. Well, it is onward and upward with God, it always is, but we didn't know what we would have to endure, if for lack of a better word for it. We didn't know this whole COVID thing. So God knew what they were up to. He did, he knew before they ever did it. Nothing is hidden, it says in the Bible, nothing is hidden from him. Yeah. And even those who believe he is not, will find out he is. Yeah, these are amazing times. So my wife just walked in and said, hi. She's got a haircut, so she's- Hi. Hi, Noreen. She can't hear you, but she's smiling, so anyway, she just came back because she's got her hair done. She probably didn't like that I had her come on the camera. Yeah, but she's just sweetie. We like to see her though. Yeah, we do like to see her. So, well, let's see, where do we go? Anything else you wanna say before we get into questions? I've got a whole couple of pages of that. I just, I have one, a little boy sent me some time ago. Oh, okay, all right. And I know it's something you have. So, but something very important, a lot of parents don't understand operations of the spirit realm and what certain images mean or even certain movies have things in them. I wanna encourage people to never have your child watch something that has witchcraft in it. Okay, wow, yeah. We know some things are fantasies and some are not fantasies, witches are not fantasies. It's something that's real. They spoke against it in the Bible, said have nothing to do with the necromancer. That is a witchcraft. And they have different levels in that whole area of, there's warlocks, there's wizards. These are dark images. These are dark beings that represent hell. And they've been around since the angels tried to, you know, take over earth when the watcher angels fell and they introduced human sacrifice during that time. This is a long before you were here. And so the dark arts have been around a long time, but there is no good witches. Just so you know, no good witches, no wizards, no warlocks that are good. They're all very evil and wicked. And they do all kinds of horrible things. And so this little boy was serious. He's 10. And he said, he says, I worked for his grandfather. He's the first little boy ties to me. I thought that was awesome. So we get the question, do you think the Habba is good to watch? And Jack, I won't answer that quite clearly. It has, is it wizardry? It has wizardry in it. Now they're showing good wizardry, bad wizardry. There is no such thing. There is no good witchcraft, no good wizard. There isn't, not even the Wizard of Oz. That was a fake, okay? But there's no good witchcraft, no good wizard, no good warlock. They are all evil beings. And I happen to know in that movie, The Hobbit, they have one. So I would say no. I told my grandchildren, no, don't watch that. I told my own children, every younger do not watch that. Why? Because it plants images in your soul as a child to accept the fact that they are good. Yeah. They need to be doing good acts, but they are not good. That's not a good title, or it's not a good position to have. No witchcraft, no wizardry, no warlock, should be on your list to read about or watch. So that's my answer, Jack. Be wise in the spirit. And make sure that you understand what God is against. He knows what is evil and what is not. And like a superhero, that doesn't mean they're evil, okay? But if they have a witch involved, a wizard involved, even though they're doing good things, which is not the truth, do not watch them. So there you go, Jack. Well, yeah, and you know, as a kid, we all watched The Wizard of Oz. I don't know if you did, but we watched it. And there was the white witch, and she was the good witch. And then there was the wicked witch of the East or something. And we always knew that witches weren't good, but at least for the movie's sake, we thought, well, she's nice, she's sweet. The Wizard of Oz, that character was not a real one. He was a carnival man who got caught up and taken to the Land of Oz. That's not like a bad place. But showing people even way back then that there were good witches and bad witches, that part was not real because the witches are always bad. And they know it, they do know it. And so for that reason, I won't even watch that again, not because of the guy who is the carnival guy who gets caught away in the balloon, the air balloon, but because it has as good witch, bad witch. And I'm telling you, that's gonna come to the earth. There'll be a whole group of them saying, look, we're good. You know why? Because the truth is that there is a guy who will be known and nobody will believe the lie, there is no God. That's what's happening right now. God's gonna expose all the darkness and the gray area. There's a gray area that says there is no God. That's gonna be erased. And he told me that himself. People on this earth will know there is a God and they don't want him or there is a God and they're gonna worship him. And he's gonna erase that lie. So they're gonna have to come up with something new to deceive people. And one of the things they will use is that there's good witches and they will on purpose show themselves healing people. All Satan has to do is remove the sickness off of those people because this is his plan to believe the lie that they are good and they are not good. Yeah, so good, it reminds me of anything occultic. I had what I would consider a divine appointment. I was 30 years old at the time because, or 35 because I remember where I lived in Texas. I met a Toys R Us shopping for our kids. They were pretty young back then. And I'm just looking at the aisle and some light. He's like a 10 year old boy, eight to 10. And I clearly didn't work there. I wasn't, didn't have a uniform on. And he says, excuse me, sir. And I said, yeah, what can I do for you? And he goes, I'm looking at this Ouija board. Is this okay? Is this okay? And I said, I said, no, that is not a good thing. I don't even remember what I said, but I said him straight that this was of the dark side and the devil. And he goes, thank you for telling. I mean, can you imagine where that boy might've been heading had God not set that, that divine appointment? When that came out, everybody was pushing it more so you can contact the dead. I mean, this is what they were saying. You can contact the spiritual realm. They didn't mean to make it sound evil. And yeah, I happen to know when people would use those back in the day, when I was growing up, that demons would appear to people and then it would, and I'm not gonna say anything that would make kids want to go get one because you're welcoming and opening yourself up to the darkness. That represents evil all the way. There's nothing good about it. It's something you need to get rid of. If it was in your house, clean your house, open the door and kick out all those evil spirits. Because that is one of the main things that they use to fool children or young people to see something exciting happen. But you don't want to be involved or participate with the darkness. It is not a good thing. Yeah, that was amazing. Follow that one. I'll never forget that. I think, because you pray for divine appointments and this and that, but you're just walking in the toy store and this boy knew something was off about that game and he must've had money in his pocket and he wanted that. He thought to ask, you know, I'd love to know meet that boy in heaven one day and say, what happened after that? You know, you know, when we walked away, he said. All right, well, speaking of kids, I've got a four year old that wants to know, her name is Reagan, his or her. I think it says Reagan. I can't tell if that's a boy or a girl. It says, are there parks with swings in heaven? That's what he or she wants to know. Are there parks with swings? Yes, and when Jen gets her book published, I'm going to have her up her answering questions too, because God has shown her heaven in cartoon form. She's writing books about all the encounters I hadn't had in heaven, but on a child's level. And Jen knows that there's parks in heaven there are. There's all kinds of fun things for children to do and be a part of, but yes, there's parks, like parks you never saw before. They have huge slides coming down out of the sky, like little slides that kids slide on. I think that's probably where the carousel, there's a carousel that has living animals on it. I'm getting ahead of now, Jensen, you're telling me about my book. These animals are like, I'm not kidding. Sharks, unicorns, bears, baby dinosaurs. This carousel is huge, but there's not a pole going up through them. They're just standing on this carousel that's going around and you have the most fun on this carousel in heaven. And so that is part of this park that I saw there. And so it's real exciting. So you're going to love the parks in heaven. They're all over heaven, all different types of them. And so you ask a good question. Is there parks in heaven? Absolutely, yes. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Now this one says, Shannon Ray, I can't tell the age, but she wants to know, is there dancing in heaven and where they use, where they have the use of flags in worship, so flaggers and dancing, I guess, in worship. I have to say, absolutely, yes, I've been to the throne room many times and God loves pageantry, started in heaven. Pageantry started in heaven. They have these huge flags and yes, people actually make them in heaven. That's one of the gifts they have. They make them and they put like lions on them, eagles on them. There's some of the angelic embellished on these flags. And when people run with them in the throne room, they come to life. Like the lions roar off of the flags, okay? I'm talking about like that a lot. Wait, say that again, the lions roar off the flag? Did you just say that? Yeah, the low head will move like this and begin to roar out into the throne room. They can't help it with, you know, there's a father on the throne, there's his son on the throne and they get undone. But yes, that's the difference between heaven and everything is alive in heaven. So this flags and all this beautiful pageantry they have in heaven is something wonderful to see. You can even participate in heaven. And of course they have dancers, they have dancers here on the earth because I'm trying to remember the scripture that I know it's in Psalms. It says that one of the highest levels of worship is dance. It says so. And it says, when they dance and worship, it binds the enemy and fetters of iron. And that is the very scripture that all my daughters lived by. They all are parts of dance come to cushion dance companies. They still do dance, all of them. And it's a very powerful in the spirit and it even does, it does say that scripture so that when you dance and worship, you are binding the enemy that would be Satan and fetters of iron. So good, now you, you're talking about the arts for a minute and I'm trying to remember what you said because you had contrasted this. He said, now and on earth, there's worship other than people do art to the worship. Didn't you contrast that was saying, but in heaven, there's something different about the way that goes down. Do you know what I'm asking? Yes, yes, although totally is, and I was shown this, I was visiting Reading, California, Bethel. I wasn't invited to speak, but I was invited by their intercessors to come and see the healing room they have there. And they had artists, of course, their artists were over on the side and they were playing in worship on the stage. Normally, even at our own meetings, we will do this. We have a powerful worship, but we always invite artists to come, our own artists are there, and they're painting what they're seeing in the spirit during the worship. I've known they've done that several other places too when I've been present at meetings to speak and they'd have artists up there painting in the spirit, what they saw while the people were worshiping. Well, in heaven, it's a little bit different. In heaven, the one who's holding the baton to lead the worshipers is an artist. And they will worship to what the artist is painting. So as the artist is painting, they're painting so that the people like, now if they were on the platform painting now, you and the audience would see the art. That's not in heaven. And heaven is the opposite. The artist is standing with a worship team behind them so they can see what the artist is painting and what they paint. They worship to that. They worship and that's what the music, they're hearing music as the artist is painting, they're hearing sounds and frequencies and instruments. And I told the people at Bethel because I was there and I was watching the artist paint and I saw that going on in the spirit. And I actually told them, they said, if you can tell us something that we haven't heard before that we would be interested in, we'll let you in the room. That's what they said to me. And what I told them was that I said, do you know that when you have artists on the platform painting, the worship team will paint what they're hearing from the art so they let me in right away. And I saw what happening. I said, wow, do you all realize, cause I could see what the artist was painting and went around that side of the stage. When you realize that what they're worshiping and what they're singing is what's on this art coming off this canvas and they got, and then the artist fell out in spirit when I said that. So yeah, so that's one of the ways that things are done differently. They are the ones who lead the worship, the artist with their art creates words, sounds, frequencies and music as they're painting. And that is what they play and sing in heaven. Now you've talked about while we're on the subject, you've talked about, I think there's a scripture that says it'll give you garments of praise for heaviness or something like that. I don't have that memorized. Talk about, cause you've spent a long time since you've mentioned this, what are garments of praise actually in heaven? They really do exist. And we all know that it does talk about them. It talks about them in the Bible. He'll give you garments of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness, I think is what the scripture says. And it's one of the gifts the father gives out himself when you come home to heaven. And people know that I did see Whitney Houston go home to heaven the night before. She's saying in a lounge type area, she's saying with all her soul, yes, Jesus loves me. And when she did, she was receiving Christ the next day she passed away. And I was in another state. I think I was out west on the Western tour. And I was sitting there waiting to speak and I was instantly caught up to heaven. I did not know that she had passed away even. I was caught up to heaven and I was standing near the throne and I saw Whitney Houston up there. And the father was telling her how much you loved her and he thanked her for using her gift on the earth. And he was so pleased that Jesus Christ had her what had walked her up the steps and said, here father, your daughter has come home. I got to see all that. And I don't know what was going on. I know they were worshiping in this meeting that I was gonna be speaking at but I was up in heaven watching this. And the father said to Whitney because you were willing to use the gift I put in you I'm gonna give you one of my own things. One of his own gifts that he had. And he took out this little treasure box. It was the embellishment on it was alive. The colors were moving all over this little treasure box. When he opened it, the color garnet, it was a color. When I saw it come out, it came out like a color and it started squirreling and it became a garnet fabric. And it went all the way around Whitney and became this gown, a beautiful garnet gown. And he said, because daughter, you've been willing to use the gift I put in you. I'm giving you one of my own songs that only I have sung. And Whitney was so undone. She was young, she was beautiful. She's so filled with the light of God. Cause you remember she got saved the night before. And so she had light, the light of God in her and all she did was move her hand and when she moved her hand, the father's song came off of the garment and you heard him singing. Really? His voice? So let me tell you that there's no way you can understand the scope and the beauty and the power of the gifts, the rewards he gives you in heaven. You're going to get rewarded. Okay. If you did things for him, you wouldn't want to stop him. Some people go, well, I don't want any recognition. You don't get a choice because it's him recognizing and honoring what you did on this earth. So everywhere Whitney would go wearing that gown when she chose to wear it. And when she chose to change in her own chambers, it would come off, go back in, I know this later. I found this out later. It went back in the treasure box. Whenever she wanted to wear it, she'd open it and it came out the same way. It would come out with this color, become a fabric weight or she'd walked down the streets of gold. Never she went. People could hear the father singing off of her gown. And the father looked at her and said, this is a garment of praise. Kat, I can hardly contain this. When you said he's thanked because you're willing to use, you were willing to use this gift, was he referring to only the night before that she did that or was he referring to her using her gift during her lifetime? If you even know the answer to that. He meant her using her gift willingly during her lifetime. During her lifetime. Okay, so even when she wasn't saved, she was still, okay. She was using the gift that he put in you. Let me tell you. A lot of people are using the gift God put in them and hopefully they're gonna find that out one day. But he did let her know. She knew God gave her that gift. She knew it. She knew it. And I didn't say she always lived right, but she did create gospel albums with that gift and they're so powerfully, they're anointed that she was anointed to sing and worship. And when God sent her as that little spirit of light and knit her together in her mother's womb at the time of conception, that gift was already in her. When he says, the Bible says, God said, I knit you together in your mother's womb. He's not talking about putting your arms and legs on. We can't make a human spirit people, okay. Our side is creating the flesh side, but there's real no real life in anything until that spirit is attached. Like when God made Adam, when God spoke and the word made Adam and his body was laying there, lifeless, the father leans over because that's where we all came from. We live in him and him, we live, we move, we have our very existence. That's talking about the father and he leans over and breathes from inside himself, Adam's spirit. And he said, he received the spirit of life when he breathed into Adam's nostrils and then Adam became a living soul. That's what the Bible says. He became a living soul because that came from the father. The spirit and the soul came from him. And so that's what he means at the time of conception, that early, when conception takes place, the father sends that little soul, that little spirit and soul and he actually attaches the edit that daughter flesh. And that is when life begins. You know, when you're talking about God gave her that gift, it was a beautiful gift of, you know, she had the gift of music. So God gave her more of the same. There are people that are not singers and they may not even yet be gifted as musicians. And they were usually, let's say, a builder who loves to build, they can't wait to build, they've always built cause they were like the carpenter. Does their gift in heaven relate to that kind of thing? Did they use that kind of gift as well, like building? I think he could still give somebody a garment of praise. It doesn't mean he can't give them one, but for her. For her, that's what he chose for her. And you get more than one gift anyway, but I'm quite sure. I know that the father and the son build our mansion, just so you understand, it says not made by hand. You get a mansion not made by human hands. But there's places all over heaven that people who have a gift to build and design get to be a part of that. They work with Jesus when they get to heaven and build these other places, not mansions, but places to go and enjoy, places to have excitement in, places where people are going to worship in or be together in. And what he would give them probably as an awesome gift would be heavenly blueprints to build something up there in heaven. That makes sense to me. And it sounds like really good news for someone. I mean, I'm not a builder, but I mean, there are people who get up in the morning and can't wait to make something else out of wood, you know? So, all right, well, here's a woman named, well, she goes by the handle cupcake. She says, Kat, if I'm just a mom, wait, the spirits all over me today. I keep, I'm this close to weeping out everything I read. Kat, if I'm just a mom living in New York City, how much authority do I have over strongholds? My street, my neighborhood, my whole city? So that's her question. I will tell you what the word says. When Jesus Christ was talking to his disciples and not just to them, but any believer and Jesus said, I give you power over all the power of the enemy. That should answer your question right there. We are over the darkness, not under the darkness. Satan is the doormat, we are not the doormat. We get the crowns from Christ to rule and reign. He says, you are ruling reign with me now. Now that's in the spirit realm over the darkness. We rule over that. That's Jesus' choice as a believer. If you've been born again, okay? You have deposits of things in your soul that you use to operate in this earth. Most people don't find out about them, although the word clearly talks about them. But Jesus did say, I give you power over all the power of the enemy, you know? And we can assess, they're in there, what you can do, things that you can do. So there's no enemy, there's no spiritual darkness that should have more power than us as a body of Christ, us as a believer in Jesus Christ, who lives in us, Christ lives in us. And the plan of God and of Christ always was for us to take authority and power and authority in this world and change things. By the way, we live our life, the choices we make, the words we speak. It says, what you dare to declare and decree, it will be established under you. So you can declare and decree that the gangs are not taken over your city where you're at, you're not tolerating them anymore. You don't partner with hell in any way whatsoever and begin to evict them from your city, stand in your yard, stand in your house and say that. You're taking the realm you live in and you have every right to do that and it doesn't matter what it is. If it's murders going on, if it's gangs going on, if it's drugs going on, it doesn't matter. You need to take authority all over all the evil and the wicked spirits of darkness that is promoting that and powering these people to do it, you learn to say something against it. Doesn't mean you have to show up at their place, you have authority in the spirit, you can speak from where you are right now against all the evil darkness even going on now. You do not have to receive the words of those who are wicked and evil trying to control you and that means that any time in your life, you don't have to put up with it because Jesus Christ lives in you, he waits for your words. The army of heaven waits for your words. So what are you saying? Are you complaining? Are you, all you're talking about is a darkness. If all you're talking about is the evil and darkness, you're gonna have that all around you. If you don't like it, then evict it from your life, evict it from your home and start declaring what God says, okay? Jesus is the restorer of our souls. He died on the cross, you're washed clean by his blood, you're the power of his blood, his name, his word, his authority that he has given us, that's who you are. You are not weak, you are not forgotten, you were called by God and your birth was timed on the earth for right now to say things and rule against things going on in this world because God is setting things up for the manifest ascends and daughters to rule and reign against the evil in this earth, in the spirit realm where your authority is. So yes, you absolutely have power and authority over all the darkness trying to ruin your life, ruin your family, say something against it and use the word of God if you want to, repeat what Christ has said if you want to, it doesn't change the fact that he said, you will rule in this life with him, he's talking about now and in the time is to come. So yes, people are going to know in this world who knows God, who believes in God and who's operating and walking in the spirit and not the flesh, they're going to know who you are by what's going on in your own life for God is about to do in your life that he's going to demonstrate to this world that you belong to him and you believe him. You know, Kat, it's not lost in me that you declare and decree all the time for your own state, the state of Florida, one of the states that's doing the best in the nation. I mean, that's not lost in me, you know, and you have Ivana Tia lives there, Donna lives there. I was born in Oregon and I'm in Oregon now, but I met Doreen in California, two of our kids, we were married in California, two of our kids were born in California and I love that state and it's so hard to see it going. And I'm thinking to myself, surely there's enough saints in California that are decreeing and yet it seems to be going backwards. Has God shown you anything about California? Well, Steve, you're only going to hear what's happening in the fake news. I mean, all you're going to hear is what the, you're going to only hear what the left is saying people. All right, that's true. He knows another whole side to this world that is not being heard, but they're there. And I promise you, they are taking authority. They are demonstrating, they are demanding things to be changed. They are speaking against the darkness and the evil thereof. They're taking authority over it. Why do you think everything they've tried has failed? Because we are light in this world and they can't take the light out of us. They can't stop God from talking to us. They can't stop it. And I think that's why they are very concerned. And it's all going to be showing up really soon that you do have authority and you do, you can do something about it. You can stop anything going on this wicked. I've not stopped talking against human trafficking, okay? That is horrible. It is a crime against humanity. It's even a crime against God himself because he didn't send people. He didn't send anyone to have that happen to them. There's a real devil in this world. But if you advertise more for him and talk about him more than God, are you going to do anything great for God? Stop advertising and participating with the wrong one and start declaring and declaring what God has said. And tell God, you believe him, you know he knows what's going on. You're on his side. You want to speak his words against the darkness. And let me tell you what, things are going to start changing so quickly. But what's happening right now and what is about to happen is the body of Christ is about to get major accelerated in authority, in dominion, and people are going to know they have it. So good, good, good news. And we can declare over other states, right? You declare over DC. We don't have to just declare our own state. I send a host all over this world. Good, that's good. I know you do. I send way more than- I send them for 24 hours a day for two weeks. That's really good. And they'll shred platforms of evil beings. They'll pull down strongholds. They will literally expose the flesh. Those in the flesh who are evil and wicked are getting exposed every day, but it's going to start majorly happening. That this stuff is going to be shown, that you can't get away with this. This is not God's plan. The earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof. You know the Bible says that. You know you're part of that fullness. You have a light in you that he put in you. You have authority in you. You have the anointing that Christ operated in. First John 2, 27, when you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior, you receive a deposit of the anointing and lives in you. What is the anointing? It destroys the yoke of darkness forever, you send it. That's good news to hear. Have an ice cream after you do it, people. And some chocolate cake. Deborah is asking, are there any distinctions between Jews and Gentiles in heaven? That's an interesting question. I think of course people know your ethnicity. You don't really lose your ethnicity. I mean, if you were born Scottish or Scottish there, you still look Scottish. You know, if you were born Nigerian, you still look Nigerian. You belong to God. If you receive Christ, you're going to go to heaven. So people do know that. They know that about you. They know what you did on the earth for God. That's shown many places all over heaven. So you don't stop being you. You're just a greater you. Do the accents still exist? Like Australians still sound like Australians. Jamaicans sound like Jamaicans and so forth. Yes. And yeah, all the Irish and Scottish accents, they all are still there for eternity. They're all there. The accents are there. There's different languages, but you understand every language spoken in heaven, except one in language. The one language of angels that is their own. They do speak other ones, but there is one that's just their language. And I don't think that we speak that one, but any other ethnicity that's been on the earth, was on the earth. You understand when they speak to you in Scottish or they speak to you in Nigerian, they speak to you in Spanish and you're not Spanish. You know every word they're saying in heaven. Yeah, it wouldn't be hard to hear. So, okay, in this one, Olivia and John just died. This says, please ask Kat, if she knows, if Olivia and John made it to heaven. I haven't been shown that yet, but that doesn't mean she didn't, people. I can tell, if it's okay with you, I'll just tell you that one of our writers, I can't think of her name right now, she's written for Breaking Christian News for years. She's the niece to Olivia and John. Olivia and John was saved. So, my personal testimony, we know Olivia and John is having, even though you haven't seen her, so I'm able to say that. All right, let's see, I haven't pre-read this, so here we go. Don asked, I recently had to put down my 17-year-old dog in the morning of his departure. I was praying for God to give me strength and peace. Trying to get through this stuff today. As I was praying, I saw a group of our pets that had already gone to heaven sitting and waiting and they all had little party hats on. Has Kat ever seen a pets coming home party? Yes, I have. I saw my own pets. I had a Yorkie named Molly and I got to see, she was hanging on with one breath practically, and I think that's when I was on the Western tour, I was going like a six-weeks tour and she was not doing well. She was like 16, 17 years old and I kept thanking God for letting her last until I could come home and say goodbye to her. And he did, he was very faithful, he did keep her and she was not doing really well and I actually dressed her in a little gown, people. It's okay, I loved her. I dressed her in a little hung-going gown and I gave her this beautiful thing when she passed that I would put her in and I had it all prepared and I got to hold her, I got to bathe her and she was on her, she was breathing, but she recognized me, her eyes, she could smell, she could smell, but she knew it was me and she loved me very much and I loved her very much. And finally, I just said to the father, okay, I've said goodbye, please take her so she can go home and it was like she was gone. Like her breath left her, she left her body and I actually have seen her several times in the sky since then, usually when we're sending another pet home, she will actually come for some reason and be here when that pet passes and she goes, they go up to heaven with her. It's amazing the relationship that even pets can create between each other and I did see them preparing for her hung-going party when she got there and her favorite thing to do was chase the mailman to try to get the letters away from him and so at her thing, I know, I know what was happening. I saw her running down the streets to go chasing an angel. I know people think God would not do that. Well, you don't know what you get there, okay? And there was an angel dressed like a postman with his big old wings running and he had this mail. It looked like mail and he was sewn out of his backpack and watching to see if the dog would chase him and boy, she was running down the streets to go after him like, oh, she could get. And she was having the best time and I thought, what better thing to give her? She actually got outside one time, she was an inside dog. She'd bark at the mail slot every day and pull the mail out of the mailman's hand and he would tease her with the mail but she got up one time when we weren't there. I don't know how that happened but she was chasing him all over our yard when we got home and he was throwing her the, you know, the mail, like all the ads and stuff. He was throwing it at her trying to stop her from chasing him. It was funny but to see that the father loved even her enough to plan something special for her. Totally. I've also seen when we all had a dox and it was my daughter's doxen and I did see him being also welcome home into heaven and the dogs and other pets we had where they were waiting for him. So yes, that does happen. And so if you had a pet past recently, number one, they never went by their self. Normally your own personal guardian angel will take your pet's spiritual body to heaven. And they've seen that angel a lot because dogs can see in the spirit. They saw that angel with you. So it wasn't somebody strange. They just gather up your spirit and take them up to heaven. But Molly seems from our side, Molly seems to be the greeter who gets to go with them also. So yes, the pets can do things together in heaven. It's beautiful. And is it your testimony for lack of a better word that dogs and cats can or might see your angels or they simply do? What do they do? They do. And that's why dogs are a part of the things you can't see. It makes sense. I think cats see them too, but dogs respond differently than cats do. Yeah, they do. I think they're really busy with cats since they got nine lives to try to save and not just one maybe. But I do know that pets can definitely acknowledge when angels come in and out of here, when we had our dogs that were here, they would always follow them when they walked. I could see them following them in babies. All babies can see the angels, not just the angels. You're not saying some, you're saying all babies. All babies fresh from heaven can see in the spirit. They can see, and even when my own daughters would have a baby and my daughter would be holding them and the baby would be like looking at me, like this is me here and the baby's looking at me. That baby would go like this. That's hilarious. Every single time they will look at my angels. So I know they're seeing the angels. So yes, your baby can see angels. Now you're describing some hilarious things in heaven. Talk about for a minute, because this is a, in the natural, if someone only listens to the news, this is a painful crisis, horribly yucky time on this face of the earth, and someone would say, well, God would never be up in heaven performing all these hilarious things because there's more important things on the earth that demand his attention. How would you respond to that? I would say God is already responding to the stuff on the earth people. He is setting up and recording every single evil act indeed that's being done, because the gavel's already fallen for justice to come to this nation and this world, but the evil trying to take over. No one's going to escape seeing this. So God is doing stuff on this earth right now. Important things right now for what is coming, which is the days of glory and fire are coming on earth. Those are powerful, amazing things. The manifest of sons and daughters, she's done preparation for hundreds of years already on the earth for this to happen. He knew what was gonna happen. He knew people would be coming home to heaven. He doesn't create evil, but there is right now an evil devil who hates everybody. He even hates his own demons. He hates anybody involved with him, even doing things for him. He loves nobody, but God loves us for the love that you hardly can't understand that he sent his son to make a way back to him. He's not ignoring us on the earth right now, but he's also not going to ignore what's going on in heaven. He's not gonna make somebody have to experience suffering or agony or things that are on the earth right now. This is his ballpark. This is his, he's dealing with this. We're praying who are alive here. We're taking authority right here. That's what our thing is to do right now is to take authority. For those who run their race and run it well are not going home to heaven. He is not going to ignore the fact that he wants to welcome them. He wants them to feel special. He wants them to know how much he loves them. He does both at the same time, deal with it on the earth and loves people in heaven. I was gonna ask you about that because we teach, we've always taught as believers that God is omnipresent, which means he's everywhere at once. So when he says weep with those who weep, rejoice with those who rejoice laugh, he literally does all of those things simultaneously, right? All at the same time. Yes, he does. Someone lost a baby today. He's weeping with them right now. Someone, little kid did something funny in heaven. He's laughing with that. All at the same time. He definitely can be everywhere all at the same time. And by the way, the devil can't. The devil does not have the power. He's not omnipresent. He's not omnipresent. He's not. He is a created being who became very evil and wicked, who wants to use and take away destiny, steal things, kill, steal and destroy is the MO of Satan. The mode of operation for Satan is kill, steal and destroy. God is to bring life and bring it more abundantly. So there's definitely a difference between light and darkness and good and evil. And let me tell you more than ever before, you're seeing that a lot of people have never even witnessed this before in their life, but they're seeing a lot of it right now. And you're definitely me. You will understand what God is doing because it's going to start showing up unexpectedly and suddenly. When God does this suddenly, almost no one's prepared for it, not those believing and hoping for it and not the ones trying to stop it from happening. He is fully aware of everything and knows where everybody is. It's hiding, who's cheating, who's stealing, who's lying, he knows every bit of that. He also knows who is ready to be blessed. Those who are about to reap a harvest for their giving and they're helping and they're praying. Both sides are going to have what they've been. It's seed time and harvest right now, people. The harvest is coming is not the great end time harvest. The harvest is about to come is seed time and harvest, which you've been seeding over these last five, six years on either side, good or evil. You're about to get a harvest of either recompense and justice or blessings and suddenly an empowerment. And both are going to be judged. Both are going to receive the harvest that they've been planting all these years. So the wicked cannot stop or stop from happening what God is going to judge and give justice for. But you also can't stop the blessings and the acceleration in the power of God. That's being given to those who stood firm, who helped, who prayed, who did what was right. Both sides are going to be dealt with, blessed or dealt with with justice. It is going to happen. Oh, good, such good news. You know, we have to stop shorter today just because those little grandsons are going to bust through the door at any moment now. Would you pray for the people or whatever God gives you to pray as we close this out? Yeah, Father, I just speak your life into people right now. I impart life, the love of God, the wisdom of God, His acceleration, His expectation, His celebration for all that is about to happen, that is full of light, love, inventions, all kinds of wonderful things that are coming to this earth right now. He timed you to be here for that. And God, I will speak to the wicked. You are going to receive justice. And you may not like what is about to happen to you, so you better change your mind and get on the right side. If you don't want to experience the judgment, probably imprisonment, maybe even the firing squad, I'm just going to tell you right now, and this is everywhere, anywhere right now. God is getting ready to fulfill both of those things in the earth simultaneously. And He is going to take this earth and turn it into a place He needs it to be. The greater glory of God can be seen and known in the earth. It says, the knowledge, knowing, understanding of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea. Did you know that this earth is covered with two-thirds sea? That means two-thirds of the entire earth is going to experience the glory of God, the fire of God, baptism and fire coming. There's no one out there, no human, no demon that can stop that from falling on this earth. Let me tell you what it is to do. It burns all fear out of you. It burns all anything that you've been substituting something for God for. It's going to burn fear out. It's going to burn confusion out. It's going to burn hate out, anger out. It's going to burn out of you when it touches you. So no one can stop these. These are the things and days of God. It's the day of His power. It is not the day of His wrath. But some people are about the experience wrath because of sea, time and harvest. And there's no one on this earth that can stop that from happening. These are the days that God has decided on. These are His times on the earth. And no one can stop Him from doing so. Father, I thank you for helping those. God, to know how to take authority, to do that, to stand up for what is right, to declare and decree the goodness that's coming of God, His plans, His will, His way, in Jesus' name, and stop advertising the enemy who is a loser, loser, loser. I thank you. I'm on the winning side. God, help them to be on the winning side. Send your presence to flood their lives right now. The presence of God to flood you right now in Jesus' name. And power you, inspire you, encourage you. That, Father, is what they need right now. I thank you for giving it to them in Jesus' name. And we all said amen. Amen. Cat, tell people real quick. You've got two websites, RevealingHeaven.com. What can they get there? And then you've got catcur.com. Talk about those real quick. The comments where our store is. The Father gave me a corporation for one reason, to reveal and create heaven on earth. We reveal it through words, through meanings. We also reveal it through products. Like, I love this cup. The Holy Spirit showed me how to create this cup. And it says, I don't do demons. See that? That little lightning bolt right there is what Satan was cast out of heaven on. And the Holy Spirit said, please, add it to your cup so people can enjoy it. Every time they know, he was put down. He lost his position, his authority, and his power. And I can tell you, a lot of that's going to start happening again. So you can go there for RevealingHeaven.com. Our events are on that page also. Catcur.com is a place I call the spiritual platform for God, the Father, Holy Spirit, and Jesus to say whatever they want to say on that place. And I'm just going to remind everybody, I will never, ever message you, number one. I don't know how to message people on Facebook or any other form of media. I don't do that. I'm not going to message you and say, please give money to this missionary. Please give to this cause. That is someone trying to steal your money. You will never, ever get a message from me saying that, an email saying that, a text saying that. I'm not going to do it. So you know if that comes. That's a fraud and that's a fake trying to take your money. Don't send it. Don't give them any answer to what they're sending. Don't answer their email or their messaging. That is not true. And also, oh, she said she gave me something. What is your public Facebook page called? My public Facebook page is called the Catcur. The reason for that was when I went to make my public Facebook page. Catcur was taken. And the Holy Spirit said, just put the Catcur. And then they'll know what you. Well, guess what? It was available. The Catcur is my public Facebook page. It's also what my YouTube channel is called. And that will keep you clear. If anybody else texts you or uses my picture and says they're a different Facebook, tell them they're lying. And that is not me and pray for those people to delete them. All right, Cat, good. A quick message that tomorrow, well, Thursday. This is Tuesday, we're recording Thursday. Tomorrow for those watching, Hank Kuhneman will be our guest. So we haven't had him on for a long time. So we're really, really looking forward to having Hank on. We miss him a lot. So thank you, Cat. God bless you and your team. It was so nice to see your mom. We're going to have your mom on soon with you. And have her give us some pearls of wisdom. I miss you a lot. So listen, we enjoyed it today. It was very great. And I am really close to the spirit today. I'll tell you what, even reading about pets, I'm ready to weep. So anyway, thanks again for the day. We bless you and have a great day. And we will see you all tomorrow. God bless you. Bye. You

music You Well, happy Wednesday September 14 2022 welcome to Elijah's dreams. I'm Steve Schultz host along with my wife We founded together both the Elijah list right there like this calm and Elijah streams Beginning 25 years ago. We are in the beginning of year 26 I think if I'm saying that right bringing you the voice of the prophets and never has it been more important than in this specific time Frame when so much is going on many of you have heard I'm gonna say repeat it for a couple of days in a row We are off of YouTube until December First it's pretty much fine with me Because they're as soon as we get back on they're gonna be gunning force again They are trying to remove Christians that are conservative that are speaking anything on behalf of Trump And I will not relent because YouTube wants me to I'll get all the more stubborn and you know So we're trying to be wise so that we're not Abandoning the channel outright. We're gonna they're gonna have to force us off And but neither am I gonna overly try not to offend them because they're trying to be offended They don't want to not be offended They're trying to be offended so that they have a legitimate excuse We wait till December 31 all of our strikes disappear But that doesn't keep them from the next day giving us more strikes so they can take us off So just so you all know we will be off through and including the elections there But we we're gonna be on rumble The whole time rumble is getting just as large of views or almost as large of views as our best days on YouTube Maybe we're not quite there, but almost as large and we're usually on Facebook as well So be sure and tell your friends and family anyone that wants to know when we're gonna be on where Rubble and Facebook now and we will be back on YouTube December One I think is the date or whichever the Monday is close to that probably or whatever date is close to December 1 Okay, so now cat will be on here in just a few minutes But you all have heard me talk about Mike and Laurie Sally Who have are helping us in two areas the wells being dug in Uganda and then the water projects We're working on right now. So without further delay, let's bring in Mike and Laurie Sally to kind of give us a report. Hey guys Hey, how you doing? Good. How's Mississippi this time of year? It's actually beautiful today. It's really starting to be fall weather So we're excited about that. Awesome. Now. Do you get snow? Probably not in the south. Do you do occasionally? Yeah, do you a couple years or so? Yeah, I lived in Dallas for a while And then I lived in Florida on the other side for a while. So we didn't see a lot of snow But yeah, we could get the you get the big thunderstorms and all that out there always that's our big thing. Yeah Well, listen, I know you guys have got a different things to share with us. I'm trying to decide Laurie should we start with how the Mississippi Water project came into being by meeting the mayor or where would you like to start? Sure, we can talk about that I don't know if everybody watching knows the devastation that's happening in Jackson, Mississippi, which is the capital of our state The water has the people have been on a boiled notice, which I don't know if that's common everywhere I didn't really I've never heard of it. Yeah, it's common here in Mississippi And I didn't really realize that till we moved back to the south in Mississippi several years ago It happens all the time in different areas. The water gets contaminated and so this has been something going on in Jackson for a really long time and So since you brought us on the team Steve to help begin investigating water issues here in the states Mike and I never realized right in our own backyard. Jack's struggling So we've been looking, you know knocking on doors and meeting different people about the water crisis is going on in the United States Which I didn't even realize it was so challenging here, but we were flying back from Vacation, I think it was in early June and I had actually been kind of sick the night before and had an upset stomach. So I didn't really sleep good So I didn't really look I don't know like travel worthy I actually felt like I was traveling back from Uganda like I've been on a long missions trip or something But I'm even that long so we are in the Atlanta airport and Mike looks across the way and he's he says I think that's the mayor of Jackson We've only seen him on TV and so I looked and I was like, yeah That that kind of looks like him and everybody was you know around him talking to him and stuff And I don't know why I did this but just in my mind just in my heart I said to the Lord Lord if you want to give him an encouraging word I I'd be willing to do it You're just gonna have to sit me next to him and that's just random I do that sometimes just to challenge myself because you know when you're talking about We're always talking about the prophetic and wanting to use it But if you don't put yourself out there, I don't know if you're not aware then then God really you know We didn't have an opportunity so I'm always you know since I've been walking in the prophetic I've been challenging myself in that so I think I said it so we get on we go to get on the plane you know you scan your boarding pass and Mike has all of the miles and he always gets upgraded any time we fly together man first-class Mike sally Back in the back, you know, and and he's a gentleman and always offers to give it to me But he has long legs so I let him sit in the front So I scan my boarding pass before Mike and it spits out a different seat number And I'm thinking oh well surely you know Mike's gonna get the same thing and he scans his and nothing happens And I'm like that's crazy. Well, I was gonna be sitting in a middle seat next to Mike And I actually love the window so this seat was the window so I said it was our last leg I said let me just take this seat. I'm tired. I'll sit there So I go and sit in on an 11 a and Mike's back in 29 So I'm sitting down and you know just sitting there waiting the next thing I know the mayor comes walking down and he stops and he sits in the seat right next to wow And I start speeding like oh gosh did I really just say that to the Lord like I'll give him a word of encouragement So I just start thinking like what do you want to say God? What do you want to say? So we're sitting there and you know everybody's passing by and they're all talking to him then I just I don't know what to say I don't have any profound words. So I just turned to him and I just tell him exactly what just what I just told you Again, okay, I think I'm a crazy Christian. I don't know and he says to me He says, you know, there's no coincidences in the Bible That does not happen in the Bible and really he started to give me words of encouragement and I tell me You know, I want to pray for you how can we pray for you and he starts just kind of sharing his journey and how he got into being the mayor and He he just starts pulling out scriptures and he tells me what the meaning of Jackson means It means God is gracious and he just starts kind of prophesying the destiny over his city And I'm just blown away and I said well, I think maybe I sat next to you for me Not the other way Okay, you know, well, I just know there's more and I'll just keep praying So he put you know, they they take off and he puts on his mask and puts on his earplugs and he goes to sleep He's been on a business trip. I'm sure he's tired the whole time sitting there like Lord. What is it? Why do you have me sitting next to him? Then I remember there's a water issue in Jackson, Mississippi and their husband and I thought is that why? So as we're getting ready to land I take the last minute I have before he gets off the plane and I just mentioned to him Hey, we're working with an amazing group of people that really have a passion to bring clean water And I don't know if maybe that's why God put us together Do you think when we get off the plane, you know You can exchange numbers with my husband and we can maybe see see what God has and he says sure get off the plane Mike exchange numbers and he actually texted us later and set up a meeting Go to Jackson to his office meet with his cabinet and just share what Elijah streams is doing well He set up a meeting with his cabinet. Yes. Yes. It really shocked us. It was actually kind of a little overwhelming like to walk in there with all these and he's introducing us into the CFO and this person and this person and And we just start talking about the crisis and the issue and the challenges that they're having and and it really was an amazing Time and got to give it. We gave him some words of encouragement and in from that point on You know, we were gonna do some more meetings and figure out how we can help bring water clean water Kind of a staff stopgap measure because honestly the water system in Jackson is going to take millions of dollars to repair and so our our heart was like, okay, what can we do in the meantime to help people just like we're doing in Uganda and We shared with him about the water box Yeah, and so right after that this water crisis hit and it wasn't just a matter of we had some flooding issues But it wasn't just a matter of being on a boiled water alert It was a matter of no pressure in the lines And really many people that had no water not just dirty water, but no water to flush their toilets no water today And this is Yeah And it's this is a major city and you start thinking like wow This is actually happening here in the United States and so, you know, we were actually because of the live streams We were able to be in position here We were able to jump in and begin to help some other organizations that are that are situated in downtown Jackson and there's there's there's a couple of organizations that we worked with That were out delivering water because a lot of people couldn't even get out There was some elderly and some people that were just homebound for different reasons They couldn't even get out and get the water that was being given away. And so we got these jugs I think we have a video we can show you in a second here about that But one of the pastors that we worked with went out delivered these jugs of water to people all over the city that he knew We're lock-ins and so it was really ministered to him that a lot of streams came in and was being was willing to help Financially and also providing these water jugs. And so you want to show that video? Let's go ahead and play that video Emily go for it. Hey guys, my name is brother JJ Thompson I am the pastor here at Alternative Ministry and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to Let you know how much I appreciate the work and the things that you guys may do for us I want to think Elijah's stream you're donating these gallons of water cause we in Jackson, Mississippi You know, we have a water crisis But what we're doing we are being the middleman to help those that can't get out But I've been pastoring for 10 years been in minister 20 But God is way too. I've got 60 years old to get me to do what I'm doing and I'm gonna say this I'm gonna be finished. I love what Paul said about pure religion It is happening to follow through this And I thank God for the passion. So again, thank you from Jackson, Mississippi. I'm brother JJ So that was so good, you know, he mentioned that that scripture I don't have it fully memorized, but it says pure religion undefiled as visiting the orphans and taking care of it I don't know if you guys have any more memories than I did, but that's what he was referring to He said, I don't know if y'all know what God said about here pure religion It's really in their distress You know, so think about they're in distress right now and we were able to go out and help people Deliver clean water to the elderly to the widows that were in distress because they couldn't even flush their toilets great now Talk about the water stations. Where are we on that? Yeah, so that's we're really excited about that We just got break through on that a couple of days ago and I actually have a meeting with them today after we get finished with this show There's these water boxes or filtration systems and we're actually partnering We're gonna provide three of them at this time possibly more in the future in Mississippi two of them will be with the Jackson Fire Department So we actually have partnered with the Jackson Fire Department. They just had the They're meeting with the city council that approved getting these boxes put into the fire department because that's one of the stations where people can come And get clean water and they've given out, you know, probably there's been six million Bottles of water or more given out in the past probably more than that actually by now And you think about these plastic bottles too, where are they going? They're going to the landfills and what how do we don't have a good recycling system in Mississippi? So this system allows people to have containers and there's a picture of Lee that we sent you guys of it But they can come and actually yeah, there it is right there come and fill up their containers and Get filtered water and then bring them back to their house and just keep coming back So they'll be regularly scheduled hours that they can go to the Jackson Fire Department And there's also a small town called Mount Bayou, Mississippi. That's a very poor area in Mississippi That we're gonna be providing a water box that had to have a lot of problems with their work These are kind of expensive. We don't normally do too much. We're telling people but I don't we isn't a cut aren't we investing a hundred thousand Dollars in three boxes. Okay. Okay, so that's huge investment and That includes now not only does that include the water box But the place that's hosting it like the the city or the fire department The water bills are covered any increase in their water bills are going to be covered for an entire year All the containers are covered all the training all the filtration systems. Everything is water testing the water testing regularly testing So it's something that we could do as a stopgap measure until they do, you know, it's Lori Dollars that I've actually heard a billion dollars to fix the water system here Really? Yeah a billion with a B. And so it's it's a big deal But you know, I was I was shocked you know, by the way, Elijah streams has done fifty three Wells in Uganda. So wow Over a thousand salvation. Yeah over a thousand now That is church is being planned and lands being given to to churches to plan because of this water It's it's absolutely unbelievable. I didn't realize, you know, I knew there was a problem in Uganda I didn't realize there was a problem here. No, I mean, yeah, we don't think of that. Well when we've been Examining you and us you guys and us guys We've been you know by trying to get some because the Lord spoke to us about Native Americans and and their needs are huge But they tend to be spread out So it's hard to put a central well in one spot because they're mild the summer will live miles away in a massive reservation Plus they you if you don't drill really deep which is really expensive You're gonna get what arsenic and things like that in the water, right? Yeah, there's some of the wells there that we've gotten quotes for over a million dollars for one water well And then you're not even completely sure it's gonna be clean water So it's a there's a lot more to that than just going into a reservation drilling It also takes about five years from what I understand for the entire permit process to get approved So it's very challenging. We are working on a few projects. We could talk about later But we do have a few projects with Native Americans that we're working on Um, that we believe we'll be able to to be doing pretty soon And on the uh, there's words. I'm looking at the note. We're waiting for cat to arrive So we've got a couple of minutes. They'll tell me when she arrives But uh on those water boxes. Did you say how many those will serve or to do or tend to serve? Well, we don't know for sure about a lot of people. I mean, there's still lines of cars everywhere that there's water distribution centers Even still today, there's lines of people waiting and that's just with the government's the government assigned spots There's also many churches and nonprofits that are also doing and so even the other day We were driving to town and we looked over and there was a church or some organization that was providing clean water And it was lines of cars Waiting waiting two and three hours in line to get to water. Well, and that's scripture that I quoted a lot I don't can't remember the exact quote. I've got it on a piece of paper, but I can't reach it But this is where Jesus says Jesus said if you even give so much as a cup of cold water one cup to one of these you'll not Um Lose your reward. Does that apply to the water boxes and the water bottles? Absolutely. Why I mean you're providing clean water, you know And so it's definitely there's a lot of rewards that will not be lost And there's a lot of people that you'll meet in heaven one day that'll be like, thank you for contributing to my clean water And you may be like, what did I do? Well, you sewed into Elijah's streams ministries and they provided a water box in Jackson, Mississippi And I was able to provide clean water for my kids and for my family and I was able to flush my toilets and Just the basic stuff and so yeah, it's it's definitely making a huge impact on people and just the heart behind it That's the other thing. It's like there's the practical aspect of the water but People are constantly asking me why would an organization all the way to organ care about us Right, and that's even more powerful sometimes and I think the physical water just to know that there's people out there that cares, you know And so it was great that we were positioned here in this in this state to be able to help quickly Yeah, and one of the things we've all learned is that you know When we when you agreed to come because you're you're still doing the you've gone to project That's your project with show mercy, but then you're working with us full time as well as As those how those work out you can work at two places full time believe it or not, but We didn't I think my simplistic thinking was we'll come here We'll start identifying the projects and we'll start drilling wells immediately and that was a that was uh an amazing um Learning process for me because I thought well as long as we're willing to pay the project will present themselves And we won't have to work for it, but that wasn't true. So Um, by the way, they're telling me that cat is here now So we're going to go in a second, but I want to thank you guys and honor you guys if we you know We go way back our our daughter used to babysit your daughters and now one's married and one's about to be married. So That's amazing. We you guys we've been at this for what? I said 20 years. We've known you or About 20 years. Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing. But you know, I'm gonna speak on behalf of you guys I I know your lives. I know your commitment. I know your walk with the lord and and I'm just very proud of you and lory. What a great story with the mayor Are you kidding? I mean you said I gotta end with this But you said lord if you want me to give him word, you're gonna have to Sit me down with him. You put your ticket in and it gives you it suddenly changes your seat to the one next to the mayor That's the other thing. I didn't say his seat got changed too. Yeah, really After I told him he said, okay, I have to be honest with you when he pulled out He said my seat got changed as well. Oh, man He knew that he knew and I told him and so it's so fun how god I mean the the the devastation and the hardship that's going right now is terrible But it's so crazy. God is so good to just little bitty things set you up at the right place at the right time I so love that. I so love that. You know, we're told to go out in the highways and byways to compel them to come in And that's where you know, that's literally the highways and byways and another Another part of that says and along the hedges. Well, what is the hedges? Those are where your neighbors next door are looking over the hedges going. What's with these people Go along the hedges and compel them to come in. So I I wrote an article about that one day I said, have you gone compelling lately?

Oh, yeah, it was really awesome and and then of course the meetings We had people come from around the world to the one um that was at their church on mount zine. It was amazing So so good Well cat, let's see. Let me jump into you throw it to you and anything that's on your heart to share right now before We get into questions about heaven and when people ask other questions They're sometimes they're not about heaven, but they're almost all very very very interesting. So So what anything on your heart to share this morning before we get into that? I can just say that that um Sunday morning this last Sunday morning. I did spirit force in a way never done before Really it's so Um, so complete powerful that you leave that you left that meaning knowing exactly who you were in christ Wow, what's your whole salvation experience look like in the spirit realm? What are our weapons that we get is the army of god that the bible clearly says we are in the army of god And it was just really empowering and very very I had said kind of intense, but it was amazing. And so I will thoroughly enjoy doing all my spirit force meetings We'll be doing some more online, but I believe they this I believe if you go back you may be able to watch this one Yeah, that was this last sunday and um Is it go g o m z? I think is g o m z is their website dot or Yeah, g o m z dot organ dot organ or or you can go on gateway on mount zine Facebook or gateway on mount zion's facebook page and uh emily uh or michael one of you could you put that under the Rumble or in the comments. However, you do it Is I knew more of the youtube system than this one But I put it under facebook so people can see that that'd be awesome if we give them that link so Now can I got to ask you a question? Well anything else because I have a question to launch our other questions, but um And it's kind of a blended question. So let me ask it to you this way Um, we get from time to time people say well cat must have lots of new and exciting Experiences, I think you probably when you go there must you must be a little bit surprised each time with something He shows you that you hadn't seen before And has there been anything recently you think boy, I'd like to tell people about that when I was caught up There are things but first of all, I'd like of course to mention queen Elizabeth Okay, and because there's a lot of of course buzz going on about that, you know And I think it probably bothers me personally a little bit that everybody automatically thinks people went to hell I don't know why um, you know, christ is for us. He's not against this and she clearly and I just have to say queen Elizabeth Is in heaven people if she is there and god is giving her rewards because She's had one of the longest running um I can't remember what you think That allowed God in that country Okay, and and talked all the time about jesus christ on every special uh holiday they had she always mentioned to him every single time She had uh like a message to give to her kingdom and the people of uh, england and and the surrounding countries there It was always positive and she didn't just be positive herself She always talked about god. She talked about jesus christ He totally was allowed and because when when you are the head of something and you allow jesus christ As a monarch to come into that country there is no way she's not going to escape being greatly rewarded For for the longevity of her of her monarchy and how much she loved jesus christ So people queen elizabeth is in heaven there. That's the most important thing. I could say today Okay, the controversy was going on. You know, there's always so many things made up about stuff And she didn't have enemies against her because they didn't like it that she Didn't want evil and she didn't want to let certain things to happen in that country So there you are straight from the throne room people queen elizabeth made it to heaven really good Can you can you elaborate on what you said a minute ago? You said I don't I don't know why people always think people are going to help Now you you are one that also believes some people go to hell. I know that So can you elaborate on that? So is it that? Uh, you absolutely know many go to hell But is it that more people go to heaven than most of us think or what? Probably more people go to heaven now than ever before. Okay. It is because of the availability of the word Uh, you know of the message about the the kingdom christ in the kingdom that you talked about that we rule in with them There's so much revelation out there right now There's almost kind of no excuse if you have a computer have any access to a computer People by the millions are looking at people's sites that talk about jesus a lot Even if they don't talk about heaven they want to know about him That's good So I think now more because back way back in those days like in the day of jesus they of course didn't have the internet They didn't have television. They didn't even have radio. That's why he walked over He traveled so much himself to share the kingdom But the news about him still to this day is going around the world And those there are many many many more Millions of believers now than ever before in the world And ministries and places for help that there certainly would be more Um more people going to heaven now than ever before and yes, people do go to hell. They're wicked. They're evil. They hate everything Uh, their soul is so corrupted and they don't want to repent for things. You know, that's their choice Yeah, as the father has shared with me before He doesn't keep people out of heaven and he doesn't send them to hell Because people are always saying, you know, uh, a loving father wouldn't send people to hell He doesn't he gave everything he had to make a way for you to come to heaven. So that's where his love is He loves us so much. He loves the people in the world He even desires that the vial center be free free from what sin Yeah, sin and have his son so they could come to heaven He's just not going to allow heaven to be like the earth. He's just not going to do it He's not willing to pollute heaven to file heaven by people who bring that with them because they carry it and that's how they live So the father actually said tell them it's just just the opposite A loving father would make a way for them to come to heaven and he clearly And so all right by that you mean he didn't send people to hell by that. Do you mean they choose hell themselves? That's what he said. They choose to go there. They make up their own choice in their own will There's a scripture in the bible that says I make myself known to everyone. Yeah, so in their soul in some way He says he makes himself known that means you'll have an opportunity a choice sometime in your life Or he will impress upon you to know him and the scripture is never wrong And I've had a lot of people say I wasn't even thinking about something and sitting where just contemplating all of a sudden The thoughts started pouring into me that I needed to know Jesus Christ And then the love of God would sweep over these people and they would just be convicted And then they would want to know him then they would receive him. So that's how far he goes Yeah, make sure that they know there is a loving God And this whole thing that we're living in and around this world It didn't happen in a big bang people and there's many scientists that know that there was creation Creation did happen and it's even the evidence of even over the ages is very clear even in the foundation of our earth And the way it was made So I know you evolutionists you you would like to think yourself You get to choose everything including where you're going to end up in some wonderful place. There's only two choices There's either Jesus Christ in heaven Or you choose satan who is the lord of the flies and you will be in hell not just hell forever You'll be in the lake of fire forever. So I want to encourage people seeking your own soul What would keep you from wanting to know him? What would keep you from wanting to receive all that that God has for you in heaven and that christ died for you Do you have there's that scripture and I'm sorry part. Sorry that I don't have that reference to it, but it says Uh, it's it's a new covenant scripture. It says this the covenant I'll make with them after that time And It goes on Sorry that I don't have it in front of me, but it says no more will a man say to his neighbor Know the lord for the or his brother know the lord for they'll all know me from the least of the greatest What is that scripture referring to if you know? I'm pretty sure that it's referring to the times because he's talking about a time. There'll be a time that's happened Right, we're entering into that time right now because what he is about to do And there's a lot of people who don't like me talking about they don't like hank robin Johnny they don't like there's people who don't like they think we're rocking the boat No, we're trying to get you in the boat people. Yeah, so that you don't die a horrible a horrible death and end up Throughout eternity. No, we're gonna say the truth prophets a true prophet god will always always speak the words Of revelation from the father from Jesus from holy spirit and the truth is what makes you free Not all these other things that are lies that are deceptions. They don't make you free They control you they keep you trapped and so you need to know the truth so that you will be free And there is a way to be free from evil from from wickedness from hell from Satan ruling over your life Getting caught up in witchcraft or other things And you don't want to live your life like that because this is a very short life But the way you live this life will determine where you end up and there's two places a bend to boat Yeah, you do not want to go to hell When I started getting to know you cat and I've said this on the air once or twice before with you I don't know if you'll remember this may have spent probably a year But I was raised with the fear that my least little stumble. I would not go to heaven now My tradition taught that you don't there's not an eternal hell. You just burn up. That's it But I was afraid to just burn up and that's yeah, I wanted to go to heaven But I felt like I was taught that it would be really easy to be deceived And now I'm on the other side of that. It's on the flip side of that where it's almost like This is just my language not biblical language. It's almost like God's looking for loopholes to get you saved That's how it feels like he's going if I don't get him saved this way I'll get him saved that way and you know, there's that scripture. I think it's Romans 10 9 but we can believes in his heart and confesses with his mouth and Jesus the Lord and and believes that God raised him from the dead from the dead will Be saved so there are people in various stages of maturity or immaturity who we might not even say God, you know, if they died they probably would say They they didn't make it but if if a person in the privacy of their bedroom says, you know what? I think I do believe that I think I do And for the first time he says it in his heart and says it with his mouth And then he dies right after that. He's he's going to heaven. Yes, he is he really is he certainly is going to go to heaven And yes, they're always watching from heaven. And let me tell you a holy spirit is so busy on this earth A holy spirit leads people of he impresses people. He's even these people who are not believers He's still going around those seek seeking for those who might know Christ or want to know Christ They they have so many angels and members of the host the army of heaven whose very Assignment is to lead people to the place where they can hear the truth know the truth or even have them meet individuals Who know answers that they need to know so they can get born again and absolutely? Yes, if the father said he desires That's a strong word. He desires the vilest most evil sinner Be safe because his son paid a price for everybody But they do have to choose and it doesn't matter if it's in the last breath If you did it as a child and you receive Christ in syria And and I tell you I remember when I got born again at age four that never left me I knew that I knew that I knew I was going to heaven at age four. I knew Jesus Christ Wow And so even children very young can fully give themselves to christ and they're raising an atmosphere that's so So bad, you know god will watch over them. It's not like it was me That that was me. I mean I was raised and I gave my heart to the lord very early I was baptized in that almost cult setting But I knew I'd I'd received Jesus christ. I knew about his death on the cross except for that even though there's And then I lived a significant portion of my life after that in all kinds of drudgery I don't and you know most stations and all of that. So you were talking about if somebody Look, I don't know how far to push this question But I mean if there's a current person who's a pedophile and that's during this horrible sin Cat and then they died but if you look back on that person's life when they were a child and they said Jesus I want you Does the lord remember that or did they throw that away in the meantime? What I keep saying he throws it away I know that that stuff would not be allowed in heaven at all And even if was like I said before even at near the death of a person Let's say they haven't died, but they're close to that Even if they're unconscious the holy spirit can speak to those people Wow, and that does happen because we've had people not died. It came so close to death That people thought for sure they would never survive and they came out of that coma or whatever that was And said that they were that they saw Jesus christ. I mean there's testimonies everywhere that happened I know like ian, you know, I always go back to ian who's the one I think he was a surfer Yeah, something like that. Ian, I can't remember. Yeah, I'm like jellyfish and I'm telling you what Jesus pursued him But through that whole time until I think he flatlined He was in the morning in the morgue of the hospital. I think And jesus presented himself caught him up presented himself and said your mother has never stopped praying for yourself And jesus moved his hand in this person who had he died and he saw his mother praying and crying out to god Do not let and she didn't know that he had died people She didn't even know that he was in that situation, but this was her nightly thing that she had prayed god Don't let my son go to hell. Please reach out to him I i'm i'm declaring that he will be in heaven eternity with me And he'll have an opportunity to know you and and in here from you And so because of her prayers, she was a very godly woman He wouldn't let those prayers fall to the ground. So when he flatlined And was actually falling into hell. That's a testimony falling into hell You have to remember that christ has the keys To hell death and the grave those are time frames from the time you are dying and to your death And any of those times if there was somebody like in's mother Who is faithful to him who loved him has served christ and would cry out on his behalf every night It says if you believe in your heart and don't let your words drop to ground She will not let them be wasted. He'll answer that and so that this is this was his answer to ian's mother's prayers And here is this this guy who was actually died flatline. He was in the morning had a tag on his toe And she just said because of your mother And her belief in me her trust and promise in me because of her own declarations I have to i have to take her words and give you an opportunity. Do you want me now? And this person caught up in the spirit somewhere not actually in in heaven This was outside of heaven, but it was still up in the spirit realm And he said, um, do you want me now and this guy began to weep and weep and say i'm not worthy of you I don't deserve this, you know, I was wicked and jesus kept saying yes, but your mother I can't let her words fall to the ground my word gives a promise And so he said Well, then he said of course. Yes, I will receive him. He really then he really started crying And i think christ reached out and touched him. He said life like he never felt before Because he remember he said he received christ life slowed into his body and he was so on fire uh for christ and He he was totally changed in that moment And jesus said now Do you want to go with me and he moved and he could see heaven behind christ And his hunger was so great for that. He said do you want to go with me now or you want to go back And ian was really struggling. He says, you know, I want to come so much But if I went now my mother would not know I went to heaven. So please send me back christ sent him back He came back into his body the dead body in the morgue He was looking over him about to do an autopsy And and the guy freaked out the the doctor freaked out and he goes, why are you alive? Sits up totally whole like he never died He goes, I have to find my mother and the guy goes, don't you go anywhere? And so this doctor runs out ian runs down the hall Because he probably had his wrappings on or whatever and he finds an outfit I think it was some Some kind of output, you know, uh like a doctor's assistant or something And he puts it on runs out of the hospital and goes to his mother And she was so undone What christ had done because of her prayers and ian goes all over the world right now And actually gives this personal testimony. These are those are the very words he spoke and because of his uh Because of his mother and what she believed and stood for him And he had been angry also one of the other things about ian is he got really angry about somebody Didn't want to forgive them either. So christ said you have to forgive that person So he did forgive that person and this is when he was in his spirit body So don't ever think that christ can't do something If you're standing for your family's salvation, I know the very first time I was caught up to heaven And christ when he was bringing me back said please tell everybody never stop praying For their loved ones salvation because I will be listening That's so easy. He actually had the keys. He was wearing the keys right then and he showed me these keys He said these keys don't hang on a hook in heaven He said uh, when you die, there's a judgment that comes it says can can you be taken to heaven or not taken to heaven And he has opportunity if there are people standing in in agreement or they're they're Declaring that their family members are those who they call family members people who they love like family. Yeah to Um that they will not miss heaven then christ has the right Because of our declarations Are we're standing what we're believing for? And then he has the right to use those keys and I've I've since I was shown that I've heard so many testimonies Just come in saying You know, I was one of those people I died or right at my death christ appeared to me And ask if I wanted him and so it is true that really does happen Can I ask you a question about the non-loved ones that but they're people who? For instance Ruth Bader Ginsburg died as far as anyone that I know knows she never received the lord It was totally pro-abortion, but a lot of people I'm aware of have prayed had prayed for her for years and years and years What couldn't you say about that? Sort of thing this guy'd say look all these people have been praying for you I have to give you one more chance that kind of thing I haven't seen her in heaven that doesn't mean she's not and I understand what you're talking about There are groups actually that um that christ or holy spirit encourage people to start these groups There is a group of believers very strong Intercessors who really know christ and have prayed in different moves of god and everything They have a list of celebrities in hollywood probably close to 50 years Wow Without fail have prayed for every one of these people and I did see some of those people Because I met someone who was a part of that group and I was I was just overwhelmed at their Their fierceness to have these people have christ have opportunities to receive christ They were they actually stood there's something about standing in the gap Yeah, that's another thing also that allows them to use if there's some standing in the gap Especially if it's a prayer of agreement, especially if it's a group and that's what they do and have focused themselves to do that Then those people will be given an opportunity also. That's so good that you said that because last night, okay cat You didn't know that I had this experience, but last night I'm praying alone Either that or early this morning one of those two Kind of runs together, but I started that scripture came to me where jesus said so I looked for a man To stand in the gap so that I would not have to bring judgment I don't have that one memories either, but I said lord you only needed one man Or one woman to stand a gap and at that point he said so but I found then so I then I swear by myself that But uh, so he there are major issues and people's lives Where all god needs is one person to stand in the gap Yes, that true It is true. It is very true But because there's there's different there's different things that make it possible for him to use those keys Yeah, and even for the the keys and all that other stuff came up even before all that happened And we know in the bible how many were just one that prayed for whole cities to be saved you know and that And uh, I and I do know that that happened also and yeah And god had mercy on people because that one person's staying and stood in the gap and said please don't kill them Please allow them to live for the purpose of having an opportunity He did it back in the old testament and that's before christ came And god god himself had mercy on people So now with christ and his sacrifice is made and I am serving not in any way saying Everyone's going to be in heaven. That is not going to happen. Right. That's right. I don't hear you say because I've clarified that Will be in heaven that would not have been there Except that he had the chance to use these keys and I'm telling you I've saw hell And I don't talk about it a lot because in these days I mean he doesn't want me to talk a lot about that He wants me to encourage people get people empowered to know who they are in christ because some people They don't even have a clue what they carry in their self as a believer and what god has given them as a believer And I think that meaning I did a spirit force this last sunday Absolutely tells you what it means to be a believer. It's very very powerful I wasn't expecting them to say all that that I said I thought we'd have maybe a 30 40 minute meeting and it was far beyond that But people were weeping in the in the con in the conversation. They were they were laughing. They were weeping They were so empowered and found out things they never knew about their self being a believer But if you're going to be operating in spirit force, you have to know what is that? What is that spirit force? What does it mean? What what does it give us to be able to do for christ and with christ? Then you have to know who you are first before you can even start I mean if you're in the military Let's just say the military because we are in god's army. I'm not talking about heaven's army at all the host They were made for that purpose but ourselves as a believer We do have promises That christ gave us about who we are and the authority we had the dominion we have And and that we had power over the enemy so many scriptures and those people got a lot of those scriptures And so but it was very powerful that for the first time they knew who they were in christ And they had no fear about anything. They knew they had a story how to use that a story It was an amazing meeting So it matters that you make a difference in this world By by sharing things with people by loving people caring about people And yet you cannot partake of the darkness if you can speak to people and it's not really a wise Decision to have a very close friend who is wicked and evil you will not win them just because you're their friend And most of the time the opposite thing happens. It really does It just has just the way it is That if you're not a strong believer yourself and you're saying well, I'm going to keep this friend I'll keep talking to them about christ. I'm not saying don't do that But I'm saying as your best friend It is wise to have someone as a believer Or if you could partner with you in prayer maybe go out with you to to witness and stuff like that Well, that's that whole scripture about don't be unequally yoked, right? It can it can apply to marriages It can apply to friendships. It can apply to business Yeah, yeah, really really good cat awesome You know and I the whole thing that got Ian guy that story we've talked about it before several times it never gets old to me because God is by that testimony God himself of course knew this was going to be a worldwide testimony at the moment He was doing it. He knew that because why don't you want that as a testimony because he wanted praying mothers and sons and daughters and sisters and brothers to know you can stand for A person and he will absolutely he had the keys of hell death in the grave You said he had him in his hand Yeah, and and you can say to the lord I mean I with that I might say If I had a loved one that I as far as I knew had never received christ and now he's in a coma and dying I would say Jesus you have the keys to the hell death in the grave. I'm standing for this I'm believing I'm trusting you for this person salvation. They didn't want it with their life, but trust me in my heart I know they want it now. You know, I guess I'd pray along that line right anything else You would be a perfect thing to say to christ He's waits for words like that to be spoken He really waits for people to say things like that And you know, you know, you have friends you have family We jokingly used to call them the black sheep. I don't know people What is that? Yeah, I was about being involved in darkness and stuff and it's hard to be around them But you love them. Yeah, that's the best thing you can do is just stain them the gap and even say you need to I would say that say father Jesus, I'm standing in the gap for this family member. This is their name That I don't want to see them go to hell. I want them to see To receive jesus christ, please and thank you for making that possible Before they pass and go go to hell, you know, make sure that they get to do that Yeah, and they actually write that down. They'll write it down and they're gonna go after that person I'm telling you, they'll go after them while they're living and even at their very death Uh at that time when he can use the keys. He uses the keys Almost at the point of death or right past death people go. Well, that's not possible. Well, you're not god Yeah And you can make that either so don't say that you know things when you don't know anything about it I mean, he wouldn't have the scriptures that stand stand with that that practice to love people to pray for them And that you wouldn't want to see them go to hell and yes, he will because your words allow him To use those keys By satan satan had him so nobody could use them and i'm not making that up either satan had those keys And there was a time back in the now when he would just go take anybody out He wanted to you need to you need to hear both sides of those keys Why did christ take them? Why did he take them back? Why did he take them away from him? Because those were there's those were made for a certain specific reason to have but there's authority in those keys And but to get those keys back he had to die as a righteous person This had to happen so that he would go into hell and he would be blameless He would be righteous. They gave him every authority To take those keys away from satan who had no right for them But satan takes advantage of anything he can do He'll lie to you if you can to see if you can He'll do anything he can to you and get away with it for a long time But in these days people are getting more and more aware. I'm not having a part of that I'm not participating in that evil or that wickedness. I'm having no part of it. I serve Jesus christ and I serve him alone Um, the enemy doesn't want to hear words like that coming from you But he really doesn't like it that he lost those keys and he can in no way interfere with christ using them I just have to point out to you those keys are real and they do give christ The ability to go even at the moment of death or as someone is falling into hell or they're being buried Yeah, I mean what what that's real that story indicates because you know I was drilled in is drilled into me as a kid. It's appointed unto men. What's to die and after that the judgment So they would say This is not possible. I can hear Ian say yeah, we'll take that up with God because Because they would say at the moment of death that's it the scripture says is appointed man Uh, uh, you know once to die and after that judgment. Well the death process can christ use the keys people That's good. That's really good The great white throne judgment. I can even tell him if they would read the bible There's two judgments mentioned. Okay. This is like at the end of so at the end of someone's life They died. Okay, they died There's a great white throne judgment. That's for the wicked and the dead in hell Okay, and they're all taken out of hell at one time when time is going to be no more They'll all be taken out of hell and they'll stand in this long line before the father's throne the father's throne and uh And then is that at that time is you clearly see these are all of your sins This is why you're not allowed into heaven He's actually going to show you all that and then you'll be thrown into the lake of fire at that time Okay, so that's at the end of time. That's that judgment. That's at the very end of time There's another one called the judgment seat of christ. That's not about sin Okay, that's not about your sin. You're in heaven. You've been living in heaven But time is coming almost to an end when we won't need time anymore We'll still exist and we'll always be the christ But it does say in the bible you'll be judged for every wasteful word Okay, this is in heaven in heaven towards the end of this time when before the new earth is made This will happen. But the other thing that you'll be judged for the judgment seat of christ is Did you ever accomplish what he asked you to do like if he called you know, this is an actual calling And you totally ignored and you knew in your heart you were supposed to be a certain something It could be and it could be a bill where you decided to be a pastor But that's not what you were called to do or you were uh, you were you were a builder You chose that over being a pastor. That's what you'll be judged for Did you do what christ asked you what you how does that judge when you say judge again? The old me would have said if i'm going to enter into that kind of judgment and god's going to judge me It sounds like okay now i'm going to not be saved anymore, but that's not what you're saying No, no, i'm not saying that the judgment seat of christ are for believers Yeah, who are in heaven right that doesn't take away your spell So what is the judgment? Do I get okay? I'm just going to be silly about do I get demerits? Did they take one of the rooms off my mansion? What? No, no, no that's not what that's about okay people Rewards are given for what you do in your life Like if you just help people love people you're getting rewarded for if you give them kind words If you give them something to eat if you get the money to have food Those are some of the greatest things you do and you'll get a great reward for that I know you're not doing it for that reason. I mean i've done it my whole life my dad taught us to do that And I never once thought wow i'll get a great reward. I thought i'm so happy that I fed someone who was hungry I helped to feed their family to me. It's one of the greatest blessings I can do For the lord, but then there's people who continually decide in their flesh In other words, this is your own opinion or this is what you want And yet there's something very much so that christ needs you to do and you know this you know what you know You know that you were called to do something. No, this is going to be much easier over here. I'm gonna choose this. I'll choose this This is what happens. Okay. You don't get any reward. This is about rewards Okay, you won't get any reward for the thing you chose You're not going to get any and it says in the bible. You will see before yourself them burnt up the rewards And and I clearly know I know they're not even know I was called to be a photographer That's my gift. That's the thing he put in me. That's my passion to do. I've known it my whole life That thing gives me the greatest blessing and I'm excellent at it. I mean my photographs are beyond imagination Even in this natural realm And I don't use one of those cameras that do everything for you. I have the kind where you adjust every single thing on that camera You couldn't ate that photograph And from the time I was a little girl, I would make little boxes into cameras and my mama finally gave me her brownie camera I was beyond excited, you know, we didn't have the money back then to get things like that But so that my whole passion my whole life was to be a photographer and I didn't make money off of it I did it for free for I did I did like weddings. I did all kinds of things I did like weddings. I did all kinds of things I it's my passion That gift I use all the time That is one of the biggest blessings number one the gift he made you Whether it's the best baker or the best builder or the best singer or whatever it is That thing he put in you. He sends this as gifts every good imperfect gift what comes down from the father of Like us that's him sending us to this earth for that purpose because when you go to heaven You're going to use that very gift. He made you in heaven. So that's that's one thing. Okay But a call on your life That he has for you and you know that call and someone even does I feel like that you're supposed to you know And sometimes it isn't the five fold ministry Sometimes it's not it's not necessarily in the actual ministry But it's something to do with that and God wants you to do that and you know yourself and he's told you several times That's way too hard. I just think it's going to take too much and there's people that say that That that they don't love Christ. They just think their way is better. In other words, they want his will their way Not his will his way And so there will be people who will be feared and that this is the thing At the end of the bible in the book of revelations it talks about the judgment seat of Christ And it says he will wipe away all tears. That's good. There you go people You will if you did not Take the call he gave you that he really needed you to go on the earth He won't take away your mansion. He won't take you your place out of heaven. He won't take he won't do that But it clearly says and it causes the judgment seat of Christ and Christ will make that decision He'll show you and he will show you You these are the believers. Okay, this is what I called you to do. You knew you heard me You knew I really need to do that and yet you said no I'm going to do this instead and you said no. I'm going to do this instead You don't you won't lose your place in eternity. You won't that's not what he's talking about But the rewards you would have gotten for doing what he called you to do Would have been so much greater than what you chose to do and you may have helped people and that was nice and wonderful But that wasn't what he called you to do And then the gifts that you would have gotten But you can't you can't get him now because you didn't fulfill this other thing You said in the past many times and it's hard for in our flesh, it's certainly hard for me to See god, let's say that I went there and there were certain rewards that he showed me. I'm not going to get I it seems like as much as I was so grateful that I'm still in heaven I'm he's not it seems like I would have regret and yet you said there's no regret in heaven So I don't know like like I said those aren't sins People would have regrets for their sins. They may these are not about sins people. This is all about a reward And you can think of it this way you worked for a business all the heavens not a business It's the best way to describe the people if you worked in the business and you were hired to do a specific job And you yourself decided in your own self and this is like let's say this is a huge company a corporation You hired a significant job to be over something that was so important for the whole company And you go, you know, I just I don't think I like that. I'll do that later I do it later. Do you never do it? You actually do other things within the company that let makes you look busy and stuff do you think The person who owns that company they won't fire you necessarily but you think they're gonna be happy with you if these were things that you said I I'm gonna do this is what I've been hired for this I know this is what I was called doing this company and you didn't do it It's sort of the same thing in a different scale that they couldn't reward or give you what you would have had Had you completed what you were asked to do and there's a lot of people who do that in business too because I've been in business a long time But in heaven in Christ, he knows your life He knows knew you before you were born He saw you inside the father's your little spirit of life He knew you then and he knew things you were going to be asked to do and he was sending you for a certain specific purpose But you yourself that's called deeds done in the flesh So let's just say that's what this is about. It's about deeds done in the flesh That means your own mind decided you're a believer and you love Christ, but you just add in your own mind I have a right to do this instead. You know, I'm happy doing this more than this That's what I'm talking about and yeah, there's many people do that But and I'm not saying in every way. I was perfect, but probably for the last 50 years I have on purpose focused on what I was asked to do no matter what it was If it was even if it was hard, it didn't matter to me. I focused to myself. I'm going to please him I've read the please him then please myself Yeah, the when you talked about christian photography and I can relate to that because I was a photographer I I was a people photographer and I did weddings too. So I relate to that dream was the nature photographer is You know, she had an eye for that that I just don't seem to have but I could do portraits You know to you know, at least back then before Some of the more modern ideas came by But that's a very how do I say this? That's a very Unspiritual, unreligious gift Are you saying that? By that example, uh, are you indicating that almost all of the gifts are non spiritual non religious? Are there some people whose gift was specifically spiritual? How would you define it because that's a very secular gifted most all of the gifts? Yeah, I'm not talking about we're not talking about anointing. Okay, you're talking about Callings or anointing. I'm not talking about like you're anointed to preach. Yeah for healing and stuff like that Uh, that's an assignment you have because there is no five-fold ministry in heaven. That doesn't even go to heaven It doesn't go to heaven It doesn't mean you won't be rewarded for obeying god for those calls Those are very important calls the five-fold ministry very important on the earth But the gift i'm talking about is a natural gift He gave you that when you go to heaven you will use that gift to bless everybody That's how heaven operates. He made heaven to operate that way He knew that he gave enough gifts to people like, you know, you you make great food You design things that people love and can have a good time in Or um, it's all kinds of things that you need normally in your life or would enjoy in your natural life So i'm not talking about any kind of spiritual gift. Yeah, we're talking about natural gifts every good and perfect gift Okay, I could this one Cat the one the one that I a particular gift that I A particular gift that I had I don't know if it's if it's in this category, but even as a child as I as Newspaper route and I would make money. It was a thing with me. I didn't do it for reward. I didn't even know if I was being noticed I would give Gifts I'd buy disney that tickets. I went in a contest and I give it I had a gift of giving and I've always Pursued that is that any where is that on that kind of spectrum as far as gift? I would have to say that absolutely is a gift Steve because everybody does not think that way Okay, and my family was raised that way Any way you can help any way you can bless people, you know, we're here to bless people for christ But that is that is a gift To me it's like a pleasure to be able to help people with money I love to do that and I do majorly do that help individuals help families And it says it's more blessed to give than receive And I understand that it is a blessing to give but that is like a gift that is sort of like a gift Because not everybody wants to do that and there's some people who even cause treasure chest In the back of treasure chest that you have goods or you have ways to have goods But you use that to bless people you don't have to give all your money away and there's nothing wrong with having good things By the way, you need to know that If you earn in your life and you do and and take in money and well, there's nothing wrong with you having things Okay, god's not against that it gives you great things in heaven, but don't let them have you or control you Yeah, I think where I realized there was something about it It took me years to ponder that part of my life even my childhood Because I'm thinking the one that keeps coming to mind is the one where I earned worked really hard One of sales contests and then gave these Disneyland tickets that were expensive for the day, you know to my Yes, mother's sister-in-law or something. It was in their family. They were so so poor I I completely utterly Forgot about it because I would do that all the time I wouldn't and then I would about the time she was close to death She said I'll never forget what Steven gave me Disney that I guess that I go I did and then my mother reminded me I go. Oh, yeah, so it was like it was so natural to do it. I I've never even thought about it again It was very major for them and you touched the heart of some people and And they love that in heaven when anyone does that it doesn't matter who you are They love that and I'm telling you you're gonna get rewarded for that Since we're talking sort of like rewards and rewards aren't you don't do things to get the rewards That you're you cannot escape getting them. Yeah, it's a father's delight to bless you for all that you've done for him on behalf of him Helping people loving people caring people just caring for people Comforting people when they lost somebody in being kind These are things that maybe you don't think of as important, but they're important. Yeah. Well, I like that's that's I know That's going to touch a lot of people because there's a whole bunch of givers. I know because they give to us You know here at this ministry There's a big group of givers and I keep reminding people even if you give so much as a cup of cold water Which people when they give to these wells, you know, God's gonna remember that but Yeah, the rewarded is the reward itself was the giving that's where you know if your heart's right if it feels so good to give That's what you say, but you get a lot more than that in heaven And I'm not saying that I'm not bragging or anything. I'm just saying I've seen people get the rewards at the throne And uh, some from the father some from christ But the judgment seat of christings that people don't understand is is great when you have revelation on the word to explain the revelation Yeah, the pointer on the man wants to die And then the judgment well, that's clearly not the judgment seat of christ sets at the end of time It's not the great white dome judgment. That's what that's past all of that. So what judgment is it? Yeah No, when you die it says what it's a point on anyone's to die and at that moment. There is a Salvation that's heaven itself. That's that's a judgment is the judgment is are you going to heaven? Are you here in heaven? Do they can they use the keys to go to to meet with you and ask you do you want to receive christ? So that is what that scripture means the pointer on the man wants to die and Elijah and you know We we know that Elijah and Nina didn't even need that they didn't have to die Yeah, because of what they did for god He decided to take them to take them to heaven, but I'm telling you there's they are watching us all the time They're praying over us. They're encouraging us They're sending words to us through people or through holy spirit or even through angels sometimes and god does everything He can to reach people But I do know I love the scripture says That god makes himself known to every man. That means man woman. He makes himself. That's really good to know That's really good. So people but don't stop praying for your family or your loved ones or those who are life friends Or if you're in a group that's praying for a specific group And and there are many people praying for different groups who don't belong to christ right now And and and god will reward them for that, but it's important to know that that can happen I'm really really good. Well, let me get let's hit a few more questions here Um, these are actually all this is just you and me talking this whole time, which has been very delightful You know, I can hear you know, steve. I can hear I can hear people at the same, but what about heaven? What about heaven? What's going on heaven? What does heaven do? I can see people saying that out there Yeah, that's true. You they're pulling uh Okay. Well, here's a question that involves, you know, because I was never taught about three different judgments I'm still trying to get it in my head. So here's a similar thing about Where does what take place? So joe joe's the end if I'm saying that right joe's the end joe's the end Uh, we regarding the new heaven and the new earth. She can't mention how people in heaven will all be moving to the new earth So does that mean that heaven will be emptied of humans and also I'm so reading all all the wonderful things that she has seen in heaven Like the crystal sea are all those things also going to be On the new earth or do we get to go to heaven and see them? So how does that all work? That was an excellent question. I'm very excited. That's a lot, but I can answer all that And um, I just want to remind people that we are going to have a new he says there will be a new heaven and a new earth Okay, I do know yes the the current heaven, which is a spiritual world It's not a physical world people that is the father's house. It's where he has always been. That's why it's called his house He is willing to make a new earth Much more massive than this earth. I've had he's taken me to me glimpses of of this new earth It will be one mass. We'd be glam ass and one massive ocean Now I said it says in the bible. There'll be no more seas The seas on this earth separate the land masses. Did you not know that? Okay? There is the ocean the major ocean, but there are seas that come off of that And the seas separate land masses. That's why it's called the seas They won't need seas in in heaven in the new heaven because I mean the new earth Because it's one lay a mess with one massive water around it, but it will be a huge land mass And of course the crystal sea will always be where we're at because it flows from the father himself It comes from him. So wherever he is wherever he makes worse that will be where the source of water Okay, so there's one answer there will be an ocean on the new earth there will be it'll be much bigger than this this earth here and Uh, I have to just say what the scripture says go to the end the bible people He's going to it's going to be rolled away. It's going to be taken away And he'll make a new heavens the planets will be different. I've seen a few of those really Yes, I've seen those and the father himself Will leave probably be possibly the last person to leave His house because he's moving to the new one which will be the new earth will be our house It'll be ours and his together. It'll be all ours together It's not like we're just moving somewhere that belongs to him. It's going to be ours He is willing to leave that place He's always been in to move and be with us forever and ever ever on the new earth And it will never pass away the new earth will never pass away and the heavens heavens says it will be new And I will explain to you why because when it was made It was it was stretched out and it says it was stretched out. Christ was the word Made it the father spoke, you know, the physical realm and and so the christ the word Stepped out of the father and made that and what he did because there's a place in heaven where everyone goes all your family members Have already been there. They get to watch how they made it Not having itself because it always existed But when they made the physical realm in the beginning In the beginning means in the beginning of time. That's actually what that means It doesn't mean the beginning of things existing because they always existed father son, holy spirit Melchizedek the the forliving creatures the 24 hours have always existed In heaven a spiritual world. These are all spiritual beings It doesn't mean they don't have a body that just means that they lived in a whole realm Different from ours and that's the only realm there was So within this spiritual realm the word Jesus christ made a physical realm area So that father could send us from himself to a physical earth and exist there and have a body We didn't have this body when we were in him. We were just our spiritual body was little little thing inside him living in him playing in him And so he made this decision We're going to make a physical world and a physical realm that will support that world And we will stretch it out so the word steps on him and stretches out literally Almost looked like almost like a big scroll and he stretched it out like this around a great part of the cosmos And that was within that frame of where he made all that all the planets We currently see now the telescopes is part of that physical realm and and it operates in the physical He made this beautiful place. They started putting the planets out there the stars out there The nebula they call that space art and I do too like there's a big eye There's beautiful things out out in space just floating It's really like space dust that doesn't just on its own fucking the different beautiful things They make it. It's like their art that they gave us out there Those are all physical round things and so he captured he'll keep the physical realm Until He sends the last one from himself to be born Uh on this current earth that we're in now. So nothing's passing away now There's going to be no blowing up the planet. Everybody thinks it's going to happen now It's not going to happen now. We haven't even done the things Christ said we could do And so there's still several hundred years I don't know the exact date But there's at least probably a couple hundred years left in the physical realm to operate to have babies to do things and stuff Like that and for some time after this whole thing changes And trust me it's changing because god's not done with this planet. Okay. The lord made it It's his this is the earth is the lord's and the fullness there of belong to him They don't belong to any group not democrat or republican Not not evil or good. It doesn't belong to them. It belongs to him And the father has a time line of events Behind his throne embedded in the floor and there's things on there that have not happened yet And we're not going anywhere until they're done with it So there's still a lot for us to do here But the physical realm was created on purpose so we could have a body that we could know christ receive him and then Live in eternity with him So when the last one is sent from the father and that baby is born Time will be no more. This is at the tribulation at the end of tribulation during the millennial reign People still have children so it's all the way through the millennial reign the thousand year reign of christ that that makes you happy for me to say that There'll still be children born So the earth isn't going anywhere right now But when god is ready And that last child that he sent from himself is born in the physical realm Time will be no more. That means we will be in eternal in eternity We don't need a clock and calendar to go by to live by and we won't need this physical realm It will be blended it will be blended so that in your physical body you can love Enjoy and live your life and do amazing things. We can still visit the father the throne room will still be on the new earth It talks about the new city a new city through some on the earth And it will be much much bigger than it is now. So don't worry about what happens between the time He rolls away the old stuff like it says When he rolls it all away and puts it or does away with it if he has to hold us in his hand He will so in heaven and then when he makes the new earth and he puts us on the new earth first That's what's gonna happen We will be here first on the new earth all of us together We see christ and then the father will step on the new Jerusalem and you can see it coming down from the heavens on the new earth And then we will live an eternal life that will be so amazing and beautiful and creative And exciting and adventurous and we'll be with them. We'll all be together forever forever. Let me ask some follow-up questions on this on the spiritual Place of heaven It's a spiritual place and then we're gonna one day get in the new heaven and new earth where god will come Um, okay, so right when our family those who have a precedence are there in a spiritual place There are spiritual beings out there waiting for their physical body then but jesus is in heaven and he has a Physical body right now right so then when there's a new heaven and new earth And we get physical bodies to inhabit the new heaven and earth The new heaven and new earth is a physical place and from that point on Jesus will continue to be a physical Person and then the father comes down and lives as what a spiritual being on a physical plane You're really deep you're a deep person. Yeah, I tend to you're deep, buddy. You're I just gotta know that I've wanted to ask that for a very long time The spirit realm would be done away with it. I I mean here one the physical realm as we know it now everything on this earth is only physical everything the atmosphere is all physical It will be the spirit realm That of course the spirit realm we've all received christ who lived there who are with him Had the ability to live in the spirit realm likely did in the physical realm and so That's the way it's going to be because the spirit realm has always existed the spiritual realm Which we call the unseen realm, but I see the unseen realm all the time So I know a lot about how they operate what it looks like and things like that And he only made the physical realm So we could come down here and have a body and then through our eternity It's just wonderful to have a physical body and that physical body Like enic and an Elijah who live in a spiritual world with their physical body. They look really good I've seen both of them. They look great in that spirit realm. The father just keeps him and he can he allows or permits them to Remain there. They don't age. They don't get sick or anything. They look amazing We are glorified spiritual bodies Can operate and live in a spiritual realm Like we did in the physical realm like when I say that you walk on the ground You pick things you can eat stuff you can do things with people that are fun and exciting to do You still do that now in heaven in your spiritual body But the new earth The new heavens and the new earth will still be spirit realm But but with the ability for people with a physical body to live and exist in there You won't get married. You won't have children don't want that make you unhappy. You'll be very happy. Trust me You'll be happy to be there But that's what uh, that's what the end looks like the end of time When he says the end he means the end of time having to keep track of everything You only have so many hours. You're awake so many hours. You sleep Uh, you know, I never get tired in heaven now when I'm caught up in the spiritual body But I'm never tired in heaven. And so I don't need to rest. Um, nothing wears me out. I'm not tired It's just a different way of life. It seems like the way you describe it cat It kind of seems like You know six one half dozen the other so your spiritual being in heaven it feels like you're physical When you become down in physical being in the new heaven and earth it feels like you're It feels sounds like it feels the same either way It sounds like it's kind of the same in a spiritual world in your spiritual body Yeah, you walk through the doorways. Yeah Falls you can eat the fruit do everything that's in the spiritual world because you're in a A your spirit your spirit man is living there. Your body is what is resurrected Your soul never sleeps people. That's not right. They don't know what they're saying. I'm I'm not making fun of them They just don't have a revelation. Yeah But your spirit man and your soul Never have to sleep. They're both spiritual things You couldn't look inside a person to see their soul But I know what one looks like because he showed me a human soul And I understand how it operates and why it's important to guard it And not let wickedness and evil and darkness and it's important to keep that soul Uh, you know focused on him and and not let the darkness in you or Phil would light yourself as a believer You want to keep that light getting brighter, which it does but on the new earth We've already had the resurrection happen The resurrection has happened the resurrection of the dead has happened that will happen at an appointed time On this physical earth everyone who's died that belongs to Jesus christ Their physical body is coming back It's going to come back. You'll get it back people It'll be it'll be put together with your spirit man If you've been living in heaven, it's going to be put together with your spirit man And then it's called you'll be glorified, which means you can never get sick. You can never die You'll never sin. These are for people who know christ and you will be like that for all eternity So there's still different processes. We have to go through who are here But it clearly says in the day the dead in christ shall rise That is your body Because your spirit man with your soul have been living in heaven You're in you cannot separate a soul You can't take a soul out of your spirit. You just can't do it. Yeah The way it's made but your spirit man it says, you know, it clearly says to be absent from the body That means you die Your your spirit man was taken out of your body with your soul in it and it was taken to heaven This body dies, but it says the dead in christ. That's your body shall rise one day When that happens, all of our bodies will come up your spirit man will actually go into the grave How about this it goes in gets that body and it blows up that grave no matter where you are Whether you're in an urn or whether you're in the grave you're going to come out of that and And that will be a sight to see I think it'd be one of the most exciting things that will be happening One day when the dead in Christ shall rise that means you're going to get your body back and you look really good people They'll know you're you it says you will be known as you were known on the earth that says that in the bible So if you were a male, you'll still look like a male a much better one If you are female that doesn't change you rise from the dead you get your body back You're still going to be you people will recognize and know you So don't let people tell you other things. I'm going by what the word says And when people go and when you go to be with the lord one day and other people go to be with the lord You're going to be a like a 20 or 30 something looking One woman. Yeah, and we'll but will people look at you and go. Oh, there's cat Yes, and how will they recognize you? Will your hair be pink? How will they how will people know that's cat? I mean this the answer to this question is the answer to every other question related to Well, there's something probably you're you're not considered People in heaven are known for more than just their physical appearance. Okay Everybody puts out a frequency. You know, everyone in heaven knows exactly what I'm talking about You have your own frequency that is You comes out from you no matter where you go on heaven people can feel Or hear that coming before you ever come in heaven. You're walking on having people go cats coming I can feel I can feel her frequency and and this is a true thing that happens in heaven So maybe you didn't know you have a frequency right now coming out of you. You can't hear or see it Uh, but it's amazing just just to be able to do that. So people will know you first by that Wow And then when they see you they're gonna go well, you know enough people have seen me on there It's already and uh, but people will watching from heaven right now. They'll watch me from heaven sometimes when I'm speaking They want to see what I'm going to say is wild But some people will like to watch certain people who do things that uh on the earth They want to hear what words are going to speak for christ or what miracles are going to happen and stuff like that Or what will people learn? So when you get to heaven people still want to know you they've never met you Oh, come on and they'll have meetings where you share your testimonies. Really? It's amazing People are interested even now in your we like to know and hear about people and that doesn't matter What arena that is in they want to know they want to know about you and they like personal stories to be told from the platform They love it when I talk about my family They wild stuff the crazy stuff really good. I mean, yeah hear about it So, uh, even in heaven they want to know you in here care about so what we think of is Getting together and catching up on the news. It's not it sounds like it's not unlike that in heaven Hey, come and tell us what you did in your life. They want to catch up, right? Is it similar? Something like that only mostly they just want to know you don't want to hear what you have to say Yeah, how did you feel when that happened? Where did you think when christ did that for you? When you lived on the earth at that time wasn't that amazing what happened? They talk about things like you like maybe things in history or stuff like that Uh, they don't ever discuss evil wicked things. Nobody even thinks about that anymore So they're not going to talk about that part of your past They don't they don't do that But the fun exciting things everybody does and they just want to revive you even the disciples will want to know you The prophets will want to know you Even if you want to profit they want to know certain things that you did in your life to help people of Or just things that happened in the first of that time one last question one last question about if So dureen and I let's say we're we're both Graduated to heaven and our kids are still here And then our grandkids are still here and from time to time we Would probably see their special events probably at the same time dureen and I would probably see them at the same time Yes, we list they've been different but let's say They're cousins or whatever are there situations where someone will say well What's new with your kids on the earth and we catch them up of what we just saw was So and so just had a baby. Is that kind of thing go on in heaven? Were you catching that part? Yes, about family relations and stuff like that people want fellowship I mean people like fellowshiping here If you're in the right groups of people in fellowshiping it can be a wonderful thing But everybody fellowships in heaven they go, what do we do besides they thought all we would do was just bow down Right, there's many things where worshiping is bowing down. It's a lot more than just bowing on Everything you do in heaven you will thank him because he made it for us to enjoy Or gave us the ability to be together and do things together You never stop. It's kind of it's called a lifestyle of worship you worship all the time all over heaven You know for everything and it just automatically comes out of you and so it's not like down to the earth That you have to come to one building at a certain time of the week and that's the only time I never stop worshiping him. I never stop talking about him or talking to him If I'm by myself if I'm just anywhere I do that so and having that would be normal to me And that's what people do mainly they talk about christ the things christ did the revelation they get from him when he when they get up there And they get to meet him. There's just a lot of fellowship There's a lot of events that the father plans for all of us and having to be together and do it together There's things he plans just to do with you or christ do with you So it's not like it's a boring place. There's nothing boring about it. I was like, yeah, that's amazing Okay, a lot of things together and having they really do still do things together They do really really really really good. So good stuff. I never get tired of learning more about heaven You can probably tell Uh, well tell people we've got revealing heaven calm and KatKerrd calm I always like to have you kind of recap what people can get there They keep you busy. I'm sure they're good at your website and Yeah revealing heaven comm is where um our our store is it's where our events calendar is And I think there's testimonies on there that people give and there's a few other things that you can learn and watch There's a lot of things that you can click. I didn't design it. I don't uh I don't even know how any that I don't know anything about wi-fi sci-fi maybe more than wi-fi. I don't know but but I know heaven fi a lot I'm really good at knowing that understanding that but so the revealing heaven comm is for that Okay, we have a corporation god told us to have a corporation He wants us to create things that represent heaven things that are in heaven Like some of the things the white people wear uh things that they would have in their mansions We're going to have a whole new list over the next year and a half probably We'll have a home decor stuff that if you come in you'd think you were in heaven Nice He really wants that to happen. He wants that to happen on the earth And his point is satan has made all kinds of things that people wear they use They talk about they play with it. They probably shouldn't play with he said he wants stuff Related to heaven that people can hold they can wear they can use they can sit on Uh things in the wall that we'll talk to you about heaven The carpeting will say things to you when you walk on it We're going to have use light a lot because light's one of the main sources of things being built in heaven Or designed in heaven is with light. You're going to see that happen all over the world By the way, that's how this is going to happen in the new witty ideas and inventions You're going to see a lot of resources And things that we use every day plus spectacular things that will be done with light is going to come here because it's all over heaven on earth as it is in heaven Is what we're going to be seeing over this next 100 years. So Don't get on your rapture rug stick it in the closet because you've got a lot still left to do in this world And we're going to enter into the great stuff and to be great for for god on this earth but my other website is KatKerr.com And by the way, I don't have any other websites. That's it I have KatKerr.com and that's where you learn a lot of things about the spirit realm and different things what things look like In heaven on there There's all kinds of interviews on KatKerr.com and it is the one and only and I really want to say this There's no other place out there on the planet where you can give to me personally Then KatKerr.com. So if you find some other other places made up with my face on it and they say things on it that is not me Yeah, and I will never ask you I will never appear on a video and say please give this much to this ministry Or if this place is doing these awesome things and I don't do it on purpose because I don't want you giving to people Who are out there and damn you so I don't do it And people actually contact us. Was that you saying to give to this orphanage? No, that wasn't me Is this who said please give this money this person who had an accident?

You Well, good morning from the Pacific Northwest in the state of Oregon. It is Wednesday, September 21, 2022. We're sorry, we're a little bit late today. We try, but every once in a while we don't make it. So it's going to be a good show, probably worth the wait. So welcome to the broadcast. We're going to bring Kat Kerron in just a moment. A quick couple of announcements. First of all, people that have questions for Kat, we still continue to accumulate those. If you'll pop that up there, go to questionsforkat.com. You see down there below, questionsforkat.com right there. Just like at Cinerons, questionsforkat.com. And then you'll be able to fill out a little tiny form and you type in your question in a simple, keep them really short so that we can just ask the question. We can't get the whole story, but just get your question boiled down to the simplest as you can possibly make it. So all right, I'm going to bring on Jeff here. Jeff is going to talk about the clip channel and how you find things on our clip channel. We're going to use Kat as an example. So Kat, go for that. Okay. So hello, everybody. So yeah, Kat, we've been made aware by Kat's team that she's been getting a lot of questions about different topics that Kat has talked about a lot. So I'm going to direct you guys over to Elijah Clips. So I'm going to do both YouTube and Rumble. So if you prefer one or the other, but they're a great resource. So first off, if you type in youtube.com and you just type in Elijah Clips in the search bar right here, as long as you spell Elijah and clips right, you'll come right up to it. This is the actual channel right here. Here's a couple of recommended videos. But if you click right on the channel, that'll take you to the homepage of Elijah Clips, the Elijah Clips channel. So this little, this little looking glass, this little magnifying glass, if you type in this and say you want to know about pets, you're like, what happens to my pets when you go to heaven? Just type in pets, hit enter, and it's going to show you all the different recommended videos regarding that. See cute little puppies and all this good stuff. So if you want to find out what happens to your pets, you can type in, what about a loved one and suicide? Same thing. You can type in suicide right there. Paul has done a great job of tagging these videos so that it makes it easy for you to search. So again, that's for YouTube, really easy. And if you ever curious to get a little lost, just come back to this video at like the three minute mark and it'll, you'll be able to see our tutorial. So if you're on rumble, it's a little bit different. Rumble is still in development right now, so it's not as refined as YouTube. So if you type in Elijah Clips in the search, you'll get a bunch of recommended videos. So if you just click, see it says Elijah Clips here, Elijah Clips there. If you just click there, that's going to take you right to our homepage, our channel of all these recommended things. Unfortunately, there's no magnifying glass. So the easiest way to do this is to type in Elijah Clips and then you go, hmm, pets, hit enter. Same thing. So what I would do in your search for that is rather than using the actual designated magnifying glass for the channel, it just does it for rumble as a whole. But if you type in Elijah Clips space and then whatever topic you're curious about, it's going to pull up all those videos again, suicide, celebrities, you know, whatever the case may be. So yeah, again, those are some great resources you guys. And hopefully that'll, that'll answer your questions so you're not submitting. I would, my advice would be to check either on YouTube or rumble first if you have a question and then look through those videos. They're shorter clips. You're not having to sit through like an hour and a half long episode. They're going to be five minutes, two minutes, whatever. Great resource. Check that out everybody. Happy watching. Thank you, Jeff. Yeah. You gotta realize that that we've been doing this every week for two years, basically almost two years or just right at the two year mark next month or so month and a half. And so we've answered literally hundreds of questions and some of them keep repeating over and over. So that that's what Jeff was saying if you try and find it first, if it's already there, because we're always looking for new questions that haven't been said so we can continue continue to populate both YouTube and rumble with those questions and answers. So again, go to their questions for cap.com right there. If you have a question for that and we'll get you on that. We have a list. These are all of our questions from viewers and we start going through them trying to be pretty methodical about getting getting to your questions. All right. Thank you so much. And now it is time for cats without further delay. Let's bring Wednesdays with Kat and Steve and here we go. Hello, I got my pink tie on free cat today. I think this is probably the first time in my entire life I've worn a pink tie. So only for cat only for cat. It looks good on you. Well, thank you. You're very kind. So I see your new shirt. Tell us about your new shirt. Yeah, we we have just of course, return from open the heavenlies and if I sound a little forced to solve the yelling I was doing, you know, it was good yelling. Really? Yeah. And Rod Parsley was just wild people. I mean, he looks like he's 20 years younger. No knew this, but he had been sick for several years. I didn't know it. And now he's so much better. He's healed. He's well. His wife was there too. They were so happy. And he was excited to be there with all these wild prophets. I think he's a friend of Hank Coonamans anyway, but I'm telling you what he got everybody stirred up about right now what God is doing now. And I think it really surprised me, but it was awesome. But every single speaker had the same the same message just in different ways that the end is not here. And you better be ready for what God is about to do because it's going to be powerful. I mean, I every meeting I got to go to to hear this because I was I loved even more excited. So I do know that God is up to things and I know there's a couple of people later who actually had some kind of inside information. So if you get a chance to go watch any of those, maybe go to Lord of Host website, you might be able to see some of those meetings that we had, but they were really, really awesome. They were amazing. I didn't get to see yours yet. I'm going to try and get I saw Kent Christmas's presentation was circulating. Were you there when Kent spoke? I don't think it was. I think I had just arrived. So I was actually rest. That was my only day I had to rest. Yeah, so I rested that day. But I'm sure that my team was there and they loved everything that they saw. We took like six or seven members of our team to handle the products table mainly, but they all got to attend the meetings to so it was wonderful. Now you're going to talk about your shirt. Tell us about your shirt. Can people order that shirt. Yes, they now can order it will be on our website in about a week. Okay. We just returned from the website. There's several new things actually that you'll be able to see there. I'm sure we got plenty of things in case, you know, people want to order them for Christmas or something. But I can tell you that out of anything that I ever wear that pen that one can I usually wear all the time. I didn't work today because I have this. I don't do demons. It opens more conversations. And a lot of other people have talked to said they say the same thing it opens conversations people. I mean, I don't do demons. That means I don't participate with them and I don't holiday them in my life. That's what that means. That means I serve the living God. And what an opener, you know, for that but they get where they can't stand not saying something. And even in the grocery line or even walking down the sidewalk people always ask me about I don't do demons. So we thought we'll just make t-shirts this time and take them and I'm telling you what they are amazing and they certainly are going to give a point of view from you. Well, you're not bashing people or what they believe, but you are taking a shot at hell. And, you know, that lightning bolt reminds Satan how he was kicked out of heaven and unseated. And so this is probably going to be one of our best sellers for this Christmas time. But we're going to keep an inventory because it's really a thing that's in demand. The cops are the tumblers. The pins are we have car magnets, which people will take pictures of our car because we have several different the magnets that we sell on the on the car. People will come up behind. We see taking pictures of them. So you're making this statement without even have to verbally say something. When you have a car magnet, this thing is about this big and this is I don't do demons. And then we have other ones say wonder women doing signs and I love that. I love it. Yeah. And we had those also for our event. We had car magnets and we had some other things. I think I don't know if you have a tote bag yet. Jen's pointing at something. I don't know what she's pointing at, but we did have some wonder women stuff. That's our women's group. And we're redesigning the logo for our men's group because we plan to have both of those. And of course, this may be too shiny to see, but if you've read the book, you know that one of the most important things that was put in that book was the portal in heaven where everybody who lives there goes to pray over their family members or just there's rose petals. It sounds wild, but there's rose petals all around and big urns and it's got peace in them. And when they throw them over through the portal, peace will flood onto people wherever they whoever they're trying to send those that that word of peace to them. But this is also something simple and it can't even hold a straight. You can see it. Yeah. Oh, that's the portal, right? That's the portal. Yeah. And it's the portal in heaven. It's got columns and at the base of the condue. See, like, what do you call them, Jen? Monitors. Yeah. And on the one side, it shows people who are in heaven when the family members are born again, they can watch it on that very those columns. And at the base of the other condue, let them know when they're coming home. Now, Kat, on that picture, while you have it there, the little tiny stick figures almost down the very bottom, those are whole. Those are bodies of people standing. So that could be like, that could be like 50 bodies of a person sitting on. Are these all different people from different families looking in the same portal, but they're only seeing their own family. And is their picture of their family filling that circle in their eyes or are just a part that they're looking at it. If you if you know how to actually seeing them. Okay. I'm not talking about the monitors. I'm talking about what they see. They're standing. There's usually about 1000 of them in there at a time. Okay. Okay. And so they're even with 1000, they're all seeing many different things. Yeah, most of them, if they're there, whatever's in their heart, they'll see their family number that they're thinking about or want to pray about or something. Or if it's somebody's birthday on earth, they go there on their birthday, even though they don't keep time in heaven. They know when and heaven when that's going to be their birthday and they go there and sing happy birthday to them. And then they go to different places in heaven and get gifts and put them in their mansion that's being built. So this is a really phenomenal thing. It connects everyone who has anyone in heaven. This place is something that's probably one of the most used places in heaven, besides the throne room. And, and so yeah, there's a lot of activity that goes down there when somebody gets born again. Everyone there sees that and they all start shouting. They celebrate that very moment. They see their family member getting born again. This is one of the things that they go there for. But it is a beautiful place and it's called the portal. And I'm going to see what it says here. It says heaven is cheering you on. God's love from above. And I've signed it. It's already pre-signed. It's like an eight by eight inch thing. I'm not really good. I'm the good. I'm not in marketing. Anyway, that's what this is. And it's in, it's in my book. It's in my first book. And you can see this image, but we added color to it. And, and Ken, are there, are there many of these portals in heaven or is there one that everyone goes to? There was many. Okay. They're all over them. They're buildings you can go to, but there are some that are outside. Okay. They're outside that you can go to outside and see them. You walk up to them and go look down over and see your loved ones. So they're not really so separated from, from us as of course we are from them. Right. Yeah. Well, and then Kat, if let's say you and in heaven, you won't be married. Let's say you and being in the gun home to be at the Lord, your best friends now in heaven. Do you, can you just be having any old, because there's not days and nights, but you're walking in heaven at some point. And then do you just say, Hey, Bing, let's go see what the grandkids are doing. Is it at a whim or are you directed by God to go look? Well, most of the time it's your own choice, but there are times when he lets you know he'll let you know about to come home to heaven. If you want to view it from here, then you can run out to the gate and meet them. I always wondered as a child, how would somebody know I was even there? Well, he showed me and it's these beautiful buildings built for that very, very purpose and people go there. They'll sing to their loved ones. You know, it's just beautiful to see the fact that they can still see their life. Now, they don't see any, you know, they don't see any of the, the any attacks or anything like they don't see that. That's not what this is for. This is a way for they can tend to speak over their family members and to know when they get born again. Any important day in their life, let's say your grandchild was graduating, your grandchild was graduating, you would be able to see that from here. A baby is being born. You would also be able to see that from this place in heaven. So they're kind of kept updated on things, important things in your life here on the earth. It's really a beautiful thing that God has made possible. The great cloud of witnesses, remember when it talks about that? Oh, yeah. You know, run your race. Don't, you know, run your race and remove every weight that keeps you from the end or the goal of that race. Yeah. This is the great cloud of witnesses that surround this. This is one of the ways that the great cloud of witnesses would be surrounding you. Oh, okay. So because I would have pictured almost in the cloud and their witnesses are almost in the air above you, but you're saying this is how this is what it actually looks like. One of the ways. One of the ways. One of the ways. Yeah, and meaning is I've actually seen clouds. Well, people would call it a cloud. It's probably the glory. Yeah. Every now and then I see this cloud of witnesses in a meeting like way up high above everybody watching. Not very often, but I have seen that and other people have seen it. I think Heidi Baker. At one time she had meetings or a facility in Florida. I think it was like mid-floor or center, center Florida. And at her first graduation from this place that she had gotten to have, I don't know how many weeks you were there. To complete a course, but they actually captured a picture. Literally. A lot of witnesses. And I think if you put maybe if you Google cloud of witnesses, Heidi Baker, you may be able to see that yourself. That would be amazing. That's what that is. That would be amazing. So what we've got a bunch of questions, but do you have anything you want to talk about before we get into more questions? Just exciting and exactly what God has said that people are starting to come forward. We can't name those names and some we don't even know. We do know there are several people right now who are turning to be witnesses against, you know, the one to destroy us. And by the way, just so you know, Kat, we're not going to be on YouTube now until December. So if you don't, if you don't want to speak in code right now, you don't have to just, I'm just saying. Some of these people I don't know, because I'm not privy to every single wicked individual who's paying for things to be done or actually in charge of recruiting people to do them. They have planned this whole thing well planned that you can tell. And probably since when we were all celebrating, I'm quite sure they decided we're going to stop all this. We're going to take over. But by the way, every single speaker spoke against that plan and they all said, we know God has got a plan himself. We know the miracle is going to be some said reset, some said reestablish some said that God's just going to change all of it. So I think the fact that we were all in one accord, not having talked to anybody, I never call someone and say, what are you going to talk about? I would never do that. I have to only say what God's saying, you know, as a prophet and most of these people didn't know until they heard what they were saying. So it made it very exciting for everybody. But that was their heart that it is not over. There's too many things left on this earth. God's not done with this earth or with us or with the body of Christ or actually with the world. And so I think that was the most exciting thing that happened in the last few days was being at that meeting. I was a warrior Alabama at the Robin Bullock place. What dates do you know? I think it's a, I think it's like, I think it's like 15, 16, 17 or 16, 17, 18. If you go to Robin Bullock site, you probably see that we'll have it up on ours pretty soon. But it's this next month. I'll be there for a couple of days speaking. Okay. Awesome. We're Alabama. Great. Great. Yeah, we had a lot. I guess I won't say the date. But since I'm not going to say the date and it's not that date. So I'll just say it this way, because we try to keep Robin under wraps as far as when he's going to be broadcasting at his request. It's a security thing. But we gave him a date in the future that we would like him to come on the program yesterday. And God told me it's going to be a breakthrough day yesterday and I've had all kinds of stuff. But so Julie invites Robin through his through Krista. I think it was the one, he's, we'd like him to come in on this date. Yeah. And, and, and Krista calls back and says, I want to throw a little monkey wrench or whatever word she, she says, we would like to come. Robin would like to come two days in a row, which he has never done. And he, we named the date, which we won't say just again for security. We won't say. Yeah. Exactly. Sure. That's why I asked Jen. I know it is next month. Yeah. It is sometime next month. So you're good for the, for the church meetings. There's no question on that. That's not an issue. It's like there, there was an issue with him broadcasting live and people were in the area, that kind of thing. I won't, I won't go into detail on that. But well, listen, I've got some questions and I've got a question from a 12 year old. If you're ready. So we said kids first. So here's, here's one for her for Olivia. And then I'm going to, I've got one that I've been saving to ask you. So, okay. So Olivia H 12 says, will homeless animals also boy, I almost feel, I almost feel the compassion of the Lord for this little girl. Will homeless animals also go to heaven and who takes care of them there? For example, are they adopted by families or are they cared for in a center? So she's worried about the homeless animals, which is a really sweet thing. What would you say about that? I do know what happens to the creatures, all the creatures, but I've never a child always or a young person always asked the most exciting questions that no one else asked. I guess that's what is in their heart. Being young, you know, they would think about the creatures and I can just say this. God loves every one of them. He loves every creature he made. And the ones that have a soul in the spirit, of course, are going to be in heaven. And that's why he had no output, every animal or species that had a spirit of life in them. He had them put them on the arc so that they'd be able to replenish the earth and then, you know, create more of them. So I would have to say that all of them go to heaven, which might be quite a shock to people. Heaven is bigger than this entire galaxy. There's plenty of room for all the creatures to come there. And anything that has a spirit and a soul will live forever. Just so you know that not just humans, but all the creatures that have that. And I can tell you, we know our cats do because they have personalities, they have likes, dislikes. They make their own decisions every day about what they'll let you do with them. And, you know, you all know that you're a pest to that. But even the other creatures, of course, I don't know about the adoption thing. I know that they will go home with you for a while to your mansion and visit with you. And it's not like a zoo. There's no place where anything is enclosed or kept enclosed. No creature has. And anyway, behind any kind of cages or bars, they have different domiciles and areas that they live in heaven. But you can go there and you can take them home with you for a while if you want to. If they decide to stay, I'm quite sure the father would not care if they stay, but they're all cared for. And if he knows when one, I think his point is he knows when one sparrow falls to the ground that they died, he knows it. Well, he wouldn't keep notice of something he didn't care about. Yeah. And you think about how many, how many creatures and animals did he put on the art compared to people? Yeah. Well, that's a good thought. That's a good thought. Wow. So he needs to know that they're all loved, everyone in their love. And there is a way you can go, go where they're living, wherever their habitat is in heaven. And they have an area that's there and you can go visit them and take them with you if you want to for a while. And if they want to go back, they'll just go back. But they're all fine. And God takes care of all of us, the creatures and his sons and daughters. Wow. Now you said something that was the right thing to say. You didn't know it was coming in. You talked about the size of heaven and the size of things related to God. And, and you talked about the new Jerusalem, the new earth is going to be so much bigger than ours. Okay. So I got to studying this and I've seen this before I got back to it. So I'm going to ask you this because I know you've seen the new Jerusalem. I don't ask you about it. So in Revelation 21 16, it says this city was laid out like a square. As long as it is wide, he measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 steady and length as wide and high as it is long. So here's. So I researched what these stadia are. So here's what it really, really is the new Jerusalem on this earth is 1400 and some miles wide 1400 and some miles long and 1400 some miles high, which is the height of some of our satellites. In other words, I really, then I Googled it and I doubled it checked and triple checked. In other words, you look at the continental United States and you take 60 percent of our land mass of the United States. That's the size of Jerusalem approximately. That's right. Isn't that amazing? So tell me more about it and how could it be? I mean, of course, again, because God said, what, what do you see 1400 miles in the sky? It's like, why would you even need to go high if you've got the earth? And what would you, what, what have you seen? Oh, because a number one of the amount of the money, the many people who will live, we're talking about the new earth right now. Because the new earth is where that will be established. That is like God's not just God's new home. He calls it our new home. So the new earth, it will be all of our home. And that's what we'll call it. This is home. And I tell people it can exist only because of the greatness and how huge the new earth is. I mean, the scope of it. And I'm sure it's bigger than even our galaxy could probably be half the size of the whole cosmos. It is so huge that it can of course sustain and nothing's going to go upside down or something because it's so high. But I kept telling people it is big. The new Jerusalem, the walls are beautiful. The gates are always open. There's never any shut gates. The gates will never be shut on the new earth of the city. They probably will call it the city of God or the new Jerusalem, whatever anybody else calls it. That's just a city. Now I have to tell you that as big as that thing is, it's only a city. There's many cities in the new earth, many cities and places to go visit, do things on the new earth. And that's one of the reasons why it is so big. And there's no sun or moon. It's lit with his glory. So it's spectacular. It shoots from the ground. It shoots from everywhere. All of the trees have light in them. And there's there's no darkness on it. There's no shadows really. If the light comes from the ground, there's not going to be shadows. And people are actually quite excited about that when they walk around in heaven. Now there's not shadows because the light, the glory comes from the very core of heaven, which is a world. It is a world and all these worlds were made after the lightness of that. And so it's just huge. All I could think of was how big it was. And it was so high up, but you have to understand there are some angels. There are angels that are several thousand feet high. Wow, really? Yeah. And they're in heaven now. They're in heaven now. They're in heaven now. You have to remember that in the very last days, there will be an angel that stands with one foot in the middle of the ocean and one foot in the middle of the land. And they declare things in the last days. I believe it's in the book of Revelation, but there are angels that high right now. Even just some of the hosts are like 150, 200 feet high. And their dwellings, they have it called their barracks. It doesn't look like what you imagine barracks here. Yeah. But even the army of heaven has their own area defined area that they live in and they run their missions on or their assignments on from that place. Michael's headquarters is a massive castle like structure. Also, it is, it is like shroud, not shroud is not a good word. I guess clouds of glory, but it's dark glory. People are saying it says God says I have myself in my dark clouds of glory only because they're not white clouds. These clouds are like a camouflage for him. We're talking about the father now and it looks like a million peacock feathers with eyes in them. Really? That whole cloud sometimes you'll surround yourself with that. But Michael's headquarters, even like I guess the circumference of where you would normally have walls around a structure or an area are these clouds of dark glory with these peacock feathers with living eyes in them. And that's what the purpose for that is. So just walking around heaven and singing and having it helps you understand the scripture, some of the scriptures. But that new Jerusalem is really amazing. Very beautiful powerful. That's where the throne will be. The throne will be there and other things will be there. But there's so many other things to do and see on the new earth, which is massive. It's just massive compared. I mean, there's no planet out there that's this bigger than that's going to be the new earth. It's beautiful. Well, I mean, it's like, and I'm trying to figure out, I don't know if your eyeballs in the spirit can see, you know, because the Empire State Building, then they made the Twin Towers and then the new Freedom Tower that took place and then Dubai and some of these places they've got the tallest buildings now on earth and there are probably a hundred and a hundred and some floors and like, but still you're like a thousand and some feet up, but this city goes 1400 miles. It doesn't say the sky above it is that it says the city dimensions are. So is there anything more you can tell about what's up there in the sky? Literally sitting on the new earth, it literally will come down and he says, and I do know if the father had said to me, don't worry about when everything starts to be taken apart and then put back together. He'll keep you safe because a lot of people go, well, if this is gone, where are we going to be between there in the new earth? Well, he will. He does impeccably everything ready. He himself, when it's ready for things he's going to do, it's going to be ready. No one's going to have to worry about being left out or lost or something like that. They say these things to me, but no, he's not. He knows where every hair on your head is. He's going to know where you are, no matter where you are. It's going to float around. So he will have a place for you, but he's going to make the new earth and put all of us on it first. So we will be on the new earth and then he will climb on this new Jerusalem city and come down out of the heavens. And it will sit literally on the earth and it will be that high. It will be that high because the earth will be so massive. It's not going to be. And you can imagine that shows you right there how big the new earth is going to be. Something that many miles high can sit and sit there perfectly because he made them perfectly. And so it's just, you're in awe of seeing it. But the thing that you know, the most is those gates are always going to be open. People will live all over the new earth. It'll have one land mass and an ocean. The ocean will always exist. The seas will not. The seas separate land masses. We told me the seas separate the ocean is the biggest body of water on this earth. And yet there's rivers that run off of it, rivers that run off of things. And the land masses, when the land was broken up, the original earth, when he made it had one land mass and it had an ocean. But when that whole thing happened in the earth, then later on, you know, verse two, there's, there's a mess going on. Not a mess, but it's hidden under the total water. You can't even see the earth between one and two or probably millions of years, literally millions of years of life here on this earth. And when God got ready to remake it and he, when he put it back together and he said replenish the earth, he left the land masses separated. All he did was take the water off of everything. And then he began to build up the land again. And then he put the greenery and the fish. You know, he did all that. And then he made man on the sixth day. And then he, of course, he did make the sun and the moon and verse two, verse one, he didn't need the sun and the moon in the beginning was when he made it the first time people. You'll find that out when you go to heaven. You get to go see how he did all that much. All that happened. But this new earth will be so much bigger than the one we're on now. Do you happen to know cat if, because I know in heaven, I think you said sometimes you can think yourself in a place or walk through a portal and you're, you're another side of heaven. Will that still exist that, that ability once you go into new earth or are you more now you're in your, your flesh, but it's glorified body. You can do the same thing. You'll be able to do the same thing you did before for transportation around. Okay. You do it around heaven. You'll be able to do that on the new earth. Okay. Okay. So we don't know if there'll be even the necessity or, or let's, let's have a group. Let's all go somewhere and take a flight from one end of the city for a couple hours. You know, and today's travel would take you a couple, two or three hours, three or four hours to get to 1500 miles. Yes. On the one city. Well that where do you have you seen planes or are they simply not necessary? Maybe you haven't seen planes because people like to have them and some are piloted by you. Most people get a star cruiser and they're called star cruisers. So none of that was made up by Star Trek or Star Wars. Okay. That was always in heaven first and it runs on light and they will still have them on the new earth. That'll still be a way people love to be able to do that. There's going to be trains, but not trains like we have here. You will step into beams of light. It will still take you around to the other side of on the new earth. There's going to be even more ways of transportation on the new earth than there even is in heaven right now. You can travel on light on bands of the rainbow. You can travel through a star cruisers. They have things that can take whole groups like I call them. He calls them MMS like a mobile mansion type thing, but it's like it's like a bus, but it goes in the air, not on the ground. So I would imagine, yes, you'll have flesh, but that flesh will be glorified. It'll be glorified. You'll be supernatural at that time, really supernatural at that time. And so I'm sure that will open up even more things for you. You can go visit other planets without a ship even to go to those other planets. I know that for sure. Yeah. There'll be a new a new heavens and heavens is like planets. It's going to be a new whole planet system and everything put out. Some will be for certain things to do on just those planets and you'll go there for like vacation instead of just yeah. Well, Kat, will people be on the new earth inventing things? Will technologies be being invented? Or is that stuff all invented? Well, I have to absolutely the father being the great creator with his son, Jesus Christ. He and the word made everything that ever was made. Father did it by speaking and then the word made it. We will more and more be able to create things, places and things like that. I know for a fact he told me that we would he'll send this like to a planet. Now we can't, we can't create people. We're not going to create other things like that. The place needs to go for people to enjoy and do things. You get to use your creativity. I'm saying not building something taking 10 years, but taking probably like, you know, I don't know. I don't know if there's minutes or hours or something like that, but it would be so much quicker to create design things and create things and put them places. Very good. Very good. Now there was one. Make sure I get to that. I couldn't tell if it was a child because it was under the 12 year old. But the question is, this is Cherie was Queen Elizabeth II aware of any of the pageantry on her love and respect. The world was showing her. Did she see any of the processions? Her family mourners or services? That's her question. The answer is yes. That's absolutely yes. I know she is in heaven. She did make it to heaven. And the father actually really honored her because her whole life that she was ruling allowed Jesus Christ name to be spoken, the churches to take place. She honored who he was and she did belong to him. And so I think one of the greatest honors he gave her was that she did that in her ruling and what she had made decisions on her own. As the as a ruler over that whole country that she opened it up at all times to Jesus Christ. And so that was a he honored her greatly for doing that. And so yes, everyone who goes to heaven, they do see that she watched the actual service. But I'm sure she got to see most all the things that went on in her honor. I'm sure that it blessed her very much. Awesome. Now, Janet's asking this question uses the word portal, but she's not talking about the portal that people in heaven looked down on. She's talking about an open heaven portal from the earth, you know, where people say, man, it's an open heaven over this place. So she's saying, how can we get open portals of heaven over our home? You can. It depends on how you're living your life. Number one. What do you allow to be shown in your home? What do you play on music in your home? What words are being spoken in your home? I mean, people use a lot of profanity. Heaven's not going to come hang around. They're just not because profanity is the is the only language spoken in hell is profanity. It is hell's language. It is not acceptable in heaven. No one does that in heaven. And so heaven will come where they feel like they're welcome or the atmosphere is similar to where they live in heaven. But I've been in people's homes and I saw open heavens over their home like right over. I could look up and see through it like through the ceiling of their home. I could see angels swirling around that place. I saw them on their property. This one man and I won't give his name because of course it's that's a national privacy and it was in Reading, California. And this man I was invited to speak in his home. The one time I went by myself, which they won't ever send me by myself again. 10 days and 15 intercessors from Bethel. They invited me to come and speak. And so I went I stayed for 10 days with one of the one of the intercessors and got to know her well. And well, she was a naturalist and eight, you know, gray matter. I know I'm making fun of her and I love her and she knows she laughed all the time. But finally, my staff called and said, has she anything? And then she said, well, no, I'm trying to get her to eat better. And they said, we told you she not going to eat that stuff. She's not going to eat avocado, chocolate pudding. Well, then I'm going to happen. It's not going to happen. So I just was fasting the first few days and Margaret said, get her to an in and out burger place. I know that. That's good. Wow. But but yeah, I was invited to a Catholic bookstore to speak. How about that? To a what? The Catholics love the books. They love. Wow. They so believe in the supernatural. They believe in Christ. And in heaven, I mean, they do. I never, I never said that Mary was anybody more than Jesus's mother by you. You need to know that. And I said, well, if I talk, I have to say what the father's saying. And they said, we don't care. We're hungry. I think they had like 90 people in that bookstore, the Catholic bookstore, and they had my book already on their shelves. So it was quite interesting. You know, that whole group of people. But I did let them know, you know, Mary is very much loved in heaven and highly honored in heaven. Yeah. But she worships Jesus Christ. He had to die as her as her Lord. And that's why he gave his mother to John. Mother, behold your son, some behold your mother. And so that transfer had to take place. So he died as her Lord. And so anyway, I did mention that nobody care. They were all so excited that I was there talking about heaven. Some people had interpreters with them. But it was a Catholic bookstore, but I was invited to this businessman's home. And he had meetings there all the time. And it was the first time I ever saw the river of life flowing in someone's home. Really? I said, I didn't even know this man. This man is living his life right. Because I have never seen, I've seen it in mine sometimes, but never seen it anywhere else. This man was really living his life wholly on purpose. He was a great businessman in Reading and they couldn't get the people in the home. Some of them had surrounded the home. We're sitting outside and I went, wow. And I said to him, do you realize that your, your own angels are surfing on the river of life in your home? He said, yes, I knew that. Wow. And he was Catholic as well. You're saying I don't think he was Catholic besides, besides that place being invited to speak. It wasn't planned. It was totally unplanned. Okay. People found out I was there. I would speak in the intercessors, backyards. It started in their home. When you have 150 people show up, you can't just keep it in your home. Right. So they moved it outside. It was just crazy. The response from the people that were so hungry. But one of the places I remember very well was the Catholic bookstore. And how gracious the people were and how excited they were to receive heaven culture and what heaven is all about. But this businessman was another person that I did get to speak in his home. And they had so many people show up. They were, they were, they were filling the streets with their cars and everything. But that was very significant that he did have what she said, an open heaven over his home. And you can create a habitation for heaven is what they call it. They don't come and live there forever, but they'll come and go in, in the presence of your home. They want to see your life. They want to see who's invited over to hear about Christ. And so that's not an impossible thing. And does the person, does the person ask God to, you know, say, I'll do my part, but could you bring an open portal over me? Or does it just happen? And you're from what you've seen. I'm going to start creating a habitation for heaven. And then automatically that portal is one of the things that would be established over your home. Okay. Good, good, good. All right. Aaron is asking, he said, he or she can maybe be one or the other. I heard Kat Kerr teach about the temple in heaven. Is that a different place from the throne room of God? And then I want to add to that. Is it a literal temple, just like another temple, but it's just not made with hands? Or is it something different, but it's still the temple? What would you say there? Well, I know they don't have church services in heaven. Everybody's already born again. It's there. They do have different meetings in different big buildings, but that I was actually talking about the throne room. If anything was going to be like a temple, it would be there. There's the altar is there, the altar of God is there. And people do go there and underneath his area that he sits in, his throne is a structure. It's not just a throne sitting three feet off the floor. It is very high and lifted up and underneath that is our rooms that you can go into and to declare things for your family or pray. It talks about one of those places, but the altar at the top of the throne room at the top of the throne itself. There is an altar and those rooms are way down below that in rooms. I used to think, are they under the altar itself like physically under that altar? No, they're in rooms that are under that altar. So the altar would sit sort of at the top and there's a throne behind it and then the other throne is next to it. And so Jesus sits in a throne with his father, but there's other thrones there and sometimes he invites people to come and sit on them. Sometimes he had some for children to sit on and I think everybody, if you ever saw Colton Burpo's movie, he actually said he was taken to heaven and God got a little throne or a little thing and set it right by his. And so that just confirms he does do that. This is that book we're having. It's called Heaven is for Real, right? That's that book. Colton Burpo was the name. Yeah, under the altar. I wanted to ask you about this before because you said it before. I think it's in Revelation. It says under the altar, there were people that were crying out. And one of the times it says, how long until you avenge blah, blah, blah, our blood is something like that. They were the voice of the martyrs. Are you familiar with that very much and what's the difference between that under the throne or under the altar? Maybe that's all the same. What do you know about that? I don't know if they go. I know there's not like time. So I can't say they're there for three hours. Someone else is there. I can't say that. I say that that structure is so huge. You can imagine living creatures probably bigger than any building we have here. They're huge. They're standing at like the four, I can't even say corners. The throne room is round. That is the very center. It would be like looking at him. There's two here and two back here. So the four of them are always looking at him and shouting things on his behalf. And you have to remember some people go up to the throne room. If they're showing everything there, they don't even know what to think or say. They're so undone. The throne itself, the one the father sits on and Christ sits next to him. There's two arms, but those arms rest on the backs of two more living creatures that have four heads. It talks about them. There's four heads. Like now we know that there's four. We know that there's four different living creatures, but there's also two that actually stay with the throne all the time. And they have four heads. This is a living creature. This is not something that's just carved. They're massive. So this throne is so high and lifted up. Just because of the size of these living creatures that are surrounded and the ones that hold up the throne, the arms of the throne, I'm telling you, you don't know what power is. No one knows what true power and holiness is until you stand before that throne. And these tiny little ants of people of the wicked who think they're going to overthrow him, he could just suck the life away from them. They'd be dust, but he's not going to do that. He has plans. He follows what he has said in place. But there are days of reckoning. Justice is coming for them. And no one or nothing on the earth can stand before God and say, you're not going to do it. And I understand when they say that they have no clue who he is or the power that comes from him. And that's who you belong to. If you're born again, that's who your God is. That's part of the God. He had Father, Son, Holy Spirit, such powerful beings, so holy that they do have personalities. They do do fun things with you. They created fun and heaven on purpose because we come home as the father, son and daughter. He's not going to just leave you on your own to roam around there. He has already prepared a place for you. That's where you will live. You may have more than one place on your own property. Because he does do that sometimes, but you don't understand until that is why I am so fierce about having no fear. Why would I fear if I had stood before that throne, life coming in and out of him, seeing the lightning bolt shoot on him, knowing that he had decimated hell, Satan, and he knows the plans for them are nothing. Their plan is to die forever in the lake of fire, and he's never changing that. But you, you and I, who belong to him will live for all of eternity. There's no end to it. Life excited, life beautiful, life creating, life filled with love and his presence. That's who we serve. That's sitting on that throne. He knows every single person and what they're doing. He knows your life. He's heard your prayers. He knows your heart. He's not for you. We're entering into and he is setting up right now. Some of the greatest days this earth cannot pass away into everything he has decided to do on this earth, forest with us and because of him, it's going to happen. And no matter what people think, roll up that rapture of people and get your heart. Because we will be rolling with Christ in this very earth before we ever get to heaven or the new earth. And that's what needs to be on your heart. Not all the sad, sick stories, lame stories coming from the fake, the illegitimate and the wicked. They're in another whole book. They're not even what your name is written in. And you need to understand, really think about that sometimes. Talk about that sometimes. Because if you want the supernatural work in your life, you better be talking about it. Even if it's only to yourself. Yeah, that's good. That's really good because some people say, who do I talk to? And you just said, only if you only talk to yourself. Because your thoughts are like shouts to him, right? He hears every word. Oh yes. Every time you say something like, the Lord is God and there's none beside him. All of heaven gets excited. All of heaven can hear that. But the heart of God, our Father, it swells with love because he knows his son is being honored. And anyone who honors Christ on this earth, you're not going to ever lose your place with him. You're not going to lose the reward. You're not going to lose things in the exciting times. Your name is already on the list to be used by God during these days. And so you need to understand, he knows what's going on and he knows who's doing it. And this is going to be one of the greatest fraud exposures in the history of this world. And because he has his own plan and those are the plans that will happen. Not the other plans. So can you, you know, you remember seven years ago ish somewhere. Somewhere that you came to our room on the cruise and I said, okay, Kat, I was just getting to know you. And I said, are you telling me that you, you sat here like before the God of the universe and you talked with God face to face. And you said, yes, so my question is, how does that work if there's even any way to describe because we know God is high and lifted up. And the Lord's, you know, and so there's that God who is fearsome and almighty and wonderful and all these things. But is it through his omnipresence, you can talk with him face to face at the same time he's there, or is he go there. And then how would you describe the difference between sitting there talking to him face to face and the guy that's high and lifted up that you're probably not going to be chatting it up with. I don't know what what are your thoughts. I have to say it's one of the greatest experiences I ever have and I've had that many times. I mean, you know, before all of this started back in the late 80s, when Christ came to me and said that father and I are going to let you reveal heaven. We're going to take you on tours around heaven, let you reveal heaven to earth. We are tired of the myths and the mysteries and the lies Satan has been spreading. Man has been spreading. We're going to set that straight and people will know what how heaven operates. They're going to know what goes on there, what life is like, what happens when they pass away. And obviously, at this time in my life, I was, I mean, passionately pursuing Jesus Christ to know him. And they had already planned to do this with me. It wasn't something I said I want that I wanted what they wanted. That part had happened. I had given them permission to come to me anytime they want to say something. It didn't matter if they said it inside me or outside me. And yet this had to start at a certain time on the earth, heaven had to be revealed beginning at a certain time on the earth. And so that was their choice. And because they choose whatever they choose, I'm going to go along with. And yeah, visit me face to face. Just like what I was talking with you. They came through the wall. They don't have to walk through doors. They come to the wall. They come to the wall, a hotel and speak to me. And all many times they'll say things to me. Sometimes you'll see the father is a swirling rainbow. Most of the time I just see him. Many times I'm caught up to heaven itself. I've been in the throne room. There's besides the main throne room, there's a commissioning throne room where mantles are given out. The commissioning throne room is a throne room that has the altar with the horns on it. Those are two different authors. The altar before the throne is the one that is used for people to bring their prayers and their desires to the father in person. But then there's a commissioning throne room or mantles. I said mantles are given for people on the earth. They're commissioned at this throne room and then they're brought down to the earth and placed on the people. There's so much to understand about how heaven operates, but whatever they choose, I have stood in the presence of Holy Spirit, the invisible member of the Godhead, and seen fire outline his whole body. And he can be as big as he wants or not, but he does have a real body. And I've seen Jesus Christ so many times, even before I was caught up in heaven, I saw him face to face. Even when I was young, I would see him face to face. So I'm from, I'm seventh generation of believer who actually believes and lives wholly on purpose. And I was picked out of all those in him to represent heaven on the earth as a seventh generation believer. My dad lived it, his mother lived it. We've got his history back to the others in my family line. Sometimes a whole line, a certain line of believers is chosen to do certain things during the different generations on the earth. I am not doing this just because of me. I'm doing it because I represent that family line. And out of all those who are here, he chose me knowing what my heart was, what I was willing to do his way, his will, his way. It makes a difference, but yes, I do really see him face to face and I'm undone every single time. The time Christ came and sat next to me and actually told me what I would be doing. First they just announced it. Then later I was caught up in heaven for years and shown things. Then when Christ came back in 2005 and told me that I'd be writing books, traveling around the world and all the stuff that began to happen. I don't even think I was breathing. I don't even remember breathing with him sitting next to me. The love he had for me, the waves of the love of the father and revealing their plan. And they picked me because I'm a detailed person. I have photographic memories. So there's reasons why I never argue with God. I never tell him to do it a different way. And I've met a lot of people that tell God he should do something a different way. I don't do that. I don't do that. I honored my own father. I loved my dad. I served him also when he was on the earth, but it was just something he had already had planned. And I didn't say no. I didn't argue with anything he said. And that means a lot. So God says something to you. Don't argue with him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you, as a seer, you might have had a really clear connection. I know there's other people that are operating out of faith because they're not hearing actual words. And so they're going, Lord, to the best of my ability, my answer is yes. And then they may have to proceed without a clear direction. Is that also true in other words? I think if you ever do that, he's going to start giving you clear direction. Once you have actually said, yes, verbally said it. Yeah. Openly said it to him is very important. Yeah. And if you're not sure you say, I'm not sure that I really think this is you speaking to me. I'm going to go in the direction you want me to go in. So that's good. Open the doors and give me clarity whenever I need it. And you need to be like, probably more focused on what you're saying to him. Yeah. It makes a difference. It's not like, it's not always going to shut you out if you don't, but it opens more and gives because they don't take things. Satan steals and takes, he'll control you, he'll use you, abuse you as much as he can get away with. He's getting away with it. Well, I'm not letting him get away with anything. Of course, being a seer does in that way. Maybe it gives me a little bit of an edge. But, but I had always been seeing ever since I was little. And yes, I do clearly see, I see things walking down the street going on in the spirit realm. Some of them will say, just leave it, keep going. Sometimes they'll say to declare something. So my life is like, not normally any sense of the word, but I'm telling you, when you get to heaven, you'll always be able to see any of them when you want to. But there's coming a time on the earth, not too far in the future. Well, these visitations and heaven encounters will be for many people. They'll be for many people. During this time, it probably pretty much eventually you're going to go because of your staying that you made and you didn't back up and you don't bash people who are doing things for God, even though you didn't understand it. Whatever you do, don't side with the left. Don't side with evil, you know, whenever something's presented, you say, you know, I'm not doing that or I'm not a part of that or I'm not believing for that. I'm not agreeing with that. All those statements you make, every statement you make matters in heaven. It matters in the atmosphere at home. Inviting to your home because if you're watching things that are like defiling or all the time, guess what? I was in someone's home. I went there to that was my place. I was staying in and there were two demons standing right next to their television and Jen was with me and she goes, what is in this room? And I said, well, they told us to enjoy their selection of movies they had. We wouldn't watch any of them. None of them. The person who lived there had been almost killed eight times. I said, it's the movies. I just told them it's the movies in your cabinet. There's so much gross violence just knowing the titles of those movies and and the fact that those were not visitors. Those were those were residents in their home because of all the content of the evil that they had there. And I just tell people you need to get rid of this stuff. You need to burn it. I said, and you've almost been killed how many times I said such graphic violence. You invite those spirits to to get into your life, which is true. And so being a seer, it makes it different when they go places like I'm going to go stay at the holiday in somewhere. But while we were there, we we couldn't even make them leave because they were residents. They gave them by the movies they were watching. The wife decided she's not going to tolerate. So I don't know what happened when we left. But I got a couple more questions. We started a little bit late, so we'll go a little few more minutes, but two more questions. Maybe I wanted to circle back to the to the altar because you said people in heaven will go to the altars and pray and give prayers and petitions. I think in heaven at the where where the Lord is where we're gone as high and lifted up. And yet there's also decreeing you go to the rooms under the altar and you said where they're making decrees. So my general question is both for them at the altar and for those under the altar making decrees. It seems like every decree in every prayer in heaven would by definition be a perfect prayer because you're sinless. There's no guile. There's no environment. There's no issues. There's no job. So if all of these people in heaven are praying, perfect prayers. Kat, what can you say? Are all of those prayers getting answered? Yes. And amen. What would you say about the effectiveness of those who are decreeing from heaven? Does it always happen the way they know that answer because I'm getting the prayers. Okay. They go right there as the throne or like I said under the throne, I probably will do a basic sketch of that so people have a better understanding. But I understand why images are stolen by Satan and used everywhere because from a distance the throne itself looks like this. Like a triangle or like a pyramid. I would say, well, what I would call a pyramid because there's depth to it. Four sets of steps going all the way up the throne on the four sides going up there. And then there are some areas that have closed doors where people go in and pray for things. So I know what I've seen or I've been told. I can't tell things I haven't seen or haven't been told. I do know that's where people go to declare, they go to put petitions before the Lord. I would pretty much think that most of them are on behalf of their family or things going on on the earth. And I do know that from there, from the throne itself, angels are being sent. I can say that part. They're being sent all the time. They're called up to the throne. They're given messages or assignments and they leave from there and come to the earth. And I think that probably has something to do with those prayers being given or petitions being given from from those rooms underneath the altar in heaven. Yeah, awesome. Well, someone had a word for me that they heard what my father, my natural father who is down in heaven was praying for me. And so they told me what the prayer was. And it made me wonder is that you say you kind of saying you don't really know the answer. The question was, was that prayer that he asked, was it absolute? Was God going to absolutely pray because every prayer in heaven is perfect? He would think. I think there may be timing on some of those prayers. Yeah, right. If God is in the midst of drawing somebody closer to him, or maybe they're in a time of training in their life for things that he's going to give them to do or something like that. And I don't think he'll give you something that is too soon for what you're doing with you. Right. You know, for three years, especially three years in my life, when I lost my job, my great law job, they let me go because I wouldn't take another lawyer on because the Lord said they're going to do this. You're going to say, no, you're not taking on the lawyer. He said, I know that I need those three years to train you. He didn't tell me what I was being trained for. It was all this stuff I'm doing. And I said, OK, and it happened exactly the way the day he said it would happen. It happened 30 days. Really? They came in, they said the very thing he said they would say, I gave him the answer he said to give. And so from that time, I was totally blown to the Lord. And there were things he did train me in. Yeah. Go places when he said to go to do what he said to do. And for three years, he did that. So he let me know that was going to happen. I didn't know within that timeframe, he couldn't give me all that I have accumulated now in revelation. And in training and ruling. He had to have me go through that three years of preparing me that I would understand him more and understand having plans more. So yes, they're given prayers. Trust me. They're there. I know that some things are asking for things for their family members and places, maybe your areas place places. And I know the father writes it down. He likes to literally write things down, whatever said. Yeah. But he's not going to ignore them. He's not ignoring. They're up there cheering you on praying for you declaring over you. And when something suddenly happens so totally unexpected, that thing was probably an answer to the prayers of one of your family members. Very cool. You were talking about God trains you and you were training. I'm going to share this. I'm not going to give the name of the person, but there's a famous or was famous person to see she had a global. Recognize she was globally recognized. She said to me this last week, she said, I knew I watched KatKerr when she worked at that church in Florida and she she did. She was in the she helped prepare food and she ministered people and she did everything God told. She didn't try to get ahead of anything. She didn't try to be something and she says, I watched her do that and now I see what God is taking her. I just want to say that because here was a person you may or may not know who I'm talking about, but she was watching you the whole time. And now she's so proud of where you come in and now she's learning from it. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about? That could have probably been several different people. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I thought I'd share that. And then we'll come and ask me a question or something that I was doing, but I was about the father's business that was cooking, cleaning, setting up, decorating for all those events that we had. And that wasn't my favorite thing. Isn't that funny? So it may be inconvenient sometimes. It may be inconvenient for you. Maybe you don't understand why, but if he said it, just do it, people just say yes to him and do it. And then you won't miss what he has for you. Yeah. Yeah, that was amazing. It was a good lesson for me and for people watching because I go, oh, so Kat wasn't always, wasn't born ready to be a prophet and caught up to heaven. God's giving her promotion after promotion. You served and served and served. I did. You said you got fired from that one job. Did you? I did. Well, it wasn't really fired. I made it. It's the way they give you a choice. You can stay. You can take a second attorney to be under. There was no time. It didn't make sense. Yeah. And my boss lawyer said that doesn't make sense that the board is saying you have to take a second lawyer. But I knew why that was happening. It was his way of releasing me from there. And I could see that it happened exactly the way he said it would. So I did a great job and I had great relationship with my boss, with his wife. His family came to visit him all the time in the law office, which was very rare. He was a Christian. And so he knew I had favor with the judges favor with the county clerks. You couldn't just call a judge and say, change this date. I can't make it there. No, I wouldn't tell you what they'd say to you. But some people just have favor and they go, of course I'll change that. And so there was reasons why he recognized that I had favor from God for things. But the time came when God was taking me to the next thing to repair for what he had for me, which is what I'm doing now. Yeah. And I was excited when I went home and told my husband 30 days from now, I won't have my job anymore. You did. I was excited knowing that something was going to happen. And then he told me my husband at one point wouldn't have his either. And it happened just like he said, he wouldn't have it. But he really took care of us so amazingly during that time. And then he begins to establish us in what our call was in our life. So even in the times when you don't understand, maybe you don't clearly hear, you trust him because he is preparing you for something that he really needs done. And he's always watching when you say God writes everything down. Of course, aren't angels recording things too? Yeah, there's five angels sent to be with you. I see them with some people and they're always, they have a tablet kind of a thing, not like we have here, but it's just different. But the father is the one who loves to write things down. Jesus, not so much. Not so much. Jesus has to go and speak and share and not, but the father has always written things down. He loves to write things down. He has book of remembrance. He has a lamest book of life. He has got many different books that are his own that he writes in. Okay, let me ask you. Here's one last question. This is Elaine. I'm trying to find one that's a little shorter, but Elaine's asking, Kat, I know Jesus laughs in heaven, but have you ever seen the father God laugh? A big old belly laugh out loud is a question. I was just imagining the father with his head back with long flowing white hair, just letting out a big laugh. He absolutely does do that. He absolutely does. I think I'm continually amazed by the father. I know why his son loves him so much and he does. I mean, I think the hardest thing Christ went through is the three days he was separated from him and was not allowed to hear him or anything. And he had to stand for what he knew was going to happen when he had to go over to hell and then wipe them all out later. But the father does laugh. He actually does laugh. Sometimes when people come home, he's so overjoyed that he'll just laugh out loud. And then you can't help everybody and someone will begin to laugh because like contagious. Yeah. And he does have a big laugh. It's a big laugh. His voice has got layers in it. So it multiplies the intensity of what he's saying or laughing at. Oh, I'd love to see that and hear that. Awesome. And on that question, where you said, are you actually just volunteered this? You said going up to heaven or visiting heaven and these experiences are going to be for the many soon. Roughly. You said something roughly like that. My question was right now, I know, I can, I know seven or eight to have had these encounters. I know the war details of that between you and maybe Kim Robinson, Robinson, Donna, the multiple things, but when you say for the many, are you talking about for millions upon millions of Christians will be being caught up? What would you say? I have, I'm not sure about the number, but I know that many will. And I think we're entering into a season of greatness of God being demonstrated and manifested all over the world. It's going to start happening. I do know you told me at one time he'll take whole congregations or whole groups of people at one time. So it's going to increase. It's really going to begin to increase. That was a huge word you just said. You're saying God sometimes is going to catch up a whole congregation. Yes, he did say that to me. Whoa. Dream. I used to pray that when we go to heaven, we could be go together. I don't think we pray that any more because right now all we want to do is go, whether one of us goes together, we just want to go. But it'd be cool knowing that God would sometimes take a couple or a church or an interesting time. He really did say that. Is there anything before we close that you can think of that in this hour, crucial hour that we're living in, things are happening in the news, things are happening in the church, that you would like to leave the people with? If you could just, sometimes I think, Kat, you must, I know you don't, I know you don't get anxious, probably, or fear like that. But are there times you just wish the body of Christ could grab hold of this one thing right now in this hour that they're having a hard time grabbing hold of? Is there anything like that? I think sometimes it doesn't make sense at all because God doesn't live. He doesn't live or think the way you live or think. He is God, and I'm talking about the Father. And I think the one thing he told me to tell everybody to do is still the best thing to do. You start celebrating, and I know in your head, well, all the stuff's going on, these words are being said, but when you do, God has said to do, it's him saying it. Eat, cake, and celebrate because he knows, no matter what's going on around you, what's being said, even the regulations, even the criminal acts that they're doing in our government right now, or other wicked people, you cannot let that be your new norm. It is not your new norm. God is your norm. It should be the thing you go to, the thing you talk about, the thing you're excited about. He holds time within himself. It comes from him. He knows the days are getting very short for those things to continue that you're seeing now. He wants every single thing and person and group totally exposed that are part of trying to take over. He wants that to happen. Until that time, besides just praying, giving your prayers or your praise, make sure you're praising and praying. Don't let it only go to like, I've got to pray this or else you need to pray. Sometimes praise is better than praying because he already knows what you need. Praising is actually thanking him for doing it before it happens. And this celebrate thing he wants you to do is those who've done or building layers in your soul of that celebration. And when it happens, it will be so powerful for those who have agreed with God that celebration is coming. Things are changing. It is totally going to be different. It won't be anything like it is right now. That's what you're actually doing. I would say the most important thing you do is do what he is saying himself in these days with all this going on. You celebrating victory and freedom before you actually see it happen is one of the most powerful things you can do. Not just for yourself and your family, but for the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit and all of heaven. Looking down and saying they really believe and trust you that this is going to happen what you have said. And I think that other than that is helping other people who are in a place of fear, who are in a place of turmoil. Pray for them that that fear will leave, that understanding will come, that clarity will come. They don't have to live in a place of doubt, of fear, of being taken over by the enemy. We don't belong to the enemy. You came from the Father and lived in him. He knows your name. He knows who you are. He knows what you need. And sometimes the fastest way to get things you need is to thank him. That's good. You have to pray. Well, Cece, because you need something, you pray once, then thank him. That's so good. You have to get that. Whatever that thing is, a lot quicker by thanking him and showing gratitude that you're trusting him for it. Really good, Kat. Really good. Would you go ahead and pray for the people? I know they always love it when you pray and decree over them. So awesome. Yeah, Father, right now I just take authority over all the darkness out there, the evil, the wickedness, the killing, stealing, destroying, defrauding, taking away, you know, robbing people, all of that. I take power over all of that darkness. I say it has not got permission to be here and has no right to operate in the life of a believer. We will not tolerate that continually going on. I'm an agreement with the Father that end is coming for wickedness and evil to be present everywhere. They don't have permission from us. I will give permission to nothing that is evil or darkness. I evict darkness from my home. I evict it from my life. I evict it from my city in Jesus' name and I release the life of God, the love of God, the plans of God, his celebration, his validation, his justice that is coming to this earth. He and he alone do I serve and I will serve no other God. I thank you Father for showing up and showing off on their behalf, set a place at your table in the very presence of the evil going on. That you know what's happening and you have a plan and I believe you and trust you with everything within me. I am on the same side you're on, the side of the right, the side of life, the side of love, the side of justice, freedom and liberty. Because that's life in heaven on earth as it is in heaven in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen, amen. Thank you, Kat. Hey, I think in the interest of time, let me just remind people revealing heaven. I want to do it with my finger. That is where you get the books and materials and that I don't do demons. Her website, catcurve.com is the one place. It's got spiritual resources that are free. It's the one place you can give to Kat and the only place you can give to Kat. It's right there, catcurve.com right there. Please support her ministry. I know many of you do and maybe most of you do so. Kat, thank you so much. Let's see, Barry Wench will be on tomorrow, Prophet Barry Wench, tomorrow is Thursday. Kat, you and I are taping a second show tomorrow, so we'll do that for next week. So that would be good. How are you doing? I love her. I will. I will. God bless you, Kat. We love you. God bless you. We'll see you all later, everybody. Have a great day. God bless you. God bless you.

You Well, I would say happy Wednesday, but it is Thursday a week before you're going to see this We're recording the six days before For us you'll see on the clock behind me that it is Thursday, September 22 You will be seeing this on the 28th. I believe I'm not right if I'm correct I believe it's you'll be seeing this on Wednesday the 28th. So just so you know This is when the words this is when the words were said and you'll see it on the 28th So, all right, so that's the story. We have Kat Kerr coming in here in just a moment Time I don't think I have any announcements. So we're gonna get right to it. So without further delay Let's bring in Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go You Well, there we are she is how's it going Kat? It's looking a little better right now Yeah, so when you're on your live on the air Kaz So we just for those that are watching we've been struggling with the lights It's a little better right now than it was. It's got you know, it's kind of we had a change in the light and the brightness We were trying to fix what what was broken so to speak. So anyway, welcome. Welcome. Good to see you So it's much later. It's actually 5 30 in the early evening for you, isn't it? I guess I'm just getting started. Yeah, this is your day. Yeah, this is towards Well, I mean this so that's good because that means it's gonna be a good show because you're gonna be awake and alert Yes, not that you aren't always so anyway Well, well, Kat, obviously this is today the set the 22nd, but they'll see it on the 28th. So Anything you want to say before I've got pages of questions, but about heaven and other things related But anything you want to tell the people before we get going on these questions? I think there's probably a little bit of something to tell them Sometimes I said sometimes I can't release it all one time, but I do know this for a fact I don't know who and I have to say that I always am honest I don't know who but I do know That there are covert people out there Gathering information that the other side, you know when I say the other side I mean, you know, if you decide not our yeah They have no clue about it because when you get so full of yourself and you think you've won And this goes for anyone if you're if you're on the wicked side and you think you've won That means you convinced you one that does not mean you have won in any shape or form of the word and a lot of that's actually still going on however Some are realizing even more realizing that this whole thing is going to go down the drain From what their plans were not our plans. Everybody knows our plans right goodness light hope love joy celebration So but the other side has no clue really they think they've got it made They think they've got the plans laid out and they're happening and they aren't happening at all and that should bring you hope That yes, there's more going on not seeing than stuff being seen What you're seeing is their plans their announcements that they generate all the time that brings no good If you didn't know this by now Satan, I'll just say Satan Satan can't create good. There's nothing good about him There's no good plans. He's never made. He's never done anything to help anybody and that's never going to change But the side of light is always working towards Great things happening more happening on our behalf on behalf of the world because this world still brought belongs to the Lord of Glory And he has let's say spirit realm operations for sure. You don't see them I see them and it's amazing the things going on that are about to happen and then on the other side On the flesh side, there's also stuff going on that no one is aware of whatsoever Which has to remain that way so always know this there's always somebody on your side If you're on the side of light, there's always somebody go things going on plans being made that actually will happen Because we who are in the light have a great foundation that cannot be shaken the other sides already been shaking Yeah, you remember that what the father said on November The fourth 2020 he said when it begins to shake and when the shaking begins It will not stop until everything is accomplished that he has planned and Therefore because that shaking has started in earnest in many places in the spirit realm and in the flesh because they're both happening That always tells me something is about to be exposed Something is about to be done and finished. So that's all I can leave you with today I hope that helps you to stay excited and remember to share truth Remember to share what brings hope and life and celebration and stop broadcasting what Satan wants to happen So I want to I want to ask you this now You have said before cat several times on a broadcast that the enemy Satan promised Hitler all kinds of things and he was going to make him Famous he was going to make him whatever it was and now as I recall you said since then since he he's been hanging on a hook and hell Is that am I saying that right? On a hook so on a meat hook. So what I'm so now is it or is it not true that even the deep state? Literal people have been promising their foot soldiers people we see on the news if you cooperate with these evil deeds We're going to do these good things for you. That's a lie, too Isn't it? It is a lie Well, the father of lies who is yeah is really in charge of everything even some of them don't know that they think it's them And it's not them. So because the father of lies Satan Cannot ever create anything good that is productive. It's going to bring forth help. He can't do it It's been it's been blotted out of his mind and that lightning bolt that you come out of heaven burnt part of his mind away That's what the father told me so nothing good will come from that for anyone involved in that That's just the way it's going to happen It's always been that way and I wish everybody could have been there and open the heaven leaves a meeting and her What was said by a couple of speakers if you can go to the Lord of hosts and watch those meetings You'll probably find out what I'm talking about They clearly exposes that deep state stuff and what's going on with them and what's going to happen according to the word Which is they're going to fail miserably and yet we who are here I will say a scripture I will quote with you until he that remains is removed the end of Christ cannot appear on the earth That is in the word of God He who remains is the body of Christ people operating in absolute dominion authority by the time those other greater days get here That's what will be happening. No one's going to need a rescuer people The only reason the antichrist comes is that people are screaming out for a rescuer But when we're gone and no one knows that day, but the father and it's not right around the corner just in case you wondered That is a scripture that is in the Bible and that's exactly what that means So we're here Not to be beat up and stepped on in the views, but we are here to rule Jesus Christ rules and mean now in this life And the time to come that's what's about to happen in this world And because that will be phone less greater than you ever imagined speaking to the land the sea in the air and running things for God on this earth so that it will be great There will be hope joy celebration and that is going to happen. That is those are the father's plans That is what is about to happen and you will just further further see the demise of everything else on the other side Because there's no one that can stand before the living God and say I'm taking over too bad That's never going to happen and until we are removed as the light in this world the body of Christ Operating in dominion in authority That's why I keep saying get your crown on because that is about to happen the other side is going to fail every single time and I think in these meetings that just happened was so fully explained by more than one speaker Including myself it was just a glorious time with the presence of God and everyone getting so excited about what was being shared From having what having the plans were so that's what I can tell you today And that's what you should expect to happen. That's what you should be talking about Yeah, I want to encourage those who are listening there are people that are part of the deep state They think we're nuts right now, but you're beginning there's some watching this that are beginning to a little way You're beginning to say maybe these guys maybe that lady with the pink hair is right Maybe that Steve Schultz of them are right. Maybe I'm on the wrong side Can I just say this if you're one of those people get out of there repent tell the Lord you're for you're sorry for for You know wanting darkness instead of like repent from it till ask the Lord to forgive you He'll rescue you before it's too late. So yeah, don't wait. Don't wait. Don't wait. Don't wait I wouldn't wait any longer if I were you. Yeah, it's right there folks, you know, you know, there are already in covert operations actually That are getting stuff from those some of those that you'll be shocked to find out who they are It's not the V person who's telling on everybody else who's involved in that But that's what always happens in these operations. It's always what happens when evil tries to take over There's already always somebody either a plant in that group or someone in that group getting Realization of the truth of what's happening and they don't want to do that anymore or be that anymore And as I've always said, please pray for their families the ones who under one stuff Illegally pray for all their families if they have nothing to do with that They don't want a part of it and yet they're probably in hiding yourself right now because of that So I do father I pray for all those right now who have a family members out there being evil and wicked Killing stealing and destroying father. I pray for their families father. You will protect them You will keep them you will bring them peace in their hearts and run after those who are doing that Let's sick Holy Spirit on them in Jesus name That if God has a plan for their life, they're gonna realize it and they're gonna turn and come back to him in Jesus name There's my prayer for the there you go. Awesome cat. Well, then well, we'll get into questions anyone That's new watching this cat has been and not she's not the only one many people on the earth have had this in Many encounters in heaven where they're caught up before the Lord cat is one of those primary ones that I know and she's she's been called To to bring heaven the teaching about heaven to the earth is that how you describe it cat? In person face-to-face commission with Jesus Christ when he informed me that father and he were gonna start taking me on chores of having to reveal the truth about heaven what life is like what happens from the moment you pass from this world or Step out of your body your physical body and what life will be like there That is a commission and I started back in the 80s and they have no intention of stopping it And I have no intention of asking them to stop What would you say cat To someone that says look we have the scriptures. They were codified. We know those 66 books God's told us what we want what we need to know There's there you shouldn't tell us anything. That's not in the Bible Because he's given us what we need all the things we need for life and godliness. What would you say to that? I think the Bible is definitely One of the most basic things you need in your life because it gives you truth Truth about Jesus Christ truth about life and death Truth about who we are is the body of Christ and it clearly says in there that he gives his power over all the power of the enemy And if you don't know what that is you need to know what that is He fully intends for you to understand what that means and also what what we have the right to do in this world as Kings and priests and to our God which it also states those are positions of authority and dominion and Some people can they'll read scriptures and they may understand they may not understand But when things change and these times are definitely changing Yeah, the messenger and has always sent a messenger John the Baptist was such a messenger He was changing everything by the word God gave him to speak that the Messiah was coming Then we would no longer offer animals of sacrifices back in those days that totally changed everything For those who believed in Jesus Christ's our life is changing their understanding the revelation was changing We're in one of those times right now where you need to know who you are and use the authority He gave you right now and therefore that is why he's revealing himself the father of the Holy Spirit Revealing how heaven operates what he has given us to do in this world if he says the earth is crying out itself For the manifested sons and daughters to stand up and say and do things To impact this world. That's what I share It is Scriptural and it is in the Bible and I had a personal commission and you all know even in the Bible people had personal commissions given by God Given by the Lord, then that's what they did while they were here on the earth I am no different than those other ones. Okay, and because I was asked and I said yes, that is what I am doing Yeah, good good good stuff. All right Deanna's asked the question. It's it's her granddaughter's question So I'm gonna read you that question and then I'm gonna add a couple more to it myself She wants to know are there schools in heaven and I'm gonna add to that The details are their classes are their courses are their trade schools any of those type of things any or all of those are none of those in heaven I I don't know about the trade schools I think that anything you don't know how to do or you would like to do horseback riding skydiving I mean, I can I'm just listing a bunch of things if you really have been doing that You go to the one who knows how to do that and yes, they will teach they teach people They they give classes and teach people But there is word university, which is the main one that everyone goes to when you come to heaven everyone revelation on every single scripture in the word and The ones who wrote those books in the Bible teach those books with revelation to you when you come to heaven There are classes. There is a specified place called word university Whoa, and I think pastors are the most excited people when they go to that go to those classes and they've learned the full revelation Of what the word what those words meant when that they were given and but being able to see or meet those Who wrote those scriptures who after they got to heaven were given revelation on that? That was going to be what their assignment was and also there's royal university that teaches you how to rule and reign Really not just not necessarily in heaven, but in the world to come on the new earth There will be people who have positions to be over certain areas In that at that time and you learn how to do that at royal university So those two places I know I've seen them word university and royal university actually do exist in heaven Yes, you will attend classes not in a school room behind a hard desk I'm not going to tell you how they do that, but it's in different places throughout heaven Even in the celestial realm that these classes take place in it You are so amazed and I'm done by what the father has to share with you when you get there I was totally going to ask you you mean sitting at desk like I'm picturing these school desks Where somebody walks by knocks your papers off just to have fun So this is not behind the desk. Nope. It's not like that. Okay. Very cool All right. Now, how come you said I'm not going to tell you how is it kind of a more secret or we just wouldn't understand How the learning exciting ways exciting ways that has taught you I want you to find that out when you get there Okay I'm gonna ask something my wife and I were talking about this thing where you've heard me talk about our loved ones that went before us and That didn't agree with the things we're doing like the stuff you and I are doing now people that are now going to be with the Lord and You know, we were talking about it was hard to visualize Even now them and even though we know they understand everything. It's hard to visualize them. They're going Wow, look what Stephen dream doing or doing because they always didn't like what we were doing You said they will be saying that it will be saying that they will be so fully Understanding what God has given you to do in this world and it will be excited. They'll probably watch a lot Don't watch a lot. Oh, that's a good word Well, that was my supposition I was saying I think they might from time to time Look down and say let's see what Stephen dreamer up to now because they're doing this prophetic and you know now They understand it. Okay interesting. So that for a lot of people who had people that went to be at the Lord They never understood what you were doing with the Lord now. They're cheering you on from heaven Yes, and I want you to repeat this one thing and I'm going to ask the next question But repeat to me what you said if you remember it and if you don't know, but the moment someone steps out of their body What they understand you said the moment they step out They understand you leave this physical body behind your spirit man is free from this physical body The presence of the Lord will begin to invade you right then it doesn't wait you get to heaven You already can feel his presence all around you joy floods your soul. You're so excited You know when you're going your guardian angels right there with you You'll see your guardian angel for the very first time if you've never seen them before There's probably more than one you'll see them right there They're waiting to take you home to heaven and that is the very first thing they experience is seeing their guardian angels And they're going to know they're the guardian angels and they'll introduce yourself to you and they'll tell you you've got to go home We're going home take you home to the glory We're going to the heavenly realm and we're here to take you and it's going to be okay But then excitement begins to pour into the heart when they realize they see their body They can clearly see their dead body Yeah, that they can feel and touch their self because of the spirit realms all around inside the physical realm and they're now There's spiritual bodies and they're they're able to touch they feel joy. They feel celebration. They feel excitement and And so that's what happens very first thing happens when you step out of this body You will get it back people even if you're cremated It's okay if you do that because God knows where every single ash is every cell of your physical body He's gonna bring it back together one day and you will have it back You know when you said Well, but well, I was gonna say but I had heard that before not only from you But someone else that God knows where all the pieces are and I'm thinking I don't necessarily want the old pieces Just give me a new body. Why do I want the old pieces? Did he literally get the pieces? He can find every single bit of it and he will put it back together Wow, okay, love your body because it will young it's gonna be young Yeah, there's no age in the spirit realm. You will be young. You'll be filled with life. You'll be strong The possibilities of what you will experience just because of what you are experiencing now It's okay. He's gonna give you your body back people, but it will not be old It will not be any cap. There'll be nobody blind sick lame None of that will be in your body once you get that body back So cremated or not God God takes the pieces and puts it all back together cremation. Nothing Yeah, put it all back together Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. All right here. In fact, you kind of know this is different. I thought it might be similar Okay, Amy's asking this question when people freeze their embryos like IVM in vitro Fertilization when they freeze their embryos are there spirits? I don't know if she means souls Are there spirits frozen with them or does the spirit still live in God until it's implanted? That's the question normally it is after the conception has taken place It was it would be after conception is taken place. So I don't think the spirits in those embryos That's like the egg, right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, once it's implanted and I have no I have no opinion of my own ever about what people think I think about that. I know that when conception takes place Either from intro in how do you say that in vitro fertilization in vitro? Yeah, that conception must take place It has to so that has to they have to meet together like they would even in in the natural way and at that second At the very second that that implant takes place and there really is life right there That's when life begins. That is when your spirit body and soul is attached God can't attach it. There's nothing to attach it to. Yeah, put it in an egg He you have to have that conception take place. It's the best way easiest way I can say that and I know people Understand what I mean life begins a conception We cannot make a spirit and we cannot make a soul So our part is the the physical part and once that conception takes place Holy spirit will bring down from the father a little spirit of life Which is your spiritual body and your soul and it says it says in the Bible God said I knit you together in your mother's womb Well, he said that because he's the only one who can do it He's not talking about putting these arms and legs on people He's talking about your spirit man and your soul Being attached at that time of conception because they grow together the spirit and so grow with your body They grow and so that's when life begins. So no matter what they're trying to say through abortion It's not true. That's my people That's a baby that is a baby and that baby was sent from God and heaven It's little spirit and soul was knit together at the time of conception and from that time It grows through the different stages until it's time for it to be born It doesn't become a living human being when it's born. It already is on the inside of the mother Okay, yeah, I want to ask you probably the most controversial question. I've ever asked you I've known you for seven eight years I've never had the guts to ask this I'm gonna ask it today. So We all know the horrors of rape a woman women that get raped and out of those rapes sometimes there's conception What do you know of anything has God shown you anything about what how in the world does he then Put a spirit and soul in that Is he there's a plan of salvation kick in at that moment for for this little What what can you say if anything about that any babies any and all babies? Even if they're like a week old in the womb or something else they all go to heaven when they pass every one of them Goes to happen when they pass they're innocent. They weren't a part of that, but I will tell you why it happened Steve God makes I could call it a protocol. I don't want to call it a law There are laws of creation if you want to call it that the way it happens There's just the way it happens and God made that a Protocol he will not change or take away Because there's so many to send the way he ordered it to happen is at the time of conception No matter how the conception takes place if that is that is joined together if the eggless one is joined together That is true conception He always made it that when that happens He will send a send a spirit and a soul in an innate in a body and send that and attach it He can't take that away There'll be too many ways for the enemy to get in to prevent things or not have things happen And so that baby can still be kept and watched over it can still be raised even if he sent them as a prophet I've known quite a few people that were born because of that and the mother still wanted them born and they're in their And their destiny still happen So I know those aren't the best of circumstances Yeah, but I will tell you that when that takes place no matter how that takes place when conception takes place Life will happen and there will be that joining together when God said I knit you That means anyone who was sent by him. I knit you together in your mother's womb That means he attached that little spirit with someone at that dot of flesh that was just created by conception You know, do you know anything about the scripture where David says in sin? My mother conceived me has God shown you what that meant at all. Do you are you familiar with that scripture? Yes, he basically says it's in my mother. I don't know. Maybe perhaps she didn't know Possibly she didn't know that there was a creator or didn't do even that wasn't even her thought pattern of doing that But I'm glad David remained. Yeah. Yeah, for sure No, I knew he would become David when he sent him when he needed to gather in that mother's womb He knew who he would be when he grew up. He knew that would be David. He knew that would become King David It's amazing. Amazing. All right, Aaron asked my son is down nine But when he was young maybe two or three while in his bedroom He said he saw the spooky bats going in and out of the spooky castle I'm positive. He was seeing the spiritual world. This hasn't happened since but how can I encourage this gift? Is he a seer? I feel like he has a big calling that I don't understand and I want to make sure we don't miss it It sounds like he was seeing spooks It that that could be for many reasons. I'll take a little bit of time to explain each It could have been something that went on in that house before they bought it If they this is a thing if you buy a home as we live in form You better evict everything out that you don't want there Open your front door because of people did wicked things in that home or they operated in witchcraft in that home There are they'll be spirits that just remain they just do and so it's up to us to cleanse that home I've done it every single time. I've moved if I didn't have a brand new home that was built by me Which I haven't so we always evicted everything out in Jesus name We took communion and to cleanse the home we poured it some of it on the land outside and if anything was there it left So I would suggest to her she do that first Because if they had a place it was operated in in different ways or they watch things all the time in there There were life witchcraft or The darkness, you know all kinds of things go on in movies now Spirits are attached to those movies and you don't want that to remain either There's different reasons how that could have possibly happened and he may have seen it Sometimes when children are younger their eyes or some some of them are still open to spirit realm some or not I would certainly pray for him to lose that from his soul But I wouldn't pay attention to what he said to her if he sees more if you begin to see angels and other stuff Without her coaching him or anything I would totally write it down in the journal and share it with him when he gets older But that he saw either he was just having a bad dream Maybe somebody watched something or went somewhere and brought something back with them all these things are reality in the spirit realm You cannot go visit places that have evil in them and leave and think something's not following you Yeah Responsibility to guard our children from all that stuff and not participate in any of it because you actually are almost putting a Welcome mat out for it to come. Yeah, and so someone if someone says Don't get that house or don't go into that house. It's haunted. There's a there are ghosts in there. You're saying they're not ghosts There's what? They're familiar spirits Even not it's not that it's not a ghost is usually somebody who died and that was their spirit remaining that does not happen It could be it could be demonic It could be and but there's those those are evil spirits But a familiar spirit can look like somebody you knew once before and they will like I just spoke about Sometimes I'll hang around in different houses That was not the person who lived there before and that was your dead spirit. That is not what you're seeing There are things called the familiar spirits in the spirit realm that are dark from are from the enemy And they will try to influence people sometimes they make sounds in the night and stuff like that Open your front door. Say I evict all familiar spirits. I did all wickedness and evil anything of saying I evict you from this place In Jesus name and they will have to go. I know some people who think it's funny. I don't think it's funny. I don't think that any Partnership or of anything to do with Satan because eventually it will bring control over your life and But those things like that that people call they're not you're not haunted by a person usually They're saying the person who lived there through their spirit behind your spirit goes one or two places when you die It either goes to heaven or to hell. There is no hanging around on the earth not not for humans not for human Okay, now let's see. I lost here it is I I came across a piece of paper when I was preparing for this the other day and this is from last year almost over a year ago and So so I thought well, I better ask her question and here's the question is Proverbs 31 This is Francis Hansen is Proverbs 31 a real woman It's almost seems like Proverbs 31 is an unobtainable goal for women. She's what it what what were your thoughts? I would say it's not unattainable or he wouldn't put it in the word Okay, it is not unattainable. It's what it's really about what your heart desires for him Are you spending time with him? Meaning Jesus Christ? Are you running after what he has what he says? Are you hungry for his word yourself? Only the enemy would be telling you that is unattainable The truth is what's put in the word and talks about it could have been somebody who was alive at that time and they Operated like that. They operated in holiness. They love people. They help people They they really wanted to know the Lord at that time. I can just tell you I know people who live that way and That is not unattainable. It's not We live holy if he says in his word be holy as I am holy He's saying you can become that that's guess what that means. You don't sin Well, you know, if I can say because my wife and I've talked about the Proverbs 31 This is not our question or this is Francis but I remember going over this years ago and and You know, it is true that this woman Proverbs 31 rises up early before everyone else Fixes the food makes this thing then she's in business Then at the during the day and she runs the business affairs It seems and then she's back to fixing the food and I think there's some people that says I don't have enough energy in my life to ever have to be like that And I I kind of think that's what they're talking about. They're talking about becoming that woman I think you could have that kind of energy if you ask for it. Okay, you have not because you asked not people think For whatever reason they think I can ask for my rent to be paid I have food on the table. We're safe and protected. You can go beyond that. You You can ask for strength for energy You can ask for for for more of God of him You can ask him that and I can tell you I begin to learn how to ask and I didn't hesitate to ask if there's something I desired or wanted that would help what I'm doing for him But but that is not unattainable. It is not Thing is this Basically, he was saying she had integrity in her life. Well, she said she would do she did it And this is really the truth. Well, she said she would do she would do it She put her hands to something she finished it She didn't abandon it and that that has in someone who is a believer that goes a long way With the father that you're showing him I'm serious about representing the body of Christ. I'm representing Christ on this earth I represent heaven on this earth you need to have integrity in your life And if you if it's getting hard you ask God to send help you can say father Some me help to do this or have sent me to someone that can explain how to do it better There's all kinds of things you can ask him, but don't reject the whole thing And having integrity it goes a long way not just with God But with people watching your own life that if you promise to do something you do it Can I ask you a question about that about asking thing because you're you hit on something that's really intriguing to me And I practice I play with it I experiment with it and I and I have said to dream my wife If you knew the things that I asked for and the things that I prayed for Yeah, you just wouldn't leave because sometimes I'll just I'll go into I want I want my memory to be like this and I'll do I'll Describe Bible characters and I'll describe people with you know Photographic memories and I want it to be this plus this plus this now And I I feel like in different areas and I'm just talking about many many different areas I pray I feel like at this stage in my life at 67 I'm just beginning to see some of the prayers. I've been praying for different things Happen. I mean, are we literally leaving on the table? Prayers that we if we only prayed them God would do for us in our have you seen anything ridiculously crazy that some we prayed for and God just did I Think it depends on the timing is everything with God, although he doesn't go by time itself Timing is everything in our lives. Where have we gotten? What level are we at? Are we pursuing him do can if he gives us stuff will it make it squander on ourself it gives us wealth And we're not ready to handle it. Well, make us lose everything we have because we begin to have greed for that God is not against giving people wealth at all But what would you do with it if you know that that matters to him very much? He doesn't want you to lose where you already have with him because you're you're tempted now by wealth and some people are I happen to know that I will have great wealth because I'm already using mine to help people I'm already doing that and my goal is to be able to help people with things that they never could have or do That is my heart. I love people so much. My dad did that I my dad was a great example of taking stuff We hadn't owned that we needed we gave away because we love people so much So what are your plans? And I think that means so much to God if you gave you this What would you do with it? No matter what it is you're asking for what would that do? For you or how would that better help you do what he's assigned you to do? I was born with a photographic memory. That wasn't something he reached in and put it was already in me I already have a great memory and It does help in everything that I'm doing because I remember every time I've been taken to heaven and forget any of it Wow every time. Yes Wow, but I'd love to have that. I love that. Okay, so yeah, so you would encourage people to pray Bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger prayers, but maybe but Lord, you know the timing Lord You know when you know how that's not my business to know I would say make sure you consider What would you do with it? Yeah, or any God he obviously can give whatever he he wants to give you can give it But what would you do with that? Yeah? More important to God and I'd write down something if you wanted something that much I'd write it down father really would desire to have this This is what I would use it for This is why I would want you to give it to me This is how it could better help the the kingdom operate or you can use me in the kingdom better If I had this that would mean more to him than you just saying I want this Well, right, and I guess in my mind that was implied, but I hear I see what you're saying state You're saying come right out and tell the lawyer. This is Yeah, and hold yourself to the fire because he will you know Oh, yes, you're right. So Okay, this I'm gonna read to because this lady She's waited for a year and a half. So I'm gonna ask a second one from her It says we do communion daily from obedience, but as we participate Meaning in the flesh. She's saying in the physical is what she's saying. Is there anything actually happening in the spirit? I'm thinking maybe the lightning power of God would be released or something similar but she's wanting to know what actually happens in the spirit realm and And if you're if you're sincere about it does something happen in the spirit realm every time you Drink eat this bread and drink this cup, you know I do know this to the father that is a holy act and it is a holy thing To remember the death of Christ It really is and I think it should be in the heart of every believer to do that at least somehow on a consistent basis I do know that sometimes when you take it healing can come Um faster By taking that cup and it's even taking the cup represents healing It's one of the things he gives us or that happens. So a lot of times healing happens when you're taking communion Things are brought down from heaven and put on the inside of you when you're taking communion It definitely things happen in the spirit realm The enemy is you sometimes who's been bombarding you a lot and you take communion over that and say Uh, I recognize your blood and your body being broken for me that I can be free And I'm declaring that I will be free from these attacks of the enemy. You would be shocked at how quickly that was taken from you It's what are you taking it for just like I was saying before he watches the heart to see Why is this important to you? What are you thinking this represents? It represents all that his blood does for you all that sacrifice and all the stuff that he's laid down in his own life To so that you can have more of him You can understand him better have more of his More of his presence around you and I also know this it literally will evict every single thing off your property That does not belong there no longer No, no matter how it remained I already mentioned that to take communion if you're having things going on in your house It's not you open the door evict the enemy go outside take communion and say this is your holy communion Representing your blood and your body and I pour it on the land to redeem the land And this property to be used for the kingdom because I will no longer tolerate the enemy's presence And I promise you hosts from heaven will come down and they'll rip everything off of there and evict it because you did that You know I this makes me think of a question that's been happening in the last year or so that I'm because all my life because I was raised in the church. Although it was illegalistic in the first half or third of my life, but I've always said the name of Jesus in the name everything was in the name of Jesus We always we never forgot to say in Jesus name or the name of Jesus, but later in this part of my life. I'm tuning into How much incredible love the father has for his son And the name of Jesus wasn't just saying the words, but it was like what he did on the cross and oh my goodness The love that this father has for the son So when I say and I pray this in the name of your precious precious son now My heart is filling up as I say that is that a more effective prayer with the Lord, especially when it's from the heart I would say anything that adores the Lord is powerful in the spirit Anything that recognizes his authority His right to rule is very powerful in the spirit and I do encourage people to do that It's not you're not saying just a rote thing like that's like written in a book You're not just reading that it has to come from your heart and your soul when you say that And you are recognizing his authority his dominion He trashed hell on his own Crushed the enemy took back the keys to hell death in the grave And opened it and made it possible for those who believe in Christ to go to heaven And no longer have to go into Abraham's bosom or paradise so many things happen that was crucifixion We haven't really talked a whole lot about that But absolutely yes, the more you honor it the way you honor it It totally is going to uh, it totally is going to affect the father And I mean in from the father's perspective two people can be praying Uh seriously one person says in the jesus name the other person says in jesus name One of them may have That love for the father that only the father would know no one else could see that looking upon right And he would he would see a different kind of a prayer and you know, they both sounded that's that's fascinating because To me it gives me motivation to Tap into what it is that i'm saying. Why am I saying it in jesus name? So All right, uh, do the prophet jenny asked do the prophets in heaven listen to what his god is telling his prophets right now For example, does isiah listen to amanda grace? And already we can say johnny or any of those or hank or whatever or and try to decipher the Okay, so let me read for example does isiah listen to Amanda grace or other prophets and try to decipher the riddles From the word she receives i guess i guess she's asking if prophets in heaven are trying to decipher riddles To me it would seem like there wouldn't be a riddle in heaven anymore But anyway, what i don't think there would be a riddle in heaven I think they would have full understanding of what was being said And by the way, they do watch they do watch they watch us they watch meetings in different places Uh, if you were a member of a certain church, you probably would still watch to see what's going on and just declare over people still there There's many different reasons for watching Either prophets or pastors or people like that, but they they are being watched by those in heaven. They certainly are Yeah Okay, um, let me see this one. Uh, uh, I didn't read it fully. So i'm just going to read it live Nancy asks scripture tells us over and over to watch Be alert for the lord's return. How do I obey those commands? When i know the lord is not returning as in the imminent rapture Any time soon. I think it is in part. She's saying a misapplication of these scriptures that prompt so many People to constantly it seems referred to waiting for the lord's coming I'm not quite sure of the question there, but maybe you can get my favorite scripture explains all of it It says, uh, um, jesus christ Occupy until I return Um, occupy is taken dominion taken authority over all the gardens. Is you ruling as a king and priest? Before him on the earth and they don't want anything to end too soon They they know christ doesn't know the day, but the father knows the very day that christ will come back But until that time you're not supposed to be sitting somewhere just talking about that It said clearly occupy which means take authority that means you're actively taking authority over the darkness That means you're actively operating with you with With all the power that christ gave you on the earth. That's what we're supposed to be doing We're not trying to always look like we're going to escape And I say it because I know some people are looking at it right now. Let's all just escape. We'll be gone. It'll be over No, you're leaving out the best half of what still has to happen on this earth It's a testimony of the of the sacrifice of jesus christ by us operating In authority like he did the things I did christ said you will do also and greater things in those you will do So we haven't done those greater things some people. I've even done the first things And and he's not taking anybody off this earth in a rapture until that has happened That's why you have to have understanding of the spirit realm how to operate in that what your authority is How to use your authority how to operate with your dominion the weapons of warfare he gave you That's why so much of that kind of thing comes out of me He wants them to know how to do that because we will demonstrate and manifest the power of the living god To this earth that there is a god That's the whole point of it Is a god and that the darkness does not rule the darkness does not have more power Than a believer does and that's why you hear that from me from hang from johnny I can go down this long list. Yeah why they talk so much about that That's what you're supposed to be doing and people just want to sit on the rapture of praying every moment. He's going to come And yet you're asking christ forget all the things you're supposed to have demonstrated on your behalf Forget all those things that the body of christ will be doing one day to demonstrate who you are in this world That's what you're saying when you say all you want to do is escape If you happen it will happen one day But I still think the greatest proof of what you do is when he said He's not coming at this time. It will happen at a time. But until then Occupy which is in an authority until I return. So that's what we're supposed to be doing That's what we are trying to show people to do You're not supposed to be running in hiding. It doesn't say hide in the hills. It doesn't say that these are not the perilous times They're not anything like the perilous times And you know, we were I was always taught that word to occupy. I meant stay there stay put never meant But I was not taught that we're occupying force. So an example of that is Yeah, when when the world war two when we took over japan, we had to Occupy that land for a season and believe me. We were in charge We told the leaders of japan. You can do this. You cannot do that. We we were in charge We were occupying force. And so god's saying occupy as a force Where where you're in charge even to see even satan wants that that's what satan's going to do right now He's trying to occupy People who don't want to be occupied people who don't want him don't need him. They're already set with god They already know what the purpose is in this world and since we know that there's no way that's going to be taken away from this by some squany Want to be leader from anywhere from hell. That's just not going to happen And therefore that's why this is going to be such a crush It's going to be crushing to the darkness because we still have to do those things that christ talked about He wants to see us do the greater works the greater works is raising from someone from the dead that was just That's a greater work. I say well, we have to be at least raising the dead Okay, we have to be doing these things because christ said these things i did You will do also and greater works you will do He wants those greater works seen operating around this world because we belong to him And that won't happen for everybody's just with out of here And I will say this for him. He said please tell them that I said the rapture will not be a rescue party The rapture will be a celebration of glory. That's good. That's good. That's good. In other words, you say these words You say these words the rapture will not be a rescue party. It will be a celebration of glory Good because we're operating like him to the point where he can't bear to be without as well in other words by the time He has the celebration. It's a celebration event We were already celebrating on the earth. He just came and got us and the celebration Amplified is kind of what I'm hearing you say Yes Okay, okay. Good. Good. Good. All right. Hannah is asking god is three part being father son Holy spirit and we are three apart being body soul and spirit But did jesus have his did jesus have his own body soul and spirit While on earth i'm not quite sure why they're asking this question And if he was god in the flesh did the other members of the trinity make up his spirit and soul well That's complex. I don't know. I guess they're trying to figure out the god head Within jesus the father's to me. I am in him We are in each other. I think that may be what she's trying to figure out. What did we made up? What was he made up of? I could certainly tell you that when christ was on the earth He had to be willing to have a body There would be no reason for christ to come as christ. He was the word That's who he was he worked with the father. They made everything the father would say what he wanted the word would step out and make it That's how that worked. That's why christ made everything. There was it was ever made The word was to say the word was with god and was god Right the word became flesh. It even says that that means he got a flesh body so he could rule in this world Indominion in authority. Okay He had to have flesh on him so that he could live holy Give this the permanent a sacrifice of him dying for us and then the fact that in his spiritual body He wasted hell. He wasted it He melted the faces of hierarchy of hell took the keys of hell death in the grave away. He knew that was a plan It was finished for salvation on the cross But he still had to descend to take back our authority that god gave adam that adam gave to the enemy There was all this reason why it all had to happen But I can tell you for sure that was jesus christ Okay, who had a flesh body born from the womb of a woman the holy spirit over overshadow mary's mary's womb and holy spirit planted Christ who had to become a seed the word had to become a seed And that was brought down from heaven by the holy spirit overshadowed mary planted that in her womb That happened to no one else ever on in all of time That's the only time that happened because he was the son of god And mary couldn't have that happen from a man. So it had to be planted in her womb and christ was planted Okay, the word was planted. He had flesh on him because of that He had to have the flesh to give us authority in the world and because adam was flesh and he gave him the authority And then he gave it away christ had to come in the flesh and that was his own soul and his own spiritual being He was all spirit. He already had a soul He had to be willing to be made into a seed by the father and then brought down and planted in mary's womb That's how it happened. That's why it's called an actulate conception It was done by holy spirit and sent by the father and then he grew up. He was born He had a body that was a real bus body. He had to have blood in his body or there couldn't be a sacrifice All this is boots and revelation that was given to me So i've always known that christ was always had a i have to say the word always had a spiritual body And even though he has a flesh body, he still can step inside the father Holy spirit can still step inside the father. It can still be the three in one even though he has his glorified flesh Yeah, it's just a it's a phenomenon. I you know, I used to read those scriptures about I think it's either john 14 or 17 where he says you and me and i and you and And us and them and he's talking about that thing and I always thought it just was like a it was like poetry We're so united that's like urin s and we're that he wasn't talking poetry wasn't he was talking about reality Talking reality. That's crazy because it's a crazy reality who but since you told the story where jesus stepped inside of you When you got saved that's the first time I realized. Are you kidding? I know the holy spirit comes to live with us But I didn't realize that it was literal that jesus steps inside you It's literal because he has unlimited Layers of himself the father has unlimited layers. Holy spirit has unlimited layers. That's how he can be everywhere all at the same time That's why holy spirit can do that when you invite holy spiritual and value as a believer He sends a whole layer of himself in you and it literally lives in you and he will guide you He will protect you. He's not just walking alongside. He actually comes inside When you does Cat when you pray to the lord and let's say you're talking to jesus now You're a seer and you've been there, but he's living literally in here So when you're praying to jesus, are you praying to what you see? Are you praying to who you know up there because you've been there or are you praying knowing? He's right inside you. So you're literally talking to him inside you. What is the fuel? When he comes in person to see me, it's not the him. He's still in me. He's still in there And so it's holy spirit. He comes on assignment Uh to personally talk to me because when he leaves from that encounter, he leaves and goes back to heaven When the father comes he'll walk through the wall He'll come wherever he wants to say something to me and he comes in person And I see him face to face because I am a seer I see the fire blazing in his eyes with love for all of us I I see I can feel the power and I see that rainbow coming in and out of him in waves You can actually see the little spirits and souls of all of living in him riding on those. Oh you oh, you're seeing those That's amazing. Wait. Yeah. I mean, I figured it was good enough amazing enough to see him But while you're seeing him you're seeing the spirits that he still has with him. Yes. Wow Wow, wow Jesse saw him and Jesse was caught up He was caught up in the flush his whole body was taken to heaven And he began to get weak and they had to give him this copper colored fruit And that would give you energy because you were there in the flesh and that body physical body wasn't prepared to be In that atmosphere for very long it would begin to affect you I don't ever have that because I'm taking in my spirit. I'm taking out of my body My spirit is taken to heaven by holy spirit by the Lord To be shown things on purpose. But when they come here, it's them coming They come they share the Savior they want to and then they leave that doesn't take away Christ living in me That doesn't take away Holy Spirit. Yeah, it's hard to grasp that because he is him. Yeah. Yeah here. God. So you can be This is interesting cat because I read you something from the year and a half ago where they want to know When you do come in and hear what happens there Here's the one that's from right away right now And this is cat being a seer tell us what what what she sees what you see when a person This water baptized can she can she tell? As well what is happening there in the heavenly realm at the exact same time is something happening in there or Are they just watching I don't know what fully with the question There's always something happening when you do something that's a greater commitment to Christ Always something is recorded in heaven. It's recorded from heaven It's also written down in your book that he's writing that the father's writing continue writing your book He wrote every day of your life before you were born But he adds continually to that book with the things you choose to do yourself There's also books of commitment There's so many books the father has a whole library of his books that he's written in And of course there's something very powerful when you get born again But even the water baptism thing is representing us dying with Christ and then rising again That that is something that will happen in the future eventually But that does actually represent that it gives you a closer commitment to Christ. I was four Um, I was four when I got born again, but I was 18 when I was actually water baptized And I felt a greater uh impartation from really When I when I went under that water and came back up I was overwhelmed by the presence of the Lord at that time because he was there That's amazing, you know, because again as your testimony That is true is that you felt and saw and felt Jesus step inside of you and yet years later You get water baptized and you feel a greater power and annoying. Yeah, that's amazing Go ahead. Don't leave me alone So Generally saying you need to explain that you need to explain the scripture Okay, Jesus said father me and you and you and me. I pray that one day They will also be that way Okay I pray that what happens then because when you go to heaven if it never happened before you can totally step into the father Holy spirit will step into the father. Jesus will step into the father and you will be one He will not have said those words. I pray that they be one even as we are one Inside of each other you actually can do that in heaven When you have died and moved to heaven Well, uh, yes, but to clarify then but didn't you say there's a certain amount of that? You just said of course that he will step inside of you now and So maybe you can clarify what happens in heaven When that has already happened to some degree here on earth. He steps inside of you. So how is it just more? When you're born again Well, I don't know when yeah when you're born again. He stepped inside of you. You said Jesus So what so when you when it says that and the word that he's right So when you go to heaven And he steps inside of you. What's the difference between that and the earth thing that happened? I guess I think that that that is the very first time he was stepping inside of you at your invitation And your invitation to receive him as your savior you're receiving him as your savior And and he does when you say that father. I'm not father. You say uh to the lord I receive you as my savior. I repent of all my sins ever committed right now I don't I don't want that in my soul right now. I'm asking for you To indwell me the bible says he indwells you it says that and he does step inside of you And you sometimes he will say things to you and that's still small voice you hear sometimes is him Yeah, and yeah, I guess I've always wondered how do you tell the difference between him and the holy spirit talking to you? I mean, you probably know because you know their voices more, but I think I think it depends on how long you've been listening Because I can tell the difference. Yeah Yeah, right now I get an impression. I see a picture. It's all like thank you. Holy spirit kind of or I'll just say Thank you Jesus, which it means all the above. I guess it's the lord, you know, uh, let's see, uh, Okay, this must have been some something you said the last show You said you pray once and then you keep thanking him So send the uh, that's an interesting send the uh, I guess I'm a bit confused I heard that if you have to pray more than once that it has not been in faith Are we to continually pray over and over the same prayer for unsaved loved ones? I think that uh asking for things from the lord Not necessarily the salvation thing. Uh, I would tell people. Yes, you should not stop praying for them You don't have to pray every day every night, but I would totally say uh to to make sure that you're just saying, you know It's a declaration you're making. Yeah You're making a declaration and it says what you dare to declare and decree it shall be establishing to you So if you're declaring that you know that your love them will know christ That they will receive christ and they will be with you in eternity Which is one of the most important things you can say in your whole life for your family members That is surely going to happen. He will pursue them So that that will happen and so I have to say it depends on what you're saying and what are you asking Yeah, your family member to be saved is different than saying. I need this. I would like to have this I would love to go there. There's different reasons and different type of prayers that you pray Of course, the most important one would you be stand in in that place? It says stand there for when you should stand there for and don't step back about your family members knowing him Uh, he is going to do everything he can in possibility And there's a woman that I that I've been friends for years and years and she said her testimony is Years and years ago She prayed for her mother to be saved as far as she kind of presented it as if she prayed once and that was it From that point on she said thank you lord that my mother is saying to that you're gonna say And that's kind of a variation on a theme right that works the same way Right, that's whatever your soul is whatever strengthens your soul more If I ask for something which is rare, but if I do I just I personally just thank him after that Okay. Yeah, that's Thank you for blessing me for this Thank you for helping in this that what I'm seeking after I I'd like to thank him and I think a lot of people don't think I think they should I remember Lord came to me a long time ago and said it would be wonderful If my people were more grateful. Yeah Yeah Well, it's a it's to me. It seems like it's a higher level prayer because to pray and pray and pray and pray For this is lovely to get saved for 20 years where this person's prayed at once and thanked him For 10 years. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you 10 years later because god without faith It's impossible to please god and right gratitude is okay that I mean that's a higher it seems like it's a higher level But I think you will take either one One Does show that your faith is grown If you can just ask that one time and your faith is there to believe for it and then thank him after that I think that's probably how most of the people I know that's how I do it But it depends completely where you're at what level you're at as a as a Christian and a believer They may for a while feel like they have to Keep saying something is better than not saying anything or not even asking at all So it depends on the level of the person who's doing that But it's certainly blessed the lord when you say it enough to and believe this is going to happen because I'm trusting him for this to happen and then thank him for Awesome now linda's asking how do how do you pray for people? Who are hateful and evil and she says in a meaningful way what she's saying is how can I meaningfully pray for someone who is just Full of hatred and evil. That's what she's saying. I guess she's wanting to know how to pray I think you do that as an act of your will and not from your emotions Your soul has three parts your mind when you think about Your will what you choose to do and your emotions that display what's going on on the inside of you I think you can totally even though you somebody despises you they abused you a lot You don't do that as an act of your emotions. It's not an emotional thing It's a statement made by your will and you say I choose to my will to forgive this person Then god will actually act like you forget them But you cannot keep bringing up the thing that they're doing. I think that's more important than saying You know, how do I do that? But your will your will is the strongest part of you and your will can actually override your mind What you're thinking that can override your emotions what you're experiencing in your feelings Your will is what really matters because that's what really moves thing is your will Kat the We've talked a number of times about abuse and there's innumerable viewers that are watching right now who are abused by a parent one or more both one or both um, I was one of those um A lot of those parents that did the abusing have died. Some went to heaven. Some we don't know. They may not have made it So there's these wounded souls left behind Who have not figured out or been able to forgive The parent now the parents gone they may or may not be in heaven How does that person forgive in a way that heals their soul when It ended badly. There were never good words. They were abusive It's going to be the way the father showed it happened. It is using the keys to the kingdom It's losing every unkind hateful abusive Word or action ever done to you by that person and you say I lose that in jesus name and jesus comes down It says he restores our soul. He will literally come down and pull that out of you He'll pull it out And that is the number one way to do that and then you don't have those thoughts can't keep returning to you about that The ending is going to give you those thoughts every day if it's still in you If it's in you he's going to mess with you if you don't want him to then you have to get that out of your soul And when you lose stuff from your soul, it's gone. It doesn't return It's gone Then you bind the things of god and I choose instead to bind the love of god the life of god His plans his will his way into my life that I will keep And guess what you're going to think about Not the abuse you're going to think about the love of god the life of god And then you will be totally free from all those thoughts of that. You know, no matter how long it happened It will be gone okay, is it fair to say or Accurate to say that even with this what you just said There would be some people that got their soul was so damaged that it will tend to be a little bit more of a process than an event They'll end up having to do that a few times In other words, because they haven't figured out You may have to do it a few times any time it begins to rise up. You say no satan. I'm not taking that back I have loosed it from my soul It is not coming back in Jesus name and some people have to because they the experience it was so long But there will come a point where you say that that is gone and it will not come back But I have prayed with people who went through three marriages of horrible abuse And I had just been shown this by the father and I went to new new I don't know where it was New Jersey Genu I went to New Jersey and I was invited by a pastor and his wife to speak in New Jersey I went back many times by the way and he went in the store to get milk or something Milk or something and those few minutes his wife turned to me. She said I don't know why I know this But you're here to set me free Should I've been abused in three marriages and I still have nightmares of the torment? What do I do? And I said I can show you in three minutes if you're really going to mean this you said I will mean it What do I do? I said you choose You choose to use the keys to the kingdom and you're going to choose in the name of Christ to lose all of the abuse You can name the people I use I lose the abuse from and said the man's name The other abuse from this person the other abuse. I will not keep any of those thoughts any of those feelings in his motion I lose them all in Jesus name right now And a minute later Steve she turned to me in the car and said I am so free I It's gone. It's gone. I I can't even try to bring it up. It's gone. It's gone. I'm a new person And she just grabbed me and how we should I don't know what to say I said this is what the keys of the kingdom were always meant for You can lose the bad stuff and the evil and the abuse and the harsh words and the critical unjust judgment lose it Lose it and then you say and I did say after you've done that I said let's bind the joy of the lord I actually say let's bind the joy of the lord you choose to bind the joy of the lord his love in his life And it was that one minute later. She her face had light in it because she was so crushed with life itself And she married a pastor wanting to be free. She said but even though I've been married a few months It's still it's still there. So that's because you have to get it out You have to choose to get that out and I went over the period of seven more years and it never came back And not only her but her 16 year old son or 17 year old son at the end of my meetings Brought them up front. She said they want to do the same thing because they see that I'm so changed They did the same thing They lost all the abuse the words of abuse the actions of abuse by those by those men Loosed them all from their soul and they bound the joy the lord and the love of god And they were jumping up and down and they said it's gone. It's gone. I She she when I come back two years later the the woman said it's never come back to me It has never come back to my son You know that I mean I wish there was a magic bullet where we could teach this to the entire body of christ because It's so powerful. I mean I've used loose from my soul A whole lot of times with this because I've been in process Um, you know, maybe some of it was from abuse, but by the time I met you most of that abuse was healed Uh, but it took me decades cat when maybe it could have taken me minutes Because I didn't know this because it's fairly new teaching but and when the father came to me And I was actually in my room when he came to me He said what am I about to train you and it will change the way the body of christ lives He said in these days. I don't have six months. I don't have a year for them to get whole I don't have that time. I need them to be active and I need them to be free He says so I'm about to show you how to use the keys to the kingdom Uh in with revelation and that's what I'm going to show you he said and with these keys with this revelation You can lose wishcraft from your soul All abuse any satanism anything you've done concerned the darkness words that were spoken actions that were done even as a child Things you saw happen like trauma and all this violence stuff He said you they can lose it in minutes. That's what he said in minutes Oh, man, they lose it my son's name. He will come and pull it out of them But then they need to find love and life and things about whatever they choose You know god's love price love his life his joy his celebration and he said and that Can never be taken up by anybody And he said if it's a hard time, it's been a really hard time in a long time They may have to repeat that because the enemy will try to bring it back It's gone at that moment because he took it out But he will try to represent that by giving someone a dream or a nightmare and you I would tell them Why would you I'd sit up saying I'm not taking that I refuse to take it because he wants you trapped He wants you to be controlled But this is exactly what the father told me and that was the first time I actually got to use it outside of my own life So I'm gonna bash you somewhere. I don't know they bashed me. I turned around from them and went I lose every wicked I'm kind word spoken to me right now and by the love of god. I turned around at that moment. How are you doing? It was gone. It was gone. I had to prove that myself Me and Margaret used to do it all the time and Margaret is the one who realized you can do it as a as a lifestyle She said well, I did it four times this week. I went. Are you kidding? Really a one-time thing she goes. Oh, no, we're supposed to be doing this and the Holy Spirit said she's right You're supposed to be doing it as a lifestyle because satan and wicked man will present themselves to you all the time And that's how you handle it. You get it out of your soul So if you're going through the grocery store and someone Decides they don't like you and says something mean Maybe you're not wearing the mask that they're wearing and they're they're mean to your faith You might have to go outside and lose that from your soul or lose those I would do that or just turn right around in front of them I wanted them to know I was free and I sometimes did it on purpose to show them. I am free It's gone. They wouldn't have heard me say that And they're like, what are you doing? I went being free You mean right there you would just lose it from your soul in front to their face Are you saying I would why they didn't mind giving it to my face That's hilarious The fight is in the story of our souls and if we know how to use the keys to the kingdom I can do it every time Wow I live that way That's why I could easily forgive those two people who made a blog to bless me I sincerely could really forgive them because I had been living that kind of lifestyle I keep nothing in here that is not god That's good. That's good. Ken. Well, I don't want to hit any other subject because I want people to end on this one Pat would you just pray for the people especially in that vein what you were just teaching anything that Anything else the lord would give you so Yes, and any in any walk of life no matter who you are how old you are You probably have experienced some kind of trauma or unjust judgment Spoken over you criticism harsh criticism Even witchcraft spoken over you. You don't have to keep any of that in you The keys of the kingdom were created for us to be free And so I will just pray this is what you would pray I choose as an act of my will To lose from my soul and sometimes I lead whole congregations Any witchcraft any wicked thoughts any actions any trauma any violence Anything I watched that I had not wanted to see any anything my eyes saw that they shouldn't have seen Any perversion I lose it all if somebody practice that in my home I'm not keeping that in my soul if I heard it. I lose all of it in Jesus name And it's going to go right now And then I make people wait because I have to see christ come down and you pulls are them Sometimes it looks like gray matter. Sometimes it looks like really And and then when they're done with that I'll say okay now We're going to bind the things of God and then once you have done that it doesn't matter what it is It could be perversion you watched online It could be things that you read books you read about witchcraft Any of those things you can lose all that you have to name what it is and lose it from your soul So that it would be taken out and then you say I choose with my will to bind The life of christ his joy his celebration His validation His plans for my life those I bind to my soul And Jesus name and then he will actually come down and walk down and put them in your soul And that is what you'll think about every day. That is what you will repeat every day because it's in your soul If you find out you're just sad, I want to tell you sadness is a is also one of the enemy's greatest plans He can make you sad over nothing. You don't even know what you're sad Lose the sadness if you if someone has passed away lose the grief Retain the memory and the love you have been the but loose all the grief especially if they Did abuse you you want to lose all that from your soul? You don't want to keep it But it doesn't matter what it is if it blows the enemy if it was plans the enemy to control you To harm you to crush you to steal your joy your destiny I mean the enemy tries to do that. He'll make you sad if you don't get it out It'll go to a oppression and then depression and then it can keep going further And you don't even know why you're having those experiences is being put in there by an enemy you Get it out Cat is that the same thing or does it accomplish the same thing? Because we weren't talking about deliverance But do some people lose from their soul and all of a sudden they've had deliverance from the demonic Is that well actually the father said it would accelerate the one thing he said to me is it will accelerate deliverance Okay I was a woman and she had had witchcraft spoken over her and they had uh in her family and they had books She said a red book one never never received it. She said but something's controlling me She said this after meeting it was like out west somewhere and and nobody was around. I said, you know what loose that book Loose the book if you remember the name of the book loose it because if you saw what it still went in your soul So first get rid of that so she got rid of that I said now you're going to evict you're going to loosen your soul the witchcraft trying to operate with you Up with you gonna lose it and she got to the words. I loose and tried to say it She couldn't even say she said something is choking me and my goodness Tell you the reality of the stuff and I said I put my hand here not hard And I said I want you to shout Jesus Christ after I say I choose to lose And you say I I choose I choose Jesus Christ I choose Jesus Christ as soon as you say that you say I lose witchcraft And she did she said I choose Jesus Christ and all of a sudden she goes I lose witchcraft And she said I felt it leave me I am free. I am so free. Thank you for helping me. Thank you for helping me And so in caught the father who told me you can lose those things that are trying to control you Uh, if you still do it in Jesus name, I've had people who were thinner These girls wanted to commit suicide because their boyfriend dumped them That's a serious thing and all I could think about was suicide suicide. So my one sister called me and said well I know they're not believers, but what will happen? I said, let me call them And I told him I said you're about to do something in the name of Jesus Christ You have to be willing to use his name if you want to be free and she goes I'll use his name I'll use his name. So what she's doing is reaching out to christ As her deliverer. That's what she was doing And so she said I I received christ I'm going to speak in his name should I choose with my will to lose suicidal thoughts And deep breath over and she said the guy's name I lose it now in Jesus name and then she stands for a minute and light came from her face And she said I'm so grateful to have Jesus Christ in my life now because you remember she had to receive it Should I have him in my life? I have no thoughts of suicide. There is no grief. Nothing. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone She said I'm going to follow him for the rest of my life and this was someone my sister just met on the street And and she looked like she was in really really not a good way. So guess what She's Jesus name It's like when people quiet up for healing you remember in the word when he said they asked him to be their healer He said that was the same as asking me to be their savior And he said not only to the people not only are you not only are you healed but your sins are forgiven Yeah So if you find someone in turmoil Tell them to do that. Tell them they have to choose Christ He is the deliverer and the restorer of our soul and no one else can do that for them You may go through a course for six weeks, but but is that going to get rid of that or is it going to make you feel better? Yeah, I mean it makes me think of I've had Um, oh, this is not anything recent or anything, but the some deliverance ministries They'll take you through hours and hours of stuff and it's complex and it's helpful and they name it They name the demons and they they cast a matter or whatever But what I'm sensing from you is you can get the same place. He took someone else four to eight hours to do That's right in in minutes if you know, it's not like there's It's not like what they're doing is wrong. It's just more like but it's not right at the same time if you can do it this way Is is it's for the kingdom age is for us operating in freedom and that you have to be free from the enemy Are free from things that crush you and take your life away from you It is really that simple and like I said, you may have to do it more than once if you've been if that's been happening a long time Yeah, it will it will it will have to leave you it will have to leave you and the same thing cat if someone is Again, I'm not asking for myself. Although there were times I used to have this but if someone Said I've done everything I can I can't forgive this person. I can't forgive my father. I can't get forgive my mother Do they do that? Do they say I lose unforgiveness for my soul? Is that what they could absolutely lose the Unforgiveness from their soul you can lose unforgiveness You can lose a fence from your soul any of those things that that be set us to hold us back You absolutely can lose all or any of those things from your soul Really the reason why you're doing it and experiencing it is because it's in there You know if someone's having an issue whether it's rage or anger or they're just they can't have any control of themselves It's always always a soul issue. It is always what's in your soul Awesome. Well, cat. Thank you so much. Um, hey quick. Tell people about your two websites and how they can get a hospitalist tell me to say one more thing Okay Okay, let them know that because they are the guardian over their soul of their children or the watcher over their soul Whether you adopted them or they are your own If someone's been bullied at school or maybe they were showing something They don't want to see and they keep seeing the images You can lay your hand on their head and you say as the watcher over their soul I choose with my will to lose from my child's soul All of the unjust criticism the cruelty the lies the abuse I lose it now the bullying I lose it from the soul in Jesus name and Jesus will come down and take the out of your child's soul And then I choose to bind the love of God the life of God to their soul and I have heard from parents That said it was gone when they prayed that over their children Well, and you could do that if there sound asleep, right? Didn't you say that one? You can do it while they're asleep It's what you're saying that you're believing for them and that means even children who were in an abusive situation and adopted Some of those things will hang around with those children if it just has been proven And so cash or try to help them but the help they need is for Christ to restore their soul So you as a parent have the right to pray that over any of your children's soul Those who you take care of like a child if you have adopted them And I was called down to Orlando to a teen center And I taught this to every worker in the center that probably was about 80 of them And they were crying after I was done because they said when he used to sit here with its drugs or its abuse We have to work a whole year just to gain their trust just to help them get rid of what they're experiencing inside We will be able to do it immediately And then that whole year can be spent So let me know Christ to learn how to operate with Christ and and they I heard from them since and they said is Spend the game changer for that whole place in Orlando that's been around for years They now lose all that stuff from their souls So good so good. Wow. I'm glad you added that part too. Okay. Go ahead and talk about your two websites now that Thank you for adding that stuff too. Yeah, I have a revealing heaven calm, which is the name of my book That's my main website where you can get products you can find out events from there I think there's testimonies on there. We're about to upgrade that one and also cat her calm That's k a t k e r r.com It's where you can get a lot of revelation given there's um tutorials on there teaching you some of the stuff I've been sharing say how to do that There's also a gallery that shows some of the things in the spirit world that they actually look like some in heaven some around the world And it's the only place you can give to me online I do not ask people to give to other people or the organizations because people are out there trying to cheat you Prove you that it's me saying this is a good thing. Give to it. I'm not going to do that If I was going to ask you that I'd tell you in person or write you maybe a personal letter or something But I'm not ever going to ask you to to give to them Okay, because that's your own personal decision if you want to give to somebody But if they're saying that's me saying that it is a lie It is not true. So don't believe anybody who sends you stuff like that They'll take my pictures and make a fake facebook or a fake youtube and they try to do it all the time But the stuff I say on my own is where truth is If i'm if i'm interviewed by people from my own website That is truth the truth makes you free Not lies and deception and I pray that you are free today and you can operate with christ in this day To give powerful things for him to be great for him In jesus name Amen, amen cat. Thank you so much. We love you. Love your team and I say give our regards to being he tells us a dad joke every now and then he comes on He's great. We're gonna have fun in israel Um in april.

You Hey, well happy Wednesday, October 5 2022. I'm Steve Schultz founder along with my wife of Elijah list calm and Elijah streams that you're now watching So be sure by the way to subscribe to Elijah's calm always free But that way when the show is over Sometime by the next day, we'll send you that program by email in your inbox and other prophetic words come out that way, too So quick let's run it the quick spot Emily if you will about the water wells We're digging so you guys can be reminded of this amazing stuff. You're helping us do go ahead and run that Giving a cup of cold water is a simple way to show someone they are valued That you care about them When Jesus talks about this Maybe what was trying to say if someone cares enough to stop and think about what you need Or what might help you and They actually do something about it. Wow Sacrificing for the benefit of another That is loving your neighbor Thank you for loving us For giving us a cup of cold water You give me a cup of cold water and me And me And me That was so good the young woman there that was telling that little sermon at whatever we might call that That was really even a teaching from the scriptures. It was so good. So I love that We are now we have not we're not only digging wells in Uganda But we we've dug some in Nepal and more to come and then we are providing fresh water now in several different ways in the state of Mississippi We're providing some water boxes that were put we're installing at some fire departments where people can come and fill up with clean water clean filtered water because Jackson Jackson, Mississippi. I think it's not Jacksonville Jackson, Mississippi has had a lot of water issues And so we're providing cups of clean water or in this case gallons and gallons of clean water at a time So there is some of the equipment that Emily was said we were going to show this last time. That's a water box see They're filling there's someone comes in at the fire department fills up their own water with their own buckets And we we're installing I think four of these either three or four depending on we've had we paid about a hundred thousand dollars to get These really expensive water boxes that are mobile But they they filter the water and so it's clean and send the local fire departments And let us put them there. So you see right there in the box. It says Elijah streams. So excellent So thank you for showing that and we appreciate that now quick quick Let me read this thing we have we're going to start every day giving you a 30-second spot about one of our Episodes of American Warriors.

I can We're gonna put chocolate cake so far. It's showing angel food cake, but that's that's a that's a good kind of game Anyway, welcome cat. How are you today? Well excited. We are back, of course from our covert activity in Mid-Florida that was actually during the storm people really really which really never affected us and by the way It actually had to skirt Jacksonville. It wasn't even allowed to come to Jacksonville. I don't know if anybody knows that No, we didn't know that I actually hit it with my staff and People think what is this crazy stuff you're talking about taking authority over the weather the other thing is I Never intended just so people know the weatherwaters have very specific Assignments when one starts to come when it's in the midst of it and even after it's done or goes off the coast or something I know that about maybe probably close to a third of America is in drought actually a lot of it's in drought So I fully intended to send that storm all the way up around the coast to where those drought areas were and if one comes Again, I'm going to send it out over the west because they they really are in serious drought And I think California's had fires already Have had fires, but we won't have any fires here We had plenty of rain and I'm not ignoring the fact that it did some damage down in Tampa But that wall of faith that we built is all along the east coast So I'm gonna have to get with a group seriously on the west coast and teach them how to build that wall of faith that Lines up with what the father said is when he made the ocean He made boundaries for the ocean and even says so in the word of God Then he made the land in the sea. He told the sea you will not pass over the land You must stay within the boundaries. I said for you true As weatherwaters we began to say that because most of the storms always would come up the tip of Africa up the east coast and then you know do damage everywhere and so We decided to use the words that God spoke himself and say you can't go beyond these bounds You will not come ashore and do destruction and we started doing that No storm has been able to come in along the east coast at all and they would even try to get close And they'd be bumped back out the sea We have records to prove that and so does the meteorologist. They don't know what's wrong That's what they say. We don't know what's wrong. And so it kind of has to sneak around how to come up the other side to do something But we drove through it on the way home from down near Orlando Yeah, the only thing we got was somebody's Construction orange cone was in the road. We did hit that but that was about it Now can't what do you say now some of people say well point out that that the Fort Mayer Beach area got hit really hard There was an island out there So is that an area where you weren't dealing with Fort Mayer? So you know? What would you say? It's on the west coast of Florida. Okay It's on the west coast of Florida So we have found that we can build these walls wall face by agreeing with what God said to the ocean himself And that's why that has worked powerfully here, but no one on the west coast has picked it up I I thought that to everybody no matter where you are in the Gulf. They've started to do something about that now But it's mainly that wherever you're at wherever you live is where your greatest authority is Okay, that's just the way it is right now. I'm sure it wasn't going to be anywhere We go, but some people are just beginning to take authority real authority over the storms and over the destructive weather I'm not changing what God put in place. He had these seasons for different reasons He needed them for the earth to either rest to be nourished or to make way for new growths to come There's a reason why he created weather, but he didn't create destructive weather Yeah, I see what you said authority over the storm He had authority over it because he was righteous of course as the son of God But he knew that he could speak to the weather and he was trying to teach the disciples to do the same thing and So that was one of the things given to me to start weather warriors and teach the body of Christ How to come against destructive weather and there's too many testimonies even talk about all over this country From people who operate in that who do take authority over it and know what to declare to it no matter whether it's a tornado if it's an earthquake if it's a flood whatever it is and We've been really successful according to the word of God taking authority That's just a work Christ did works the works I think you will do also that includes the weather But we are not we don't live on the West Coast I was in central Florida and Central Florida didn't get very much anything of all happening and we were even there during part of it And there was some wind some palm fronds and there was some rain But even in that place so I think the hardest hit was where it came in I think Punta Gorda and Fort Myers not that people weren't praying they were praying I'm sure some of them were praying but Really how to make a stand for where they live that destruction will not happen and cat Can I ask you a question about you? Let's see. I'm from California initially. I'm in Oregon now I was born in this state Oregon, but I was raised in California There has been so much drought in that state now if there was a big old front even if it was almost a Dangerous amount of water you would almost think that we'd need that thing to come Assure, how would you pray? It'll say if you live there and if you were if you were making a stand in Southern California where it's such a drought How would you make the right kind of stand so it's not destructive? But it gets that water in where it's needed. How would you pray? The first thing is I would begin to command low pressure systems to form Or to come a low pressure system is what brings the rain and actually God based the operations of weather on Pressure systems a high will bring in a dry cool air It helps with humidity if you have serious humidity stuff like that not that you'll take it away forever But we can actually make the temperature adapt to that so a high pressure system Will actually destroy a storm it will so if you have high pressure coming in you want the rain to remain Then you command the high pressure system to go off either to the west the east or wherever you need to go It to go to or you just command the low pressure system to come through quicker and bring rain That will not be destructive and you see it's it's really a whole thing that you're taught and there is and I always teach it For free and I try to do even at meetings when I go to them because they make a major difference People have stopped tornadoes may then go back up in the sky They have stopped lightning from striking and just circle in the sky They've they have caused the whole areas of their city not be destroyed because they've been speaking against when the weather people say You know, this is what's coming. This is what what this is what's involved in it Then you would know I actually have a manual a very simple For different things that when they start to come what you say Before it gets there while it's there and even after it leaves if you need rain You need to pray you just you can say I pray for rain But you need to command the low pressure system because you get to command You command because Christ commands not everything and not people ever You're not going to command people that's a waste of time your authority is used in the spirit realm But the devil has learned for many so many years how to take advantage and use weather to do destruction He didn't really have the right to do it, but he'll do whatever he can get away with so that's why the father had me begin Weather warriors and we have had floods recede I'm not kidding We've even put out forest fires in certain years because we would command a low pressure system to come with a great amount of rain And just rain until the fire was out There's all kinds of things you can do as a believer You don't have to sit there and be destroyed at all But if you need rain you can say father I declare rain to come in Jesus name I command a low pressure system to be in the form right now It will bring rain and the rain will remain until our ground has been watered and the earth has been nourished here And then it will go that's that simple. It's your faith It's still faith Steve. You still need faith. Yeah, you start trusting God Then you actually believe him and at one point you step into faith and from that moment in your life You should continue to let that grow and that's where the words we started speaking against I knew because when I was younger I would watch the weather just to see what they're gonna say And I would sometimes say that is not gonna happen Not understanding even what what authority I already had and the things wouldn't happen And then the fathers are doing the start weather warriors It'd be one of the first things the body of Christ will come in agreement Wow their denomination or whether they like anybody or whether you know, I don't like them There's this and that they won't care if destruction is had that way They will want to do it together. We have about 60,000 people who are now involved in weather warriors and pray in Really 60,000. Wow. Okay, so there'll be a time on years when we speak and these things will happen and people always say The manifest and sons and daughters will come in the land to see in the air But they don't know what that means. This is one of those things You will speak and the weather will follow the pattern the father made it to follow with no destruction involved and I had already spoken before when the father took me into the future and showed me a serious earthquake it was in California and I don't know who know who did this, but the father said this is This is a greater work that is coming and I know people for years have prayed But more people in California talk about the big one coming then they do stopping it. Yeah, they do Yeah, the words are seeding your atmosphere people is seeding your atmosphere Well, this always happens here. Well, probably will if you don't stop saying it your words have power and authority so I was taken into the future not not a long way and I saw a serious earthquake come and Expressway systems collapse buildings collapse people were dying and I was I was standing there and of course in my spiritual body But I was watching all this and all of a sudden one young man stands up and says I command you to stop moving earth I command you to cease earthquake, and I command you to put it back the way it was before you came Wow Those words the earth came back together the buildings came back together and the people who died were no longer dead Wow To me very poverty said that is a manifested son of God And that's what I mean when I say that the land the sea and the air will have to obey those That follow Christ that believe in him that do the works in greater works You will do also that was a greater work So it is going to happen people will begin to get it They'll get it and they'll start operating and it doesn't have to be everybody in the city But he does need people who actually believe What that you know there's a scripture that says if you confess with no believe what you're saying don't doubt your heart You should have what? You should have what you say. Yeah, whatever you say that is that is walking in authority That's called dominion in authority. That is occupying Occupy until I come Christ. Yeah That doesn't mean sit on your rapture rug That means take authority where you see that it needs to be taken and operate in the spirit with your faith and That faith does please God and you when you the more faith you have in the greater it gets then the greater things You'll be able to do for Christ or with Christ and the thing about the faith thing is that you know I pointed this for years in practice now and then God knows the exact level of faith that's emanating from you whether it's vibrations or whatever it is He knows so one you may have a minute from now an increased faith But five minutes from now it may reach a level of faith I think is that true your faith can grow even in a moment and all of a sudden grow very quickly because as you're speaking and Eventually we will when we move and get out of the place. We will have news and media Program or network. I'm not quite sure what it is and we will actually Teach people that way through those resources of having We're gonna have a weather. We're gonna have a weather. We will have a weather channel But we will all in the body of Christ begin to speak to the weather and we will keep our cameras where with it So they can see what is happening They speak the truth. This is what the father said. This is being added to your list And then you'll go broadcast things where things are happening and then you they will speak over the reporters One of our people will speak and you begin to see changes and people will join them. Wow cat And that's why the earth will be a totally different place to live in and God wants it to reach that level and Operating at that level see if you can see there will be no use for the antichrist No, there will be absolutely no need for him because the body of Christ will be operating in power authority with Jesus Christ and The mass miracles and the things that people see changing. They were one after they're after Jesus Christ at one point They don't want to know him and so that is one of the reasons why some of the harvest will be so great But I'm not talking about the last Harvest before we all get out of here But I will promise you there will be a catching away because he said there would but the rapture will not be a rescue party This is from Holy Spirit himself. The rapture is not a rescue party It will be a celebration of all of us operating such power authority that God just has to have us That's why that's good Christ will not be able to appear or have authority on the earth until we're gone Because he can't you serve the authority? We're already operating in after all these generations He won't be able to do it and the Bible says into he that remains is removed That's the body of Christ the antichrist cannot appear and so we have to get greater in authority and dominion And our faith is going to change. It's gonna get greater And so he gave us weather warriors sort of this is how you start this is what you begin Yeah And people faith everywhere has grown so much to see even in this storm that went on there Well, I was rescued there were miracles that happened because people were declaring and taking authority and I know two places not this time But one of them when there was great floods coming and God said tell them to begin to stomp on the ground and command the water To go down and before their eyes it did really happen in more than one place Okay, I wanted to ask you right a few minutes ago, and I wanted to get circled back to this You said I took my staff and I pounded it down. So my question was You were you're in Jacksonville, Florida? Harry, did you do it there? Did you do it on a map? You have a map in front of you did it on a map? What what what did you do that had the that had the effect that you're talking about? That was before I got to Jacksonville, Florida. Okay, we had to leave Orlando in return of course because well, we just had to come back and And so I actually started speaking to it when I was in Orlando. I didn't waste any time I went out and sent the host on as the host are always sent to shred the bands of the storm. So these hurricanes We we know pretty much how to speak to them and we know there's gonna be some kind of results Every now and then one's actually stopped and it never goes anywhere or it's shredded in the morning But this storm here that we just had come here was I know that the devil's real purpose was to set it up through the entire State of Florida mass destruction. Well, that was not gonna happen Not on my watch or the weather warriors watch and I was not tolerating it even coming through my city And I did hit it with the staff. I hit it and I said you're gonna get off and you're gonna go quickly But when you go through the wall of faith that's been built along the east coast because if it was going to go back out In the ocean actually had to go through that side of it. I said when you go through there, you will be shredded and The next day after that happened people woke up in this city and went where did the storm go? Where did it go? It was in pieces people. That's where it was. It was in pieces Well, even the tail of the storm was not allowed to stay on the east You mentioned the bands the destructions in the bands a lot So do you speak to the bands and say I want you to disintegrate you? You know, do you speak to them? Do you name bands to having to go and shred those bands of the storm? Okay, because one this one of those bands begin to separate it loses power. Yeah No, I send the host to do it. Yeah That's good. And so the one clarification when you so before you were in Jacksonville But because you had authority over Jacksonville, you were in Orlando area. You took authority with your staff while you were in Orlando about Something to represent in my staff that that's where I hit the storm But when I got here, I actually went out to the beach area Okay, I guess some of the bands were beginning to come through we kind of got ahead of it And I my husband with me and we stood right out there and there was rain and there was wind blowing I I told I told it again It was getting offshore and it was going because I was standing in why that wall of faith that was built It goes out some miles offshore along the and I was standing there And that's when I was telling you will be shred as you go through there gonna be shred You will have no longer have the image of the hurricane and when that begins to fall apart the storm falls apart It just does and then the high pressure can grow the high pressure going up into the storm That's what it was saying also in Orlando I've come in the pressure to begin to raise because when the pressure goes up the storm can't get any Greater it can't and then it will actually begin to be downgraded And I remember in Hawaii when that huge massive storm was due to hit the next day and all the weather channels were saying Hawaii will be wiped out We have powerful weather warriors in Hawaii and I told them to agree that that the the host would come and take the head off The storm just take it off the storm. It would fall apart And I still we somewhere have a copy of that weather report from the Hawaiian Islands the next day going what happened There was nothing left of it. It was nothing. It was like something came and took the head off of it It fell apart completely Destruction was there ever we don't understand and then they then we would take other channels And they were all beginning to say that that year was a great year to to take authority and people everywhere begin to take it And so we actually saved some of those weather channel reports and them saying we don't know what happened It's gone, but this one especially I think all of my friends and the weather warriors in Hawaii said you stayed up You did a great job. The head of that storm was totally just taken off. There was no I left there was no kind of nothing left and So people need to know that if you have received Jesus Christ, he said I give you power I give you power the things I did you will do you should expect to do them But if you never step out and I'm not saying God, I pray this won't you can go ahead and still say that if you want to He wants us to take authority. He wants to see us rule Jesus Christ said you'll rule with me now in this life So you're saying it's not that you should say dear Lord, please take the story It's like saying I take authority over this storm. That's a totally different thing. It is a totally different thing It's called it's called you're using faith Yeah, the Lord said when I return will I find faith? He said that in the word because he wants to see us use our faith and yes we were given authority in the earth as the body of Christ and We demonstrate that by doing those things and it's going to get greater and greater So the days that we're now are not the end of everything because we've only just begun to do these things Yeah, and the father wants them seen for generations to come us taking authority and what we do is we represent Jesus Christ We show people that he's real because we're using his name We're doing the things that he did and that's what he said to do. You cannot use them against people I have to keep saying that because people want you know want to send a host to kill their whatever or whoever That's never gonna happen. They're not gonna do that, but you need to understand who you are first Who are you? What are you talking about? Do you talk more about the devil's exploits? Or Christ's conquest because you should be talking about the kingdom the kingdom of the gospel the kingdom of heaven That's what should be coming out of your mouth no matter who you talk to you can't repeat everything the devil is doing That's all that's gonna be in your soul. That's the only conversation you'll have with people How is that directing them to know or want to know Jesus Christ? And when you do these things You you must be very aware that you what you did and what you with that wall of faith that you built and what you Go out there with your staff and you might literally be saving billions upon billions of dollars in damage And I know of course you always have people usually Christians People don't make fun of us or lapidus the Christians who are clueless to who they are themselves Say we're wasting time or we're not supposed to be who are we Jesus Christ? And I always say I'm just like him because that's why That's why I received him. That's why he wanted me to do this. This was his commitment to us Take dominion take authority. That's what he said to us He didn't say to be afraid and run and hide. Yeah He was very clear the works I do you will do and greater works in these because I go to the father is very very clear, isn't it? And yet you'd be surprised how many people bash the weather warriors for taking authority And I'm like, well, you don't even know what the word says Well, you know, and then there's exactly the works of Christ. That's what we're doing We're trying to help people save lives, you know, let them know he cares, you know He's the one he's the only one who can give us authority to do this But you still have to choose to do it So don't waste your time bashing people and this is what the father said if they're out there bashing the good works We're doing that's because they have no they have no vision their self They have no plan their self to do anything with God So what they do is go around and find people who are doing and they spend their time bashing them Yeah, it's yes That's not helping the body. That's certainly not helping the image of Christ was so slow on another and care about one another If you don't want to do it, that's fine pray for the people who do Yeah, I mean we used to call that there wasn't I won't say the gentleman's name I'm sure he's alive anymore, but after Walter Martin died Who was a pretty well balanced teacher another guy came along and he became a heresy hunter And all he did was look around for all the errors that the body Christ and he decided he was God's gift to point out all the errors And there was no life in that Yeah, yeah, it was not a gift it was a It's almost like a curse. It was like taking the enemy's accusations You know anyway, it's it's really bad. So what'd you look up? You looked up at something just now you looked up? Oh There's all kinds of things in this room to look at if I was gonna get distracted. Yeah, anyway, well anyway High-fiving each other see that's what they're doing. Awesome. I love that I mean, they have a lot more sense of humor than we really don't they I mean, there's some serious ones. I think you said before but there's also some hilarious ones and that's their gift They're angelic gift is there funny and they're humorous and there are some that are very funny and God always sends them with one who is not He explained to me the two scribe angels were signed to me. They're still here because I haven't written book three yet they'll be with me until I'm done with book three and One is very serious and you know, he likes he likes He likes setting the fire of God places to do things to wicked people and and he would rather do about they talk about that kind of stuff He's out, but the other one is hilarious And I'm gonna tell you the names but one actually means holy one and the other one who's funny. It means humorous Humorous he kind of bugs the other one and father said this is why I do is that there's no other way? Really to have them rub against each other, you know, like a husband or wife dust We help each other kind of die We learn to die Yeah, you know, I don't think of the angels is needing to learn that or learn to die. Yeah, but you're saying they need to learn too, huh? So the father will find total opposite You didn't send them on assignment. He'll let them know I'm watching you Seem more real now every angelic being whether a member of the host of the under Gabriel or under Michael They have personalities. They have favorite things. They like yeah, like where they like to see they like to eat I do know they eat man up with the more than men and heaven people and And people always ask me I want yes You will get to meet your angel and know them in heaven and they won't belong to you and they won't serve you like a butler So I've had that question asked to No, no, they're they're free from having to take care But you will get to see them and I'm always amazed at they have their own places. They live in heaven. They have They do have angel games, which is probably where the Olympics came from. I'm quite sure And it's sort of like extreme sports. It is like that but but the angels with the What the way he's he's gifted them because they Very cool the things that they carry the things that they can do and stuff like that They do and it's not the only reward they get is that Christ is always there to watch them and they love that they love him Very much, especially the army does a lot but but they Actually will fellowship during big meetings, which is one of my favorite things to do is sit there I just got back from open the heavenly and And angels were everywhere They're saying hello to each other. They they will give each other if they want it to become They don't know everybody every angel doesn't know every single angel in heaven. Okay, there's millions of them there And they do they have friends they have friends they do things with and everything in heaven or they help work on projects in heaven together But the one thing they always do is sometimes we will exchange like an address with somebody back Yeah, I say hi. Oh gosh. I like your story. I I'm so happy I can meet you You came from a home state can can we kind of stay in contact to let's change addresses We used to they exchange feathers with each other. Oh, really Wow, so it's almost like a friendship rain a friendship necklace a friendship feather So wow and I so I see that a lot in big meetings because everybody's guardian angels come with them They come and they get to attend the meeting they'll sit there and they get more excited sometimes I think from the people do Hearing what's being sad because they know what truth is they recognize it But they do they do have friends and sometimes they get to see them if you go to the same meeting Maybe three years later or something else though. They they still know that they know each other, so I love that I love it Well, Kat anything else before we I've got questions for you. Did anything else that you want to share? Before I was mainly going to talk about the weather thing so people would understand Now literally there were millions of people praying I got I got so many tests and so many messages people saying we're standing with you We're praying we're agreeing with you in florida in florida, you know for everybody that was there And I love to see those kind of reports that people are with us together with the body of christ praying for one another And so that also I've seen a lot more of that happening That the body is becoming closer the body that's listening that knows that there is a god they love jesus christ And it may be some simple person You've never heard of before but some of them are some of the best intercessors ever And now along with their intercession they actually will command the army of heaven also They'll command they'll send the host now in their prayer closets They'll do it all the time and they make strategic times on their even on their calendar to send the host different places So that makes me happy seeing people step into something that christ clearly did He commanded the army of heaven and the things he did that is one of the things that we will be doing And it's really starting to make a major difference in the atmosphere of the spirit realm itself And even now when I go places, I'm seeing less and less darkness spiritual darkness over places because of people taking authority and Bearing yes, I am And I know the news the fake news are never going to say anything about it But I can tell you from the ones who know about the foundation of this whole woke thing this whole thing That's been been trying to shove in our faces Is falling apart and the spirit realm can't lie The spirit realm shows clearly what's happening in the spirit realm between goodness Between the light and the darkness and and of the evil You know god over the evil and what's happening in there things are already changing Setting up for what's going to happen in the natural that I am probably the most excited about awesome, so yeah, I mean we You've talked about this like they're um I mean we could get off in all kinds of tangents here, but I mean you talked about One day and I can't christmas. I just saw him prophesy Not not necessarily the one where you were all right, although I saw that too, but he's quite a prophet But he said at times coming when god's going to wave his hand and a lot of people who are stuck in Homosexuality will just begin healed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and you've mentioned that Is that part of what you're saying and things are getting ready to fall apart? um from the dark side And is it is that is god chipping away at at that? for instance that area of Sin homosexuality and one day he goes okay. That's enough the rest of it just goes And it and it's just largely gone or what I think for him. It's more Of the layers he's building around okay Okay, I know you said chipping away. I understand why you said that but but for god when things begin to change It's what he's putting there. Okay, but he's putting in places or over places over cities I can see layers of light Uh hovering over whole cities and the darkness when they see that begin to leave that area they don't want to be They don't want to get caught in that when when it gets brought down to over these different cities And and you know it says he even says can a city be changing today? You know, uh, when I know they were talking about israel can Israel be saved in a day There will be times in that thing that begins to happen It will it will begin to happen and I do know he specifically mentioned And groups of people to me probably maybe I don't know five six years ago Maybe even before that before that he did but even more so now that yes All a lot of these people who are in confusion who's believed deception and living a different kind of life It will be in a day in a day He will wave his hand and and every single one of these people Involved in these certain things their eyes will be open and they will dump the darkness and run into the kingdom They will run so good so good man. I hope there's angels high-fiving with that too I mean, yeah, that's such good news because It has gotten to be so dark and we've talked about this And starting about seven eight years ago when we were talking about you said it's not really actually getting darker darker It's that he's ripping the veil off. He's exposing how dark it's been So in reality, you know, I use the term chipping away, but you're saying in reality He's putting layers of light and light and light and pretty soon. That's all that can remain. It sounds like Yes, because see the the evil Can't operate in an atmosphere of nothing but light They can't I'm talking about people at this point. Yeah They really can't operate when the presence of god is so great There's no evil spirits around To help commands, which they don't think they can command, but they're just being used by the devil Uh, there's not a lot they can pull on to do evil things. That's basically the way it is the regions of light Evil will not want to be there Crime will not be even evident in regions of light and that's what he's really beginning to prepare the regions of light to be shown um he reveals the good And exposes the evil and all these several years he's been doing almost nothing but exposing evil But the whole time he's been exposing the evil. He's preparing to take that away And in when in doing that he makes deposits. I think thank you, holy spirit He'll begin to put deposits of his presence deposits of the glory of god deposits of all these different things over areas right now And now the wicked the wicked the spirit in the spirit realm they can see it They don't want nothing to do they they can't stop that from happening And I don't care how long people have been evil or evil spirits been wrong. They cannot stop god From doing what he wants to do When he has people on the earth willing to work with him to do those things that makes us very dangerous against hell Can I ask you this about the air? We've talked about it in the past. I think I can't remember what you said Well about hollywood because it's one of the darkest areas Of sin because there's so much junk going on behind the scenes Even a cultic worship and all of that kind of stuff luciferian stuff Is the same thing happening as god even as we speak is he building layers of light? If you've seen any of that In hollywood or what he is but actually the angels that the city is named for City of angels is what lost the angeles. The word angeles is angel people Yeah, it's the city of angels and it actually will be probably called the city of angels Uh, I do know that when I was there a few years ago and I was speaking I was shown these angels that have been there forever With these urns and they were pouring out Before the last time I when I left they actually poured oil on the whole city and anointed that city in the spirit realm Whoa god Whoa, so that's really good news. Yeah, that would that would be something I would try and pray out of you Thank you for doing it because a lot of people there's a lot of people that have been praying for that and there was someone that I Talked to a number of months ago and they said well, we were going to minister And then they learned out some of the actual occultic things that were going on where they were going to minister And I think they pulled off because they didn't realize the darkness that they were dealing with so Yeah, I just think god's gonna need to help them. Well, I've got some questions here Let me start with the kids one seven-year-old mackayl m-i-k-a-l. I don't know if that's a Michael or mackayl. I don't know. It's a boy or girl. Sorry, but mackayl wants to know Why did god create adam as an adult and not a baby? That's what mackayl seven-year-old wants to know There's a very good reason because he needed people on the earth A baby can't have a baby people and that's what he made adam and eve so that they could create They with him And bring all those I don't know how many they ended up by doing together themselves But the reason why he made it male and female was when they come together Of course, you know babies come and those little spirits of life that live in the father At the time of conception He takes one of those from himself and knits it together in the womb With that little daughter flesh that was just created and that is when life begins right then And that's when the baby begins to form and grow and then eventually it's birthed into the earth And uh, and he made this so that we we all lived in him. We were little spirits who were still us Um, we didn't really have a name yet And maybe not all of our personality was there, but you can think of billions of them living in the father Crazy and that's that's where we came from Okay, now adam's body was made but we Lived in god our little spirit a little spirit person with our soul in the spirit And that's how he creates human beings at that little dot a flesh at conception one of those and he says I knit you together in your mother's womb That's what he did Because you were still you that's what he said. I knit you together So he's saying you were with him I don't think people even get that and that you together But you were already here but in him So he took your spirit with your soul in it and knit that and attached that to that little dot of flesh And then the spirit grows with the baby inside the baby and uh, and so He's ever been you've been from the beginning to the end because you were there with him in the beginning of time And you've been to the end when we won't need time because god's already been there We were in him and we would move in and out on the rays of the rainbow We saw everything that there was out there to see You know, that's an interesting question of this young child because I never really stopped and pondered it But the only two human beings that ever lived that were never a baby first We're adam and eve unless i'm forgetting something You know, I think Is this when he when he made animals He made animal he made the chicken people not the egg first. Yeah Yeah chicken that could lay eggs, but he bought the all the animals were created also that way Okay, he didn't send them to the earth to be little baby things He sent him as you know, those who could create the little baby the chickens were laying the eggs Okay, yeah, but they got he didn't send an egg to exist on its own So that's just the way he's always done it. He made sure that those babies when they came They had parents to take care of them His whole thing about be fruitful and multiply Yeah, he ranked with all these adult creatures and adam and eve and then he says now multiply and fill the earth um, it wasn't I mean in in human thought it takes weeks Before all of a sudden the babies are coming all over the earth, right? So But through the animals, but all right, so Julie is our producer Julie Smith, you know, Julie So she don't ask me if I would ask you this question. She says okay to use her name So she's saying can't my mom passed away two years ago today She was a mighty warrior over her family since she passed I've seen many prayers. She's prayed for her family Come to pass and I know many more will as well A couple of days ago. I asked the lord what mom is doing right now and I immediately heard quote She's cheering you on close quote. I know this includes prayers over her family Yet has the lord revealed what else what else cheering us on Means in heaven and do our loved ones in heaven fully know our destiny on earth that is still yet to come So what he's asking? I guess what does it all mean cheering him on a lot of questions? But I can I can't answer I can't answer them I do see people cheering us on my own dad Um every now and then I'll hear him say something and not not real often Every now and then he'll say that was that was great. You did a great job. You got it that time I mean, I don't have to say that That was pretty pretty close to my dad And um, but I do know they go to the portal that we have shown people pictures of that And um and actually I might as well show it now But we actually created a smaller size to them So almost anybody can get them if you want to give them as gifts or something Uh, I just had it in my heart is one of the most important things that the father gave me was to take me to this portal They're all over heaven They're huge beautiful buildings that people go in there and walk up a stairway They literally look over a railing and when they look down They see their loved one on the earth now one thing they don't see they don't see death and destruction But they see you uh when you get married they see when you have a baby They know if you've been rewarded for something they know if you did good deeds Uh, but every year on your birthday, they especially go there and declare over you They sing actually happy birthday to you and yes, they cheer us on because god What he knows when something's gonna happen. So he'll let us know he'll let everybody know Uh, your loved one is about to have a child. You need to go to the portal so you can watch it And so people get to watch these things and they're going. Yay. That's great. Yay. We're so happy And so they don't miss those happy moments in your life. And so that's what he meant when he told her That she was cheering her on she was cheering her family on and the other thing is the prayers she prayed My dad prayed my grandmother prayed my great-grandmother prayed It's still circling in the atmosphere until they are fulfilled. That's all my dad I know he prayed for every one of us. I know he did. I know he prayed for certain people And if I'm in a place where it was that he was I can hear the words I can go into a building and hear prayers that were already prayed And somebody invited me they built uh, they took a piece of property and they built um a christ a church And then across they built a big school And they always felt the presence of god in the school They didn't know why so they invited me to come to walk in there. Did I see anything? Did I hear anything and I was almost went down on the floor Really of prayer. I found out it used to be a place of prayer not labeled a place of prayer But great intercession took place in that building And I literally could hear the prayers and I began saying out loud what I was hearing and they they got totally undone That this is where the students now go in this place that has the presence of god so strong because prayer took place there And that's incredible Sometimes people walk past me steve and I hear things coming off of their clothing Really? Yeah, such as give an example If you can think of one well, sometimes it's good sometimes it's not really good Okay, I know one time I was out somewhere Excuse me at a place a nice place people went there to have fun and stuff. I think there was like a Sort of like an amusement park type of thing There are people coming from all over the world and I would see things with them that weren't really good And so I just on purpose. I didn't want to necessarily stand next to them Uh, I might start saying something to the spirits who are with them and then the people I don't I don't want I don't want to make people afraid so I'm gonna go off somewhere Then I would speak against the spirits I saw with them But I was standing in line to get on this boat ride And and there was a woman there and I won't tell you what her she wasn't from America. She's from another place Demons started coming out of her Really and I turned around And I shoved my husband I shoved him. He's always he's used to strange things like this I said get back and get out of the line Well, he didn't even wait any more just because he said what I've said their demons coming out of that lady over there And I want to say something about it, but I can't do it behind her and I'm not getting on the boat because I'll be saying I'm on the boat And I did I broke the power of the enemy off of her life. I commuted them to go Uh, or to shut them out. Were you talking out loud cat? Were you talking out loud that she could hear this or what? No, no, she couldn't hear me. Okay. You need to hear me They needed to hear me. Okay They probably were leaving her because I was behind her. I see. Okay. Well, that's helpful right there So the presence is with me all the time men or where I go there's always things reactions in the spirit realm if I go somewhere And it's no different than no different than paul or peter is that when you walk past them his shadow heal them That was the cloud of anointing coming from him Well, I have a large cloud of anointing and it impacts whatever is going to be there with me So I think that's what happened, but I wanted to say something so I knew I couldn't say it right then because The lady would have to be afraid and leave and so I went off where they could hear me Um, but I didn't go on the boat with her because I knew I'm gonna be laying hands on her and then they'd throw me out And um, I was wanting to help her Yeah, but I see things I see things like this everywhere and I'll let god tell me pray for them Uh, that's dude. That's for someone else to pray for or whatever So tell me what to do about each situation with that one was I was kind of kind of surprised And I mean they were like a lot of them coming out and I'm like, I just wanted to put you get back That was really good I gotta pray I gotta pray so he goes, okay, but let's go up here. Okay. Go ahead and pray and you know, my husband is The perfect person for me because he doesn't get excited about much. No, he's very mellow being is is a mellow guy He's Yeah I won't say any more about all that, but anyway, he's great. Yeah over it And uh, and some I could see leaving from where they were just leaving they would just disappear, disappear, disappear And then I just left I sent the presence of god to that woman to begin to surround her that she would know christ And so but that's the whole thing about me going anywhere even to the mall. It's like not normal Yeah, well, I understand that more and more. Hey talk about for a minute. Okay. You said like of our loved ones So I would have for instance in my loved ones I'm sure that I had a lot of them were praying families But many of them had really really wrong doctrines But they loved god to the ability that they were able to love him They understood about the cross more or less they got that but they would be praying now with their prayers Although albeit sometimes they would they were probably prayed amiss. They were praying Make them Sabbath keepers lord and god wasn't interested in making them Sabbath keepers He was interested in making their followers of christ. Would their prayers be circulating and accomplishing things? I think the prayers that that remain are the ones that you usually pray over your family members Okay, it's always about christ to know christ to have a great relationship with christ to understand who they are in christ Those kinds of things like that those those are the prayers my dad prayed and my grandmother prayed Or for people she knew that didn't know christ those prayers remain They're productive prayers. Yeah, and he won't remove the words the words that you speak actually remain They saturate your clothing So or they saturate you Depending on even what side you feel with the darkness you feel the light Um, but but a lot of people like the building I walked into the prayers and the words and the and sometimes it was worship I heard saturates the walls Wow, that's what heaven also, but it saturates that place And is the lord cat is the lord? How do you know how to ask this question is the lord therefore constantly hearing those prayers in the air? Yes, even though it may be two or three generations later. He's hearing those. He's still hearing those prayers Yes, that's fascinating because I've never been caught that You know, we've always always thought their works do surely follow them and you know, he remembers the prayers But I think of them as they were prayed and he's got them in his hand or a bucket or something But you're saying no, they're circulating even come up before the throne of god. Okay Interesting interesting. All right. Let's see. You've got a time for a few more questions here Um, okay. This is a cute one. This is a mom asking about her two-year-old son since Mallory is asking since I began commanding the host A few months ago almost to the day my two-year-old son began talking to me about cow c o w cow In his room every night. He smiles at him talks to him tries to feed cow his snacks shows cow His toys and has described him as what I believe to be a host Have you ever seen one that looked like a cow? My son has always seemed to see in the supernatural even as young as he gets Interesting question Probably more than likely is a member of the host because I keep telling people most of them look like creatures like The royal guard all look like lions That is a tribe the host as well as gaverals are all made angels are made in tribes the first tribes were in heaven And so all of gaverals has they different tribes of angels some are the guardian angels some are like scribes some are Like courier angels some would be for different They're bringing mantles down or they bring body parts down from the warehouse Those are all tribes and those members of those tribes do the same type of thing Because he needs so many to do different things. They would do that The hosts are also made in tribes and that is usually depicted by they are usually Like assigned to one type of thing like they wore in one type of a battle or they wore with certain weapons And when he needs those weapons he sends them to the different places he needs them in some of the hosts are Are a weapon themselves the way he puts them together and that's hard to explain but most of the hosts of the armies of heaven I see them as creatures And there are some that have heads that look like Remember the ox? Yeah, yeah, what did he say one has the head of a what? Yeah, that would be like a cow Yeah, it would wouldn't it it would so he might well have seen Yeah, something that would have had of an ox it would look like a cow little boy. Oh interesting fascinating, okay, so Okay, Susie asked is we get a lot of questions about have you seen this person or that person in heaven Here's Susie Goose is her handle Susie Goose asked has can't see never can either in heaven I've been studying Jeremiah and Daniel and though the king never can either acknowledge Daniel's god is real And encourage people to worship Daniel's god Did he finally do the same that's her question About that I'm pretty certain that he is there. I mean even the fact that he recognized god for who god was Um, that was actually why the father created a paradise which is in the earth where Were the those who believed in god before christ came along they believed that there was god He wouldn't they died he'd send them there. He didn't send them to hell or hades That was for the wicked and the evil and of course that place is empty because when christ died on the cross One of the things he did when he went down into the earth Before he went into hell He had to go into hell it mentions that he had to take back the keys of hell death and grave wipe up hell Show Satan that he had no power over the son of god He was in paradise first and when he was there Uh christ saw ever ham isaac jacob but many more who believed and knew there was god and would speak to god They didn't call him a sign or something christ actually went there and it said christ led captivity captive He preached the gospel to all those in paradise and once christ Left hell on the third day and came back in his body when he was the first resurrected from the dead At that time many of those all left and went up to heaven when christ finally went back to heaven To pour out his blood on the mercy seat That's what happened after he came up into the grave and he told mary remembers he told mary I had to go to my father and your father that was father god in heaven And he had to pour out that blood on the mercy seat as evidence that he paid that price And at that time all the ones who who received him of course in in paradise And you also remember that it said that people saw the dead walking around Yeah, yeah, they did hundreds of them that they saw them walking around And that i'm quite sure happened at the time that probably when christ was preaching to them When he was what speaking to them Yeah, when they they all received him every one of them in there Yeah, you can imagine how long that had been going on adam and eve were there I mean a long time Prepared a long time well, okay, um I I wanted to ask a follow-up question on that because never can answer you hadn't seen him But you you're you're assuming that he probably is there I've wanted to ask what about cyrus? There's a scripture that says though. You did not know me I did this and this and this through you, you know and people talked about trump being a modern cyrus But that scripture says that though cyrus did not know him. He had a calling honestly Do you know anything about whether cyrus ended up in heaven? No, I don't know anything about that the father will probably tell me now that you asked that question He probably will eventually tell me uh I have I have seen many many many many many many many people in heaven Some people think there's a handful there and they'll know there's a lot of people There are millions of people already in heaven So it's not like it's like you sort of walking in new york city and thinking can I see somebody? It's almost kind of like that. There's some yeah And I don't just walk around and have been looking for somebody they always escort me where they want me to go Or what they want me to see uh seeing I do know john Wayne made it That was really good. I know the disciples are all they're except not judas Yeah at all And neither hit people you know that may um Come into the question that I wanted to ask one of the okay, so Here is sherry is asking this at the time of the new earth Okay, the new earth is created. Where is hell located? Is there any way the spirits of the people in hell Will be destroyed so that they do not have to suffer forever. So that's an interesting question That is not what the word of god says at all Hell will be empty because nothing will be in hell and this whole earth will be gone It says so in the bible He's going to wrap it all up. It will not exist at all But the lake of fire will exist but it won't be on the new earth But it will be forever where whatever he put that Uh, it's still be a spiritual place of torture not a physical place Um, so I just know that the lake of fire will exist. It says they'll burn forever never That's why it's important to pray for people. I have a question to ask about a follow-up on that because I've known some people some are even close to me Relative wise but one of them Anise told me a few years ago. Well, you know, she's got a church and she's She's a co-pastor at her church Uh, but she says but we don't believe in hell anymore. Now. I'm assuming she believes in jesus christ Talk about if you if you have anything to say about Because you're not saved by The way you correctly believe on hell you're saved by grace In in in jesus christ as your savior to talk about what you would say to someone Or about the situation where someone says I just don't believe in that. I don't believe in hell. What what would your thoughts be? Well, the first thing I would do is tell them my experiences that I had when I was taken into hell In a while I was taken there and explained that this word of god that That god had written Is uh, it's a book to live by it really gives you the truth about how to live how to live for him with him And his plans his plans he had for man his plans He had for this earth and then of course We know the end when he says the end will come and the bible says the end will then come That means the end of time. We won't need time anymore But this earth we're on right now will not exist it clearly says he will make a new one That doesn't mean he will remodel this one again because the new one will be so massive Uh, even just because the city of god that's going to be on there. He would have to make it massive Yeah, probably gonna be bigger than our whole entire galaxy the new earth I would really assume to do that. I've seen parts of it that I can tell you that We don't need time. We won't need calendars things are always done by events in heaven And you know, there is the jewish people have a calendar they follow. Um Just so you know, not everybody in heaven is a jew Uh, there are jews there who receive christ and many of them do that right almost at their death Many of them. He'll appear to them. He just does Um, he appeared to those who were in abraham's bosom or paradise at the same place And god kept them because of their faith in him for believing that there was a god The world talks about that too But everything changed when christ came and died for us from that moment christ is the one you paid the price That all evil and every sin that could ever be committed. He had to carry that in his body That was destroyed on the cross and he's the only one who can say I receive your repentance and yes, uh, yes, I will when they ask him to be their savior That's what you're doing. You're saying I recognize who you are. You're the only one who can forgive sin So i'm repenting on my sin. I want I want to belong to you I'm inviting you to come and and be in me and be my savior forever. That's a significant thing because there's no other being ever That ever existed that paid the price for your sins to be forgiven So just because you say well, I like how they do this or we do it this way because of this Uh, your life at one point you must give it to jesus christ. You must receive jesus christ And uh, the one good thing that's uh, is happening now is christ does have the keys of hell death in the grave Which means he can go At the very moment of your death and say do you want me now if you've got people praying for you to know him That's surely going to happen But you're the only way into heaven Is through jesus christ There's no other way. Yeah Didn't send you to hell on purpose. He actually made a way because he loves you. He made that way Back to him where you used to live in him. He made a way and that's what the word says christ paid the price No one else paid the price and he was god And yet came to the earth lived the man lived righteously And was he laid down his life and paid the price with his blood That that blood when you receive christ washes away every sin you ever had like you never did it That gives you entrance into heaven when you die It gives you all the eternity to be with them when your family members who go there That's what you do. You're securing that for for your all eternity That's good. Would you believe something is good? That is not well, i'm god showed you how Multiple times at least i i think and because he wanted people to know hell is real Otherwise, he kind of just kept it to himself and said they'll find out You know, but he's he wants you he's taken other people to hell as well so that they can talk about it Right other people kind of like you as well. I have a question about I wanted to ask you this before I don't think I ever have when we lived in him before We lived in the father before And he's getting ready to send us down to here's mom and dad and he knows this is where he's Does he Tell let's say me does he tell me when I'm in him. This is your life. This is what you're going to go through these are some of the things you're going to affect you and do you still want to go do you receive this this um Plan for your life or or is that none of that It's shared with us. We just come down and what happens. I think there's a part that is shared um, I remember laying in god's hand and him talking about Really really some of the things he told me wasn't just about my life, but the future itself Uh, but I clearly remember laying in his hand looking at him. I would lay like on my stomach and just stare at him I was so fascinated with him and uh, there's a holy hill inside of him And we could choose to run up that hill and he would put his hand This is deep stuff inside of his mouth and we would climb in and then he would bring us out and he would that's how I was in his hand. Wow and it says Who shall I have my tent? Who shall ascend my holy hill? um That holy hill is inside the father And there's a lot of footsteps going up. There's some going up and coming back that didn't mean you weren't important That means you made a choice even then. I'm gonna pursue. I'm gonna I'm gonna know him I want to know this person that I'm living in we knew we were living in him because we would write out the rays of the Rainbow when it would go in and out of him because the stones of fire were in there the river of life which produced that Holy, uh, it looks like the northern lights. It's bands that come in and out Like there's a band of teal blue Gold I mean they just come out the most beautiful But there's always these little spirits that can we can jump on them and ride in and out of him That's what we used to do. We couldn't leave him. We couldn't live somewhere else in him. We live We move we have very existence. Oh, wow. That's how that goes. That is exactly what that scripture means And the other half of that scripture says the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things So there was a time on the earth when prophets who knew this and God showed them They knew that's how we lived we they knew it And so people think well, there's nothing in there. Yes, there is you need to read your bible more We lived in the father He was our father. We are his offspring the bible is very clear about that Well, guess what when I had a child that was my offspring that came from out of me So everyone who ever lived or existed on the earth they all we were all at one point in him And he didn't start sending us Until he made Adam Right Made the body Then the father the the word stepped out because that was Jesus's name also when the father spoke the word stepped out of him And made a form in the ground and they made the body of Adam and it was perfect and amazing But there was no life in it Then the father leans over who was carrying Adam's spirit And it says he breathed the spirit of life Into Adam's nostrils and Adam became a living soul. That's exactly what the word says That's proof we came from the father and he was our dwelling place And I love that scripture because I know what that means And that's what you were You remember him Did you said you remember him talking to you about did did he tell you anything about what your life would be that you would ever remember that? And you know, I didn't always remember that but there came a point in my life where he began to show me Okay, you know When he was training me to do things he actually caught me up and showed me And then of course there was the time in 2010 when I began to say to him I want my heart to be like your heart I want to be just like you because you know, you say that to your father if you love your father You say that to your father I want to I want to be I mean, of course, I adore Jesus christ and still do he was my beloved He always has been I spent 20 years just Approaching christ to know him and one day he walked in the wall of my house and he's never stopped coming So he was first I I received christ at age four. That's a long time ago A very long time ago. So good 70 human years ago I was born and then four years after my birth I could see angel. I mean, I already saw angels. I saw them. I wanted to know him in our home We heard about Jesus every day of our life. It was just the way my dad was. That's what he he loved the father He loved the son So I grew up knowing them but at one point I went hey in Sunday school. Hey, I need to receive him I know I want to receive him. So I actually asked christ repented of my sins. I don't know what they could have been at age four But I received christ and I literally he appeared and stepped inside of me crazy He is in there and no one on the earth could convince me. He's too late people Oh For that's amazing With him the angels over in the room were applauding. Uh, they were writing things down in heaven when I got at age four I Understood this That's amazing Well, it sounds like to me you are you are you sound like you are almost a protege If I can use that term the same way akeana was at four or five or six She's drawing masterpieces of art. You're at four five and six and you're walking a masterpiece with the lord There are some people that are so far out ahead of The rest of it because you were born with it would be like putting a genius only instead of making you a genius Which you might be you made you go ahead But that's why I have such a passion to tell people Yeah There came a point when he said you can't keep this anymore yourself And he put me in places not meetings. I never shared ever shared in meetings. I didn't really want that I never wanted attention. I didn't want to draw attention to me. I had one friend in school because I had a tribe at home I didn't need a lot of friends But I had uh, I had some of heaven's wisdom and every now and then I would just share a word with somebody And it would kind of freak him out because I knew exactly what it was I needed and I would say it and I would just I would walk away So my life and I'd see things all the time. I tell my dad my mom would just keep telling me I was strange Compared to the others. I was strange. Well, RJ was there. He was kind of strange too. Anyway, um, But but yeah, I I knew this inside Christ is real and he's in me And I would tell other kids and they go what what what? How can I see him? I know you need to invite him in yourself But that was the atmosphere we grew up in so for the Holy Spirit that was normal Uh, I wouldn't say familiar at all. I'm not familiar with going places I'm always undone when he takes me but that is choice but but that's why I was sent And I was choosing in a generational line of many people for generations who love god serve god Obey god. I was part of that generational. So this is actually a generational thing. I'm doing That those who went on before me in these generations whose platform or whose steps I followed in I was chosen this time to do this. Yeah, very profound Well, cat, um, I'm looking at a time. I've got another show to do at one o'clock 30 minutes from now So we kind of have to wrap up this but I'll tell people that clay Clark will be on in 30 minutes at one o'clock So I'll be back here After catching a quick bite or something.

This is the end of this video. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. We were in Korea. We took on Marines and headed to Vietnam to evacuate refugees. We had no idea what we were going to find. I don't even know that I necessarily knew my dad served in the Navy at that point. The war wasn't a popular war and we weren't popular because of that. So I never talked much about who I was or what I was. I turned on the TV and I sat on the bed with my wife. And I watched the people running from the buildings. And I turned to Judy and I said, I've seen this before. She said, where? I said, Vietnam. I said, where do you think you have PTSD? And I said, how could I dock? My boots never hit the ground. My time when born in the Durham was when I grew up. I guess I got a foundation of what I wanted to be and who I wanted to be. Amazing story, amazing story. I hope you'll get it. It's on both YouTube and Rumble. In fact, let's pull up that sheet here. Thank you, Emily. So it's on the Rumble channel. It's rumble.com slash American Warriors 22. And then on the YouTube channel, this is the same YouTube.com slash American Warriors 22. So don't miss that. It's on either one of those channels. We're just doing a lot of great service to the veterans of the nation from all the wars. World War II, Vietnam, Korea. We'll be doing things probably in front regarding those who are in Fallujah or Iraq or all of those places. There's stories, many, many, many hundreds or thousands of stories to tell. But Bible says no greater love does anyone have that except when they lay down their life or another. And that's what these people are doing. So we want to honor them strongly. So all right. I think that's it for our announcements. So without further delay, let's bring in Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go. Hey, there he is. There she is. Someone needs to square. You realize how was this? There she is. There she is. Hey there. Yeah. They're squaring your camera up. Well done. Yeah. Well, you know, we kind of got on last minute today. So welcome back, Kat, as always. So good to see you. How is your, this is the beginning of your day, even though it's two o'clock, right? Yeah, it is. I get up probably around noon. I did go to bed this morning at almost 7 30 a.m. Wow. Sleep at least four hours because I'm up for 20 hours every day. I've been packing because if you all don't know, we're moving not out of the city. We are moving and I'm right now sitting in the midst of everything's, a lot of it's packed. So I had to unpack stuff to get ready for today. Really point where you know, you're going to be done in a few weeks. So, but you got to kind of keep stuff out to put on. And I bought some stuff for my trip to warrior, Alabama, which I'm very excited about that. So it's just been not as easy to get stuff out and get it ready because place has to be painted. The flooring has to be replaced and you know, a few other things. So we're right there at that, that ready to cross over into our new home, which I'm very excited about. But I'm happy I'm here and I'm happy I'm here right now on the earth. I'm very excited. The father's been speaking to me about quite a few things. I can probably mention a couple. I can't tell you the other things right now, but he will tell you eventually. Okay. I am going to mention again about the storm that came through. And I want to thank all you weather warriors. I know you, you know, now the minute something comes up, the tip of Africa, which is where most of these storms form and come across here to, to America and had its normal MO the way it normally operated would come straight across, you know, the Atlantic and then just hit the whole east coast and go up the east coast in New York sometimes. But the weather warriors have been taking authority over the weather, especially the storms. We haven't reached, you know, as powerful as Christ did, but that is his goal for us to speak to the land, see in the air for anything's causing issues and to make it straighten up. And we know that Jesus stopped the storms. We have a right to do that. We actually should be doing it on a regular basis. So we did start attacking that storm, sending the host to shred the bands of the storm so that the eye would not be formed. And we started doing that right away. Well, the storm changed many times. If you haven't heard this report. And at the very last moment, I actually hit it with my staff. I said, you're not coming to my city. You have no right to be here. And it had already by that at that point was downgraded from crossing over land. We really did what they said it would, because we have the final say. We as the body of Christ have the right to not have destruction done to our lives, to our property at any time whatsoever. And so when I did that, it went around Jacksonville actually went off a shore early and it never actually fully came through our city at all. But I did go up to the beach anyway. And I kept speaking against it, telling it that it would not do severe damage to people that would go up these coast and come inland or bring some relief about a third of our country right now is actually in drought. So you need to be praying for low pressure system to people who are in those drought areas so that rain will come and nourish the earth and nourish the land. And that's why the father made weather. He never made it to destroy that's the enemy's plan. So I just want to give an update on that that we were all busy. Many thousands of people were praying. Thank you for your prayers. And a lot of miracles have happened. I'm probably get some of those together. Maybe the next time I'm on, I can read some of the miracles that happened during the storm. But you know, God's ear is always tuned into us, his children. So thank you all for praying. Thank you all those who helped in those cities. Thank you for the volunteers are still out there cleaning up other places. I think I don't know if it's South Carolina, Virginia and North Carolina, one of those were kind of were hit, but not as severe as they said. So thank you for your prayers. They do make a difference. It's awesome. Now, Kat, you mentioned a second ago, you're going to be with, you're going to be a warrior Alabama with Robin bullet. Go ahead and put up that slide. They, it says the church international, which is Robin bullet, Robin and Robin. You can just watch the name or both Robin welcomes Kat October 15 and 16. So I assume by this announcement that there must be some seating laughter. Is this, is this tickets or is it first come, first server? Do you know? I think it's first come, first served. Now he is in his new place. He has a place that's still in warrior, but it's much bigger and of course more improved. He was in a place that maybe could hold maybe 200 people, I think, and they would, they began to get so overwhelmed. They could not get all the people in there. Wow. When I came, they couldn't, they were inside rooms. They had cameras in there and people were so excited to, to get to hear the prophets that really do know what God is saying. And I really am looking forward to it. I helped to, when he first found the place, I actually was there in the city and prophesied over it and said what God would do for him and what would happen. He would have that piece of land. It's very strategically located. Two places you should always look for. If you're, if you're building a place that God is going to do stuff from, you should live on the highest hill in the area. Oh, wow. Oh, really? In the center is where you need to be. The center is very important because the epicenter of anything is where the hardest thing hits and that includes the power of God. And I do know that's what's going to happen there. So I'm very excited about being there and getting to bless his place, the place that God gave him there. It's going to be very powerful. And that is, that is this hell from that place and also all over this earth just because that we're both there together, speaking and speaking for God. That's good. I just realized, yeah, that's like three days away. Yeah. 15 and 16. So they've written me a note and I assume they'll put this underneath your comments under YouTube. I'm sorry, under rumble. We're not on YouTube. It's a 204 camp drive in warrior Alabama. They said it is free. No registration is required. And services will also be live streamed. So if you can't go, you can watch it. I'm assuming those are probably, do you know if those are evening only cat or do you know? I probably think Sunday isn't Sunday is Sunday morning. Okay. That's okay. I'll make sure I sleep later. Yeah. Saturday night and Sunday morning. I think that's when the meetings are and I'm telling you their worship is really out of this world. Really is like very powerful stuff happen. Angels come and go and things happen even during the worship. And, but I'm excited to be with someone who understands and believes not just having, but the heart of the father and how God operates and what's going on in the spirit realm right now. He's very big and understanding of the spirit realm operations and has been involved in a lot of stuff for God doing things like that. So, and I call her lady Robin, by the way. Yeah. Robin and lady Robin. Robin and lady Robin. So by the way, they're telling they've typed in this. So on Saturday is seven PM central time, which is their time period and Sunday is 1045 central 1045 AM central. So it's one evening and the evening in the morning. Okay. It's in the morning where the day that Robin and cats. Yeah. That's going to be awesome. So now I'm going to go into questions on having anything else. Make sure I give you time. Anything else? Any other questions? That's it right now. Okay. So I'm going to start with it again. Anyone that may be new cat has been to heaven. He catches you up. And would you tell people, you know, Paul, it's believed that Paul went up to the third heaven that it was himself. He was writing about. He said he didn't know if he's in the body or out of the body. So how would you describe it when he catches you up out of the body in the body? What would you say? I understand that also. I know Paul did. He went a couple of times. I think John, the beloved, has one of the best examples in the book of revelation. I think revelation four, where he talked about when he was in the spirit on the Lord's day, that's the way he lived in the spirit. It means many things can happen that don't normally happen. And that's when he heard the voice and he was told, you know, and he saw a door open and they, they took him up. He literally went up to heaven and was standing for the throne of the father. I don't know if you all realize this, but in the book of John itself, and I'm talking about revelation right now. This is much later in his life when he would say, you cannot see the face of God and live. And yet God on purpose, the father caught him up before his throne. And he saw that living rainbow. He even says it in there. He saw the rainbow like unto an emerald. That was probably the color of teal. And he saw him described him, the fire in his eyes, the lightning, the thunder, the living creatures. I mean, that was a very accurate description of what I see when I'm taken there, but he was taken before the father's throne. Jesus is not the one who has the rainbow coming in out of him. That is the father. And I know the father did that on purpose because here's John living a righteous life on the earth, still carrying out what he was sent here for. And yet he was caught up to heaven without dying and saw the face of God himself. So that tells you right there, if it's God's choice, yes, it can happen. And because you're born again, you're dependent of your sins, you're righteous. You have entrance into heaven. You have the ability to, when you pass from this world, to go live in heaven. But the fact that he could see the father's face before he died is very significant because he was born again, you know, filled with Christ, doing his work that God gave him to do. His sins washed away. That gave him the ability at that time to be caught up and shown the throne of the living God and all the things that go on there. Paul was so overwhelmed because I think so many years later, there was more things that could be understandable to John. I'm sure that what Paul, you know, Paul didn't know what in the world to say to people about what he saw there. There's so many things that are so supernatural, unless God pulled you on purpose to explain and gives you revelation about what those are. Revelation changes everything that comes from the heart of the father. And the Bible says, we shall not live by bread alone, but by every word spoken from the mouth of God. So yes, God can give people things directly from him to say on the earth. And there's a scripture right there to prove it. And that's what he does with me. He'll come in person or he catches me up to heaven or other places in heaven. I've been taken back in time, forward in time. And let me tell you something. If you're a believer, you've already been from the beginning to the end and the end to the beginning before he made the earth. He could time came from the father. He could go back as far as he wanted or even forward into eternity if he wants to. And we all lived in him when he did that. And we would ride out on the rays of that rainbow that comes in and out of him like the northern lights. That's what we used to do when we lived in him. And him you live, right? You move, you have your very existence. And that would be in the father that we lived in him. He is our father. So there's some correct scripture revelation for you. And one, I like to bring this up every few months for those who may be new is you tell an experience once where you were, you, you're shopping, you lift up to get something on the shelf by the time your hands up there, suddenly you're caught up. You have an experience. I don't remember if it was minutes or hours or longer. And then you have the experience. You come back and your hands still up there and you put it in the basket. Am I saying that about right? Yes. But in heaven, there's no real time. Yeah. They don't have clocks up there. They don't have to keep time because you're living in eternity right now actually. But there is a difference on how long I can gauge that by how long I'm not here or I'm taking my spirit. Man is taken out of my body. My body is kept alive by Holy spirit. And like the thing in the grocery store, I'm sure seconds, probably maybe three seconds, two seconds go by. If you're going to reach for something, I use my cup for an example. If this is on the shelf, let me get in there. This is on the shelf in the store, right? And I'm reaching for it. I touch it. He takes me to heaven. My hand is still in the store on the thing. And a second later, I'll be back and put it in the cart. But in heaven, I could have been taken to three or four different places in heaven and shown that. That is the beauty of heaven, that there's no real definition except, you know, how many places you saw. And even though I was gone for a few minutes down here, because that's eternity and there is no time, I could go to several places. I do know one time I was taken for four hours Earth time. I just happened to glance at my clock right when he's told me I'm taking you. And then I was gone when I was back in my body. Four hours Earth time had passed. And that was when he was teaching me about the keys to the kingdom, how to bind and loosen things from your soul. So your soul can be free that it can prosper. Well, and when you, when you say it was four hours at Earth time, because you, you saw it on the clock, would you have, if someone had said when he got back, you told Jen, your sister, this has just happened to me, if you were to describe all the things that happened during that four hours, would it have seemed like it would have taken longer than four hours? If that had happened in Earth time, do you see what I'm saying? What might, I know there's no time in heaven, but if you had done all those things on Earth, would it have taken four hours or maybe a lot more than four hours? Would you guess? I, I, I can't gauge that. The spirit realm is so different from this natural realm, this physical realm. Every moment passes by in this physical realm. So you know what that time is allotted for. And that's why people can plan events and stuff. That's how they have to plan. I mean, in heaven, the events could just go on and you go right to another one, or you get to go visit other people. And you don't have to have an appointment to do that. You don't have to have a schedule thing for that to happen in heaven. It's just life. It's just the way life is. I did get shown a lot though. And I have great understanding not only of how our soul operates, but what our soul looks like. Our soul is a literal thing. It's not just a little wispy thing that appears and disappears. It's one of the, it's the very core and heart of our spirit man is where our soul is. It's your mind, what you think about your will and your emotions. Now in saying that, I'm not talking about your brain. Your mind is not your brain. Cause in heaven, you live there when your body has died, your brain is in your body, obviously. You have buried or whatever's been done to it. You still have a mind that's a spiritual part of you that thinks and chooses and does other things. Your will also is with you in heaven. You couldn't decide what you wanted to do. And your emotions are definitely in heaven. You can be very expressive about a lot of things. So having a great understanding God calls me a soul doctor now. And he said people really want to pursue that can be soul doctors. You can help people lose things from their soul, the tragedies, the traumas, the fear, but then you bind the holy things, the powerful things, the love and the life of God to your soul. And nobody can take that out of you. When you have bound the things of God is the keys to the kingdom. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you lose on earth will be loosed in heaven. And you show me in great detail how to use those in that four hour time span that I was gone from here. Wow. Now, because you're talking about the soul, I'm going to jump to the fifth thing on my fifth question on my list. And then I'll go back to the top because this is, this will just, you know, pick you back on top of this. So a person by the name of Sunday asks, I have heard cats say that our soul does not sleep. And she said that a few times. My question is what does our soul do while our bodies are sleeping or our dreams, the journey of our soul? Now, I think this person's asking about physical sleep, but I'm thinking you might have been talking about the default doctrine of soul sleep. So I don't know for sure if she has the same angle of what you meant when you said our soul doesn't sleep, but maybe you did. Go ahead and touch on any of that that you like. Well, the one thing that they're talking about, that people think that when you die, you're doing nothing. They think that your body, you're in your body, your body goes into the earth or gets pre-made, and therefore it can't do anything. They don't understand the soul. The soul is a spiritual, fully spiritual part of you. And it says to be absent. This is when you pass away. The Bible says to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord that clearly tells you when your body dies, out of this body steps your spiritual body that looks like you, but much younger, is very aware of everything. It has memory. It still has emotions. And the excitement fills your spirit man because you know you're going home to heaven. When you step out of this body, the body, when the dead in Christ shall rise is your body you had. And then the soul, that spirit man, when soul will be joined back together on the day the dead in Christ shall rise. All those living in heaven will come back with Christ and they will get their bodies back and their bodies will be glorified at that time. So your soul does not need sleep. It's a spiritual thing. People do not sleep in heaven. They don't need to. You don't get exhausted. Your body doesn't have to be rejuvenated. You're living in the life of God there. But your spirit man has a literal life in heaven like you sit on your furniture in your mansion because you're in a spiritual realm. Those are spiritual things prepared for you. Your mansion is a spiritual thing, but it's literal because it's in the spirit realm. You, therefore, in that spirit realm can eat amazing food. You can go places, do things. So your spirit man is very active in heaven while your body is resting because it died. Some people don't even understand something that simple. But your spirit man still can make choices and understand things, get more revelation. You can learn to do new things in heaven. And so people are very active in heaven. No one's sitting around just resting in the arms of the Lord. If they did it, it was just because they loved him when they were near him, but they're not literally sleeping. And so your soul person, your soul and your spirit do not need to sleep. And sometimes he will catch you up and do his things with that spirit man while you're sleeping. And people have already proven that because they go into a foreign country. People recognize him later, say, you came and prayed for me and they never left their bed. And so you have your soul that are all you. I know this is really deep for some people, but that's how he can take you somewhere more than one place at the same time. And that will begin the increase. Oh, really? He can take a person more than one place at the same time? Yes. Oh, I haven't heard you say that one. That's interesting because you've taught about layers for years and years. So I've heard that. I didn't realize. So I've had people thank me for being in Argentina and different places. They've thanked me for. And I never was there to my knowledge. I mean, I've never been there on purpose. Okay. And yet they've thanked me for coming. And so that happens. But you're saying he could take me to Argentina and New Mexico at the same time. Yes, because you have layers of you. And actually the father's probably got more than anyone else, but the father is a many layer being. Holy spirit is a many layer being. It's one of the ways we're made in their image. Our soul has layers. The layers are not like this. They're like, I'm going to have to bring a model of something. But I've already got, I've already drawn the human soul, the spiritual one and one that would look like a model you could hold in your hand, take apart, understand how you're made. But that's one of the beautiful things about being made in their image. They all have layers of themselves in their soul. That's how Holy spirit can be everywhere, all at the same time. And if you, if you get born again, invited Christ in your heart, then it says he moves in. It says that he lives in you. It says that. And then he can influence you from inside, but you can also and then invite Holy spirit to indwell you. And then he takes a layer of himself literally and sends it to you when you invite him in and he moves in there too. And then it says in the Bible, when Christ sent him, he walks alongside you. But when we start inviting him, which is what he wants, you give him permission to indwell you, then he can speak to you from inside. So you'll hear him all the time speaking. Now I've heard, I've read where Paul said, at least in one place, he talked about, I think some of it was when he was disciplining the church, but there might have been another time when he said, when you're there and you come together, I'm with you in spirit. And I always thought that meant I'm with you. I'm with you in spirit. I'm for you. But I think, does it mean more literally like he really was there? I think sometimes he probably was there to observe. Yeah. Sometimes he sends you places to observe things. Sometimes you actually speak to people. Sometimes he makes it like you're in a place praying for people or even part of a meeting somewhere. And that has happened to several people and not just several quick, excuse me, quite a few people who've had that happen to them on a regular basis. And that is one of the things, if you give permission to the Father, the Holy Spirit to use you in any way they want to, but it's going to begin to increase because we can, in the natural, be in other places at the same time, but in the spirit we can, if that's what the Father wants, can take us to different places. And your layer of you looks just like you. Looks just like you in there. Yeah. Do you, do you recommend maybe not even just once, but every night when you go to sleep, say, Lord, if you can use me while I'm asleep, I give that permission to do that. I would totally say that. Every night even. You say it as often as you want to, because when you begin to show him, you believe that it's possible. You believe he does do that. And he did it in the Bible with Philip. Now, Philip, he just transported him physically in places, which he also can do that. And he looked for Philip, you know, he ran right up next to the chariot, that tells you how fast he was running. And God had an appointment with him to speak to that person in the chariot. And when he was done, he was no longer there. I said he was no longer found, but he was found in another place. So there are examples in the Bible about being transported in the spirit, but people don't understand what they mean. So some of them don't read them. There is a question that I think is one of the best as a supernatural God, because everything has the ability and made us in certain ways that he can do things like that with us. Now there's a question also on my list today that says, from Simone and the question is, when Jesus lived on the earth, did he still have layers of himself in heaven when he lived here? That's the question. Um, I don't know that he did. I think when he came that was, that was that had to totally be him that had to be his. He was in his spiritual body, but God put flesh on him. It says the word was flesh. He had flesh put on him. Jesus used to be all spiritual body. He was a spiritual being. He didn't have flesh on him at one time. But when he said yes to come and die and walk this earth as a human so that people would know he was here, know he was real, then he had to have flesh put on just so people could see him. He has still got that flesh. He's got the same flesh. You can see the holes in his hand. And actually, they're in the wrist. You can see all the things on him from his crucifixion. He actually does have his immortal body. He's in his immortal body, but looks very similar to what he did when he walked on this earth. Yeah, so good. OK, good. Now, here's a Daisy, age 11, is asking this. Was it the Holy Spirit's horse named Thunder, one of the horses in the chariots of fire that took Elijah to heaven? OK, so that's the question. I guess you must have said that the Holy Spirit had a horse named Thunder. I haven't heard you say that. OK, so I don't want to know if that's the same horse that took Elijah. That's what they do. I'm not sure which horses were used. I'm sure there was more than one, though, to take that chariot. Jesus does have a horse named Lightning. And when he says in the Bible, my Lightning goes from the east to the west. He's not talking about natural Lightning, but he's talking about his horse that he rides. He rides it quite a bit in all over heaven, outside of heaven. And Holy Spirit, and he do ride together sometimes. And that was probably especially before he had flesh put on him. They're very close. I mean, they are all God. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is a triune Godhead, which means that they all rule together. But they each all have their own body. And some people picture, because it's a spiritual body, that you can't actually see it. But that's not the way it is in heaven. So that is, I know for sure, it probably was Lightning since Jesus sent that chariot. He sent that. The Lord of Hosts, I'm sure some of the hosts were even present also when Elijah was caught up in that chariot. But that was a physical thing that happened. And yet he was still seen, especially by Elisha. I did see him go up in that chariot. OK, cool. Now, Kathleen is asking, will tattoos show on a resurrected body? So your resurrected, will tattoos still show? I can't say that they would, because that was something you had done on the earth. And I do know that when your body is resurrected, it's going to be new. It's going to look young. I don't know that you will keep marks from the earth at that time on your body. I know that God's going to put some on you when you get to heaven, it says so. So God puts a mark in your forehead and a mark in your hand. It says that in the Bible, the city of your God and your God, you'll be marked with those marks in heaven. So in other words, if you had other ones that stayed on you, he wouldn't be able to do that without erasing them. So I believe probably that when you get your resurrected body, I don't think that there'll be earthly tattoos on me at all. OK, good. Yeah, you know, I'm being the purist. My idealist is maybe a better word. I don't like the idea that Jesus still has holes in his hands in heaven. I want him to be all healed up. But I get the point. We can see what he did for us. But I find myself often when you describe that, I go, I don't want him to have holes anymore. I want him to be healed. It's the evidence. It's the witness. It really is the witness that it's him. And he loves those marks because he did for us the fact that they pulled the wool over Satan's eyes. In other words, Satan would not have ever wanted to kill him, had he known what was going to happen after that, that he would show up in hell, wipe up hell, take the keys of hell, death and grave, and we very jumps on off of Satan, which the Lord did that right before he came out of the grave when he was down in hell. It says he crossed over hell. And so he would have never, ever wanted for that to happen. And yet he encouraged them to crucify Christ, although that was the plan for Christ to give himself. And he said, no man takes my life, but I lay it down. He actually said that about Calvary, that he laid that life down. So I don't think had they wanted to kill him and he wasn't supposed to do that, they could have never killed him. I have a question about hell, you talked about Hitler is now, even literally, on a meat hook in hell. You said that. And last time you were on, we talked about there is no let up that the punishment is forever and ever and ever. And you mentioned that in so many words. So my question is, are the people like Hitler suffering? I don't know how to ask the question. Are they suffering much worse than someone that just says, I don't want Jesus, I don't believe in it. I'm sorry, I just don't want it. And that person now doesn't go to heaven. Is suffering equal? Or is there some that are tortured more than the other? I think the more evil you are, he puts it in their face. Because they think they do. Most evil people who have actually made a covenant with Satan to be evil on the earth and Hitler did do that, he thought and was promised a position. And Satan has always done that. You all remember when Christ was in the wilderness and that was his time of temptation. And Satan appeared to him and he said, you see all these amazing, beautiful cities that belong to me. I will give you them if you bow down and worship me. And that's what he wanted. Of course, Christ said, get away from me. He only serves the living God. But even that happened then, because that was his mode of operation, Satan will go to people who don't care about life itself that want to be wicked and he'll make a pact with them. If you're as evil as this and tell somebody he wants them to do, I will give you power on the earth. And then when you get to hell, I will give you places to rule and reign. He gives nobody anything except torment. And he makes it, he mocks them in hell. He just got them to be stupid enough to be wicked for him thinking he was going to celebrate that. Let me, oh, excuse me, I've got to take a drink, just a minute. Go ahead, take a drink. I'll do that too. Well, no. Yeah, so because there's a part of me that says if somebody just, I don't want this Jesus, I don't believe it, I think it's a fairytale and they just reject him, that seems like a hugely different thing than what Hitler did and some people who are torturing children. And so I wondered if their punishments were very... It is worse. It definitely is absolutely worse. But the thing is, God desires even the violent sinner to be free because of the price his son paid, the price he paid for sending his son that is available to anyone who will receive it. It's not God's wish. And I don't think hell was ever created for people to suffer in, that was a place for the demons to stay until their extreme punishment, even they get punished later, they won't have any ability to rule. And I do want to make one actual comment. They are tortured, everybody in hell is tortured by all kinds of horrible things up until the day that the dead in Christ rise and even after the tribulation and all that time is over when it's all over that God intends to do, Christ ruling on the earth, that big final last battle when the last one is sent from God himself to be born in the earth, time will be no more. The Bible says that at that time, we will all be in heaven, of course, being celebrating and everything, hell will be empty. There will be a time when hell is empty because that's not their final place of torture. The lake of fire is clearly talked about in the Bible. They will all be thrown into the lake of fire that will not be on the new earth or even around the new earth that will be in a whole different place. And that's where they will spend eternity burning in this lake. And even Satan will have no power in that place. Nobody will have power and it will be their captive prison for all of time. They will be let out from hell so the books can be read. We will not be at that. We will not be at the great white throne judgment. That is for the wicked. So you will not be present there and God will read all the sins they did and the rejection of Jesus Christ and why they made their own choice and they're gonna know why they made that choice and then they will be cast into the lake of fire. So there's something worse than the torture that in torment that goes on hell now but everybody will be tormented the same at that time. It won't be like different, different, different things. And we've covered this a number of times what I'm about to ask. And that is God will, if people are praying and standing for a loved one, you've said many times he will then obligate himself to answer that prayer by going to them at the moment of death and say, do you want me now? It gives them one last chance. So it's not like someone said, I don't believe it. I think it's a fairy tale. They'll have an opportunity for a moment in time at least to see him in his glory and then reject him or not reject him. Am I saying that right? I think anybody who has somebody passionately praying for them to know Christ and you know that they'll have the opportunity, but he has the keys. That is the clear evidence, Steve. That's why he took the keys Christ when he was on the before the third day, end of the third day, when he was resurrected and came back into the tomb. The last thing he did was wipe up hell. He literally melted the faces of principalities and powers. Those are high level demons that sit on thrones around the world. They do not live in hell. I mean, people don't understand that type of thing, but they were called into hell to see Satan torture the son of God. Yes, that was the plan on their side. It never happened. Then he took every gemstone off of Satan, which was his pride. He took them off of him and took them back that God had put on him. And then the last thing he did was take the keys of hell, death and the grave. The Satan did not have supreme authority to hold people there. If there was a reason why that was given, the Bible says it's appointed unto man once to die. And then at that moment, the judgment, that's not the judgment seat of Christ and that is not the great white stone judgment. At the moment they died, there has to be a judgment. Does he have the right to go to them and say, do you want me now? Are there prayers that have been put forth for this person that he can use that key, whether it is as they're entering into hell, as they're being buried or at their moment of death. Those are time, those are like windows of time that he's allowed to use those keys, not years later, not months later, he can do that. But it's appointed unto man once to die and at that time, the judgment is made in heaven. Can Christ go to them? That's why it's important to never stop praying for your loved ones, those who are like your loved ones, that they will know Christ, that they will be in eternity with you, don't stop praying that. And Christ said to tell people when I came back, they will be surprised when they get there, some of them, even though they prayed for them, to find out that they actually did go there. And of course, he has to ask them, he doesn't just say, I'm here to take you, he must ask them, do you want to receive me now? And then they still have to repent and repent to him. There's a few, I don't know how many, but there's a few who said, no, I'm not wrong with you. And you would think they've become so insane that they just don't want anything to do with them and then that seals their. That seals the weather. So either, I think I asked you this about it because this was the thing when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, some people were declaring her already in hell suffering. And I didn't feel right to me, not that I claimed to know whether she was or not, but I know whole women's groups who stood for Ruth Bader Ginsburg for years and years and years. So God, by that, God would have obligated himself to give her one more chance. If everything you're saying is true, which I believe it is, he would have said, do you want me now? And I'm sure we probably did do that. And I can also say this that I personally know there's been a group of people for almost 60 years praying for celebrities in Hollywood to know Christ. Wow. They've been praying that they even, I even got one of the lists one times of all those that they were praying for. Some of them are still alive on the earth, but I have seen, I haven't had time to write a list down or anything, but I've seen a few of the celebrities in heaven because they did either at that moment of death or them knowing. Now, it was easier back in the day when people knew and believed there was a God and there wasn't heaven in hell. A lot of people would have at that last moment say, hey, I'm receiving Christ. They would have automatically done that, knowing where they would go. But in this world today, that's not even taught a lot in a lot of places. But I'm grateful to God that he did allow that window, those windows of time. And that's why Christ, one of the reasons why he had to die. And you know, people go, well, it was finished. It was finished on the cross for your sin. But he had to go back and take back our power and authority and dominion. He gave Adam and Adam gave it away to the devil. There had to be a way that somebody could enter into that realm and because they were righteous, had the right to take it back. And that is exactly why, one of the reasons why Christ didn't just go back to heaven the minute he died when he left his body. He asked his spirit to leave his body. It didn't go up to heaven at that time. And even when he comes out of the grave later and Mary sees him, he says, I have not been to the Father yet. So that clearly tells you he didn't go up to heaven when he died on the cross. He descended into paradise, which is where he counted people faithful because they believed in God himself. And when they died, they were taken to paradise, which is still sort of in the middle of the earth, but you can look down and down and across. You can see where the gates of hell are. These are spiritual places. You're not going to go down there and find the people. But it does talk about Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and that Christ went and led captivity captive. That means he captivated them with his death and with his willingness. He went down there to share the gospel to them, number one. And then he went across on his own, which no one had ever done to show up at the gates of hell. So he could then on that day, when the Father made it known, it was time for him to stand up and the power of God shot through him. And he basically wiped up hell at that time before he went up and got his body back. Awesome. All right, this is probably a quick answer, almost a yes or no kind of. Mary is asking, do you by any chance know if Vincent Van Gogh is in heaven? I don't know. I haven't, I don't know. I haven't seen him. Yeah. I know that we get lots of questions that it's not like God takes you all over to heaven and shows you 2,300 people. No. Yeah. So, okay, Simon asks, it's humanly possible to speak something into, oh, I guess. Oh, okay. This is a statement on a question at first. It's humanly possible to speak something into existence as we are made in the image of God. Success coaches call it manifesting and meaning the secular world do it to create a life they love. What does the Father think of this? And can we as believers use this gift in a similar way, or does he want us to do things different? So what, how? Well, there are some things that people in the secular world kind of understand. They're not sure exactly how that kind of thing operates, but I'm telling you the manifested sons and daughters of God are mentioned in the Bible itself. It says the earth is crying out and is in travail. So a lot of the stuff going on in the earth right now isn't saying the end is here to get out. It's the earth saying, okay, manifest sons are a stand up and start speaking of the power of God and the life of God into this world that needs it. So things can change at different times on the earth when we do that. I mean, it's gonna happen. That's one of the reasons why Jesus isn't coming to take people away in an escape plan, okay? He's coming to set us on fire with baptism and fire to let us allow us to carry the glory of God and release it all over the earth. This is the knowledge of the glory and the understanding of the glory of God will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea. That's us taking it and shock waves of that will go through the earth and things will happen immediately. There's too many things left that we have to do that the Bible says we will do, but a manifest and son and daughter to God is that, that this talked about in the word. It's us going to higher levels, believing in God and knowing him, understanding what he wants done and knowing that we are allowed to do these things because it was given to us by Christ to do these certain things. So I don't know about what they're doing or what a man themselves are doing. I do know people do get what the ideas do come from heaven and many of those are just taken to the earth and they go around there to drop into the mind of man so that certain things can and will be created. But as far as that statement, I'm not sure probably. Well, and you know, there's just me guessing what he means, but could he mean, I think as Job, it says he decreed a thing and it was so, you believe probably and I mean, do you, have you seen the father talk to the father about our responsibility to decree things on this earth? We send the host, but what about decree? I decree God's best and life for me and for my family. I decree that, you know, what about that? It's similar to sounding than what he's saying. Can we be clarifying? I think that what he's talking about is making things happen. Oh yes, some things actually will be formed. I mean, there'll be a point where we go and speak to the desert and command vegetation to come up. And it will. Okay, well. Now we don't want that thing. Yes, that is gonna happen. It will, we will speak to the land to see in the air and things will happen immediately because we have to manifest. One of the things God wants done is we have to manifest the presence and the power and the existence of Jesus Christ. And of course, the father and Holy spirit, that's going to happen and it is up to us. One of our assignments is to do that. In different times on the earth, there are always things given to man, especially those who believe in God, that things would happen, things would change, things would be built. We're in a transition right now, a very powerful transition of things like that, beginning to happen. But I have been seen and taken and shown that the mass that died, there'll be, I've already been shown, there'll be a mass death in a land, not here, it wasn't here, not knowing exactly what the land was that they were spoken to. All these bodies were laying there and they spoke life of God into them. And everyone in that whole bunch came to life. Oh, wow. Those kind of things are going to happen, Steve. They have to happen because manifest means to clearly and plainly make known who you believe in and who you serve. And that is why it's called a manifested son and daughter of God. It's not going to be everybody in the body that does it, but there'll be those who choose it, no matter what he wants or when he wants it, you're going to say yes to it and you continually obey. And if you keep obeying, you could do a point in your life where you learn the joy of obedience. And from that time, he doesn't no longer judge you on whether you did something or didn't do something because it's already in you and a part of you, then he will give things to you because of your love, is your love extravagant, are you helping others? It's, there's a whole process to being in the manifested son and daughter, but if the earth itself is crying out for it to happen, it's going to happen, it's going to happen. There'll be people do things like raise the dead that was cremated. That's the manifested son or daughter of God speaking to the earthquake in the middle of the earthquake and telling it has to go back and the dead will be raised. It's going to happen. So those things you're learning about, the clearing and decreeing, yes. It's powerful, it's not ruling. At the death of Christ, the earthquake and the graves were open and some saints were seen walking around. We don't know how many it doesn't say how many. Maybe there's a thousand, maybe there's 26. I don't know, maybe there's 20,000, but whatever that number was, will we see something like that on the earth before it's all finished, on a sinful earth? I'll just put it that way. We'll see that. Okay, go ahead. I don't know if that is what will be happening soon as the sons and daughters. I think when there's like, I don't know. I don't know how these people died. There were like thousands of them. Really? Wow. I don't know where it was. The young purpose probably didn't tell me where it was, but I was taken into the future before 2030. This will happen. This will happen before 2030. Before 2030, it will happen. And none of the bodies look like nobody was like blown up or none of that. I mean, I could clearly see the bodies. I was walking down this road. It was like a dirt road, like a sandy kind of a dirt road. And we rode in the Jeep. I actually was riding in the back of the Jeep. And I would probably assume I was there to raise the debt. Wow. And it just didn't look like it had been, just like it had been a recent death. Like it had just kind of happened. Okay. I haven't really explained this much to many people, but yes, this is like a whole town somewhere. Wow, okay. And the people were just all they had time to do. And they obviously knew that was gonna happen. Whoever was driving knew I was there for that. Oh, really? You will do this. He actually said, you will do this. But not just me. Other manifested sons and daughters will do. It's going to happen. See, it has to happen. If God said, can these dry bones live? And he said that as an example, you know, to the prophets that could these dry bones live? And finally he said, guys, he said, well, you know only, you know that, but they did come to life in front of him. And all that, I mean, everything that sent you, everything came back. And now those, those were really dead bones. Well, yeah. That's all we're not like that. You couldn't tell anything had happened. Like they weren't shot. They weren't bombed. Okay. Anything like that. But they only had time to wrap them. And they had just wrapped them on. They were just stacked. And I knew that that's what he had me there for. So I will say, I know that's going to happen. The only shows me reality. He doesn't show me symbolism. Yeah. Yes, literally. What will happen. And that really, actually, honestly, that's pretty close to the exact answer I was looking for. I don't think it had to be in my mind, people shaking earthquakes and the dead coming out. And more like, will there be groups of people is what I was asking that will suddenly be raised from it. I suppose there could have been, therefore on another time, a 9-11 type thing where 3,000 perished and someone manifested sense might be clear, something like that. Resurrections. And it's kind of like that that you're describing, honestly. I'm quite positive that that is why. One of the reasons why it is not the end. Because we are entering into a supernatural time where things will happen that nobody ever expects. The God would have already prepared the heart of these people. And they would have already been going towards total surrender of their life. I'm not talking about being born again. You're already, these people are going to be born again. But then getting to the place where, wherever you want to send me, wherever you want to take me, I'm giving you permission. You need to do it ahead of time, people. And then you stay in that place with him and build that relationship with him. He wants you to know him. I'm talking about Christ. He wants you to know him. But these things are clearly going to happen. The Bible talked about them happening. And that is why the earth is saying, okay, things are getting really bad. You need to stand up and start taking authority because Christ said himself, you will rule with me in this life. That's not just a statement. He wasn't just making a statement. He was talking about things that will happen. Ruling and reigning is dominion and authority at great levels. That's why he says, know you not that you are kings and priests unto your God. Those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion that some will walk in. They're going to walk in that. And they will speak and the waters will part and people will walk across. They will speak and literally speak to the ground and say, come forth life of vegetation and you'll see before your eyes come up. It's going to happen. Good, good, good, good. All right, Teresa is asking this question. What does the fear of God mean? Are we supposed to be afraid of God? No, that's not what that means. Okay. I do know what that means. That means you love him so much. You would never do anything to disappoint him, to hurt him or to make him look like not God. It's a reverential fear you have that you would never want to do something in your life to cause any distance between you and him, although that would probably be on your side, that you do something so wrong that you wouldn't have a relationship with him anymore. The fear of the Lord, there is something called the terror of God. Oh, man. That is for the wicked. Yeah. I think we'll be seeing some of that soon. And let me jump off on that for a moment. You've talked about, of course, we send the host, talk about or remind me what you said about, can we send the terror of God against God's enemies? It seems like you said, you don't speak against people or cursed people, but can you send the, it seems like you said, you can't send the terror of God against his enemies. Tell me what, if you remind me what that was. God had purposed us to, this is the thing. We were given this earth. I know it belongs to the Lord. So guess what? Satan doesn't get it. He don't give a mud that belongs to him. It isn't his. It clearly says the earth is the Lord's and the fullness of what it will produce, what we're going on. It's his. This is his earth and he made this earth and he made it for a purpose. So we could be born, sent from the Father at the time of conception and knit together. And it says in the Bible, God said, I knit you together in your mother's womb. He's talking about your little spirit man that lived inside the Father. That at the time of conception, it's knit together and attached to that daughter flesh and it grows within the mother's womb. So life begins at conception, not at birth. And so that's one thing I can just add for free. The Father is furious with those trying to kill the babies, take away their destiny. He had a purpose for everyone he sent. He's not gonna long tolerate that happening. There will come a time on the earth where it will be against the law, literally against the law in these years ahead, these generations ahead of demonstrating the power and authority of Jesus Christ, his dominion, what he wants, speaking his words and that happening right away, that's what we're going into now. Darkness will be crushed and pushed back and they won't even be allowed in some cities because of the power and the glory of God in some of those cities. But I can tell you right now, the terror of God usually is set from heaven and it does affect and impact physical wicked people. They can become so filled with terror, knowing the awe of God is affecting them. Some of them will probably run to get saved. Someone even wanna live because it's so powerful but God, it gets to a place. And you saw earlier in the, even the world when the world was made, there came a time when he would not tolerate things and he finally did something. He not finally, he did something about it at that time. But that is going about to happen in our lives. And you're living in a powerful time because no matter how much darkness is there, you're about to see that darkness severed and you're about to see a crushed pushback, judgment, serious judgment come to the wicked, the physical flesh wicked who've all come together to do this thing, to try to take our lives away, freedom away everywhere, they're not gonna get to do it. It's not the little drop of time Satan has and the tribulation is a very small part of time and it's not that time. There's too much that has to happen yet. So I'm gonna say the terror of God is usually set. It was sent at one time for Israel when Egypt had stuff going on, terror came upon people even back then. And it does happen, but usually the terror of God, I had a prophet walk up to me one time. I was one person in the church who always was on the floor. You know, I was so wiped out by God that I couldn't move. And I was sitting up in a prophet game, I'm playing it and he said, the terror of God is gonna be released on the surface and you'll be able to tell the people what to do about it. Oh wow. Which was a rare thing. Yeah. So I'm just telling people right now, don't be wicked. Don't be a part, don't participate, don't tolerate them, don't advertise, stop advertising about how wicked things are going on and start talking about the power and the life of God that is much greater than all the evil that's going on. And this evil is a temporary thing, so they can be judged. They're gonna be judged by God. I'm talking about the flesh people are gonna be judged by God and they will not escape that judgment, but the terror of God will probably come a little while before that. And people, what happens is you can't think straight. This is for the wicked. Your mind will be lost. You'll be so severely confused. You won't know how to even think normally because you'll be so terrified by God's presence moving across the earth and it is going to happen. It will not hurt us, it won't affect us in that way that belonged to him. But I'm telling you, there's about to be some demonstrations that no human hands will demonstrate at this time. It will be God himself. Good, good, good. All right, Frederick asks this, what will Michael and the host, which of course is the armies of heaven, what will Michael and the host do after the thousand year reign of Christ since all evil is God? So a lot of people have that question. What do you need an army for after it's all sin free? Well, they're not quite right. Okay. There will be a battle that will happen at the end of the thousand year reign. It clearly talks about it. It's the final battle. Okay. And Michael and the host and the father, the father will send fire and burn up all the wicked on the earth at that time who come up against his son after the thousand year reign, you have to remember, there is a thousand year reign, but there's a time period after that. At the end of the thousand years, it will be loose from the bottom of the steps that he can go around the world and tempt those who probably still don't want Christ. There'll be people alive. There will be seven, eight, 900 years old. It's just going to happen because of Christ's presence on the earth. So even after the thousand year reign, there's still another season of time. The Satan will go around, try to get people to come on his side and he's going to find them. And they'll want to do a big battle. It talks about the battle. They're going to have great armies come across a certain area on the earth to destroy Christ, to take the throne away from him because Satan is still stupid and he still hasn't learned that he's not going to win. And at this time, the father will himself defend his son. Christ will not have to lift a finger because in the battle prior to that, before the thousand year reign, at the end of the tribulation, Christ will be doing something about those coming to fight and war. And a lot of people that are wicked they will die at that time. But even during the millennial reign, there will be people on the earth who didn't choose Christ, who's still alive, natural man, and they will live for hundreds of years under Christ's rulership. But at the end of that thousand year reign, Satan will be lose to tempt those to see if he can get anybody to side with him, to build war, warring equipment and do these things to remove Christ from that throne. And I tell you in that battle, there will be no decision about anybody about who's going to win. The father will send fire from him, the clitoris says, and burn up all those armies. Wow. And then, Kat, okay, after that, after the final battle, then what happens to the armies of heaven? If you know, you may not even know. I'm quite sure that they will probably get to know a lot of people that they defended on the earth. They'll be speaking a lot of places on the new earth to them and I'm quite sure they'll probably be part of, I know that there will be people that will actually be taken to a planet to make things like vegetation and places, not people, that's never gonna happen again. They won't have to make people. But I'm sure that that army will be involved with going with them to make sure everything goes okay with them, not that it wouldn't. It wouldn't be to protect. Yeah. Because we won't need protection at that time. When all that's done evil will be judged. There will be no evil on the earth, no evil in the spirit realm. And all of that will be in the lake of fire. So I'm quite sure that they have plans of things that they would like to do and get to do things besides warring because that's all they do right now. Okay, awesome. Now, Shay is the name of this person, says I'm a Christian ventriloquist. Have you seen ventriloquists using their gift in heaven? I'm quite sure that people probably do that. I don't know, I don't think I've personally seen that happen. But I do know that gifts like natural gifts that people have and that is a gift. I've known a couple of people that did it. It was amazing. They do actually do it. It's not, none of my magic people, it's not magic. It's the skill they have and they've gotten very good at it. And so I'm quite sure that that would probably be in heaven. Okay. It's the skill it's a gift. Okay, now Margaret's asking this question. I get some of it, I'm not sure I fully understand. Margaret says in heaven, will we be able to trace our spiritual line of salvation back to Jesus' meaning similar to how family trees are traced backwards like so-and-so and so-and-so. So-and-so led so-and-so to Jesus. Then that person led another and then another. So they wanted to know like, if we could go back find out who was led to the Lord, I guess a thousand years ago that ended up with me or 2,000 years ago, if we're back to Christ. I'm quite certain that you will be able to do that because I know generations are God's deals and generations, he just does. That's why it's not gonna end. Now this generation is still coming on you is that things will have to happen through them or with them. And I'm quite sure there's a way you can trace that when you get to heaven. Okay. Now we're doing a good thing. And we're Margaret, we're doing a lot of questions today. Elizabeth asked, will we still be able to have our ears pierced in heaven? I really like mine and it's really the only jewelry I wear. Okay. I think that's gonna be between you and God. I do know that there are things, I know people will have marks put on them. I don't think I've ever seen that. That doesn't mean that's not gonna be allowed if it's done with the realm of God, you know? You probably wouldn't have to actually pierce it. You probably wouldn't have to have something pierce your ear to do that is what I'm saying. Just do it. You would have a way just to put things on yourself or anywhere, wherever, without it being pierced because you'd be supernatural. It's not like on the earth where food comes from. In other words, he's not subject. He doesn't have to have either piercings or clip-ons. He could say, put it there and tell it to stay, right? I mean. I'm quite sure he probably could because I've seen people's, everybody's mansion has a wardrobe room. There's probably thousands of square feet. I've seen it. I've been, I've walked through some of those like that and the apparel you get is unspeakable. It's just not even something I can describe. Even your clothes are like alive. There's only one size made in heaven and whoever puts it on it conforms to the size of your body. So you don't have to shop through racks of clothes for things. You just pick out what you like and it fits you when you put it on. I do know that much. Speaking of clothes, this was one of mine that I could keep meaning to ask you. Every picture of God and Jesus is always a big old long robe, white usually. Maybe there's other colors. Have you ever seen anything like the father or Jesus wearing jeans or jeans like? I'm just curious if you've seen something like that. I have seen Jesus. You have? I've seen, I've not seen the father where, I'm sure if he wanted to, he could wear whatever he wanted to wear, but normally I see him in the most glorious, their gowns. Not like a, of course a woman's gown. You know, it's just like a ship kind of thing. Glorious beyond description. And he has many different robes that he wears at different times. And then maybe that will change. He may wear other stuff. I don't know on the new earth, but. But did you say you've seen Jesus wear jeans? I have seen it. There's jeans in heaven. Awesome. I like that. There are heavens brand, trust me. They have heavens brand. They have them. You don't buy them. You just can go get them anywhere. I like that. That's very cool. Because you ride horses, Steve. You can't ride horses in a gown. That's right. Oh, I like that. I'm going to ride horses too. You're not riding the rush in the gown. You're not going to swim under the crystal sea in a gown. You actually have things to use to do that with. So, but I have seen Christ attending rodeos because he loves horses. I think he's always for the horse, though, not the ride. I think he's probably there to cheer the horse out. I'm real serious about that. Yeah. That's very good. All right. Why did David Joyce ask, why did David pick up five stones and only use one? What do the other four stones represent? Do they represent our authority and power for us to use against principalities, powers, rulers, or darkness and spiritual wickedness? I mean, they're guessing, I guess. What do you know, the four represents something else? I don't know that, but as you know, this David was very wise. Yeah. And David would get as many as he thought he might need. He's never going to just take a thing. He's going to take more than one. He should something else show up or something else happen. He might need it for that other thing. He didn't know. And so, but I'm sure there was a reason why he chose that money. So you'd have extra if he needed it. Someone said he had four brothers. Yes. Someone said he had four brothers. I don't know if I've never studied that, but if he really had four brothers, and that was just in case he needed to take out the brothers, but I have heard that he had four brothers. So I think it might be the, all right. Suzanne asks. I'm sure Goliath had others around him. I know he wasn't the only giant in the land. I think it was before if they showed up, I don't think it was about his brothers. I think if the other one showed up, the giants, if more guys could take them all out. That'd be awesome. All right, Suzanne asks. If Cap could take a picture of anything in heaven, it could be a person, place or thing and show it on the Elijah list. So that's a thought question. What would it be? What would you love to take a picture of and show it if you could? There's too many things. Come up photographer. You're asking a photographer. Yeah. There's so many good things. I want to, when I go to heaven one day, I will be photographing all of heaven just because I want to do that. But I think the most significant, moving, powerful, beautiful would be the throne, the throne room. Yeah. Oh, I love to see that. I can sketch the throne room and at one point I will paint myself the throne room. One of the promises God gave me was that I will, he will make me a fine artist. Oh, wow. I don't know how far down my journey I have no end to my journey. He's not told me any end while I'm on the earth. He will let me paint heaven and it will come alive when people look at it. And that's on this earth before things wrap up. See, now that's kind of one of the questions, type of questions I've tried to get an answer for is like, what if I want to be doing something? I often think of it as in heaven, but there are certain things that I've been asking him privately to do on this earth that I was talking with him about today. I'm not going to say it here, but I'm saying, Lauren, I'm not going to keep asking, I'm not going to quit asking you to do this on this earth. And so you kind of answered that, Kat, honestly. He told me because I was willing to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted and I can tell you all, if you had stood before the throne of the living God, you would know how real he is. Just because you can't see him doesn't mean he's not real. He's very real. He has great plans. He plans well in advance. He knows what is in time and eternity, but he also sees his own plans coming to pass. That's why it's not over right now. Nothing is over, except how awesome we will be living with the body of Christ. If you can't, let me expand it. So outside the throne room with Jesus himself, if you could snap one picture of Jesus doing something outside of the throne room, what would you take a picture of him doing? Probably something he really loves to do. Probably maybe him in the gardens. He's got the most amazing gardens all over his own. He does have a mansion of his own. It's glorious. He uses it to have celebrations in. So when somebody comes home to heaven, he can throw a big celebration. Besides the throne room celebration, he'll take them there. I think also probably I've seen him with the children. I've seen him with the little babies. That would probably be something else. I would definitely want to take a picture of when he's with the little babies. Maybe they were aborted. Maybe they had become miscarried. How much he loves them. And he holds them in his hand and talks to me like that. I think probably something like that showing that he has a heart. He does. He's all powerful. He now is our king. And he says that to me all the time. When I come back, it'll be as a king. Because he already came as savior. When he comes back, it'll be as a king. Awesome, awesome. By the way, while I'm talking, put that, if the team could put up the website for people to ask more questions of Kat, we're going through them really fast right now on purpose. Questions for Kat, fill out the form and go to, they're going to put questions for kat.com, which I don't see up there right now, but I think it's going to be there in a second. All right, this is the middle of my time. We can ask a couple of quick questions here. Virginia asks, is there a place in heaven where we can watch a replay or a replays of our loved ones' reactions to their homecoming and see the joy that they experienced when they first reunited with the father and the ones who had gone on before them? That would be a cool thing. They say, what did it look like when my dad showed up? I would love, can you see anything like that? Yes, absolutely, I have seen that. And people love to do that. They have this, a place where they have many different, I call them mini theaters, and they probably maybe hold a hundred people. That's a small one, because I have been to the movie theaters, which of course is no profanity, just so you know, you can't start judging. They make movies in heaven people. Guy has always told stories. He loves to tell stories. The best movie theaters are in heaven. You're playing to be there. You better receive Jesus Christ. They capture what's being made in heaven. It's not like a film, you have to process it. But there's places you can go into. You can go into your parents' theater. They have one that shows their life really, minus any sin. No sin is shown at all, because they've already been forgiven. The great days in their life, fun times in their life, really funny times. But in that theater, towards the end of that show that you're watching, you will literally see how they were caught up to heaven. Were they taken in a chariot? Did they go in something else? What did they say? What did they see when they got out of the, there's a place you disembarked. Oh man. These things that bring you what the expression was, what they were feeling, what they were saying. And then you could go in the throne room and see their whole celebration party. Then you could see them go to their mansion that was given. God doesn't let you miss anything. You're not going to miss anything. That's good. That's really good. You know what? Then this before when we talked about the theaters down, I'm thinking, man, the popcorn's going to be so good. Oh, we do have food. Oh my goodness. Like, they wouldn't give you, they loved to eat in heaven. Oh yeah. Absolutely. I think in my first book, I described the movie theater I was taken to. Isn't that? Well, that was actually the first time I was taken. Yeah. In Christ that I was taken to somewhere fun. He said, I'm taking you somewhere fun. He said, you were so serious about everything in your life. You need to understand that we're fun. We do have fun. So I'm taking you to a fun place. And it was a movie theater in heaven. And that's when I saw John Wayne acting in a movie. And they do have popcorn and they do have snacks. And then they have another place outside within the theater where you could sit there and discuss what you saw, how excited you were. The actors who were in are right there to talk to you. Usually your family members get to start films too. Again, nothing defiling is in there. There's no profanity. And that's when God also told me, I'm going to give you what we think about the movie ratings. And he said, God said, you know how they rate movies? Yeah, yeah. You know, rubber, 17 and then R. He said, this is what we say those ratings mean. G means good, you know, depending on what the movie is about. We wouldn't say it was good if it was witchcraft. I can tell you that. But G means good in heaven. PG means partly good. Okay. PG 13 means it's got some not good stuff in it. R ratings down here. R means rotten. Don't watch it at all. And he said that to me. That's what he's saying. That's what we call those ratings. I see. Yeah, he's talking about the earthly ratings for the movie theaters. R means rotten. Don't go see it. Okay. Wow. Wow. Let me just, for the last question, let me ask this. Cause you just opened a interesting door about God took you up and a very first trip he gave you was to do something fun. Cause he said, you're very serious. Talk about what if you could, there's a bunch of people who they say, you know what? People are always telling me I'm so serious. And I know I don't want to necessarily be too serious, but what tell them the people who say, yeah, they're always accusing me of being too serious. What would you think God would want to tell them now? Right now, try to lighten up some. You know, it's okay to be serious about the Lord and, you know, and I'm not talking about change your relationship with him at all. I'm not saying that. I'm saying the way you respond to people who ask about Christ. Yes, he is a risen Lord. Yes, he died for sins, but he also enjoyed laughing. When he was on the earth, he loved to laugh. He loved to be at celebrations. He loved to attend the wedding. He loved to attend the wedding. He loved to attend the wedding. He loved to attend the wedding is essential. That's why he was invited. He was at that wedding where he changed the water into heaven's wine people, not earthly wine. He made it into heaven's wine. And he did love to celebrate. And he was quite a character. And he was really good friends with a lot of the, not just his disciples, but he had other people that were his friends. And so, you know, don't be so serious that you can't have time to smile every now and then. One of the things the Lord said, you're gonna start smiling a lot and laughing a lot more than you do, so that when you get to heaven, you'll be used to it, probably. So people can actually see that you are a happy person. Maybe you might want to know them. Maybe you'll be more a little bit approachable. I'm not telling you to go out drinking. I'm not saying to go out partying, just so you can be with people, don't do that. That messes up your testimony and your witness of how Christ lives in you. So I'm not ever gonna tell you to do that, but you need to be seen to have fun and like to have fun and to laugh at things because we have to show that we have a sense of humor sometimes. Yeah, and I think I can say without fear of being wrong. Well, because you talked about eating cake, I think I can say without fear of being wrong that you're saying God wants you to laugh and lighten up now amidst all of this COVID and geopolitical things that are going on and threats of war. He wants them to still have fun. Yeah, he's not saying to ignore the evil or wickedness, but you're supposed to rise above it and you need to let people know. I am not afraid of this. I'm not tolerating it. I'm speaking against the evil. I'm praying for people. I'm setting the army of heaven to hold on strongholds of evil in places, but I also can laugh. I need to take time to laugh. It's nice to have a balanced life. People know that they can come and see you and maybe discuss something that is fun or is exciting, even exciting. And so I would encourage people, and I know some people are having hard times, but why don't you ask? He actually had me people start asking, asking for him to let you have fun. That's good. And people don't even pay for it sometimes. So you have not because you asked not. And I know it's important to have bills paid and people healed. Those are always gonna be important and you haven't got to worry about that, but you also need to make sure that you leave room for fun in your life. And yes, it's okay to ask. Can I have fun? Can you send me some fun? Or you want me to have fun? That would probably be the best thing. Because he will surely do that for you. He will surely do that. Okay. Okay, Kat, tell people real quick about revealing heaven and catcur.com, those two, and then I'll maybe ask you to pray as we go out, but talk about those two sites real quick. Revealingheaven.com. I really didn't choose any of this stuff. I didn't choose the title of the book. I didn't choose the names of the websites. I don't choose almost nothing because I let him tell me what he needs and what he wants. So he actually named the book revealing heaven. And I had picked other names and he said, how about revealing heaven? Do you think that explains what it does? Reveals heaven? I went, yeah, I think it does. And so revealingheaven.com is our main website. It's where you can find events that are gonna be planned. It's where you can find products that he wants us to make on purpose. He wants us to reveal heaven and earth. Sometimes us to written form, spoken form, but sometimes it's through things that we make. Things you can hang on your wall, things that you can wear, things that you can drink out of, like this is our newest cup we just had made. It is a coffee cup or a hot chocolate. And so we probably will have it down at Robin's place, but it says, I don't do demons. And that is the number one quote the Holy Spirit gave me to make things out of because you're not supposed to really bash people. You're supposed to love people, but you can bash hell. And so that means I make a statement. I don't do demons, means I don't tolerate them. I don't participate with them. They were thrown out of heaven on the lightning bolt and therefore I will have nothing to do with them. I will help people get free of them, but that's about it. So that's why we make different things. So you'll find a store there that has a lot of things about heaven on there. And of course there's testimonies, I think. I think they just revamped the website. I barely got to look at it the other day and I'm like, wow, it's completely different, but it's easier to navigate through. And so there's new things on there. And then there's catcurve.com, which is a spiritual platform for the father to say whatever he wants to say and everyone wants to say it. And so there's a lot of quotes from Holy Spirit. There's a gallery that shows you what things look like in the spirit realm that we have created those things. There's also some photos there of the host and stuff there. And again, that is the only place you can give online. There is no other Facebook I've made than the catcurve Facebook or the catcurve YouTube. I don't have other places like that. I only have those two. And so that's why you go to the two different places. And if you want to give online, it's catcurve.com. And I think you click on the treasury or something like that and you can even become a member, a guardian zone member that helps to bring heaven to earth by supplying a funds for me, praying for me. And I really appreciate the guardians very much. We're gonna start some new things with them. Once we move and get our building, we're not just moving for a home. We're also looking for a building. We have an actual building that we can have our offices in. That's gonna be exciting for us. So thank you for praying for us and standing with us. And we stand with you in these times. We're not tolerating the enemy, Satan is your number one enemy and that he's just has a hold of a lot of people right now and God's exposing who is in the light, who is in the darkness, and he does have plans to do great things on this earth still. So good. So good, Kat. Kat, go ahead. If you feel like it, go ahead and pray for the people as we go out and that'd be good. That'd be awesome. Yeah, Father, I just pray right now on your behalf, God, before the throne of God, I declare and decree that this earth will be free, this country, America. America was born to be free, still is free. Yes, God's gonna do some amazing things, Father. I thank you for helping those who are in fear, who are in lack, who've had things stolen from them, taken from them, things that have been lost. I thank you for restoring them, restoring their properties, restoring their homes with even better things. God, I thank you for showing your hand of justice on their behalf and also extending the hand of life and love towards all these people out here who are praying to you, Father. I thank you for the suddenlies coming in their lives, the things they never expected to happen, will begin to happen in Jesus' name. And right now, every demon out of your home, I sever every spirit of witchcraft trying to operate against you right now, and I say to the devils, get out in Jesus' name. You have no power here. We give you no power. We give you no permission, but we rule with Jesus Christ, and you're about to see us rule and reign for many generations to come. I'm looking forward to tomorrow and the rest of my life on this earth, and I pray God that you get help wherever you are, whether it's spiritual, physical, mental, or emotional. I thank you, God, for bringing ways of healing to this nation and to this world in Jesus' name. Remember to forgive those who speak against you. It opens the door for a Holy Spirit to go pursue them. Very good, very good. Kat, thank you so much. We love you and your team. And a quick reminder that Roger Stone will be our second program today at three o'clock Pacific, six o'clock Eastern. Have a great day, everybody. Thank you again, Kat. We love you all. See y'all later, Kate. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. 

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE - Episode 99

This is the end of this video. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video. I hope you enjoyed this video. Hope you enjoyed this video. Hey, everyone. Welcome to Elijah Streams. Today is Wednesday, October 19, 2022. I'm your host, Kelsey O'Malley. I'm filling in for Steve Schultz today. We have an awesome Wednesday plan. Kat is here with us, and she's going to be sharing updates, but also answering questions that you guys have sent in. And there is a list of amazing questions. I can't wait to hear her answer because some of these questions, I myself am like, yes, yes. What does this mean? So I'm so excited to be here with all of you today. Thanks for tuning in. Thanks for being family with us and coming and watching us each and every day. Thanks for sharing the good news of Jesus to all your friends and family and just being so faithful to us. And you know, you guys, your giving has done incredible things for the people in Uganda. We want to share a video with you guys of what your giving has done for these people. I mean, fresh water is absolutely changing their lives. So take a look at this incredible video. The words that were already existing here in Uganda, we thought they were the safe ones to have, but actually they weren't safe at all. We would have to share this water with the animals. And you can imagine all the different contamination that can happen and go on in Uganda. Fetching water is done by the young children, the young boys and the girls. You had to move a long, long distance. And usually it is done in the morning and also sometimes very late in the evenings. We also have the elderly who we call the judges. These are the very old grandparents of different families who sometimes can't walk and also sometimes can't be able to carry the cans that we use to fetch the water. So they have to take days without even taking a shower or sometimes even not preparing a meal because they are saving water for the next day. I would like to say thanks to the opportunity that you guys came to this community and are changing so many lives. We appreciate you so much and may God bless you. And may God bless you, Lillian and all those sweet babies and all those people there. I just think of the scripture when Jesus says when we give a cup of cold water to one of these His disciples, our reward is great in heaven. And moving the heart of the Father looks like giving to the poor, looks like giving to those in need. And by partnering with us to do that, I mean you are really touching the heart of God and touching the heart of so many people who see His tangible love through our giving and through them building wells and it's changing lives. It's incredible that video is so touching. So thank you again so much from the bottom of our hearts for giving and partnering with us to show the love of Christ to the people all around Uganda. Thank you guys so much. If you have not yet followed American Warriors or heard of American Warriors yet, it is an amazing, incredible documentary series that Steve Schultz's Brother Warren does and it talks all about different soldiers and all these amazing stories from these men who've been through war and seen at first hand, lived at first hand. There's a brand new episode of American Warriors premiering today. You can find that on YouTube and also on Rumble. If you search American Warriors on Rumble or YouTube, you can find a brand new show going to air today. And today's show is about Les Davis. He's a 17, he was a 17 year old farm boy who joined the army to get away from home for what he expected would be an exciting adventure. He found himself in Korea within 600 men in his company caught in a brutal battle in which only he and one other survived. This is the story of his experience and how it changed his life. This here's the story of of an annoying massacre. The fighting just went on and on and on and finally I thought I better just get out of here. I started running. I think I must have run for two miles. I had no idea at the time but later on I'd found out that there was supposedly two survivors from that massacre. I didn't really think about myself as a survivor, just another soldier and I just did what I was told to do. Les, thank you so much for your service to America and for everyone that's intrigued in watching that. Please head over to American Warriors.

All right, without further ado, we have Kat Kerr coming on today and she's going to be sharing amazing stuff with us so let's bring her on and hear what she has to say. Love your intro, Kat. It's so cute. No fuzzy. It's nice to have you today. I'm happy to be here. I was just trying to tell Jen I'm a little bit fuzzy looking. You're clear to me. Okay, then it must just be my must be mine. Okay, I think I think you're clear to me. So I think you're good. But I know it says Wednesdays with Kat, but it's going to be Wednesdays with with Kelsey and Kat today. So yeah, I'm excited to be with you, Kat. I always love hearing all your revelation and your wisdom on heaven. But before we get into the questions, would you share with us any updates and amazing things that happened last weekend? Oh, yeah. It was awesome this past weekend. I was with Robin and I call her Lady Robin since Robin and Robin Bullock. And I actually got to stay in their vintage Victorian mansion that someone sold them so ridiculously wonderfully priced. And it's on the highest hill right there in Warrior, Alabama. Of course it is. And I got to speak in their new sanctuary that they had, he had bought like a shopping center in such a short amount of time. It is an amazing place. I think they went from seating like 250 to 1200 now. And it was awesome. But I got to speak twice. And then for Sunday morning, the Holy Spirit said, you need to impart the life of God to people. And that is the thing that is the thing that I carry. It's not just something. It's not just a word about something. It's not just a movement. It actually is the presence and it's the life of God. And when the Father anointed me to do this, I was not expecting what happened. It's sometimes for the very first time when I do that, people literally feel the presence, the manifest presence of God, because it's his life. It's just like standing before him almost. But it just comes out of my hands. It's like blue, it's like blue smoke or blue fire, sometimes with anointing, it's like blue fire, blue smoke kind of. And it makes a cloud that you can't always see. Some people see a little mist of it, but somebody captured a picture which really amazed me. And you literally see it coming out of my hands. I'm about to lay it on somebody's son and they took the picture. And you could see it come out of my hands, wrap around them, and then go into this cloud around the area I was standing in. And I always let people know you need to be prepared for being undone. Okay, it's not me, it's him. Totally undone. Sometimes you hear him say something. You sometimes you'll shake, sometimes you will jump, sometimes they jump. It's like getting hit with lightning sort of in some way, but the presence is so strong. People sometimes weak, sometimes they laugh, but they don't stand up for very long. And it even goes to the people, it passes through, it's a spiritual thing, which it can happen to people who normally lay hands on people in any kind of a ministry situation. It's the spiritual thing, the releasing so it can pass through that person's body to the people behind them, to the ushers. And the ushers always get really kind of wiped out, they'll stand up there, they're standing up there. It lasted five hours, five hours I stood and imparted to every single person there. And it got stronger and stronger. But I was not expecting to see it in that picture, but it totally captured it. I'm going to see if she can send it to me, maybe we can show it next time. But it was amazing. And people were so overwhelmed. Some people were healed, some people were set free. But the most precious thing was everybody in the line when they would come up to me, they would go, they wanted to hug and hold on to me, but we never got done. We would have never got done, but it was awesome. It was powerful. And God really does love you. He does. And they would walk up there and I would say, He loves you. And then I would lay my hand right here on them. I always tell them we're going to lay it. And because it comes right here from the center of my hand, and it flows right into their spirit. And so it was an exciting time to be there. And of course, I got, we got to sit a little bit with Robin and talk to him about things that are coming, things that are hearing, we do the same thing. So it's wonderful to develop a friendship with some of these prophets, you know, because we understand each other. We know it's not going to be normal in the household. It is never normal, not in mine, not in theirs, not in Hank, not in anybody's. But it's wonderful that in the past, you didn't always get to do that. You came and went, came and went, but I really want to have a relationship. So that's really developing. And I'm exciting about it. But we are all in agreement on one thing. Life is about to never be the same again. God is absolutely going to move on this earth. And a powerful, amazing things are about to happen. And I think next week, which will be number 100 episode, I think we should definitely have some cake during that event. Yes, everybody get your cake already for next week, next Wednesday. Yes. And I wanted to ask you something about when you release the life of God, when people walk up, is there a posture for people who've never experienced anything like that? Maybe they haven't been to a meeting where someone's laid hands on them. Can you posture yourself to receive? You stand like this, you know, you have your hands, you're receiving it. This is, this is, like I'm receiving it. That's what that means. It's coming from God. He just uses me to do that. But that's what I tell people. If you're uncomfortable, just hold your hands up. You're about to receive something because you are. You don't, you don't have to raise them up. You don't have to even touch me at all. And so I, but I always let the people know sometimes he'll tell me to impart it to their soul, which is by your stomach, the core of your very core of your spirit man, the very center of your spirit man is where your soul is. And your soul is not a little thing. It is not little. It looks like this beautiful, amazing, big column and God has written things to you on this column. It's your soul. He writes on it. So it's like this column and then off of that comes the layers of you, like a big fan. And it's you. There's many images of you and on your soul. Those are your emotions. And then your mind is a little bit at the top of this thing. So your mind, your will, which is that powerful column and God did write things to you on there when you were in heaven before you left to come to earth. So I understand how it operates. All those layers of you, if I could have a book to bring it out, I would do it in between all those layers. So it's not layers like I used to say, not like a fluffy biscuit. No, I used to say like an onion. And the Holy Spirit said, excuse me, we'd rather be a fluffy biscuit than another one. If you do not know Holy Spirit, she makes me laugh a lot, but he also tweaks me. He also shares things with me. That's why he's there. Guidance. He gives you instruction, but he also can be very funny. So after I start saying, you know, sort of like a fluffy biscuit, not an onion. I actually finally just drew and we're actually going to have the image made like, like a piece of art. It's amazing that you really understand how you are put together. And you know, those things, the soul and the spirit man, no man can make those. You know, the flesh part, yes. That's why they need heaven involved. Heaven is involved all the time in your lives, even at the very time of your conception. They take one of the little spirits of life that would be you or me or someone that's where we came from. And he would take us down to the mother's womb at the time of conception and knit and attach that little spirit man in the soul to that flesh. And that is when life begins. That's when your life begins, when you're attached together and the body, little body, the baby grows, your spirit man grows also. But it says in the Bible, God said, I knit you together in your mother's womb. And people think, well, he put her arms and legs on, that's not what he did. He literally put you, that was still you, your little spirit man and attached it to the mother's womb so it could grow. So that's how life begins. So really, when you have that moment where a husband and wife meet and that happens, life gets created, you really have a true visitation from the father. Every single woman who's ever been a mother had that visitation. And it's the only way life can be. It's the only way. If you remember in the Bible in Genesis, when they made Adam, when the Lord made Adam, and his body was perfect, and it says it was laying there, but there was no light then, it was just the body. And the father who was with him leans over and breathes Adam's spirit of life that it says in the Bible, that was his spirit, man and soul, breathes it into his nostrils. And he said, you have become a living soul. That's what he called him. So that's when Adam got his soul, then he was alive, and then he could think and make decisions. But really, in a way happened to all of us. So at the time of conception, your guardian angels are sent them. When Holy Spirit brings that little spirit of life with your soul in it, and let us attach, your guardian angels are brought with that. So you never even left heaven alone. And they will hang around the mother. I see them all the time with pregnant women, that baby's angels are outside the mother waiting, so they can never be with that baby from the time that you're born. And what do you think about when Jesus blew on the disciples and said, receive the Holy Spirit like it would, it always reminds me like it's, it's like, it's like that new birth, like God blew into Adam, Jesus blew into the disciples. So we actually, we receive from each of them, the Godhead, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, there's something we receive from each of them, at some time on this earth, you will have an encounter, even though you don't see it. The Father sends you down here, right? And it plants you in there. And then Jesus helps to bring Holy Spirit, and then he also was inside of you, right? And so, but you get something from all three of them. Because you've been forever with the Father, you lived in him, it says in the Bible, in him, we live, we move, we have our very being. That is the Father, because we didn't live in the time of Jesus. He had enough of us when we were born, and he had to come die for us. But you know, when you receive Christ, he does step inside of you. When you receive Holy Spirit as your guide, you know, as your guide and your counselor, and he's still part of the Godhead, he puts a layer of himself, which is a whole of himself. This is, this is revelation to some people. Okay. And then you receive him. So I'm telling you, you are so filled at that moment with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. That's what makes you powerful, but you need to know who you are. And so I love all this revelation that they have given me about how they put us together and know what begins to happen in our lives because of us having them. But Holy Spirit who indwells you, really, that's the best way to get him to have him speak to you. Now, when he first comes to you, he'll walk alongside you. So he's alongside you. So when you get born again, he comes alongside you. He comes alongside, he comes alongside. But you have to invite him. Inviting is part of heaven's protocol. You have to invite to partake. So you must invite Jesus Christ to be your Savior after you've repented. And then he literally will step inside of you. And then when you invite Holy Spirit, he will too. So if you had a spiritual picture of this, this thing about them dwelling and abiding in you, you would be so amazed. I can't sketch it. I haven't sketched it yet. It'll probably be in book three. But you can have them step in you and allow them to give you this information. When you get to have it, the Father will be sitting there and Jesus will step inside of him. Holy Spirit will step inside of him. And you will step inside of them. And we will be one. Wow. Jesus was talking to the Father and he said to the Father, you and me and me and you, that means they can have ability to step inside of each other. Father, I pray that they will be just like us. They will be one with us just like that. And so you do get to do that when you get to heaven. It is an amazing, you get overwhelmed so much by the love and the life flowing in you. And you feel so powerfully amazed at what has just occurred in your life. But most people don't get that told them. They don't understand. Most pastors don't understand that God did put you together literally, sent you from himself. And it says, you know, he is our Father. We are his offspring. Well, every mother knows that means you carry them and then you have them. And so he literally did carry us. And by the way, everybody, you've been from the beginning to the end. And the end of the beginning because we were still, we were in him before he made this earth. It wasn't like one day he made us. Not that way. We've always abided in him as a little spirit being. And he used to jump on the rainbow as it came from him. You'd ride it. You can see him in heaven. They'll come from in right on this rainbow that goes in and out, moves like the northern lights in and out of him in waves of vans of color. Do they look like, do the spirits look like little lights or little beings? Because he's called, the father's called the father of lights. Is that the little spirits? It is. We had a little, our little spirit you saw. It looked like a little child kind of, but not a baby. When he says, you know, every good and perfect gift, which be us, comes down from the father of lights. The reason they said that is your spirit man has made totally out of light. You can see them. They look like, you know, little individuals, but you're lit up. You literally have light in you from living in him. So the father of lights is not talking about the stars. It's talking about all of those, all of those, whoever lived. You lived in God first, even the ones who don't want him. That's where you came from. You are his offspring and he's going to get you. And does that tie in too with like, because a lot of people wonder about for knowledge and predestination. You hear a lot of people, well, if God knows everything already, then what can I, you know, even the Bible talks about, what can I do? You know, God knows everything. We were foreknown in predestined. Yes, we were foreknown. And that's because we've always been. That's right. Yes. Yeah, he already made plans for us while we were in him. And he literally chose what generation of time you would be born in. He, this is what the Holy Spirit says. He timed your birth on the earth. That's what the father does. He knows when he needs you here. He knows what your gift will be that he puts in you. He knows what will be happening. So he needs you for specific things on the earth. That's why he sends you in a certain time. Like, all of my family, he handpicked each one of us separately for us to be a family. So he knew we, while we lived in him, would be a family. He knew my, he knew who my husband was. Now the father even told me, okay, I wasn't necessarily looking to get married at the time. The father said, I chose him. I chose him for you before the earth was made. So you need to marry him. No, he doesn't say that to everybody. I've heard other people say that they knew that God picked him. But the father, because of what I'm doing, had to pick somebody as my husband who would not mind me spending a lot of time traveling and speaking, or even live living the very different kind of life. You know, some people wouldn't like it or wouldn't want me to do it. And so he picked somebody who wouldn't mind it all. And that's why he handpicked him. And so he chose, he chooses who's supposed to be in a family. Now he doesn't cause things to happen to you. There's a devil on this earth. And anytime the devil can kill, steal, and destroy, he's going to try to do it. He's afraid. Every time somebody's born, it threatens him. Because that one might be somebody powerful in the kingdom that would crush him, push it back, and expose stuff. So that's why he doesn't want us here. And Satan knows where we came from. He knows that we are God's children. He's not. He was made, like formed, like, you know, I was something. He was, he didn't exist inside of the father. Just us, just us who are humans. We did exist in him. And there's still more there. And they're still coming. They're still coming. So if you love God and you're serving God with all your heart, is it possible for you to ever miss your destiny and God or live out the books that have been written about you? I think it would, unless you totally decided you didn't want to. I think unless you said, if you ever said, I don't want to do it. And sometimes he might need you anyway. And he has this way of getting you to change your mind without forcing you. He just does. So sometimes you're very important. Everyone's important. He made me reword that everyone is important to God. And he loves us all the same. And we are his children. It's like, if you had children, you'd love them all. They would be different. And they might want to do different things, say different things. They may respond differently to a lot of different things. That doesn't mean you don't want them. And so even sometimes when children don't listen, and they pay consequences, doesn't mean you don't. Sometimes. It does not mean that you don't still love them. So the father's just like that. He really loves us very much. But that is where you came from. If you ever wonder, you didn't appear somewhere in time on some other planet and found your way here. No, people come up with all kinds of excuses. No, I was from another world that nobody knows about. No, there is nothing like that. There is heaven. There's God, Father, Son, the Holy Spirit. That's the divine. That's the Godhead. And there's heaven. And there's Satan and his minions. They live in hell. Well, they're supposed to live in hell. So there's always battle going on up for us, you know, to try to pull us into whatever, especially on the enemy side. The enemy never asks permission, by the way. The father always asks if you're going to do something for him. He will ask you, Satan never does that. We're going to get away with stealing, hurting, you know, that's Satan doing that. Okay, that's not the father. And so I wish everybody could know the father and Jesus introduced me personally to the father and he loved his father so much. He talked to them all the time when he was on this earth and how much he loved him. And even when he was here on the earth, he would go away to the mountain to spend time with him because this mountain that was in Israel. And so except the three days that he couldn't. That was when he was down in hell. And he had, Jesus had an assignment to, when he was, when he went to hell, he was actually released himself, his body, his spirit from his body on the cross. He descended into paradise, which was Abraham's bosom. That's what God put people who believed in him. They didn't let me know the Messiah. Jesus had not come yet. And so he counted them righteous because they believed in him as, you know, as God. And let me tell you, I will tell you this. I've been to that place. I've been to paradise. There's no one in it right now. It's been empty. They all were taken out by Jesus Christ, golden buildings, people. It has a river. And I'm talking about a spiritual abode in the middle of the earth. Below that and off to the side is where hell is, the great gulf between paradise. It calls it paradise in the Bible too. When Christ was on the cross, talking to the thief who accepted Christ. And he said, today you will be with me in paradise. He said that to the thief. And he was. So Christ died first. The thief was still on the cross. And Christ descended down into paradise. And he's got to see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, King, David, everybody who had, who had, you know, followed God for who he was. And I'm sure that even his father, the one who raised him, you know, he was there. And also several other people that had known Jesus. When, when he was walking on the earth and they died, they were taken there if they were found faithful to believe in God. And he actually preached the gospel to all of them. It was really an amazing. But the place he put them in, God counted these as his friends. They had feasts. They had tables set with feast. And people were eating. And they were laughing. And they were all talking, of course, this is when Christ descended down there. But it was a beautiful place. I didn't expect it to be that beautiful. They had an atmosphere. They had a sky. These are all spiritual places which shows you, yes, heaven is a real literal place, although it's a spiritual realm. And people eat in heaven. They enjoy all kinds of activities in heaven. So if you're in your spirit, man, and you're in that spiritual place is much like you being in this physical earth in your physical body. Did the Lord take Enoch and Elijah? Did he take them to paradise in their bodies? Or did he take them with him to heaven? He, they were in heaven. They were going to humans that were in heaven because the father caught up Enoch first. You know why? Because Enoch had such a great relationship. I mean, really relationship. I mean, he wanted to know them. He would talk to them all the time. Live the righteous life and love people. I mean, he only lived to be, I think, 300 and something. Back in those days, you could live to be almost a thousand years old. Back in the days when Enoch was on the earth. But they couldn't bear to be without him. They loved him so much. They just took him. They took him to heaven and he's been there ever since. And of course, Elijah also, all the powerful things he did. And you know, even when he had to deal with the prophets of Baal and all that stuff like that, he wanted to go. No, Elijah wanted to go to heaven. So God sent the chariot for Elijah. And Elijah got in this chariot and that he had told. I know when he is spoken to people and said, I'm going to be going. I'm going to heaven. You know, I want to go there. And but God actually sent this for him. So Elisha, who is his like, I guess he was mentored by Elijah. Elijah told him, if you see me go, if you're around when he's when I go up and you see me, I'll throw my mantle down to you. So Elisha just followed him everywhere. He was not going to miss that. Of course, that was God's plan for him to step into that place. And he did. He was there. So he, Elijah threw his mantle down and Elisha caught it and struck the ground with it and said he was served the God, the God of heaven and earth. I got Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and he now would be that prophet that he had to double. He did double miracles. He did double everything. And when he died, when Elisha died, and he just went up in the mountains and died. And then years later, they threw somebody who had died over this mountain. And when they fell on the bones of Elisha, that person came back to life. He carried the noting that you carry stays with the body. It doesn't need to go to heaven. It stays with the body. And so that's why it's very powerful for people who are anointed to lay hands on you. But even this is a wild thing. Even if they're cremated, whether you're buried or cremated, that anointing you carried stays with your body. And when I got to visit Israel the first time, we were allowed to go into where King David's is sepulchre where his big tomb was. And because they were the Jews and they had curtains dividing it like the men got to go to one half of this place and the women went together. Before I even reached the tomb where he was in, I felt the anointing leaving that thing. I could feel David's anointing leaving. And I heard songs he had sung. I don't think I've ever told anybody this. I heard songs he had sung. Whatever he was wearing, when they actually buried his body, but it was wearing and he's, if he had sung in those garments, the garments would carry those songs. So I heard him singing. He wasn't alive, but that was anointing he carried. But the anointing he operated on was coming from where his body was in the tomb, even though he was dead. Wow, that's incredible, Kat. I know I've heard your testimonies from when you go to Israel and you still see the angels standing beside the tomb. Is that right? That is absolutely right. The same two angels that it talks about in the Bible. Those two angels are there. They guard the tomb because it is a holy place. It's where Christ's body was laid. It's where he was resurrected from. And a lot of people go in there and they feel, this is wild, they feel a presence so strong. And those two angels carry anointing that was given to them by Christ. And then they were anointed to guard and protect not just Christ when his body was in that tomb, but the tomb itself. So I would encourage you to go to Israel. Don't miss going to the tomb and just know that those two angels are still there. When we talk about Enoch and we, okay, I want to ask you this question because I'm curious your take on it, but you know how there's two witnesses and revelation that come and then they get killed and they get raised three days later? Yes. Do you know who they are? Do I know? I don't know who they are. I know it's Helens who lived on the earth and they will live on the, I'm not saying they're here now, but they will literally be living on the earth when that whole thing happens, when the perilous times come and then the three short years that it will be in the perilous times and the tribulation three years long. Those are two people. I would think probably they might be prophets because they said things that's so annoyed and enraged the Antichrist. I mean, they enraged him by, they probably declared things about God, probably did talk about Christ sitting on the throne in Jerusalem while he's trying to take over. And so yeah, they, they, they were martyred and they left their bodies laying in the street. They didn't even bury them. They just left them so, so Antichrist could say, look, I killed them. I killed them and he was probably laughing until God raised him from the dead. That's going to be incredible. I don't think that'll be an amazing, people need to think about the amazing, supernatural events that will actually happen on this earth. And that is one of them. I know my brother wants to be one of them. I've heard a lot of talk. This could be one of the two living witnesses. Yeah, I've heard people say it's Moses. It's Elijah. It's Enoch. It's Elijah. Moses and Enoch. So I was just curious. I do not think it's any of them at all. I don't think so. Okay. Okay. Number one, people, they already are immortal. Abraham, Jacob, they're immortal because they have gone to heaven. They couldn't come back and die. Okay. They couldn't come back here and then die. That's not even possible. It's not even possible. So it isn't them. It'll be somebody who lives in that time when all that's happening and they will be known that they hear God, that they love God and they speak about him. So it can't be somebody who nobody knows. Okay. These two people probably have, they're probably really tough, tough, strong willed and everything because they had to be on the earth when it was really, really bad. This is not bad. I know it's not, you don't like it. I know it's, nobody wants it, but it's not anything like it will be in the pair of the sun, which is well, well, I'd probably say close to 200 years or more away because there's still too many things we have to do. But yeah, those witnesses, they're car witnesses because everybody's hearing them. They're probably on television. I know they are annoyed and probably insulted the Antichrist because he couldn't wait to get rid of them. So when he killed them and they stayed dead, he should have learned from Jesus Christ. All right, evil? He thought he hadn't even gone to and he shows up at the gates of hell on the third day. This is not going, I'm going in a different time zone. So you understand, I'm not in the girl's time zone way back when, when Christ died was crucified in the cross and his spirit man went down into paradise. He preached the gospel. He ate with them. The things showed up because remember he Christ told him he'd be there and celebrated with them. And then when he knew the time came, you have to understand the way that God designed, um, paradise and then hell or Haiti sometimes is called. This was a place of delight and God's presence. Uh, uh, was paradise. And then hell was total opposite. It would be a boat of Satan that he ruled there and a lot of demons ruled there. And that's where torment was. Well, nobody could cross over from where there was a great golf. I'm in a great distance. You couldn't just decide, I'm going to go to hell. You wouldn't want to anyway, if you were in paradise and yet Christ did go there and he was the only one who ever went there like that and you went or showed up at the gates of hell, then that whole scenario happened where Satan's thinking, I got him now. I know he didn't. He got a lot. He got a lot of fire and light and that's what he got. And on the third day when Christ stood up and melted the faces of the principalities and powers that were called him from all over the earth, principalities and powers are evil, wicked spirits that sit on wicked thrones around the world. And Satan called them in. He wanted them, their leader, to wanted them to see him torture the Son of God. Well, it didn't turn out that way. He wiped up hell, put up part of it, melted the faces of the hierarchy of hell, stripped Satan of all his royal guard, all the gemstones he was wearing and took away the keys of hell and the grave, beating him up and left him in the dust of hell. Pretty much that's what he did. He wasted it. That's what he did. And in the Bible, it says that Christ, that Christ spoiled, this is why he's in hell, spoiled principalities and powers making a show of it openly. Yes. You know why it was openly because those in paradise hadn't left yet that he had gotten born again, but they were watching because you could see the down into the courtyard of hell, you could see from where they were up there yelling and cheering on Jesus Christ. Satan says tearing them up, people, he's tearing them up. And so what a wonderful experience. That is a powerful, powerful thing. And I know that paradise and hell aren't on the earth, but they were still part of earth. So that whole thing took place within the realms of the spirit realm in the earth. So that was an exciting day for everybody in heaven. I can tell you, they were cheering too. And then he comes, explodes out of that grave, picks his body up in the tomb, goes into the tomb. There's those two angels waiting right there, comes up, fill a bowl of light and glory because he had just reached hell and gets back right into his body. And of course, he's an amazing thing. The stone is easily blown away, rolled away, whatever you want to call it. And then he goes outside and steps into the garden. That's why it's called the garden tube, steps into the garden because he loves flowers. And that's where he was when Mary came and she thought he was the gardener. Nobody knows why she said that, but that's why, because I was taken back and I saw that whole thing happen. So she came in to bring anointings, you know, she was going to anoint the body again or herbs and put it on the cloth that was wrapped around him. And he wasn't there. Wow. He was not there. Okay. And so they, she left to come outside and there was the gardener, she thought. And the only reason she said that was because he was in the gardens, not on the sidewalk, looking not on the path, he was in the middle of all the flowers. And then when he turned around, she knew exactly who he was. Having revelation just makes the word come alive, but make sure you realize that is your king. That, that, that God, Jesus Christ, he's our king. And I'm telling you what, he still rules over everything. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof is his and this whole left group who think they can take it over. I would laugh. You don't get nothing because you don't own it. You didn't make it. You didn't make the people on it. And we belong to Jesus Christ. You're about to see, you see the power of his justice. That's what you're about to see. I'm talking about the left right now. I'm talking about all the wicked evil people who are killing, stealing and destroying thinking that you have one and nobody knows. I tell you somebody who knows Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. Yes. And what about, can Jesus, or does Jesus still come? Like, you know, how he appeared on the road to Emmaus with the two disciples and they didn't recognize them. And even when he came to Peter, does, does the Lord still come in that way? Like, could he be in a, in our church service or could he be appearing as someone where we're not recognizing his form? Does he still do that? He does that because I've personally seen him. I'm seeing. I'm not sure. I've seen him too many times, you tell you. I've seen him a lot. He comes into my home and talks to me, no matter where I'm outside somewhere, he'll come and talk to me. Does he come, does he come as his, his, his form or done? Okay. No, when I see him, it's him. I've seen him in heaven. I've seen him on the earth. No, it's him and his physical body that he's been glorified. He is glorified, but you can see the, you can see the, the, this is where the, the nail scars are. They're not here. They're not in the palm of his hand because that weight of his body hanging on the cross, it would have, it would have ripped. It would have ripped right through this. So literally, it's right here. These two joints in your wrist, it was, he was nailed there and you can put your whole finger in it. I mean, you can see them and if the wind blows when he's here and it moves his hair, you can see all the holes in the, the wounds of where the holes were in his head. When they put that crown of thorns on him, you can see that. So in his feet, the same thing you can, he's still kind of wear sandals most of the time. I was going to ask, does he come barefoot? But now people need to understand before he came to the earth, he dressed differently. He looked differently. Yeah. When he was called the word, the word was with God and was God and there was nothing that was not made by him. It said he became flesh. He had flesh put on him. The word agreed to have flesh because he had to be born from the womb of a woman. So he had the right to choose whether sin or not sin. He actually had that right to choose that. He had to be down here to live just like us, but he never sinned even walking as he was still God, but he was walking and living in a human body. And so Satan didn't recognize him. He did not know he was the Son of God. He remembers what he looked like as the word because when Jesus got the body, the physical body, it changed. It changed his spirit and he still has that body. He's about six foot tall, something he's very muscular because he lifted trees down here. He's a master carpenter and he he worked all the time. So he was, I wouldn't say he wasn't up gloriously beautiful face like some handsome man, but he had a real strong features and everybody loves him. It doesn't really matter, but I just sometimes people want to know he had to walk this earth just like us. He experienced temptation in every way like we do, but he never sinned. Therefore, of course, living and walking as us, he already was righteous because he was the Son of God, but the fact that he chose not to sin in his human body, that really he really was righteous in hell. And he knew this when he descended into hell from Abraham's bosom. He himself knew the Father had already told him on the third day, I will raise you up. This is what's going to happen. I will not have contact with you during those three days. This was all on his own. He had to be there to make the choices and and he he did know that his father would raise him up again, but he didn't talk to him again from the time he was on the cross before he died and the father did not look upon him. He had to be there. This could be something where the father was empowering him with extra grace and mercy. He literally had to experience the suffering and torment and the crucifixion. He had to say yes, because what he took to the cross wasn't just his body. Right before that, when the soldiers came to get him, he was in the Garden Garden of Gethsemane, which I have been in. And I knew exactly where he had been, where he knelt, where he prayed, because there's so much glory in that very spot where he did that. And the angels came and tended to him the same two angels when they were sent from heaven to comfort him and minister to him. That was just, I don't know if it was a reward the father gave him for something or whatever, but why they were chosen, but they were there. They, when they came, brought the cup and everybody should know Jesus Christ had to drink a cup, not made, well the cup was made on the earth. That was a cup that was a gift he took to his father in the mountains one time. One of his first good projects, Jesus Christ actually made the coffee drink from. And the father put all that stuff in it because that stuff, every evil wicked thing, no matter every evil thing, every disease had to go in that cup because he bore that on the cross. That's why he has power over all of it. That's why he has a right. And the only one he can forgive sins because he carried all of that sin in him when he drank it in the garden. So he died in the garden when he said, Father, if it's possible, let this cup pass from me. Because he was righteous, right? But he had to drink this and carry it. It was the spiritual stuff in the cup, but it was a real literal physical cup he drank. And so those two angels brought that cup from heaven filled with that stuff. And they had to give it to him as a garden. I can imagine how hard that would have been. And then they had to witness, they were there as witnesses that he drank it. So then all of that was in him. It didn't make him evil. He was the carrier destroyed that stuff, the power of it. So that's why he went to the cross. It was crucified. All of that stuff was crucified and therefore gave him the right to forgive sin. And so that's why he is the only one who can forgive because he bore it. He chose to. And so can you imagine making a gift for your father? And then it comes back to you with all this. But that's what those angels did. So their reward was to remain here on the earth by the tomb. Get to see all the people just worshiping Jesus Christ, thanking him and everything. But that is their position right now. They are still there outside that tomb. And so that's that for what a reason he chose them to do that. That's what they did. I know there's a question on here if I can find it. It's okay. Lynn asked, have you been shown what actually happened on the day of Christ's crucifixion and how there was darkness for three hours? The time span is too long for a normal eclipse. Yeah. I have seen glimpses of the crucifixion as well as it sounds. I don't see a lot of violence. I'm not showing a lot of violence on purpose because I'm here. I carry hope and joy and celebration and revelation. And so he doesn't really want me to have to. It's not like I experienced it. I saw him on the cross. And I do know I heard him say the things to John that he said in the Bible. I actually did see that. So he's taken me. It's not that I'm better than anyone else, but I have a photographic memory and this is my assignment. And I've always been, I know that I've always was supposed to have this assignment. God told me. And so because if I'm going to reveal heaven, the fathers of the Holy Spirit, their operations and their actions and stuff that happened in the spirit realm, they would have to take me to these places to bring truth about them. And so I did see glimpses. I got to see Mary crying over him. I got to see him tell John, behold your mother and to her, behold your son, because Jesus Christ had to die not as the son of Mary, but the savior of Mary. He had to die on that cross. That's why he gave his mother and the care of his mother to John. And that's what he was doing at that moment at the cross. I did get to see that. I got to see, I saw him when he lost his spirit man from his body. He descended into Abrahamism. I saw that. I was taken to Abrahamism. So when I'm showing things, it's not a vision. It is in that time I've taken to that time and actually happened. I'm pretty certain at this point that we will write a revelation Bible and it will have all the revelations. He's given me wherever in those scriptures he's given me. It will be in the not in place of the scripture, but it will probably be down at the bottom and explain what happened in the spirit of things happen. But he had to do that in order for me to understand things and know. That wasn't a pleasant time to be there at the cross. People were really just heartbroken. Some of them had fear in them. And then of course, the powerful thing that began to happen. Darkness came on the earth. The veil was rent in the temple. In the Holy of Holies, it was rent. It was rent. But I think, I don't know if it was rent. I think it was rent. I don't know if it was from the top down or from the bottom up. I don't remember what it was, but it was rent saying. What that was saying was now man, righteous man now had the right to step into that place because we had to build streets to receive Christ as our savior. And that, that made us, that means we were just, okay, we were righteous. We were not unrighteous anymore if we received Christ. So there's reasons why all those things happened. The earthquake came over 500 dead were walking around alive in the city. That's the most, that's amazing to me. Yeah, because he had died. He, it was finished. Now that part when he said, it is finished when Christ said that he was talking about your salvation, the way of salvation. That was done. It was already handled. You just have to repent and receive him. So that was what he did the cross for, but he really wasn't done with being here on the earth. He didn't just go home to heaven when he died on the cross. He had something else to do. He had to take back our authority and dominion that, that Adam had given away to Satan because he chose Satan's words and chose to operate under Satan, the things he did and not God. What he was doing was giving away his rights to Satan to have dominion. Christ had to win that back. It had to be a just righteous man. They had to go into hell and take that back for us because hell cannot keep a righteous person and they had to know that. So when Jesus showed up and on the third day, he wasted them and he walked out of there having taken the things away from Satan that no longer he had the right to have. So then it was quite a powerful time. All of those encounters were very powerful times. So someone else asked on here, if I could, they asked about visions because you were just talking about how you were actually, how you were actually taken there, that it was not just a vision that you, so they were asking the difference between, if I could find it, the difference between how do you know if it's a vision or if you're really taken there? I think most people know that they're really taken there because everything in that place is alive. It's active. In a vision, it's like you're watching a movie. You know if you're in a place or if you're watching something on TV, you just know it. You know, there's a huge difference. You're smelling the air. You're tasting stuff. You're hearing things right there and you're standing there next to some of the people who are doing it. So it's not, a vision is different. A vision is different. You sometimes see things a little bit far off. Sometimes even if you see a vision and it's close, it's still not the same as standing next to the people where this encounter is happening with. So I know, I mean, I know what a vision is. I used to have visions. I don't have dreams either. I never dream. So don't ask me to interpret your dream. I wasn't there. So I can't help you with that. There are dream interpreters that do do that for God, but I'm a revelator. That means I reveal things. I reveal truth. I reveal things about places, about the Word, about heaven, about hell, about time. And so that's what my, that's what my assignment is. So you, you know that, you know, you, once you experience, through experience, you know, there's a complete difference between actually being taken and just maybe a movie screen opening up before your eyes and seeing a vision. Total difference. Total difference because a long time ago when I used to have a vision, I know that it's like I'd be sitting somewhere and then like everything would disappear and I would be watching, but I knew I was watching. I knew I wasn't in that. I wasn't in the scene. I wasn't with the people that were in that, in that thing. So an encounter is totally different than a dream or a vision. You'll, you are literally physically encountering something. And it's like, you know, you're there. Like I knew when I was taken back in time and I was taken to right at the time when Christ was resurrected. I was in the garden. I know which, which there's two different tombs. I say there is just the one that's inside this little pretty, like, I don't know what it is, like a temple or something like that. And they have beautiful tiles in the floor and everything. And they say that's the place where he died, but it wasn't. It's the one outside. It's Golgotha. It does look like a skull. The mountain thing that he's in is gardens are everywhere. So that is the right one. The one that's outside is the one that Christ actually was in, the tomb he was in. And so, uh, yeah, I knew I was, I knew I was there because I could touch the ground. I knew my feet were touching the ground. You know, if you're walking something or you're walking on the ground, there's a big difference. If you pick up stuff in the counter, if you hold things in that encounter, so there is a big difference. Yeah. That's, that explains it really good cat. Um, David, he's 10 years old. He asked what language did God speak when he created the world or the earth? Now, when I heard him speak, I heard him speaking in English. It may, it didn't have to be that, but in order for me to be able to share with people, since I don't speak Hebrew and I don't speak Greek and I don't speak, you know, other languages that were around on the earth at that time, I speak English. Now, if he wants to tell me what they said, sometimes he may do that, especially with angels talking. Angels have their own language. They can also speak any language on the earth. Angels can, but sometimes they have their own language also. I don't always understand what they're saying, but then they may, they may turn to me and say what, what it was just said. But I heard God say what he, what he was going to create and what they actually used to do when Christ's name was the word, it was the father, the word in Holy Spirit. That's what the Trinity was. And, but they still were, you know, they didn't, they didn't become somebody different, even though Christ had flesh put on him and his features changed, changed. That's why Satan was questioning him. By the way, let's go back to that scene. When he was tempted in the wilderness by Satan, he wanted to find out if he was a son of God, but he didn't know for sure he was. And Satan at that time didn't tell him who he was. He just used the word of God to make him leave. When he said, if you, you know, if you, he was asking Christ to do these different things to see if he was Jesus Christ and he didn't, he wouldn't do any of them. He gave him an answer of the scripture. He wasn't going to turn stones into food. He wasn't going to jump off the cliff. He wanted to jump off the cliff and prove that he was a son of God and Satan said, I'll give you all these, he was showing him all the kings and everything and wealth, which he always lies with and Christ wasn't fooled at all. So until Christ said he was the son of the living God. And then that was repeated by his disciples. He did not know that he was the son of God until that. So in the temptation part, he didn't find out because he didn't look the same. When, when Satan was Lucifer lived in heaven, Jesus didn't look like Jesus Christ. He was the word. He was a spiritual being, a spiritual body. He had all of his arms and legs and everything, but his very features changed when he had flesh put on him. They didn't take, they didn't take the appearance of the word. That's his name. They didn't take those features and put them on. He had to be born to the womb of a woman. And so that's when, then when he had that his body, then that body developed its own image, which he still has that body now. So that's one way that Satan didn't have a clue who he was because he knew what he looked like when he was in heaven. Wow. Can we, can we do a couple more questions? We're at an hour. The time goes by just so fast. Okay. Edmund is 13 and he wants to know, can you change your age in heaven or will I always look and behave a certain age of maturity? Nobody looks old in heaven. So let me just say that. If you die, go to heaven. You look like you're in your 20s. Your spiritual body looks like it's in its 20s. There is no age in heaven because there is no time in heaven. Nothing decays. I think it's old just so that you understand that. So no matter what age you were on the earth, normally when you die and go to heaven, unless you're young, because if you were young, when you passed away, you would still be that young in heaven. And you would actually stay that young until I think probably until the dead in Christ are raised. And when your mother passes away, when she's ready to Jesus to take her, she will finish raising you in heaven. So if you're young, when you die, you look young in heaven. But if you're older, when you die, you look young in heaven. Everybody's young. And so that, that I can, I can just tell you that. And I think, yes, I have seen people, a lot of people want to be like a child. And there is a place you go to. It's a fun place in heaven where you can be younger. Let's say you died and you were 90, but you want to be like, and you normally look like you're in your 20s, but what if you want to be five again? This place, when you go to, when you step into the boundaries of the place, she would, let's say, it's a woman she wanted to be five, you would be five while you were in there. But when you came back out of that place, because it's like sort of like an amusement park, you can be five, play like a five-year-old lap. You still know who you are. Sometimes friends go together and do that. And it's a lot of fun. I haven't done that. But when I go to heaven, I look eight, just so you know that. So. Oh, wow. Oh, almost every time I'm taken, when I get there and eight, they want me to understand this is why he's going to speak to me like what he would say, explain revelation to an eight-year-old. That's why all the revelations are simple. None of them are, none of them are so, you know, brainiac that you couldn't understand what I was saying. If some wise person who is studying university for 30 years explains something, you'd be wondering, well, what the stuff is so detailed, I can't understand it. He wanted people to understand like a child. So that's why he makes me eight. And I look eight when I'm there. I remember I was, I was interviewing Kim, Kim Robinson, and she said that she was, she would see the, the people hold hands like the father and the daughter. And the daughter would, she said, would, before they entered this, like circus tent would go down to like five or eight years old. And so it's like you're saying, there's places you can go or yes, it was probably a amusement park, probably. Yeah. She talked about the circus and how you can go with your parents and you can actually be like a little kid again. Yes. So that's really cool. Okay. That part is, that part, you can, you can do that. Yes. That's amazing. God is so wonderful in all his ways and so creative and beyond what we can think or imagine, right? Right. So Annette asks, what happens when people with special needs die? Is there anything special for them based on their disabilities? Yes, you don't have them anymore. Praise God. Amen. There are no blind people, crippled people, sick people, handicapped people. They don't, they're not there. You are made whole. If you're sick and you're in the hospital, you're not doing well. I don't know, maybe you lost a limb or something. The day you pass away and your spirit man stepped out of this physical body, no matter what infirmities or handicaps that had, you have none and there are none in heaven. So nobody has to have crutches or wheelchairs or none of that exists in heaven. Do you know what, Jen? I said no down syndrome, no autism. No down syndrome, no autism, no, none of it, none of it. Your brain is perfect. Your physical, mental, emotional is made perfect. Wow. That's awesome. That's, that's a great answer for you, Annette. Jesse asks, how does the sea of forgetfulness work? I just know that that's where the father puts all the sins that he forgives. You know, whenever you repent of sins, he takes those and they're put, it's not on, it's not in heaven. It's outside of heaven. And I haven't seen it itself, but I know that's what they do. It's sent there and the father, when he sends it, is never remembered because he's the judge. He also is a judge in heaven and judges things in heaven. And Christ also is involved in this whole thing when somebody repents to Christ for all their sins. Those sins are taken to the father, so he has evidence that they repented. That's why they do it. Then the father sends them to the sea of forgetfulness and he doesn't remember them. You can't even bring up these sins. He'd be thinking, why are you doing that? I don't even know that. I don't even know what that is. I don't remember that. And he did, he did it on purpose, so it wouldn't dwell in his soul. So if you have repented of your sins, don't talk about them anymore. Don't tell people, you know, if you have a, you're having a meeting in a church and you want to give you a personal testimony, that would be okay. But don't run around telling everybody else, you know, I used to do this. I used to take drugs, use the steal from people. I'm like, don't say that because then you're living in your past. You are a new creation, new meaning. None of that is a part of you anymore. Talk about the new creation you are. You know, I used to say, but no more sins, not a part of my life. I have living a holy because of Jesus Christ. What he did for me, I totally gave all that back to him and it's gone. It's gone. And someone asked on here too, if I could find it, because I read all these questions before, someone asked about your soul, if I could find this, because is it important to, you know, when you repent, you're, is that loosing it from your soul when you're repenting? Or should it, maybe if you're still dwelling on it, should you lose it from your soul? Well, you shouldn't be dwelling on it, but when you repent of your sins, okay, it is automatically the sin which abides in you by the way, until the day you repent of it, it's in you that sin is to lend you. And once you repent of it, it's taken away from you, it's taken out of you. So I would tell people, don't let the enemy try to bring it back. He will try to bring those images back to you, say, no, I've repented. That's not a part of me anymore. I would actually tell people to say that. But no, once you, once you at repentance, you wouldn't necessarily have to lose it from your soul. You just to have, if the devil tries to bring it back, say, no, it's gone. And just say that we hope it's gone. And then he'll just give up. So, but when you've repented of something, it's not something you can dwell on. But I promise you, if you have sin as a believer, you will think about it all the time until, this is after you've repented to Christ. And you're now a believer. You're someone set free from the sin. It's then removed from you. You're clean on the inside. Your soul, your spirit man has nothing in it. None of the sin is in there for you to think about or choose again. You're free. You're free. You've been made free by the blood of Jesus Christ. Don't let anything come back up to you. The enemy is the one trying to do that. So don't believe him. Just tell me he's a liar. You don't do that anymore. But once you've been set free at the time of repentance, usually people don't just lose from their soul. They've already just spoken. You're actually speaking to Christ. He reaches in and takes it out. But anytime after you've been born again and you sin, you do need to repent of it because if you don't, it'll stay in there. And you'll think about it all the time and over and over again, then the same will begin to beat you up. Look at you. You're supposed to be righteous. Now you've sinned. You've lost it. You might as well just throw your life into them. Just give it to me. That's what he'd like to say. So you can't let sin ruin your life. That's why it's important. And the Bible says, since grace abounds, should sin abound, should sin abound. And he says, God forbid, that's the answer when they're asking the disciples, you know, because grace is here and we're saved by grace. Can I go out and sin now because I've been forgiven? And they're asked what they're actually asking. And the answer to them in the Bible is God forbid. Yeah. That means God doesn't want you to do it. Can't you wonder? No, don't go sin. Because then you will be unrighteous. Yes. To the blood of Christ is unrighteous when you sin. And there are people who preach once forgiven, always forgiven. That does not say that in the Bible. Yes. It says, if you, if you have sin, right, so now you're unrighteous, well, Christ forgive you. And he says, yes, Christ will forgive you and cleanse you from all unrighteousness when you repent. That's what the word says. If they've left this in the Bible, that I can let you know for sure that's what the Bible says. No, don't sin. But if you have, go repent to Christ and then he will take it out of you and then you will be righteous. Yes. If you sin as a Christian, yes, you're unrighteous because you sin. If you don't want to be unrighteous, you repent and then the sin is removed. And that is probably one of the most important messages that should be preached in every single church. Yes, I agree. Because you know why if you sin and you don't repent, the devil will get you to do it again. And when he keeps doing this, you'll sin worse and worse and worse because you never repented for the first sin that you did. So the sin out of you is very easy. You just recount and you can get to a place where you actually live holy. I do not sin. I do not sin at all. I choose not to sin. It says, be holy as he is holy, be perfect. If it wasn't possible to live that way, he would have said so. So yes, you can. Don't point at the past. The Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. But did you ever realize what the scripture is actually saying? What sin was that coming short of the glory, meaning because you have sinned, you will not produce glory for God. You can't get the glory and then later impart the glory. The glory is a very extremely important thing. When you sin, it will be taken from you. You can't carry the glory because you have sin in your life. So that scripture that everybody uses to say, everybody's a sinner, that's not what it means. The sin departs in. That's past tense for all have sinned at one time in your life. You sin and you're in short of the glory of God at that point. But when you repent, it removes all of it. And then when you do God, you are creating glory for him because you are righteous. The glory builds in you. You can say to Christ, I give it to you, but he's going to make you wear it. You take it because the Bible says the knowledge and knowing and understanding of what the glory is, it will be demonstrated all over this earth, just like the waters come to see what this earth is to. There's water. Another was what they're saying is you will many times carry that glory to different places and you would release it from yourself. It causes a shockwave of glory penetrating buildings and cities and people and it begins to change their heart and what they think about Christ. So the glory, how do I know that you do that? Christ in you is the hope of glory. The hope that you will prove it, that you will carry it and that you will impart it to change places. That's what Christ, that's what that scripture is, it's revelation. So all this needs to be understood. It's the beginning. You can pursue a greater relationship with Christ. Amen. Every day of your life, not the sin. Amen. And even in John 17, Jesus says, he gives us the same glory that the Father has given him. So that he tells us, I've given them the same glory. That's right. It's amazing. Well, Kat, thank you so much for all, there's so many more questions that are, I mean, I could be on with you for, I could take three hours of your day, but I know you're busy. So thank you so much for being on with us today. And would you pray for everybody before we close? Yes. Father, I pray for all those watching God and those who will watch later that they know you, like your son knows you, that they understand your heart for them, that you do know what's going on in this world, but you have a plan to change it. I thank you, Father, for loving us to bring justice, really powerful justice, not just to America, but to every single country. There are believers all over this world crying out for you to help and to do something about the evil. He's so intense to do that. So Father, right now, I just impart the life of God, the presence of God, the power of God, authority over the enemy. He is your doormat. He is not your king. I release an impartation of the presence of the Lord, the joy of the Lord, His will, His way, that this day you will run after Him and know Him and know that He will come to get you. The day your day is up on this earth, He will come to get you. He will take you home to heaven and walk you up the steps of the throne and your celebration will begin then because in heaven you exist to live. Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Oh, Kat, thank you so much. Wow, it's like waves when you pray. I feel like waves of the glory. Would you share how everyone, I know we have revealingheaven.com on the screen now, but I know you also have another website where people can find your stuff. Yes, it is called Katcur.com. Is it the Katcur? There we have it on the screen. Oh, it's on there. Okay, that's good. Yeah. Facebook page is the Katcur. Okay, no, but this is on the other website. It's just Katcur.com. That is what I call a spiritual platform for the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to say what they want to, whenever they want to, and I post it there. There's videos you can watch of some of the interviews I've had with people. There's, I think there may be testimonies on there, but there's many videos you can watch that teaches you how to pray for your family over certain things, how to declare things for him, how to know more revelation. So it's a really awesome place. There is a gallery on there where I have created images of what it looks like in the spirit realm, places in heaven that you can enjoy and see. So that is what that's about. It is also the only place on the earth you can give to me online is at Katcur.com. And by the way, I need to let people know there is a new fake Facebook page and it's called Prophet Katcur. I don't ever put anything that is not my Facebook page. My Facebook page is the Katcur. And so if it doesn't say the Katcur, then that's not my page. Even though it's got my face on it, people just stole my image. And usually they'll say send money to this group for this and send money. They'll give you a link. And what they're trying to do is rip off your money. So we make a place for you to give online if you want to. As I said, it's called Katcur.com and you can click on the information about the guardian zone, which is what we call, I'm actually wearing a guardian zone, a pin right here today on purpose. This is what people receive when they give to me on a monthly basis or an annual basis, whatever you want to do. And we send out gifts. We already send out our first wave of gifts. We have some more we're going to be sending out. And I'm so grateful to all of you. And you have something for me to show Jen. Oh, one of the things we're doing right now is we are creating a lot of new images to put on, on our, on our, in our store, on Kat, on the rebel, okay. Revealing money.com. Because the last calendar we did was all about two, two events that will happen on this called the fire and the glory. And that calendar is all about baptism and fire, which will happen. And also the glory I just talked to you about beginning to impart the glory and places that you go to this calendar was done for that purpose. So the father has put images. We have an image of the father sitting on a throne, the commissioning throne room, not the main throne room. We have a picture of Christ with fire in his eyes. So we also created an image of the invisible being the third member of the family called the Holy Spirit. So I'm going to show you that image. And it looks like an invisible being coming through a fiery portal. One thing that is always around when Holy Spirit is, is the fire, the fire is like a fire. And he carries that fiery crease portals to go through to come to the earth and other places. So here is that image right here. It may be shiny. I gotta move it over there. So that is the invisible spirit of God. You know, he does have a body. He has a whole real body. It is invisible and having you see the outline of his body, you see the outline of him. And so there's a fiery portal he came through and it says right here, yeah, it says Holy Spirit, invisible and something with fire, filled with fire. But at the bottom of the top says live Holy, because when you live Holy, here's what it says, be dangerous against hell. There you go. Amen. We have these posters available now on our store. They're not, this is on phone court and you can take like Office Max or Office Depot and they can take that poster and put it on phone court. It's a really high quality poster and it is that big that we send it to you. So the father wanted it to be released. So that's what we have. That's new. We also have these cups that are new. Let's say the coffee cups, hot tea, coffee. I put, I get a hot chocolate or a coke in it and I don't drink a lot of coke people just so you know that. We have many new images. I think we also showed this before already. If I can get a hold of this one underneath here, I can show you. I think these all have, this one might not. Here we go. It does. This is shiny, but we thought people would love to see. I talked so much about the portal in heaven where all your family comes to see you and if I can get this, I'll use this one. Where they come to watch your life, declare over you, pray for you and this is it right here and that is actually in heaven. That's where they go. If they want to see what babies are born, when marriages happen, they don't miss it on, miss any of that stuff. They go on your birthday every year to this place in heaven and they lean over a balcony and they actually sing happy birthday to you. So that looks like a really big building cat. It's massive. It's massive. At the bottom of those columns, you see like screens, like the media screen, but the ones on the one side will show you when your family member is going to, it's got born again and on the other side of the room, those screens show you when they're about to come to heaven. That's how people know to meet you at the gate. So this is now, not in the scene or all the angels flying overhead in this place, beautiful angels in there and angels even go to with people and they regard an angel. Sometimes they will go to to stand next to your family members. They declare over you. So they haven't forgotten you. Your family love you probably more in heaven than they ever did on this earth. They're declaring over you. They're praying for you. The angels are heaven is cheering you on in your life in this race we run from Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you, Kat, so much for being with us today. Make sure you guys don't follow any fake accounts and just a general rule for Facebook and Instagram. Don't give money that way. Go to the minister's website or a secure place to give money. And Kat, we love you just, we love you so, so much. We love all your team. Hello to everybody behind the scenes there with you. I know there's a bunch of people there. We love you guys too so much. Make sure that everyone joins us tomorrow. Steve will be here with Mike Thompson. You don't want to miss it. Have an awesome day and we'll see you tomorrow. God bless. Bye. you

Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Good morning from the Pacific Northwest. I'm Steve Schultz, founder along with my wife of both the Elijah List, ElijahList.com and Elijah Streams that you're watching. You see flowers behind me. We are celebrating today the 100th episode of Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So we're going to talk about that in just one second, talk about that a little bit more and then of course Kat's got some great message for today and some questions and answers. So if we have time, so it's going to be a great fun, fun filled day, but welcome to the broadcast a very quick announcement. Let's see. First of all, Cash Patel will be back with us tomorrow. So don't miss that as far as far as profits and Patriots, but we're going to do American Warriors real quick. So let me read this to you. Paul Lesher, Lesher, I hope I'm saying that right, was a young man enraged by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and quickly enlisted in the army. He found himself on the front lines of World War II in Europe, directly fighting some of the biggest battles of the war coming face to face with Germans behind enemy lines. He has some fascinating stories to tell and this is part of it. Go ahead. So we had to be frequently behind enemy lines or you might say ahead of our lines. There was hell and destruction everywhere with Grant, but we were here in the southern area and we were sent back up to the Battle of the Bulge and that's where it was so cold it was colder and it had been in a long, long time. But it's a good thing we were as young and healthy as we were or we wouldn't have made it. Wow, great story. You got to see today's episode of American Warriors and here are the places to look on Rumble where American Warriors 22 where you can just type American Warriors at Rumble on YouTube. It's American Warriors 22 or just type American Warriors on YouTube and you'll be right there. So my brother and I produce these together. It's a great, these are great stories. Many of them give glory to God. And you hear, you know, it's, it's, it's good to honor those who went before us and fought for our freedom. You know, we were attacked on December 7, December 7, 1941. And the world was never the same. So we are in crucial times even now. So this, this is good to remember those who went ahead of us and fought for us. We honor, we honor, I just put his name down, but we honor him. So, all right, well, it's time to bring in. It's time to bring in Kat for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Well, Kat, we're 100 today. That's amazing. Isn't it 100 weeks? We are 100. Yeah. 100 shows, 100 weeks. I see the blue, they added a balloon since I last saw you. Boy, your, your, your balloons there are, are multiplying. I have flowers that were sent, these flowers behind me were sent as a celebration and they pre gave me my cake. We're going to show your cake in a minute. Here's my chocolate cake. Look at this piece. This is one piece. One slice. Wow. I may take a bite, but this is the actual full cake. Happy 100. Yummy. They sent that to me. So they, they gave you a cake. Let's bring your cake in and show it to me while I take a bite. Oh man, this is so good. This is the cake right here. Oh, look at that. What does it say Jen? It says eat cake. And this chocolate also, there you go. One hundredth episode it says. That's so good. You know, they call, they call, there you go. You know, they call white cake, angel food cake, but I think chocolate cake is actually angel food cake. So really? I'm just gonna, I'm determined that. So, Hey, so you've seen Jesus love, love sweets. What kind of cake does he like? All cakes. He loves sweets. He really does love sweets. And I think one of the things, believe it or not, that really changed the way I thought of life in the throne room was the time they took me in there and there were sweets lined up about 50 steps up to the Wow. Are you serious? The summer sitting there, he was eating a piece of cake. People on earth probably would think, Oh no, that would never happen. Yes, it would. It's a family. We're a family up there. And God is our father. He has all these kids that would be coming home, his sons and daughters, and they do plan amazing events. Some of them are fun. That is so good. And in heaven, you don't gain weight. Right now, if I just look at this cake, I gain weight. So, oh my goodness. Well, you know, happy 100th episode, you know, little did we know two, two years ago, just right at, right at the two year anniversary where, or Johnny, some of you have heard me say Johnny and low text to me, he says you're supposed to do 10 days in a row with KatKerrve before the show. So I said, Oh, I did the forest gum thing where I go. Okay, you know, I didn't know. I didn't know if you would say yes, we weren't doing this that we weren't doing daily shows at the time. And so you said yes, and we jumped in and God just breathed on this thing and put his favor and this ministry has exploded. I assume yours has too. Yes, it has. It's just been an amazing ride. So what else tell us something else about this? I think I also mentioned at one time, the father actually have been talking to me since you told me about what Johnny and love said, that you probably need to do more than just the 10 so don't be surprised. Yes, just don't be surprised. Well, I was surprised and here we are 100 weeks later, while just thinks the how much the world and the body of Christ has received revelation about having itself, how they operate. What the Father, Son and Holy Spirit look like what their actions are activities, how they operate heaven, and things to come and revelation on things from the past has filled the heart and the soul of so many probably millions of people by now. All over the world have been changed because you listen to God and Johnny and low and so it was so fun. By the way, in case anyone wonders, I've no only known about this cake just it got delivered about 10 o'clock today. Or maybe 930 somewhere in there. And I thank my staff, Dennis, Julie, all those that were involved in the whole staff. I had talked about doing something on the 100th but I didn't know I was going to get cake and my favorite cake of all angel food cake, which is chocolate cake is my very favorite. Yeah, the whole world and I just found out about just now. Wow. Yeah, because when you found out I use. I said I think there's a cake for you and you go where's my cake. That was hilarious. I love it. So well, God is in a celebratory mood and you did say just before he went on the air, you said they're eating cake in the throne room and I said did you just see that. And you said yeah, they're eating cake everyone in their thousands and thousands and thousands of people can fit into the throne room of God, and they all have cake. Yeah, you know, there was a coming victory which to them you have to understand they've already been there. Yeah, I say the coming victory is the coming victory for us, but they have already been in the victory since they go to the beginning to the end and the end of the beginning. They've already seen it happen people. So yes, yeah, we'll be celebrating and eating cake soon. And when you do I'll be doing it with all of you. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Well, you know, there was a time if you go back seven, eight years ago about the time I met you. I thought I don't know if I wouldn't have known about this cake thing, but you talked about amusement parks and I'm going I don't know I'd like to believe that but I don't know well I have no, you know, in the ensuing days I have in years in this case I have no question whatsoever that God has fun that God eats cake that God has enjoyable times. You've talked about extreme sports and you've even talked about people that love cars will car collect and people have will have their. Can it be said that people have hobbies in heaven would that be a thing. Yeah, I think what they do the most in heaven is what their hobby was on the earth. We all carry a gift in us. When he sends us he already puts in his mind to photographer that's actually I am a photographer that's where I really am that's what he made me. That's where he sent me to earth as a photographer when I go ahead and have a I have my own studio and do supernatural things with photography. I will wait. I will wait. So that's what you do the thing. The most the passion that you have that way. His purpose always was he said your gifts are without repentance, which means he's and you're not he's not going to take him away because that's what you will do in heaven. Whether you sing, whether you teach dance, whether you have rodeos, you know, they have movies in heaven, they capture them, they don't have to produce them to actually capture them. And what you see is live action in heaven. Now you have to have heaven they don't even have to have what do you call the ratings. They're all G rated or fun rated. There's fun rated. There's excitement, intensity, beauty, wonder, splendor in all of the movies made in heaven and even music in them just by signing up in heaven for them. You see a lot of people that was their gift on the earth doing that in heaven. If they receive Jesus Christ as a savior, you will surely use your gift. I have been working in Christmas Town, my brother writing music and playing music in heaven. My dad is running over heaven probably helping God with things. Or it's the M.M. Parks that will be mobile mansion parks. I know what they're doing because that was their passion. You know, you and I are not that different as far as photography when I was part of the photography club in high school, the annual on the annual team. And then I did portrait photography for not a living for a second income. I did weddings and I did portraits, but you know, yours was nature, which I love, but dreams better at that than I am. But I was a portrait guy. I wanted to capture portraits in a way that that would be, you know, very, very complimentary and creative. So, you know, I don't know if I'll do that in heaven or not, but we'll see, I guess. I'm sure you will if you love it that much. Yeah. Yeah, I think, you know, there was sick. There's a family of eight, six kids. And I was the first one to get a camera. You know, back in those days, you had that little brownie or the little thing camera. You write about this big. Yeah, do anything with the lens, but take a picture the way that lens is made. Yeah, stationary. You couldn't do any enhancements on your photography. Yeah. And mostly in the beginning black and white film in the beginning. Yeah. Yeah. And then when color came out, it was so amazing and you'd have either people don't understand who come up today where they even take unlimited photos. You had 24 or 36 exposures. And I remember this, even the smell of that film and it just smells so good, fresh film, you know, and you'd put it in there and you'd take very careful, but you didn't get to see him sometimes for weeks later. I love the way it is now better. But I but you but it's missing the the smell of the film and I of course I'd work in the dark room and I would, you know, you do all the creative things with the with in the dark room that was you know, I still have a it's called s is that camera like the 35 millimeters were the first ones made that had a 35 millimeter lens, which means you got better pictures. If you want to enhance them, you bought different colored lenses and screw them on the front of the camera. Blue, yellow to cause different effects for your camera. That's called SLR cameras, single lens reflex, which means you really put a different until it came up, of course, with the with the camera. Well, they got it. Well, now they call him a DSLR. So it's a digital SLR. Now look at it right after you take it. Yeah, they combine it. When I was at summer camp, you know, I met Doreen the third year I was a summer camp. But the first two years I pioneered the photography program for the campers. So that's awesome. The photography, they would pay to take that class. And we would have them all take their pictures and then I would go in the dark room and develops color slide film. And then on Saturday night, we on Saturday night, we show. Yeah, on the Saturday night, we show the slides with music. It was all different. Oh, I did. I did. It was fun. You know, everyone looked forward to Saturday night where we see the slides for that for that week. It was very, very fun. You know, so. Well, even now, we have, we have so many different cameras and all kinds of attachments and stuff like that. We, when we do a cruise, when we speak on a cruise, we have workshops, one of those workshops is basic photography workshop. Everybody's encouraged to bring your camera user phones. We teach them how to take the best pictures of their crews and how to use light, how to stand people properly. And we love it, except actually using our gifts. So yeah, we still do that. I didn't know you did that on the cruise. Oh, wow. We do. We do. Wow, that's very, very good. Yeah, it was fun fun. I had a deal with Kodak where Kodak sent me their best teaching materials and it was professionally produced. It was fun. Photography was a lot of fun, you know, and so, yeah, it's hard to get that. Oh, I love the smell of photography developing. It was so good. Yeah, it's kind of a, well, you know, it's got, it's got, you know, the developer, the, you see, it's the developer, the fixer, and then there's, there's a third one. And now it's, it's, I'm rusty on it now. There's three chemicals and you put them through that. But you had, you had techniques back then, especially in black and white with dodging and burning. If something was underexposed, you, you'd cover everything else and expose it more during the. I love even just talking about photography, but I don't do as much. I only, the only thing to take pictures of now is teaching people how to do it or I do host, I take pictures of the host. And we also teach a workshop, host ID. And we teach you through the film and the pictures that I've taken, what a real cloud formation is or what activity in the spirit realm is. And then what the host looked like. Which is awesome. Then we go outside and we do it on the cruise ship too. And everybody, the hosts have gathered and they all take pictures. So now Kat is what I understand is people's hobbies and gifts. They are just as much as you and I are, are, are talking about the fun with photographer. They would photography. They would be talking about the same thing in heaven with cars. You said cars. Take into an antique car show, but the cars were not actually old. Nothing ages in the spirit realm. There's no aging. So that was the, they were really awesome looking cars. Some are new designs. Some are very old designs. You know, God can remake anything he wants to. And this person on the earth, that's what they did. That was their gift to create car shows, some old, some futuristic ones. And when they died and went to heaven, he already had a place made for them with his special places to put on shows and stuff with the cars. And I know you all are probably saying, well, what about, what about preaching the gospel? What about soul winning? Number one, there's no soul winning in heaven. Right. While you're there. It's done. You have to understand the five fold ministry is not used much. It was made for the earth. That was set in place so God could have some structure to the five fold ministry and they would understand what that was and what their part in that was. And that was specialized in a certain field. Like they would do revivals. They would do healing ministries. They would do teaching. They would share the word of God and teach it. All kinds of different things with the five fold ministry on the earth. But in heaven, you already have that and you haven't even already got all that. The one thing they do in heaven is you go to the royal university, which teaches you what ruling and reigning with Christ through all of eternity. What they will look like. It'll be caring for some things that they will take us and let us do. So that part is still there. That part of it will be there. But mostly there's no soul winning. Nobody has to get filled with the Holy Spirit. She's right there next to you talking. So you have to think what else is there then? And people have for centuries said, well, we're going to worship. And every church you ever went to would talk about, well, I'll get together. There are crowns in the street. We'll all bow down for all eternity. And I had people who actually thought heaven would be boring. And I went, no, with a God that created that made this search, it's got to be more than that. That was before they started taking me to heaven. And boy, is there a lot more than that. And the father said, I can't leave the fun side out. If I'm your father and you are coming home as sons and daughters, I would have to have places prepared for you to have fun. And he did. So what he did was whatever gift he gave you, whether it could be singing, creating music, it could be baking. That is an art in heaven, baking or food preparation. Restaurants are there because people owned them on the earth, wanted them, always wanted them. They create some different clothing and apparel. I was going to ask you about that. I was going to ask you about that a minute ago. So if someone says, I love to make clothes or I love to fashion clothes, you know, you said that I did, I did a show, which I did every week. So someone that makes clothes would do a fashion show in heaven. That's right. They would make things and then they'd have a show. And then they would give them away because nobody pays for anything in heaven. You use your gift for everybody in heaven, no matter what that is. There's campgrounds in heaven. There's the places to go and the mountain of spices or things to do, you know, in the valley of the falls, there's all kinds of things to do there. And the other places I was shown in heaven, most of them were for having family time because you still spend time with your family in heaven and do things together. You meet new people, have new friends. You're always, always a fellow shipping. Fellow shipping doesn't mean you just sit around a table and eat. It means you're going to different events that are going on in heaven all the time. And there's throne room activity where you get so undone when you worship, you're caught up into the air in the throne room and you get totally undone with the ways and the love of God consuming you. And you were so glad that Christ died on the cross for us. We had an opportunity. We came from heaven. We lived in the Father. He made a way back to him and that's what the Bible says. And that was by his son giving himself to carry all sin, evil and wickedness. Nail it to the cross so you could choose him to forgive your sins and then you would have a way back to heaven. And forever and ever and ever be together with all those you love and those who you only take to heaven people. You can't take things to heaven. You don't need them number one. He's got so much stuff up there for you, but you won't need. But souls you can take. Those you share the gospel with, when to Christ. You know your family members who know Christ. And you're together forever and ever. They may have left you, they have moved to heaven early and you're not there. And I know people really sorrow, but because of releasing Revelation on heaven itself it really has helped with the grief thing. People actually consider the family members doing things all over heaven preparing them for them to come one day and be with them. Even all the little babies, every single little baby that passed. They're all in heaven. And if they're yours, they will be waiting for you when you get there. So good. Now I know we're going to talk about things about Halloween, things in just a moment, but one last question. Is there photography and cars and sewing and shows in heaven because it was on earth first, or is it the other way around? It is the other way around. Everything is says in the Bible, every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of life. That would be God our Father. We were little lights living in him. He timed our birth on the earth. He knew the gift we would carry and would use even on this earth. So you use it because it is there. God did already have it in heaven. Of course, there's nothing defiling, nothing profane, nothing like that exists in heaven. None of the movies have any horror stuff or any of the wicked stuff. None of that's in heaven. But the gift he put in you with it was making the best spaghetti sauce on the earth. That's what you'll do in heaven. That is your gift. That's why there's surf parks. That's why there's all kinds of things to do together with your family. Places to go with the Lord, to be alone with the Lord and say things to him that you always wanted to say. Passionate paradise is about the love of God. It's a place he takes you to honor all the things you've done with your life. There are so many beautiful things to do up there. And places to go. There's adventure. There's excitement. And there's fun. It's part of heaven. It was always there. So good. So good. Paul didn't know what to say when he saw things. He didn't even know how to explain them because they didn't have them on the earth yet. Yeah, I mean, I can imagine him seeing an amusement park or old cars and saying, I've seen things that I'm not even allowed to tell you about. And I always thought, well, this must be something so holy that, but I'm now I'm beginning to wonder if it was just the simple things that there would be no good for such as photography, which didn't exist, you know, and fashion show. Say again. I was in the sky that you fly in the sky and heaven. That would really get him, I'm sure. Oh man, someday I'm going to ask him what all he saw. I want to know that answer. Well, we better jump into what you have for today. But this has been really fun going down. Some of this is memory lane, but I've got my cake here. I may take a bite, but anyway, jump in where you want to go and tell us what's on your heart for today. You know, God made this earth for a purpose. Number one, he wanted us to have a body when we lived in him. We had those spiritual bodies. He wanted to make it possible for us to have a physical body for all the time. So he made a physical. This whole, you know, this whole place out there in space is physical. What we can see, what we can send ships to, you know, space ships to and circle and take pictures. That is called the physical realm. Most of the most of the places are spiritual realm places, spiritual realm places. I stand with the Southern girl right now. Anyway, so he made this physical earth so you could have a physical body. So he came up with a whole plan for a man and a woman to get married, fall in love, get married and have a family. And at the time of conception from the man and the woman. Okay. And they knew each other's husband and wife. Then he would send a little spirit of life from himself. He says in the Bible, I knit you together in your mother's womb. He's not putting your arms and legs on. He's talking about knitting that little spiritual body to that dot of flesh. And your spirit man grows right along on the inside of your physical man. And then one day, whenever that day is, when you pass from this life, when you pass, when you die, that spirit man steps out of your physical body. It looks just like you. Okay. It has all of its thoughts and the memories of his family and all that stuff like that. And that spiritual body, that's what goes to heaven. Your flesh rests on the day the dead and Christ shall rise. That is your body. But it's not your spirit man and your soul that cannot die. It would never be sleeping anywhere. That's why they come to take you to heaven and heaven, which is a spiritual world. You have a spiritual mansion, all the stuff on your property is yours. Yes, you eat, you sit, you enjoy all the stuff God gave to you. Your family, your friends come, you go to other places and enjoy what God made for them. And it says those mansions are made not by human hands. I'm sure the Lord had a lot to do with the building and design of it. And they're great designers. Some is very supernatural. You know, that's what I would call it, very supernatural, even beyond what you call modern. But some is very beautiful and amazing. They know exactly what you want. So they had all that plan and it was going on fine till Satan got his face involved. Decided he was going to take over Earth since he was kicked out of heaven. I'll remind you all that Satan was kicked out on a lightning bolt. I've sure fried part of his brain, which is why some people who are evil can't think very well. You get around those evil people want to be a part of them. Something happens to your brain too. So have nothing to do with wicked evil people. I'm just like, you know, right now. He's going to take over heaven. He was kicked out the day in hell. He thought he would torture the son of God. That didn't go well either. You know, he failed again. He failed. Epic fail. Epic fail. Now people around this world because the wicked and the evil are going to fail miserably along with Satan. This is not the time for them to have their takeover. I'm not even sorry, but it's not time to take over. Although he's trying. He's going to fail miserably. Justice is coming. Holy Spirit is making me say that right now. Okay. So when Satan decided, I'm taking over, you know, remember some of the, the, the walker, the watcher angels were sent to the earth to help educate man. Some of them decided to follow Satan. They became worshiped as gods on the earth to introduce human sacrifice, all kinds of black arts and magic and stuff that came from Satan today in this world. The wicked evil stuff going on is from one being. His name is Satan. Okay. He is only the Lord of the flies who can't beat over the Lord of the host. So I might remind him of that because these days are glory days. And God had told me several years ago, the fire is coming to be baptized. Everybody baptized in the fire of God and also the days of glory, carrying the glory that you created for Christ, releasing it all over this world. The Bible says the knowledge and the knowing and understanding of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea and the waters cover two thirds of the, of this world. So that's a lot of glory being released. And it's entered like a shock wave. It'll pass through you to people in building people run up to get saved when that happens. So God's not willing in case you all wondered if he forgot about us, God has not changed his plans and he will not change his plans. The plans made by the evil one, the Lord of the flies, it's going to fail miserably and everybody who's a part of that will go down the hole with him. There will be like dust not remembered. They'll have no power, no property, no place, no say, nothing. So don't be concerned about what the evil is doing. Why not start talking about what God himself has got planned. Today's of greater glory, the fire of God coming, the money, the money, remember the money thing that's going to come from the wicked. It's going to be given to the just and the righteous, more money than the wicked has ever had. The body will have that you. If you've been faithful and just, and that's what it's laid up for, it is going to happen. It has not happened yet. They're not even doing the great, the world's on the greater work. So there's too many things that we still have to do in this world. He's not done. I've been taking well over 150 years into the future. Now it was a hundred and silver 150 and the tribulation had not come. Okay. Things were the greatest they'd ever been and creativity was so wonderful. People were amazed. Your life got easier and better. Okay. God also in these days coming will erase the great area that says there is no God. So you can, you can throw that in the trash. There is no God. He's about to show up and show up on behalf of all of us. He knows what his plan is. He knows exactly what's happening right now behind the closed doors of the Justin, the righteous. And then real soon what was planned behind those closed doors that they had. They don't believe in God. Anyway, they're about to suck his fire. That's what's going to happen. And then they'll be like dust on this earth because he does have a plan for you and I, and I can't wait to see it happen. I am celebrating what's having doing there celebrating these days coming on the earth. They're not set there scared and afraid of the wicked evil beings on this earth. Not the spiritual or the physical God holds the air they breathe and they better watch out. So good. So good. Now, Kat, I'm going to ask you a question. A lot of people and I think Christians as well. Not myself because I've never wanted to be scared. But a lot of Christians go, man, I just love scary movies. I don't believe in witches and warlocks and ghosts, but I just love in Halloween time going to scary movies and being so scared. It's so fun for me. Talk about that. I think that's a bad plan, people. It's enough to talk about what the wicked evil people the flesh are doing on the earth. But when you start glorifying and seeking out and craving horror movies, that is the enemy working on your soul. Okay. Normally as a believer in Christ who knows him, who's seen his miracles happen, have read his word over and over again, would not want anything to do with horror. Horror comes from hell. And that, that vacation, that's what Satan thinks it is. Halloween. You need to know what the first part of that word mean. Did you ever think about it? Okay. Hollowed ground is holy ground. Well, they can get property or buildings or movies or haunted houses or witches operating. That makes evil hollow. Wow. Halloween is a wicked day created by Satan to get your kids to look at these things. And think they're fun. But all he's doing is tagging them. And I'm telling you, don't take your kids to no haunted house or anything to do with that. They will tag them. What does that mean? Tag them. That means the enemy will put a mark on them that they willingly entered into something that was that wicked and evil is still horror. Horror is not in heaven. It is not in the heart of God. The horror comes from hell. So when you're interested in hell's plans or their ideas, you get a mark. You're going to movie theater to see something like that. You get a mark. They mark you. They sit on these platforms over top of the doors of all these R rated movies or wicked evil movies, satanic movies. And you get urinated on. I'm just going to be honest by the demons sitting over that door. Wait, wait, wait. You went by that really fast. Say that again. What you just said, you get your theater. There are platforms created by Satan. And he positions a demon over the door. You walk into the movie theater to see that movie. And when you go in, you get urinated on. That's their mark. And it leaves a visible mark in the spirit realm and no matter where you go after that, they will, they will, they will look for you. So they pull you into something else and get you deeper and deeper into darkness. They'll get you to go to sales. They get to have your palm read. Whatever, every time you do something like that, you get another mark on you. Satan has a mock graveyard. And if you do that enough times, he puts your name on those great songs. Heaven. What about it's not Halloween and somebody just says, man, I just think it's so fun to watch zombie movies where supposedly these dead people are walking around. It's not, it's not Halloween. I'm just watching zombie movies. What about that? I wouldn't want you anything to represent anything of evil. There is no dead walking around. That is not, that's what Satan would like to do. And if he could pull everybody out of the graveyard, make them wick and let them walk around doing horrible things. He would do that, but he can't. He is not over life itself. So he tries to go after people who are alive to use them. And I can tell you, if you watch enough violent movies, you will be violent as a man think it in his soul. So is he. Okay. That's what you will do. That's what you will follow after. That's what you will look for. So I encourage people don't say, you don't see any of it. Don't participate anywhere. Never go to any place that Satan is represented in any way. Witches are not good. They are all wicked. They're wicked. They even make movies called Satan named wicked. And the one thing that Satan will try to fool people with in the future. I'll just let you know right now is that witchcraft is good. You know, so which is performing miracles and things, but all Satan has to do is take the sickness off people. He put on there and it will appear that those witches healed them. I'm just gotta be honest people. You understand have nothing to do with October 31st except for this. Did you know that was reformation day? It was all saints. It was reformed. And when that when that one of those articles were nailed to the church door for people to have freedom in their life to have the word for themselves. October 31st is reformation day. Yeah. They also call it all saints day. I remember being when that happened and yet Satan stole that day. You know, I had an encounter. It was that profound. So I would call it an encounter. It's not that I saw something. I was in Europe by myself. I shouldn't have been there because I needed an assistant, but I was there and it was October 31. I think I was mildly aware that it was all saints day, which is one of the names they call it. And the bell started tolling and it wasn't very far away. There was a church because they got churches all over year. They started tolling on October 31 and cap the spirit fell all over me on October 31 all saints day. And I knew that I knew this was not Halloween doing this. This was all saints day. And what do you think about that? I was going to say also, you can either call it reformation day or all saints day. Those are both two holy things that represents what God wants us to have and to know about. So Satan, when he looked for this fake holiday he wanted, he decided he always will go after what God has. He always does it. He'll mock things that belong to God images and places and make them evil and say they always belong to him. No, nothing belong to him. Hell doesn't belong to him. That was made for his abode because he was kicked out of heaven. But yet you're right. You're right Steve. That is a day to be hollowed for God. It is not Halloween. I have no participation. I'm even going to have a sign made a really big one that says we don't do demons here. We celebrate all things day. We celebrate revelation. We celebrate the life of God at this place. If anybody comes to our door, they get a little thing that talks about Jesus Christ. Well, it makes me think of the fact that the enemy specifically and purposely perverted October 31 simply because it was meant to be that way. I can even go back. Dren and I found out starting about 88 that God would visit us in a way, not that I'm seeing him in person, but on October 31 he would visit us. And of course we knew it has nothing to do with Halloween. God was giving us encounters and confirmations. It was like a day that he pecked. So anyway. It was his day. It's been his day for a very long time. No one in heaven celebrates Halloween. Nobody does. It's not mentioned. It's not practiced. It belongs to the devil. I would not take your children anywhere to have anything to do with that. They're innocent, but you as a parent are giving permission when you take them. And some people probably mad at me. Well, at least I told you the truth. If I love you, I will tell you the truth. I want to save you from all kinds of harm and things later on in your life. My dad was always right. We wanted to go trick-or-treating ourselves. This is way back in the 50s. Okay. In the 50s people, they didn't have the stuff going on. My dad said, I don't like this. I don't think this is God. Yeah. He let us go for a while because we started seeing some things happen on that day. And we said, no, we're not doing this anymore. We do not practice it. And yes, I do speak against it whenever I get a chance because you need to be aware. Anything that looks like horror, suffering, death, dying, manipulation, control, pure evil. You know, the images as well as the actions. I know people went to some haunted house somewhere last year and people had horrific testimonies on what they saw and what happened there. They left really terrified. Wow. Anything you've ever done that you need to lose those encounters and that stuff in your soul, lose from your soul every time you participated in that or any other day that represents something that Satan is over. Yeah. And let me, I want to come back just for a moment. You talked about, you used the word both tagged and marked. He tags and marks. If you go to a horror film, by that, are you meaning if you go in, first of all, you've given permission for him to tag you or mark you or urinate you. And from that moment on, unless you repent of it, he has permission to, to what? Well, he'll have, well, demons will follow you sometimes and get you pulled into something darker and deeper. Because that was your choice to go. And that's what they do. And God himself actually can't stop that because you have a choice. You have a will. You're old enough, you're old enough to understand this is bad and this is wicked. I still want it. You're, you're yourself are giving permission. You do. Yes. You do need to repent for any time you participated with anything that belonged to the enemy, whether it was things that was said, things that you watched and movies, things that you heard, things that you attended yourself. You need to break all that off of you, especially the witchcraft, break it off of you. And I have news for you. Some of the stuff being, being made and shown in movies for kids has witchcraft attached to it. You need to be careful what your kids are going to see. You're responsible. You are raising a soul. You're raising a human soul for God and for what he has planned for them. But you cannot, you cannot put harm in their way. If you're choosing to take him with something that you know is darkness. It was darkness and evil. That is not for your children. It isn't for anybody. It's the one way that Satan can get, get to you is by you give, you give permission when you go, you give permission when you go that. Yes, I chose that. Yes, I knew it was in it. And I went, if you get there by now, you didn't know, then leave, leave. Don't stay. Yeah. If your friends, your friends, if you, if you're afraid that your friends will be ashamed of you. You don't want to be ashamed of Jesus Christ and his blood. That's what's keeping you. So all these days, so you can tell them, I'm sorry, I don't participate with the devil. That's a nice line to give. That way you're not saying anything against them. You're speaking against the evil. And I'm going to encourage you to do that. The days coming on this earth, people are going to know absolutely what is the darkness and what is it of the light? There's no place to hide in the middle. Pretend like you don't know anything. Yeah. You will see acts, acts that have already happened during these last two years. There are so wicked beyond imagination and we are not putting up with it. No one. Okay. No one voted for the right person who actually won number 45. Yeah. Once any of this, this was not our choice. This government was not our choice. The way they're running it was not our choice. And they're not doing anything good for this country. You are about to see the hand of God move. And I mean move mightily in this, in this country and in this world. And there we no doubt in your heart who won and who didn't win. And we don't need any more evil because God's, this devil is pushing this right on the heels of the entry into these days of glory. And God will let it just go so far and it's ending. It will be an end. This is not our new norm. The fire and the glory and the love of God and creativity, that will be our new norm. So good. So good. Well, Kat, we have questions to ask you today. But I want to make sure you, if there's anything else you want to say or share before we get into questions, let me know. I just know that things are very, very close, especially what I have recently. I don't just so people know. I don't look up other people and listen to them. I don't number one have time. I don't watch videos sent to me by people. I don't listen to broadcast or whatever. I don't have time. I don't care. I pray for these people who are doing the work of God. But I, I'm not going to be accused of hearing something and saying it because someone else said it. If I say it, then God said it. And that's the way it is. He won't let me put certain things in my soul. I can't read books. People have written. I pray for those people. They wrote their book. If it's from God, then I pray that they do well with it. I am only filled with revelation from the father, from the word of God, from what the Holy Spirit takes me and shows me. What from Jesus plans for this earth? That's what I am filled with, which is why I know if something good enemy comes along trying to fool me. Last night, he was trying to tell me to stop breathing. I'm going to die anyway. He was telling you to stop. What? Out of my room and said, get out. You liar, friar. I'm not having nothing of your garbage. I will complete what God has given me. And I will do that 100 day, 100 week broadcast. I'm doing it. I'm going to yell loudly against you to get out double. Wow. Wow. And you said that really fast. He was telling you to stop. What? Breathing. I had had a minor injury to my, my chest bone. Okay. And because I was overactive, I was healing. Well, it was doing okay. Nothing broke or anything. Uh, but I was really overactive the other day. So it was hurting. And, uh, I just kept holding onto it and the devil comes up behind me. I want you sorry thing. Oh, you just need to just stop breathing and give up. You just not going to survive. Wow. And I turned around. I went, you are afraid of me. You're afraid of every believer who has God inside. It doesn't mind sharing it. You're not going to like what I say tomorrow, but I'm going to say it loud and clear. And then I told him, he wasn't going to affect me in any way to get out. He actually ran. He ran through the wall. Wow. Wow. You know, that was what you just said was very, very helpful. Cause there's a whole, uh, there are thousands of people that just said, that was so good to hear. Cause even cat can, can get attacked, but look how she handled it. So you really helped a lot of people with that. Yeah. That's, that's great. That's awesome. How you did that. So super good. So, um, okay. We got 45 coming back one day soon. Anything else? You just mentioned that anything else about 45 before I get any questions. I think, uh, besides him, there's going to be so much activity going on. Uh, you know, I November, if you remember, November the fourth, 2020, that was the first time God spoke that was after the day we said we would, we'd have a meeting. I mean, it shows up to land until that day came. Then we wouldn't have anymore. That was our original plan. And I remember telling you, Steve, God wants to fourth, he has something to say. And, and I called you on the Thursday, something to say. And so I'm not quite sure what it's going to say, but he said it very boldly that justice was going to come when the ground began to shake the, the, the, the amount of fraud exposure would be almost unbelievable. The people, the landslide of fraud exposure is actually what he said will not stop until everyone who's involved in the whole stealing of 2020. Of 2020 election. They will be brought to justice. They will lose their position. They will lose their property. They'll lose their money. They'll lose their voice. And that's what God, the father said the day after the November 3rd, 2020 elections, he already told people they threw them in the river. Uh, they buried them. They burned them. They put fake things. This is, this is right after this probably still happening. Uh, but he said that the very next day on November the fourth, that was his report. He told me he has something to say. And that was what he said. And you go back and see that again or find it somewhere else, but I'm telling you God said that is exactly what I'm going to do. And no one can tell me no. Wow. So good. So good. So good. I'll take a few minutes. Right now there's being papers made out. I can't tell you who's making those papers, but there are people demanding people to, um, leave their positions. So resignation are being written even as I speak. I wouldn't have to tell you who they're for. Cause pretty soon you're going to be C. You're going to see who they're for. But like God said on the fourth of 2020, everyone and everything will be exposed. If you think you've been hiding it really well, you can't hide from God. And you better leave his people alone and not touch his anointed. You may not live very long. I don't mind saying that either. Cause he also said that. So I'm just letting you know, you're about to see the hand of God move. And there are the hearts of heroes in this country, getting together with other people in other countries. And guess what? You don't know who they are. I'm talking to the wicked left right now. You don't know who they are. Staying here everywhere all at the same time. You don't know what's happening. Why don't you check with your leader, the devil and see him cry. Because you're about to lose everything. And so is he. Can't have cake and celebrate right now. Absolutely. Justice is already on the earth waiting to get into action. So you mentioned a minute ago, but let me ask it again. So you, you know, we, we, the classic stories are Ann and IS and Sapphire. Of course they were believers who messed up and they lost their lives. And then there's the unsaved. And then there's probably those in the middle. Have you seen people just suddenly drop dead through this thing? I've never asked you this. So I don't know what you're going to say. Have you seen that? I have in the spirit. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Cause I've already been taken forward to the celebration. And right before that celebration. Well, I saw happening exactly what God said. They were telling on each other. This is the, this is all the, the line left though. So those, it doesn't just have to be the left. There's people even on the other side who are secretly being parts and getting paid off too. You're going to find out who they are too. Okay. Make sure you know who you voted for. Okay. Vote for what is right. What is life. What God would vote for. What would Jesus do people? You know all about that. Yeah. The difference between right and wrong. What's wrong is wrong. And you can't make that right. Yeah. Do it. So yes. I was showing people drop dead. On platforms while they were speaking places and they hauled their bodies off. Wow. Wow. Yeah, I wondered. I've never asked that. I don't think so. Yeah. Very sobering, sobering, sobering. Okay. Are you ready for a few questions? Yes, I'm ready. So illumination works for us. We, does it an amazing, fantastic job. She's asking this. She says, I've heard you talk about. Asking God not to write down the sins of those who have wronged you. Could I ask God not to write down someone's wrong against me that happened. Years ago. So I don't know. You know, there's that time thing. You understand the question. Yes. Yeah. So she happened years ago. Can she still right now choose as God not to. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well, I promise you, he wrote it down back then. I mean, it's written down. I guess you could ask him if, if it works. When you have a prayer like that, illuminate you. You ask God, if it is possible. That's good. This is a pot as if this is possible. You can ask that. And that's how it presented to the father. If this is possible, would you please remove the, the harm. And the, and the, the torment that somebody has. This person has done to me although it was years ago. I want it taken off my record that I held it against them. That would probably work. But this is what God said. Even though I recently have asked God to not write down the harm. I didn't even call it a sin. I said, right now in the harm that someone did against me. It was unjust. God, you know that. But because I have a true forgiveness in my heart. I'm forgiving them for doing it right now. Right after it was done. I forgive them. I'm going to act like they never did it. And also would you please not write it down against them. He didn't write it down. But this is what he said to me. I will not write that down, but I will tell you this. There will be consequences to pay with everybody else against them. Cause they can't say that. I can ask God not to write it down, but everybody is watching that stuff and knows about it. They're angry. They're upset. They don't want relationships with them now. And I'm not even going to say their names because I forgave them, but this is the consequences. He's done in the natural. There are consequences that will happen. Number one, they're still doing it. And number two, that's their choice. They chose to do this. Although God's word says something different. So God himself did not write it down as a wrong. Yeah. Consequences they will face because of what they did. That's up to them. If they stop, if they say, you know, I'm sorry for doing all that stuff. You know, there's that, there's that scripture that says in wrath, remember mercy. Could you say Lord in wrath that this person deserves? I forgiven him. Remember mercy. Here's an example. I know of a person that, you know, not that they would be known out and about, but their son was accidentally killed in an altercation. There was a fight, but he felt the son fell over backwards and hurt himself. And he was in the story. And God said to him, because it was going to, going to go to trial. And God said to him, I won't say his name, but God says, what do you want? And meaning towards the, towards the one who pushed him and he died. Because it was a real fight. And his answer was Lord, I want mercy. Yeah. And so that was a okay prayer to pray then, right? God to show mercy. Well, I don't know what that, the mercy could be many different things Steve. Yeah. The mercy was that it wouldn't be written down in heaven. But on the earth, even the legal consequences of somebody proving that and knowing that they may, that mercy may be, they go lighter on him. But I don't think that that means in the natural, he won't have to pay some kind of a price. I don't know what that price would be. Yeah. But because you're asking that that way, when it happened, when it happened, that probably means that they would get a lighter sentence or maybe let go sooner, sooner. But that would be a big thing that God would have to influence the judges, the jury, all the people involved in the, in the trial and stuff like that. And sometimes he will for certain reasons, but and sometimes most of them, I think they pay some kind of a price for their action. Oh yeah. Okay. That's really helpful. That's going to help a lot of people too. All right. Julie, who does our producing and she helped me get these flowers behind me. Thank you, Julie. Excuse me. She's asking this question. She gave me permission to say her name. So she says, I'm leaving the country next week. I've noticed in the last week, I've seen bright golden orbs or circles in my house. I know these are angels. And what I've noticed is they've gotten bigger than what I've seen them before. Am I being assigned new or bigger angels or hosts? That's a question. I think there's an increase in the authority that she has and the dominion that God has given her because she's been willingly been what he asked of her and has operated really well in forgiving people and seeking up things from God himself. If they've changed in any way, if there's more there, yes, that means that your assignment is about to get something added to it. The fact that they're gold or brighter lights now, that's a whole more authority and dominion thing. That's what that means. Okay. More authority and dominion. Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. So I guess this must have to do with decrees because they're talking about speaking. A few viewers are asking the same question. Is there something or are there things either way we can pray or speak against Halloween displays in neighborhoods or public spaces? Should you speak or decree against those in some way? Yes. We do that ourselves every time we come into our development. There's people that have really horrible displays and yes, I do. I do. In the name of Jesus Christ, that stuff will become like dust. It will be in no one's memory. It will not affect one single person in their spirit or in the flesh at any time whatsoever. And I do nullify any effects and nullify any wicked, evil, sadistic, torture, death, dying, suffering, spirits that have been brought along with that stuff. I evict him from this neighborhood in Jesus name and you will not come back. Good. I do not want to go into the evil spirits attached to these things that people put in front of their houses because they're actually portraying part of health. I mean, it's gotten darker because of the dark people who are trying to run this country. They allow more darkness here because people are standing up and finally becoming filled with God and saying things. They're not having as much of an effect. But if you go by and say nothing, you actually are just allowing them to remain until something comes down. That reminds me of, you know, because I've gone, you know, we're very careful in the movies we go to, but we may be heading down the hall to see a nice family movie passing by some really evil movies. Could you do the same thing about that? Speak against those. I almost make a hobby out of that. If there's anything to see, I actually take authority before I get to the theater people. Before you get there, if you know, like right now, there's almost nothing with seeing. I go by and I wave my hands. I send the anointing that destroys every yoke of darkness, trying to attach people to the evil or the wickedness of the horror. I nullify the effect. I evict those spirits from that place and people will become bored of watching them and they'll have to replace the movie in Jesus name. And you can do that in hotel rooms. You stay in. I'm going to the hotel until I do it. Really? Really? I don't have authority over any darkness. I do. We're of the light. We are here representing God. In Jesus name, I give you power over all the power of the enemy. That really means you have that. So I'm not going into a hotel until I kick everything out into a dry place. I release a life of God to flood every room. I go through and touch the hallway walls and say, I've released an anointing to destroy every yoke of darkness in this place or any attack of the enemy. I just kick the devil out. I release God into that place. That's interesting. It reminds me of this has to be almost probably 15 years ago we were in France and they took us around. I think they were considering a property for the church. It was a some sort of compound almost. There were several buildings and they wanted to know what I was discerning and I was pretty new at that. But I walked around and I said, someone meaning a human being has gone around and peed to mark this territory for the devil. I didn't know now what I know you just said. I just gave him the information. I should have nullified it right there, right? Yes. Do human beings, I mean, any claim or stake that the enemies put out. Yeah. You know, we're here to occupy until Christ comes. Occupy means take authority. That's what that word. Occupy like an army. You occupy. You're over everything that goes on in your area where you live, especially you have a high authority and dominion over the area or the city you live in. You always do. So I will run other drug. It used to be the drug people, all the kind of stuff that will be exposed, brought to justice because this city is becoming a city of light and I will not tolerate darkness in the city of any form whatsoever. I rule with Jesus Christ here. As a king, I make a ruling. You will get out. And you need to do that in any place, you know, that is doing wicked evil things. Don't just walk by some place that's having, you know, nudity shown on stage. Just make sure you take authority over it. That'll become nothing. And guess what? I did that one time and that place is nothing now. Wow. Wow. You have a voice. Use your voice for God. You take authority. Christ says we rule and reign with him now in this earth now. And in the time is to come, we will rule with him. You have rulership. You speak against any of that darkness that has no right to be around you or anywhere that you will not tolerate it. If you're not, if you're not participating with the darkness, you have every right to speak against the darkness and not tolerate it. You know, and one more example, this reminds me of a story. It's a known prophet, not as well known as others, but it's a known prophetess. And she was driving by one of those palm raider tarot card reader places. And she started cursing the place in so many words. I don't know what words she used and God stopped her short. And he said, don't curse the place, curse the money that's keeping it in business. So she said, oh, okay. She was at a stoplight. And so she said, I curse the money that's keeping that in business. And a woman came running out of the place screaming, saying, no. So it had an immediate effect. What do you think about that? I think either it was the person who would be losing the money who ran the place. You know, Satan does give them some sense of what's going on. And sometimes they will hear demons speak to them. I mean, those places really are partnering with demons, even if they don't know what they are and they may start screaming. So if they're screaming other people in there, if they're participating, may not hear that scream, but the person running it will. So it could have been them hearing those spoken. And that's why they ran off with screaming. No, no, I don't want that to happen. But you can't stop a believer who knows what they're doing, taking a story with Jesus Christ, especially with his name. I've never forgotten that because she's sitting inside her car at a stoplight. And she just did that real quick. So that was amazing. All right. Let's see. So Diane asked, she says, I'm wearing an I don't do demon shirt for a Halloween party. And for the 31st, what simple reply would you suggest for those who might ask about the shirt? Now, I don't know if she means Halloween party or harvest party. She's, she's calling it a Halloween party. So I can't, I don't know which kind of secular slash. Some people actually think it's perfectly okay to participate with having candy, having some little refreshments. No, it's not unless God sent you there. If he sent you there to be a witness and share something that might rescue somebody, that's different. You're choosing yourself. I'm going to go to this place and enjoy all the stuff, but I won't participate that it belongs to Satan. You're not doing, you're not doing anything good unless he sent you there. If he did an assignment, but I tell people, if people, this is the thing, it's not a good witness. If people see you there, walk by, they're at this party and they've got images of, of the wicked in the hell and death and dying stuff all over the place. They know what it is and they know that they think you're having a good time. They don't realize you're getting marked by the enemy. So if you go as a believer because you have a good shirt on that says something, don't go there. And unless Jesus Christ tells you, go to the mall and where, go to the mall, where there's not no party going on. And then when people ask you, you can say, I don't participate with hell. I don't approve of anything hell does. I know if I, all of their images, I know if I, all of their actions and Jesus name, because they are not of the light. She should walk around the mall with that or someplace where there's people, but I would not go to something called a Halloween party. Right. And I might as well make a comment about this. A lot of churches, because they don't want kids going to do trick or treating. They will have a harvest or fall fest. I do want to say this. This is the time to celebrate the fall. It is a time to celebrate harvest. I've been to many harvest events and they were fun and people there prayed for everybody else while we were there. They got in hospital. We prayed together against the people who weren't participating in the darkness. Something like that would be perfectly okay. Just don't dress like something of the darkness. Don't go to a church harvest festival, which our church, I don't know if they're having one this year. I don't remember. I asked, I think they're going to do something different. But every year on this day, they would always have powerful big events. They'd have God's music playing amazing music. People would get fellowship. Some people would talk about knowing Christ more. But it was a fun family thing. It had nothing to do that it was part of Halloween. They never called it a Halloween anything. That's the leaders dressed like that. They spoke against that stuff. So that is different. That would be an option you could do in honoring All Saints Day or Reformation Day. I think it would be great if somebody had an All Saints Day event. And then you tell people, but when they did that, people from the neighborhood came, which they wanted to win the Christ. And now no one else would be wearing this, but they would come in dressed as people that look like the darkness. And they looked around and started wearing everything else. And they started asking them, well, what is this? And they would say, we're not celebrating Halloween. We don't participate with celebrating. It's Hell's Day. We bring people with the light and Jesus Christ. So do you want to know about it? And that helped to lead people to Christ. So you can't walk up to someone this year and say, get out of here. You look evil. You never want to come darken your door on your property. So we just want you to know that we love you and care about your family, but we don't dress like that during this time of the year because we don't partner with darkness. So people going to hay rides and corn mazes and all of that. That's just, even if it's on the same day, it's there. It's a substitute because it's a fall. It's not really a substitute. It's a fall. It's not a substitute for Halloween. There are places that have always like 100 years have had fall festivals during this time of the year because it is harvest time in many places. I would go up to Virginia all the time and our grandchildren, our daughter and our son-in-law, they always would do the corn maze fun things. And they would do it on, I don't know if it was church property. I think it was the school property, but everybody who went to the elementary school grown up. The biggest fall festival I've ever seen. There was never any mention of Satan. There was never any of the dressing like for the other thing, the other holiday. That was a fun family day. It was all about fall and harvest time because a lot of the farmers had harvested. And some of them hold them in their barns at the end of the fall season, which would be the end of October. So that's going on. That's a totally different thing. That's a delightful fun harvest thing to do. You know, pick out a pumpkin, you know, make your pumpkin pie. They have pie contest and cake baking contest and jar can stuff contest though. Yeah. It's a fun time for families. So good. Okay. Mary asked, what's the difference between the 90, now we're moving into other guests. What's the difference between the nine gifts of the spirit and the other gifts of the spirit such as charity, generosity, etc. Does every believer get one of the nine? That's a question. I'm sure that you would have one of the nine, but again, that is not your gift. That's totally different. The gifts of the spirit and gifts of how to live your life. That's the others show kindness, give charity and all that stuff. That is identifying you as someone who cares, who loves for God and helping people. I think a lot of people probably has one or two, have one or two of those gifts. But the thing about when you go to heaven, the gift you operate in is not a spiritual gift at all. It's your natural gift you have that you are really good at and people even say you're really good at doing that stuff. Some people go, well, I don't know what it is. You may have more than one. You could have more than one gift and so you probably would operate in both of those in heaven. But most people, you'll find out if you don't even think about it anymore, something you love to do when you were younger, maybe you don't have the opportunity. That doesn't mean what your hobbies are on the earth now would be the hobby or the gift God made you. Every good and perfect gift would be us coming down from the hobby. And on the gifts, there are people who do many, many things because they've got hobbies and many, many things. They're going to be like that in heaven, right? Many, many things that they would do, right? Oh, yeah. There's all kinds of things to participate in heaven and be a part of and joy going and have fun with and exciting things. Yes. There's places of excitement and fun everywhere in heaven. There's also places that are so amazing and so profound. I love that two of the things that are used to describe heaven are wonder and splendor. I would have to say splendor is absolutely things that happen in the throne room and a few other places around heaven that are so filled with splendor. Everybody goes there probably often just to see the demonstrations of the light of God, the fire of God. He makes things even in heaven for us in heaven and gives them out at different places in heaven. So wonder, you're always undone. You are so undone by the goodness and the love of God. What He has blessed you with, what He blesses with everybody in heaven and the fact that He wants to spend time with just you. That is also amazing. That's good. All right. I accidentally skipped this one. Carrie age nine asks this question. My goldfish died a week ago and I can't stop thinking about him. I had him three years and I feel like I failed him, this Carrie saying. My dad tried to help save him and we prayed for him all the time, but he died. I read your book about Chester. Do you think my goldfish will be in my mansion too? Will he forgive me that I failed at making him well and he died? I think Carrie that he doesn't even think about the fact that that he thinks that you didn't take good care of him. I think what he will say to you when you get this, he's so happy you loved him so much and that you missed him. I don't think like past don't even think about the things they went through before their life ended or anything like that. They will remember you. Of course he's going to be in your mansion just like Chester was in Brandon's mansion. Of course, and he will remember you when you get there. But all he'll say is thank you for loving me. Nice. And he will. He will talk. He'll say thank you. All pets talk in heaven. I love it. I love it. I love it. By the way, speaking of animals, Satan is Lord of the Flies. What's the deal with flies and why is Satan the Lord of them? Is that some creature that God didn't choose to make or why are flies going to be in heaven or what's going on with that? I have never seen a fly in heaven. I've seen a lot of other insects never seen a fly. I think because Satan uses them to persecute and he does, I'm quite sure flies are not a good thing for any reason. The only thing they do is they give food to the frogs, the lizards and the snakes. They're feeding people for the reptiles. That's what they are. So I don't know anything further than that is a title given to him that I guess maybe he didn't really have any authority except over that one thing. Yeah, that's an amazing time. He hasn't reached the top of the animal kingdom to try to control. I can almost see, you know, The menial things that don't even really have a soul flies. Yeah, I can almost see. I think he has a big fly swider in hell. It's like, you know, Satan said to Jesus, if you'll do this and this and this and bow down and worship, I'll give you all these things. It's almost as if the Lord said, you know what, you're not Lord of that. You're Lord of the Flies. That's all you're Lord of. So anyway, okay, Chrissy asked this. Is there a difference in your prayer language and in parentheses tongues and the gift of tongues? Are they the same thing? Or are they different? She's talking about the getting filled with the Holy Spirit tongues. People call it many different things. They'll they'll call it, you know, just lay hands. The evidence of receiving Holy Spirit is you speak in tongues. There's a very real reason why that happens. I know this too. When you pray in tongues or speaking tongues, Satan cannot understand you. He does not have the ability to understand tongues. It brings great confusion to him, frustration to him, aggravation to him, because we're praying in a language he has nothing to do with and does not understand. So I think one of the other purposes for having that, of course, you are praying the perfect prayer in the spirit. When you pray in tongues, regardless of what people call it, if you invited Holy Spirit into you, you pray for that gift of tongues. That's the tongues you're talking about has power in them and the enemy cannot understand them. I would advise people it's almost been kind of forgotten or maybe not even forgotten, but just not used in church. But it should be. It's something very powerful in the spirit to pray in the spirit. And you can even say, Father, I'm praying for this person in the spirit. You may not even know if you don't get an interpretation of those tongues. I tell you this, you are praying the perfect prayer for that person, for that situation, and the enemy can't try to do anything about it. He doesn't know what you're saying. So the thing is for tongues, whether it's one or the other, Satan cannot understand those tongues. So it sounds like Chrissie's trying to decide if the terminology, if your prayer language and tongues are the same thing. You're saying it's the same thing, right? In that way, if it is those tongues, but you can pray in the spirit that's not even about tongues. When you pray a prayer in the spirit that is anointed, that God has given you to pray or something you're passionate about praying for, it makes it powerful because it's coming from your heart. So that I also would, that would be another way praying in the spirit or into the influence of the spirit. That would be different than tongues. Okay, so I'm not quite clear. If you pray in the spirit, are you praying in a kind of a tongue? Are you just praying with your own words? But you're, but you're, but you're praying in the spirit. What are you saying? There are two different types. There's two different types. You may not even be filled with the Holy Spirit. You can pray a very powerful prayer and Holy Spirit may be guiding you into praying that. You may hear him say, well, don't forget about praying about this. Don't forget this person and you pray when you're in your prayer time, then that is a powerful prayer. That would still be praying in the spirit. Now praying in tongues that you know for sure that's exactly what that is. Praying in tongues that the Holy Spirit brought to the earth when he was sent to the earth and you speak in those tongues. Those tongues are a spiritual language. Okay, now I'm going to drill down one more time because even I can be dense at times. If I'm praying in the spirit, because God's told me something and I totally am tapping into him. Am I using my own language or am I using what sounds like tongues? You can use your own language. Okay. If he has told you to pray that way. Okay. If it's a special prayer or certain reason why he's asking you to pray, then that could be, it could be. But praying in tongues is that heavenly language that comes down in your tongue as you begin to utter those, its mainly sounds or syllables that you're praying. Yeah. Something that we may not understand. But I remember the day when somebody would say, let's pray and somebody would get a message in tongues. Someone else in that meeting would get an interpretation and they'd actually see what those tongues were because the Holy Spirit gave them that interpretation of that. And either that or just declaring and decreeing yourself. Sometimes when you declare and decree, people will do that in tongues. That doesn't mean it's for an interpretation. That means there's something that's serious, serious that they want to pray about. Okay. Now, John, it was said, John was in the spirit or he said, I was in the spirit on the Lord's day. What was that if you can put that into words? It is a, it's a way that you walk your life out. I'm in the spirit a lot. I walk in the spirit a lot. That means I'm not, I'm not being, I'm not receiving man stuff. I'm not taking man for any answers. I'm not, I'm not, I don't have everything come along and I don't gauge it or see it by the flesh. Because it says if you walk in the spirit, you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. I mean, that means if you stay in that place of always hearing and listening, then you're going to know what to do and say at all times. You won't think, well, I better judge just by the flesh. This is what so and so did about the situation. Or I think this would be the best way to do this, you weren't, you weren't hearing that in the spirit and you have to stay tuned into the spirit. And then you will be letting God, everything that is presented to me, I judge it according to what the spirit of God would say or do about it. I do not judge it by my flesh. Okay. Well, that, okay, that leads me to one more because you know me and my rabbit trails. Okay. 30 years ago ish 30, maybe 32, there was a gentleman and he was one of the elders in a church. This is in Texas and everybody want his first name is Glenn. Everybody wanted Glenn to speak over them because he would prophesy. He would use that we use the term read their mail. He would, he would know things and he would prophesy and everybody wanted it. He was a godly man. I sought counsel from him from time to time during the time that I knew him. He would speak these words over people. He'd call him out from the front. He had never yet spoken in tongues. Talk about how that was possible or what that means. Well, you know, people can prophesy. You can prophesy without speaking in tongues. That's a totally different thing. Everyone can be prophetic. It says so in the Bible. From a prophetic viewpoint, doesn't mean you had to be filled with the spirit. Doesn't mean you had to speak in tongues. And I know friends, I have people that do it a lot and that your personal choice to invite. You have to just like invite Christ to invite Christ to be your savior and then he moves inside of you to get the Holy Spirit. Now, when you get saved, the Holy Spirit comes along side of you and he will guide you from that place. When you invite the Holy Spirit to indwell you, he actually moves in and then you hear him from in here, not out here. But that doesn't mean you can't be prophetic. People can hear prophetic words. You hear God say things about people and then they say them. And then they're being prophetic. That has nothing to do with being filled with the spirit. Okay, I'm going to give you one more cat. You're on a roll and you're doing good. So Paul writes and he says, your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Is it or is it not true that when you receive Christ at that moment, your body becomes the temple of the Holy Spirit? Are you saying he only comes beside you so far? Yeah, I would say he comes beside you. It is where Christ dwells in you. So when you invite Christ as your Savior, he does come inside of you and then he is in there. But he said I will send the Holy Spirit. When Christ went back to heaven, I'll send him to lead you and guide you and show you things to come. He does that. Holy Spirit is up here. Yeah, okay. Once you invite Holy Spirit in, then you become also a temple of the Holy Spirit. You're a carrier. That's what that means. The temple of the Holy Spirit doesn't mean you're a church. It means you're a physical carrier of Holy Spirit who has now come to indwell you and he will show you things to come. He'll give you a revelation on the word of God. He may give you things to say to people also that would be professional. Yeah. Okay, can I give you one more? Sure. These are experience here on the roll. We're in the spirit, walking in the spirit. Okay, when I first, I was baptized at the age of 10, I believe I was saved, although it was in that tradition that didn't know very much about it, but they accepted Christ. Okay, when I had this encounter with the Lord 1981, so 41 years ago, I had an encounter where the spirit, it was walked in the room in the Bible. It was almost as if the word came alive on top of the Bible. It was almost three dimensional. The woman went into slow motion. I knew nothing yet about being filled with the spirit. I never asked for the Holy Spirit because I didn't believe in it. From that moment on, the Bible flipping came alive to me and I couldn't put it down. I was reading and reading. So what was that? I would say he probably came over you. If you had never actually invited him in, I also know this. People who are in services where a lot of people are getting filled with spirit, he just comes in anyway. Okay. If you're attending, back in the day when people really began to get filled with the Holy Spirit, I remember those days. I was born in the 50s. I remember those days, but people began to sincerely seek the Holy Spirit. They would go to meetings where people get filled with the spirit and the Holy Spirit was over everybody in there and all of a sudden they would just get to them. They would start speaking in tongues and then after that, they just continued to speak in tongues. There are ways if the Holy Spirit knows your heart and knows that your soul cries, he'll just come in. If you don't mind, you can always say, I don't receive you. He's done that. I did that very profoundly in years later as I learned about it, but at this one event, that happened to me. I realize the scripture was about to come alive until a few days later, but in the same meeting and a group of us that knew nothing about that, inviting the Holy Spirit, our friend who heard the encounter that I was describing that I had just had, Nils down in prayer and she started speaking in tongues under the anointing of the Holy Spirit at the same meeting because of the same encounter I had. I didn't get that for a few years later. She had it instantly. So it was like, it sounds like what you're describing, like he just came in anyway, almost, although I did invite him years later. So fascinating thing. I think it's the spirit, the spirit does know everything everywhere. I mean, he just, Holy Spirit knows everything everywhere at all the same time. He knows it. He knows what, what, what, what your heart is. He knows what your hunger is. And if he knows that what you're crying out for, even if it's inside, he's just going to come move in. That's good. That's really, really good. Yeah. And I had to contend for tongues years, like I said, a few years, and I kept asking and asking and he kind of like took his good time for the times. But, but, you know, I, but the scripture was like so alive. I had never heard had anything like that in my life. I thought, where did this, where did these birds come from? You know, one, one example is we, I, we, we got invited our group. Okay, we, I was always a part of the father's company, dance company, Christian dance company, very powerful in the spirit. They did a lot of dance intercession and stuff like that. And they were invited to come to a Baptist church. Somebody wanted to know this, how do you use Christianity? How do you preach the gospel? And they invited, but what no one ever said to us was this church had been seeking more of God for six weeks. They were having nightly services seeking God. We want the more, they didn't even know what the more was. They didn't know Holy Spirit. They were seeking, seeking, seeking, seeking. And the day before we came, the whole church got baptized in the Holy Spirit by the Holy Spirit. Wow. And so while we were there, they knew we were spirit-filled people. They knew we were, they called us tongue helpers. They knew we were. So when they got into performing, they came up and said, can we please ask a question of somebody in here? And they started speaking in tongues. And then the whole church started speaking in tongues. They went, we, we need to know what is this? What is this? What is this? We can't stop doing it. What is this? Wow. The whole church of 200 some people, they were seeking more. That was the more they got invaded by Holy Spirit. And, and we, we didn't laugh at them, but we just kind of left at the situation. Yeah. And we said, you have been pursuing more of God, more of God is baptism in the Holy Spirit. Once you receive Christ baptism, the Holy Spirit is what you should ask for next. You were seeking more, more of him, more of Christ, you wanted more. He gave it to you. So what you have now is your prayer language that is from Holy Spirit. And if he's moving on you to pray in those tongues, just keep praying in those tongues. And probably one day I'll come along and somebody will get an interpretation in the church can stand up and tell you what was just said by that person. But you, you started on the journey that your denomination almost never does. Yeah. The whole church got it. They weren't telling anybody. They found out what it was. Well, you know, and I've told the parts of the story on and off, but I was at that meeting to set them straight. I knew they were deceived and off and wrong. And so God knew my heart because I wanted to do right and be right. Yeah. And the way I describe it is God walked in the room by the spirit. The scripture came alive and I, and I never looked back as far as the scripture. It just came alive. But then later I would. So God will do all kinds of funny, crazy things that don't, that don't match anyone else's experience. Well, how did that happen to you? I don't know. Well, all I know is once I was blind now, I see it's like that. You know, so well, Kat, thank you so much. This is really, really, really good. I know a lot of people got help. Would you go ahead and pray for the people and whatever God gives you. Yeah, Father, I just pray for all of your children, God. I pray for those even thinking they don't know you don't know your son yet, God, that their eyes be open. That especially this time of year, open their eyes to the truth about the darkness, but also about you and who you are. Your son gave us life for all of us. Let them live by that truth. I thank you, Father, that the darkness is about to be pushed back, crushed and pushed back in these coming days on the earth when the glory will be seen around the world, when man will be free of evil and darkness for a very long time and that new inventions and creations are coming. Bring hope. I impart hope to those people right now. Hope for life, hope for freedom, hope for joy, hope for celebration, hope for your family. Hope that comes from God alone. Let them feel your presence, begin to invade them, invade their home. Let them know you love, that you care for them very much, that your son would have done it all over again because he loved. I thank you, Father, for the darkness being fully exposed, justice coming and us getting on in acceleration with our lives for all the things you have planned, Father. I just release life and presence of God, his will, his way, the good days coming on this earth. In Jesus' name, receive it. Amen. Amen, amen. So good. It's always, always so good. Today felt even better. It always feels better, but God bless you. Can't talk about. Enjoy your cake. I have one too. I'm going to take a bite. You're going to take a bite. I'm going to take a bite. Oh, yeah. Oh, man, there's nothing like chocolate cake. I said, if there was ever money in heaven, it would be chocolate. Now don't run around knowing people. I said chocolate was money in heaven. I said, if they don't have money, you don't need money. All the chocolate cakes, which are actually the size of your dining room table. You can have all the cake you want. Awesome. Well, thank the Lord for Milton Hershey that God gave him. The American version. The European version of chocolate was not the same. And he made the American version. I even watched some of the specials. It's just amazing. What an annoying he got put on him. Well, talk about just for a moment. You're revealing heaven.com and catcurve.com. So people will know that.

Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music And good morning. It's 11am from the Pacific Northwest Coast of the United States of America. I'm Steve Schultz, founder along with my wife Doreen of both the Elijah lists right here.com and Elijah streams that you're watching right now the video portion that you're watching now. Welcome to the broadcast. It's going to be a great show with cat today as always. There are a few preliminaries to to not get out of the way but to most of this. You'll enjoy very much. I do want to make an announcement about a position that has opened up. It's not, it's not a replacement position, but it's an additional account that we need. Put that up while I talk then you see along the bottom it says Elijah streams.com slash careers. If you know someone in the area of Albany, Oregon, and that could be Lebanon, Oregon Corvallis, Oregon, Kaiser, or Salem. I'm probably missing some things, but anywhere in that area, someone could even be up in Wilsonville and drive down, but we need an in person account to join our other account account on location in Albany, Oregon to, you know, we're continuing to grow and our donations are very generous. We need to help getting getting the paperwork done and the envelopes opened and the things that need to be done legally and all that county wise. Anyway, we're very excited about that. If you know anyone that wants an in person job. And it is an account. We're not talking about a bookkeeper. We're not talking who's kind of learned to do this and that, but this is a full charge accountant. I think they've told us we're going to leave this open for about 10 days and see who is able to respond. We're, we're trying to advertise first within the family of our viewers. And then if for any reason we didn't find the right person then we would advertise locally here but we thought we would. There's a lot of people in the area. So it may be hit someone right between the eyes in a good way that, oh man, I just was looking for a new job based on my accounting job went away, whatever that would be. So, all right, we're going to play now another clip of American Warriors is premiering today right after the show. Let me just tell you about that Bob Sanders trained for the jungles of Vietnam and commanded a platoon in a provisional rifle company on the outskirts of Da Nang. So this is the Vietnam War era, Da Nang. The action he saw in his first week convinced him he was going to be different. You can still see the pain and the regret on his face as he tells the story. I don't think anybody going to any war in history really knows what it's going to be like until they get there. The reality was pretty different. When you're in combat, you're much more affected when you have people you're responsible for wounded, hurt, killed, much more. Staff Sergeant Henry Sparks was my platoon sergeant, first platoon sergeant when I got to Vietnam. He bonded pretty quick and he took good care of me. Sergeant Sparks was killed in Vietnam. So we're producing these American Warrior episodes so we can honor those people who have gone before us and fought for this country in various wars. We've been in World War II, Korean, we've had people that from Vietnam era, from Desert Storm, Desert Shield. Even I think someone from one of the battles of Fallujah, which is one of the great battlegrounds of the Laugh Desert war in Iraq and all of that. There was a city called Fallujah where it was hand-to-hand combat, house-to-house combat, so I think we've had one of those already. I hope you enjoy it and honor the people. Here's how you get to it. In the Rumble, you type American Warriors or American Warriors 22. In the YouTube, you type American Warriors or American Warriors 22. Both Rumble and YouTube are getting a lot of play and the viewers are growing each week. It'll be fun to watch this grow over the period of days, weeks, months, years, whatever. We're going to bring in Mike and Lori Sally and talk about the wells. We haven't had them on for a few weeks, so let's bring in Mike and Lori. My heroes in the faith. We love you guys. People wouldn't notice about it. We've known each other for more than, I think it has to be more than 20 years or very close to 20. My daughter babysat your children. Now, one of them is married and one of them is doing some of the videos that people have seen has been done by the other one, but my daughter babysat them as little girls. You even were with the Elijah list way back when for a short stint here in Albany, I think. It's been quite a while. 97? Yeah, time flies when you're having fun, right? But after we met you and after you started this, doing some work with Elijah List in the marketing area, then you guys started building the village we now know as Field of Dreams and Show Mercy, your organization that you did, but you're not only with Show Mercy full time. If we can state this way, you're also with Elijah Streams full time. You're doing both ministries and getting the wells dug for us. So tell me, I'm just going to throw this to you and bring everybody up and you call for the pictures you want in the video and all that. Okay, so go for it. Yeah, do you want to show the picture of where the wells are located first? Sure, yeah, we'll show that. It's a little hard because it's a distant, oh, there you go. That's Lake Victoria, right in Uganda. I think if you actually zoom out, there's even maybe some other ones that are shown. Is that it? Okay. Yeah, so this doesn't look like much, but actually it does look like a lot, but it's a map. But it represents 59 wells that Elijah Streams has dug in Uganda over the past just less than a year, almost a little bit more than a year. Seven of them were done last year and 50 were done this year and we're on a pace to do 77 this year with Elijah Streams. That group that's up there towards the left, there's a cluster there. Is that by your... That's by the Field of Dreams. How far would it be from the one on the left to the one on the right? How far of a distance is that spread of wells? I don't know the distance, but it's hours. Oh, it's hours? Right, and if you zoom out a little bit, the reason we wanted to show this map is if you see the whole plate of all of Uganda, we wanted people to know that Elijah Streams isn't just funding the drilling by Show Mercy, but reaching different parts of Uganda all the way up into the Northeast, and that's more of an area dry area. There's a lot of things, but that's the area I want to share a story about. Okay, wow. I'm not sure which one of those dots, but it's one of the four at the top. Both of those two wells recently were dug and the stories I got from the pastor we're partnering with up there were incredible. You don't really realize whenever you say you're funding clean water, you're helping... I think we kind of understand like the water's contaminated and we're helping them have clean drinking water, but it is so much more than that. Elijah Streams, by the generous donations of our partners, you are restoring people's lives. Wow. This one community, it's about 1,400 people, they have never had a water well. They've always had to go trek long distances to get water, and it's dirty water that they're getting. There wasn't even an opportunity for them to have unity, have social events, because their whole life, their whole day-to-day was trekking to get water in the morning and then again in the evening. Even the children, they were telling me, don't have time. The parents do not send them to school because water, you can't live without water. You can live without education, but you cannot live without water. I want to show the picture of them sitting under this mango tree. In Uganda, in many places in Africa, trees are a big deal, and that's where they normally socialize. They get under a tree, and so this is an old mango tree. They send me this picture, and you can't see the faces or the beautiful people, but it's a picture of a community able to rest now that they have a clean water well. The water well, you can't see it in this picture, it's right behind them, but now they can come together under this tree. It's one of their first times where their leaders were able to gather everyone and talk together as a community and to socialize. Time has been restored to these people. It's incredible. Rather than walking for hours or miles or however long it takes, they can go to the meeting place where they all get together and the water is right there. It's right there, and they're hanging out while they're waiting in line to get their water, and they're socializing and getting to know one another again. I also heard a story about a mom. She works all day. She has to walk to work. Very few people in the areas where we're serving have cars. They have to pay for transportation, and they don't really have money to pay for transportation, so they walk to work. She would walk a long distance to work, work all day, have to walk all the way home, and then when she gets home, her next task is just to walk for miles to go get water. Well, Elijah Streams has just donated a water well near her house. Now she can come home from a long day at work after walking so many miles to get that home, pick up her jerry cans, and walk not very far to get water, and they were telling me, if you could see the smile on her face, she actually can prepare dinner in time for when her kids get home before. She wouldn't have the energy to walk that far. She'd wait till they would get home. They'd walk for miles together. They were just tired all the time. So it's more than just clean water. It's just restoring souls to be able to live life. It's like giving, and I'd say, you know, I would have said, well, we gave them their life back, but it's like they never had their life in the first place because this is their existence. I don't even know how they congregate all over these, whatever they are, hillsides or whatever, when they don't have water, but I guess they do because they know somehow they were going to walk miles and find some watering hole that the animals also shared. Right. That's crazy. That's just crazy. That's just crazy. Now you had a video that we were going to show. Do you want to talk about that? Yeah, this is one of the wells by that mango tree, and the people were just celebrating. I just wanted to share it with all of the viewers watching because it's, I love it. Okay. Okay. Now there was something about people were, Emily, didn't you have one where people were singing or are we talking about the same one? Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and play that one then. So they sent me that video and I was like, what are they saying? They're like, they are praising the Lord for this miracle that's come to their village. So it was exciting to see that. Oh man. That's just, I mean, I have no words to see, you know, we're changing people's lives and I know we are and I tell people we are and then when you guys come on and then sometimes your daughter will make a new video and we see something that we hadn't seen before. And every, every miracle story, I just cannot, when, when I, when we decided to help with one well, you, you came to us a long time ago, year or two ago and said, how'd you like to sponsor? Well, and I just kind of go, okay. So I did the forest guy thing. Okay, we'll do that. And, and then after I had done that, I began to think, well, wait a minute. God told me in 1987 that I was going to have a well ministry and he also mentioned little orphan children. Now they're not all orphans here. There's probably some, but, but he mentioned the children and wells. And I, I waited, it was like, whatever that is, 87. Is that what that's almost 40 years or 30. I, I don't have my calculator, but anyway, yeah, it's, it's 37 years or 40, close to 40 years, whatever. But I waited until finally it became very clear what God had, that, that the wells God's used an expression with me. That's, that's a known expression, which is home is where the heart is or charity begins at home. And so it had become clear to me over the years that wherever God, whatever God put in your life, that's where you give. So we didn't go looking all over the world to see where we get. We look to see who was in our life that we could give to. So you guys, you guys have said, we were just talking off the air. How much have you, we've been giving to even other things that other than water. Can we just, let's just tell people what you estimated we've given to people this year from Elijah streams. Well, that's a lot of people. I don't think anybody really knows how, how much your donation to Elijah streams are impacting so many groups of people. And so, you know, one of the things we're tasked with doing is helping to find organizations to give to and good causes to give to. And over the past several months, just, just Lori and I, on behalf of Elijah streams has given probably between six and $700,000 to other organizations. And that's not including just the wall of projects. And so I want to encourage people just, you know, Steve is one of the most generous people. And I know you all know this, but he's one of the most generous people that I've ever met, if not the most generous people. It's true. It's true. But when you're sewing into Elijah streams, you don't even have a tip of the iceberg of the impact that you're making for the kingdom of God in thousands and tens of thousands and probably millions of people's lives. And so it really is making a big difference. And Steve's not going to, Steve's not going to brag on himself and on Elijah streams. But I want you to know that you're, you're giving is absolutely unbelievably making a huge impact around the world. Well, very good. Thank you for that. So there was a picture of a church. We didn't show that picture. Let's show you the church that that. Now, go ahead. It's not by where the mango tree was. It's in a different area. But the thing is, is we've shared before, you know, at first I was shocked. I started getting stories of hundreds of people giving their lives to Jesus. And then the next thing I know we are over a thousand. I don't have the exact number, but it's over well over a thousand. And my team sent this picture of a church that the community, they gathered funds and they all pitched in somebody donated this land. Because so many people gave their lives to Jesus after one of the Elijah streams wells was opened. And I think we understand if you have running water all the time, just the miracle that this is to these people. I mean, this week they're commissioning another well that's been drilled and when they do a big commissioning, they do a big party. One area is taking it upon themselves. The the local chairperson, which is like the mayor of the area. They are renting some tents there. They've gathered all of the pastors. They called all the churches to come together as one and they're doing a huge celebration. They're going to be preaching the gospel. I can't even imagine what what kind of reports we're going to hear from them. It's just it's so impactful. And Steve, whenever you say the Lord spoke to you orphans and wells, I'm confident that he knew that the fatherless. Yeah, into the house. That makes sense. Because he called them little orphan children, but look at, you know, yeah, you're right. That's really good, Laurie. Really, really good. Okay, now we today you sent me a report this morning. We're waiting for cats. So we're going to talk for a few minutes. And it reminded me that we had just approved a couple of other projects for your village. Talk about that and maybe the medical clinic a little bit as well. Yeah, so Elijah streams has donated to build a hospital at the show Mercy base and so that is in progress and I'm sure we'll be showing pictures of that soon. It takes a little bit of time to build things. But again, it's it's going to be a hospital where people can come and get treatment. It's right next to a birthing center that Elijah streams is also helped to fund part of it. And you've also donated Elijah streams and ambulance and emergency vehicle for this area that's rural and rural area and they don't have access. We have our clinic now, but we're not able to treat every every sickness like serious things. And so sometimes it'd be challenging to figure out how to get them to the city. And so we have an ambulance to again, this is going to help the people physically. But the thing is, is for every patient that comes in, we pray for them. We share the good news of Jesus with them. And we're located in the middle of a Muslim village. And we've had stories of the Muslims coming to our clinic, not having the funds to pay. We charge a small amount. We also give, you know, services for free to that we charge a small amount. And so some of these Muslim women were hearing that God was showing up at our clinic. And so they would come and say, we don't have money, but would you pray for us? And so our team would pray and of course he would show up and, you know, they would get healed. Anyway, so bring their friends, they bring their friends. And so it's just another way of bringing the fatherless into the house. And so he's doing it through a hospital. And so thank you Elijah streams for me. And then there was you that you would talk with us about the toilet. And I don't know that I don't know how fancy the toilets are, but but you talk about what we just approved and how where that's going to go. Well, so we've been doing these water wells partnering together with Elijah streams and the need is not just clean water, but after you drink the water, what happens? Sanitation and so, you know, as we're discovering things in the United States, it's some of those same things. And it got me thinking, I wonder if Steve would be open to helping the community with some community toilets. And so we haven't started that project yet. We're doing our research. You want to make sure that we do it well. It'll be a place where it can get cleaned and sanitized and and just help present prevent disease again. And it's just going to impact the people in another huge way. It's not something you would typically think of like providing a toilet to the community, but most people don't. They're not nobody in our area has has running water in their house. There's nobody has flush toilets like none. And I mean, when they can, can I just get down dirty to use the expression. So if there's no flush toilets, what are people doing? Do they do they just go out in the bushes somewhere? What do people do? If you don't have a pit latrine, you go in the bushes. And that's very unsanitary. And that's a lot of people do not have pit latrines. And so what this is going to be is a similar to a pit latrine, but bigger, nicer, tiled, you know, something that you could clean. And so it's going to be in an area where several families can use it. So just something simple like having a place to go to the bathroom is not is not common. No, no, yeah, some, some local schools to that don't have proper facilities so that the students can have a place to go. Well, you know, when I was an only, I've only been to Africa once and it was to Nigeria and I'm sure there's many differences, but it sounds like there's some similarities because we were talking about when it's really crowded, traffic wise, it's mainly motorcycles, people who ride motorcycles and then some taxis and things. And it's, it's a crazy thing. But when we were in Nigeria, it was 2000. So that's 22 years ago, we would go by and there were places where there was water, outdoor water, and by a building and it was painted. Someone just spray paint on the building do not pee here because they if you didn't tell them that they would do the same thing, which, which could then hurt the water source. Right. So that's very common. We see those signs all the time. Really? Okay, the same thing. Yeah, and they'll even put a fine on there. Sometimes they'll say, you know, 50,000 chilling fine. If you urinate on this building, you don't think like, wow. Yeah, it's a problem. I didn't realize that how big of a deal it was, but just providing a solid hole in the ground for somebody to use the restroom is a real blessing to them. That's crazy. Well, there's more things you had a term a few weeks back when we were talking about you had a term that had to do with use the word wash or something. What was that term? Yeah, wash, water, something sanitation hygiene. I'm not sure what the aid I think it's water sanitation hygiene. Okay. And then it was so it was kind of like an acronym. And so we had talked about moving from just water to water sanitation and hygiene, which are like, how do you live without that? We were so spoiled and something. Well, they're telling me the cat is here. So we'll go ahead. Thank you so much, Michael. I appreciate you very much. We love you. You're doing such a great job for both show mercy and Elijah streams and getting those wells done. So blessings, blessings, blessings. We'll see you all soon. But okay, so without further delay, let's bring in Wednesdays with cat and Steve. Here we go. I don't care. There she is. I can't tell if that's blue or teal. It kind of likes teal, but it might be. It's teal. Awesome. Yeah, sometimes we match and sometimes we just look good together. Like right now. So I can say, okay, I see you got your don't do demon thing right on the top, but I do. Okay, welcome to the broadcast that we're looking forward to today. So I have a whole list of questions, but you often have something you want to share. If there's anything in your heart before we get into those questions. Um, just staying excited. Mainly, I have to say finishing packing is priority for everything except loving God. Okay. And it's really hard because we're so busy all the time. Yeah, but I never don't take time with God. That's good. Last night I was doing that really late and I love hearing what he has to say about everything right now and he just wants everybody to just continue to trust him. And he said, don't be concerned and do not. This is the main thing he said. Tell everybody do not let fear interfere with what you're going to see over these next couple of weeks. It has nothing to do with what he's going to do whatsoever. That's all he'll tell me, but he was excited when he said that. So I think we're going to be seeing probably a soon ending of all of this. I can't really say any more than that about what he showed me, but I will just say this. The main thing is, even though you go through everyday issues in your life, even we do hear, I know this is a supernatural place. We talk about we live the supernatural. We live heaven culture. We command the host of heaven. You know, we speak to the weather and yet and all of that, just so you all know that we have everyday things that rise up against us also. We always do. We all become them because we go with what God has to say, no matter what it looks like or sounds like, we will always choose. By the spirit and not the flesh. I think that's probably the most important thing I can tell you is sometimes, some days, especially it looks like it's never going to end. Or that it's too hard for you, but I can tell you it's not too hard for Jesus Christ. Well, Kat, you know, I got to ask you this because people would think, even I would think Kat is so close to the Lord. She sees him face to face often. She sits down with the Holy Spirit, your best friend, the way you said it. You know each of the members of the Trinity. So it would be easy for me to say, well, Kat probably just never has a stressful day and nothing ever goes wrong. No, I think that's probably the main thing I have to tell people is you see and hear the power of God from me all the time. But I live on this earth too. And just to remind you, his own son, Jesus Christ, didn't have the easiest life while he was here. But he sure made it exciting for everybody else. And I guess that's kind of what my part is in all this. I still have things to face. I overcome them very quickly because if it's the devil, especially now, there's things that happen in the natural. Just in your everyday life. I'm not saying tragic things. There's things you face every day, how to make decisions about things or maybe something happened. You didn't expect it or you're still waiting for something to happen. We face every one of those. But what are you talking about yourself? I choose to talk about what God has said. I choose to tell about God's plan. It doesn't mean I'm ignorant of what's going on. It means I am innocent of all the wickedness. I'm innocent of fear. I'm innocent of struggles against God actually saying something to me. I'm totally innocent against any of that because I don't do that. I would rather give people the power and the life of God always, even from myself. And just leap over the things that are in my way. And you do that by saying what God says. You have to understand. A man is, as you think in your heart, a man is as he says. And people will see what you do and what you say more than anything else. Even in your everyday life. I'm not talking about a platform right now. In your everyday life, how are you responding to what's going on around the world? Do you have a powerful word? I'm not talking about a prophetic word. A powerful word, God does know what he's doing. He does have a plan and he's being covert right now. But right now he's going to have to bust through. And you're going to see everything change for you and your family. That's so much better than saying, did you hear what someone so did in the White House? Did you hear what the fake news said today? Did you hear this? Why are you saying that? Because what you're putting in now, the same thing you're carrying, what's in your soul will come out of your mouth. So change what's in your soul. Change what you think about, what you say, what you look at, what you say to other people. Your soul is active 24 hours a day, even when you're sleeping. You're putting that soul to good use. You're supposed to make it better for people, happier for people. You're supposed to give them something they can trust by hearing God and understanding God. But what kind of report are you giving? So I'd have to say the number one thing today to say to people is, I'm giving a God report. I have to tell people, I am excited about what he's going to do. I do trust him. This earth is his. It doesn't belong to the darkness, the evil, or anyone else. You're about to see his hand displayed like you never have before. And your lives will never, ever, ever be the same. You're living a powerful generation right now. Some of the greatest things are about to happen. Why do you think Satan is fighting so hard to keep people in that destiny? Kick his butt out, give God's words everywhere you go. Staying excited and guess what? People will want to hear what you have to say because we're here to bring hope in this world. So, so, so good. Now, can I ask you one more question along the line about what you see and all that? Because people would also assume that because you see more than most people see, you're not only a seer by calling from birth, you are a seer. But God is constantly with that gift or maybe even without that gift is taking you to heaven and showing you things. So they would assume that cat must know everything that's about to happen and when it's going to happen. And she's one of the lucky few that God just tells everything to. I will take two of those as a yes. Okay. Which two? One thing I don't know for sure is what time. Okay. I don't know that. I do know about everything that's about to happen. I don't know that. I'm not bragging. I'm just saying that's what he called me to do. I'm a revelator. We reveal truth from the heart of the Father, not from man. That's why what I always say to you will be something the Father would say. Yes, he does show me all the time, everywhere. And I've been taking 150 years into the future just so you know that right now. We're not going to talk about that 150 years. But I'm telling you, I've seen that far into the future. This is like we're at a big entrance to step into something that is so powerful. It's called acceleration. It's called habitation of heaven. It's called baptism in fire. It's called the glory being imparted everywhere. It's called the manifested sons of God are standing up and speaking to the land, the sea and the air and it obeys. That's the entrance we're going into. And the devil is trying everything he can in his little self to stop that from happening. But he is going to fail and fail miserably. And everyone who's a part of that is going to fail miserably. I got to ask you this now. I, I, I'm with you. I 100 percent believe you were, you know, you've even said, even gave me a word that I would live more than 50 years from now. And that takes me to at least 117 years old. So I, I plan to do that. But there are people who are saying, Steve, you guys are crazy or you're just not hearing right. Because everything that is, that is in scripture about the one world government, they're trying to take over. They're trying to kill us. They have this is all they are so close to succeeding. And as you're not in any fear about that at all, there is no chance they're succeeding. Steve, they keep trying to come up with new lies and plans every day to work it as long as they can. There's already some that know this foundation is crumbled. And the word says these certain things must happen before the end comes. God is sitting on his throne shaking his head. You all saying there's no way I'm giving up you doing the greater works when you haven't started the greater work. There's no way I'm giving up my son knowing and understanding that you rule and reign with him in this world. There's no way I'm giving up the manifested sons and daughters of God. The earth is shaking not because of the evil is shaking wanting us to stand up and begin to do things that will so blow the mind of not just the left, but all the wicked and evil out there. We are about to make major changes in the spirit realm, which will then fall into the physical realm. So if you read your Bible, I hope you do. You're leaving a whole lot out if you think it's going to wrap up right now. Stick your rapture rug in the closet, get your crown on honey, because you're about to rule and win with Christ. That is what is next. Next is not fail, crash and burn. That would be for hell. Fail, crash and burn. But not for those who believe and trust him and he's already got your name written in a book saying you'll do these things. Why would he pull the rug up from underneath you and go rapture you with it? Yeah, that's good. Can you talk any more about because we know you've talked a lot about justice that's coming. God, we are in a time of justice. Can you give any more detail about what justice you've seen? There are people that are so wicked that some of them were leaders of this nation and their cohorts. I mean, what to what kind of detail has God shown you how severe this justice is about to be towards those that have done wickedly? Some are going to die. That's not me killing him, by the way. Yeah, Supreme Court doing it. It's not the government doing it. I can tell you right now, you better look at the hand of God because there's times in the Bible when he personally intervened himself. There will be natural man to help this happen, but don't look to the Supreme Court to be your answer. Don't look for these elections to be your answer. I'm telling you right now, God is going to have his hand in this. Yes, like I said, natural man will be involved because they do govern here, but a lot of them are about to be removed. And a lot of the other side trying to take over will be removed. This is as simple as I can tell you. Many will live in prison for the rest of their life. How do you like that one? Some are just going to, they're really going to crash and burn literally, literally. God said, I will take them off the face of the earth. Some, I said some. God said some. He made me say it again. Some will not live until this is over. Wow. God is about to establish, not him down here on the earth personally, but what will be established after this will be a just government that will want this country and even the world to succeed. That's what you can look forward to. That is for sure. Write it down right now. That's what's going to happen. Justice is going to be served like never before at a degree never given before. He made me say it twice. You will see people haul up in handcuffs. You never thought they would do that to them. But I'm telling you, don't worry. It will be seen and it will be known. The next part people will not be hidden. Okay. That's good because there's been so much that's been hidden that we didn't get to see. There must be justice going on behind the scenes that we're not seeing. And I'm kind of anxious to see some of the results with my own eyes and be, you know, I'm not saying a court will not be used. Yeah. We'll just say this. We don't have to depend if you're always looking at man. Yeah. What man has said and what man is saying will happen. If it doesn't line up with what God has happened, then what they're going to say is not what there's won't happen. It goes between a man and God who carried you in him for eternity before he stopped to make time for a while. Yeah. You better know who who is. I don't care if people don't know God's not in charge. Oh, make me laugh. Go stand before he's done that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we just laugh if you said that because let me tell you what, when he feels like it and when he has to, he will come in person. Yeah. And you said so a minute ago about, I don't remember exactly how you word it, but basically don't, don't look to the election to solve. What did you say about the election and what, how that was not. I do not think that these midterm elections are the thing that's going to solve everything. Because people are thinking, yay, it looks good for this party. That looks so good for that party. This person's getting in this person's not in. When God is done with all this mess, he's going to have it. They're who he wants in and I can tell you that's who you trust. You have to trust him. I'm not saying some good won't come out of it. I'm just saying it will not be the answer to everything. Why would we need God? Yeah. Good stuff. Kat, really, really good stuff. You know, I can tell, you know, that that was like, we didn't know that was coming, but it came with a, with the flash. That's good. I'm very encouraged. All right. You ready for this? Yes, that's good. I'm very encouraged. All right. You ready for a few questions? Yes, I am. These questions, you know, we technically, they're supposed to be about having, but people have all kinds of questions for you. So I'm going to just start at number one. Okay. Jack, Jack says, I know that there's theaters in heaven because you talked about that and lots of entertainment heaven, but are there. Are there any organizations with fun programs or a TV set in our mansions? That's an interesting question. I never, I never heard that one asked before. I never saw a TV in anyone's mansion. That doesn't mean that you can't do programs in different places. They just have different ways to do it. It would probably just be, I don't know. I'm not brilliant enough. I don't have a degree of great genius. I do have in heaven with revelation, but not stuff. I never saw a, most people I think, I know a lot of people go out to watch things, attend things and do things. I'm not saying they don't have a way that you can't see something. It's not like any of the televisions we have today. It isn't. Like if you want, I do know this, I can tell you this much, you know, to play music, you have, what is the name of that thing that you can play? Oh, the, I, well, it's on your phone board. It used to be the iPod, but now it's used to be iPod, but now your phones will play music. I mean, it's streaming. So yeah, I don't even know how it operates. There's a dot they give you. I can't even tell you what it is. Oh, I don't know that. And you put it on like here and played all the different music you always loved. I do know there'll be some stuff from the earth. If it's good and decent and exciting, those kind of things still remain, but, and I'm not talking about just heavily choir singing. I mean, powerful people who are highly anointed, who were caught up to heaven, they still play music up there. They still have concerts up there. And you can have that. I guess it's like streaming on this little tiny dot, but you hear all around you. That's interesting. It is very interesting, but this, there's some technology so high and me with my 12th grade education people not explain all of that. Okay. I can tell you what tastes good and what doesn't. I just have seen the way things are done. Like I've told people before you travel on air, on light, on bands of the rainbow. You tap into these places you step into really and beams are like shoot out and grab you and take you to the other side of heaven. Like almost instantly. There's all kinds of ways to travel. Travel. Thank you, Holy Spirit. He said you're talking about travel. It's completely different than any way you travel on this earth is so beyond your imagination. But I'm telling you where you're going to really enjoy it when you get there. So there's things like that. They still have transportation. They still have a fellow shipping. They have dinner parties. I can call it a party. There's nothing wrong with the party. I probably doesn't mean you're going to have liquor and get drunk. So forget that stuff. You need to change the way you think, but everything in heaven is exciting is sometimes it's filled with adventure. You go on the adventure thing. And boy, they're adventures. I won't say anything, but they have different ways to do it in heaven. It doesn't mean you don't get to do some things. It's just done differently. Well, you know, you talk about music. I think a lot of times about my friend, Kim Clement, who's now got with the Lord, he was a violent in the spirit. Worshiping keyboardist. I mean, he could do that. And if he watched his fingers, you wondered, how does a man do that? You know, he, even when he was older, you know, 50 some 60, he probably was close to 60. It must have been when he passed, but his fingers would move like I've never seen. So does Kim, is he likely in heaven performing some of that warfare type music? If you know what I mean. I've already seen him in heaven. Say again. I've already seen him in heaven. You have you talking to him playing a keyboard that was not flat. Oh, really? Not like this. It was round like this, but it moved. Really fingers. Yeah, it was. It was that's what it was. And he was playing. He had his eyes shut. Of course, he's playing this instrument, but it was a keyboard. That's what they told me. This is a keyboard in heaven. And he was playing it with sounds I never heard before, but it was so powerful. Wow. I think I even wrote and told his daughter about it and they about what I saw him doing. Is that is when he's doing it? Is it not just gorgeous and beautiful and worshipful, but is it is it performing prayer in heaven? Is it like the creaking things on the earth from heaven when he's doing that? I, some of it, I don't understand because some of it wasn't in a language that I spoke. Okay. The sound part, the song part that he was singing. I just know that it was extremely amazing and powerful. It was very powerful. Okay. So whatever he was playing about at that time when I saw him, it was powerful. Yeah. Very good. And I want to come back to the movie for a minute. You said this before and I thought, I need to ask her this because she said, John Wayne's in heaven. And she said, you know, you don't, it's not on film. It's like it's live. It's captured live and that type of thing. But you said there's no violence. There's no evil. But how, how could you have, for instance, a, an, on the edge of your seat Western with John Wayne, and if there wasn't a bad person that had to be fought, which Western's always had, what? I think you'll have a whole new way to do that too. I'm not going to give that one away. Oh, you're not going to give that away? It was exciting. I saw a part of one with him and then it was really, it was very powerful. The thing that's different is you get to be in it with him if you want to. Oh, okay. I've never, I don't usually press you on this when you say, I'm not going to give that boy, but why couldn't you give that away? Is it just, we wouldn't get it. We wouldn't understand. It's something that would ruin. Okay. You'll ruin the surprise. Take away the excitement and this quite big surprise of what you will see up there, but they do have adventures filled with even, even sitting on the edge of your seat kind of adventures and stuff like that. You, they do have them. Wow. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I believe I just wanted that one. Okay. Let's see. Rose asks how she says, can you please explain how to seal a room? How to seal a room from enemy forces when you're away from home, home or away from home, when you, when you are home or away from home, I guess. So she's saying, I, I guess she must mean that the room she's in, she wants it sealed away so enemy forces can't get in. I assume that's what she's saying. Well, a room or a building. Yeah. Yeah. But her room, if it's just your room, you would have to post host outside those doors because that is what their, that's what their, that's what their job is. That's what they're there for there to protect you and keep you in all of your ways. They need to say that and say, I'm leaving you here as sentinels to guard and protect everything of all of my property, this place where I live and all of this and nothing by any means shall harm it. You would say something and the host would stand, they'd stand there like sentinels right there and nothing would be allowed to come. Nothing that would hurt your place, right? Yeah. Or in your place would be allowed to come through those doors or any other entrance in that place. Oh, okay. That would be the number one way to do it. Awesome. All right. Regina asks, she says, I don't totally understand what it means to be to quote, be in the spirit or to pray in the spirit. Can Kat explain what that is? Is that a special gift or can anyone learn to do that? Did anyone learn to be in the spirit? So she may be thinking about John, the revelator said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day, I suppose that would be one example. Well, that's because he actually was in a place. Okay. He was in a spiritual place. It's almost like, I don't want to say a level of prayer is not like that. It's your focus. You always want to hear what the father is saying or what the right thing to do with. And you can even in the beginning say, I would like to have an answer from the spirit, the spirit, like Holy Spirit. I don't want to think in the flesh what that is unless it's a decision you have to make in the flesh. So there's a, there's a line right there that you have to decide are these things that I can get received information from revelation from about what I need to do about something that's a little bit different. But what John, John had just had reached a place where he was in the spirit. That means all around him is almost like a cloud of the spirit of God, not Holy Spirit, but it's a place and area that your prayers are always received. Your conversations with God are always received. And you get to a place like every decision I personally make is not made with my flesh mind. It is made with a, with a renewed spirit that God gave me when I got born again that I decided to go and say what God would do, do what God would do. And you begin to actually develop that. So John, even John the beloved on the Isle of Patmos had to develop that relationship where he was always going to be hearing what God had to say if there was something he had to say or something John had to say to him and he was actually in that place right there. In the atmosphere of the spirit, when, when the door opened up in heaven and he heard the voice saying, come up. He did. Cause that's because his relationship was to that place and anybody can do it. No, anybody, God said he would rather have you walk in the spirit so you don't fulfill the lust of the flesh. It says it in the Bible. It does say that. It does say that. Are you saying that does that scripture mean cause Paul said that walk, therefore walk in the spirit so you won't gratify the less of the flesh. That's what you said that are you saying that anybody can get to that place has the possibility of getting to the place like John, where you're walking in that spirit where it's the spirit realms all around you. And therefore when you're in that, you simply don't gratify less of flesh. Is that, is that what you're saying? So giving itself over to God, you would not even consider sin is not even a kind of sin. Consideration is not in your vocabulary, it's not in your lifestyle. There's no thought. There's no desire for that because you have on purpose developed relationship with the father or the son or Holy spirit that you would rather have what they want, what you, how they need it. God's will, God's way. That's a good thing to start focusing on. I can do God's will, but do I want to do it my way or do it even mad? Does it matter to me that I find out what his way would be? And that's like a place in that space where you begin to walk in your life. The walk in the spirit doesn't mean you have to be in the spirit realm. It means it is wrapped itself around part of you, especially this upper part where you're always thinking and acknowledging who God is. And it actually does become a way of life. And that's what John had developed, that way of life. And that's why he got caught up to heaven and shown those things. He, God knew he wouldn't reject that. He wouldn't laugh at that. You have to watch out what your conversation is all the time concerning God. You really care what he thinks. You really care what you want to know him. I mean, not that everybody has 20 more years of their life, but for 20 years I personally pursued to know Jesus Christ in a greater way. And I would not purpose find time just to go sit in a room with him and just talk to him before he even started to appear to me. I could still see angels and stuff at that time that it came like, I really wanted it's not like I shut out eating, I shut out sleeping, I'm not saying something weird like that. It's a heart desire to know him. And you go from level to level on everything, on dominion, on authority, on even understanding of the word, declaring and decreeing, ruling and reigning. You reach different, you reach different levels of all of that, but you have to start somewhere and the number one thing is don't sin. That's good. Don't look at sin. Don't look at the darkness. Don't be tempted by the darkness. And when it comes to tempt you, you say, I will serve the living God and him alone will I serve. I don't do that stuff anymore. I've given myself to God. I will run after his things. That's so good. Now, Kat, you said and you said it many times on the program that the Holy Spirit is your best friend. I think Catherine Kuhlman used to say the same thing. But one time you were pursuing Jesus, were there times when you pursued the Holy Spirit and other times now you're pursuing Jesus and other times now you're pursuing the Father? How do you decide who to pursue on a given day? It was always Jesus first. Okay. It was always Jesus first. He's the one who came and died for us. You know, I think if you have to know one time or wherever, I don't know in your life, I would say you always focus on Jesus first. He should be your first love. I mean like the person that you love the most. I'm not saying like a romantic love, the person you love the most. The fear of the Lord, by the way, is not being afraid of him. That's not what that is. The fear of the Lord is you would not want to be concerned to do something that might hurt him or might think negatively of something that you said or did. So that's you saying that. I would never do anything to turn away from the light or from Christ or his plans or anything and you have to have that mindset and some people say it's impossible and though it's not, I was just a normal everyday person, well, except for seeing the Spirit, but I still had to make decisions on my own or who I would choose. My friends would choose, where would I go even? I think probably because of my relationship so young with Christ, maybe that was a little bit more believable for me that I actually saw him and I saw angels, but you know what? You can make that same decision without seeing him at all. You can say I'm choosing this day to follow. Okay, you can be saved by Jesus Christ, but are you following what he's saying in the Word of God? Do you believe the way he says to believe? And I said, once you start looking at that, assist and meditate on those things or think about those things. So what are you thinking about? What are you spending your time doing? It's very important how you set aside time, even if it's 10 minutes a night saying this is for you Jesus, I'm going to sit over here and just talk to you, find a place to be quiet and just talk to you, tell you not all your problems. Hello, you're making a friendship, say hi, I want to tell you Jesus how much I love you, what you've done for me. I'm so excited about what you said in your Word, the plans you have for us, your home called heaven. I'm so excited about that. I'd like to know you more, say those words to me. So you're going to say, yeah, okay, you said that really quick, so don't, by pursuing, you don't mean, well, I'm just going to tell him all that's bothering me. So then he'll know that all that's bothering me, you're saying, no, no, no, that's a different time. Okay. Okay. Let's just say you're going to find somebody, you found someone to marry is every time you met with him, are you talking about what's all the problems and issues you had with him, they'd be interested, but there's a time you can always go for us to take all of your things to him and prayer, it says that cast all your chair on him, he cares for you. He's the one who restores your soul by his stripes. We are healed. I mean, there's so many things he's already done for us, right? Yeah. Nice to just give him thanks for some of those things, but really you can have a conversation with him. I would say prayer is an extended form of conversation. You know, when Jesus comes in to present himself to Thomas, who said, I'm not going to believe unless I put my hand in his wound, you know, and the side in his hand. So Jesus says to him, you know, bless that you Thomas, because you believe when you see I'm paraphrasing. And then he said, more blessed are those who believe, believe having not seen that that's a paraphrase, but that's what he was saying. He even said more blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe. So can you have any revelation on that scripture? Because some people don't see nearly the things you get to see. And yet God would like them to believe the very things that you believe, but you believe because you're seeing it. Or at least it seems that way. I believed it before I really saw a lot. Okay. I believe what he said to me when I was age four. And I repent to my sins, ask him to come and live inside of me as my savior. And then he appeared and goes, I will. I knew when he said those words, I will, he meant that his word is true. The truth will make you free people, not things you might assume or you may think someone else is sad. Maybe that's important. What's important is what's in his word. And I know people who live, even though they're seers, they live strictly by the word of God and I know I'm a bus person, but there's a lot of accountability in my life. And I can just tell you this, to carry something like this, you would have to have a huge amount of accountability. I'm accountable to him, but I'm still accountable to my husband as my husband, but as my God, I'm fully accountable to him for my life and what he has asked me to do and how to do it, how to say it. He won't let me step beyond bounds, he has made for me to stay within this limits like he would tell me all the time, don't let somebody make you a Billy Graham, you're not, don't let somebody make you a revivalist, you're not, you are a prophet, will speak for me what I say when I say to say it and I'll share, let you share what heaven is, the future is because this is what I've assigned for you. And I said, yes. Now, if he asked you something, even something smaller than that. Make sure you do what he's asked you to do. Like this cup of milk to your neighbor, they're trying to make something and they need the milk. Now, are you going to be willing to step out and maybe embarrass yourself by going next door and say, I thought you might use this cup, might need to use this cup of milk. Wow. Small thing. I do small things like that all the time. And I did it every time. Every time he said it, I would do it, that build your trust in him. He already knows he can trust me, but I have to see, I have to see that I can. And so he started with small things with me too. And he would ask me, and I didn't know those things, you know, I didn't always know they needed the cup of milk. He would just say, go over here and take this to this person, go over here, fly here and take this to this note to this person in the airport, fly over here and I would do it. I didn't always know all the answers. It's called willingness, willingness to obey. I do remember you telling a story once about going and flying the airport and handing someone a note. Is that a story you can recount? Yes. It was one of those times for three years, he kind of trained me by, at the spur of the moment, sending me all these strange places with strange reasons to go to them. And now you have to understand when I first started doing all this, he had me go to my husband and explain to my husband, this is what God has me doing. He needs to know that you're okay with that. And he turned right around and said, oh God, you can do anything with her you want to do. That's fine. And so I didn't just bypass the fact that I had a husband. My husband gave me permission and I could have said, I don't need you. That would have been so wrong. God would not have been happy with me if I'd have done that. He didn't want to separate us. He wanted us to be together, so I had to be willing on both sides to get to do what he asked me to do. And so, oh yeah, there was this one time, he said, you're going to fly to Minneapolis. And he said, I'll tell you why when you get on the plane. And I need you to go to the airport and you're going to walk in the airport. And I'm going to try to remember what you call the place where you go and buy all the food in the airport. The food court. I need you to go to the food court and he said, I'll tell you who to say something to when you get there. And my trip, I took, the flight gave me 45 minutes in the airport before my return flight that he told me to plan. I just flew the Minneapolis airport and then I flew back here and I had 45 minutes in between the flight. And that time you fly, he was going to make sure I guess I did it. I don't know. But that's my time frame that I had to fly back. And the enemy will fly everywhere in something like that to stop you from doing it or delay you doing it. And I already said, I'll do it. I will do it. I will do it. So I went, got the tickets. My husband, we got the tickets and he came to me, took me to the airport and we took off. I took off. He didn't go with me. I took off. Arrived in Minneapolis airport. But right before I got there, God said, there's a man in the airport who's got a new invention that will help change a lot of the lives in this world. He's trying to find the right buyer to help him invest in it. And I'm giving him my answer because he's asked me and I told him to go to the Minneapolis airport. And I was giving him my answer. Now I don't know this man's name at all. He said, so you're going to write down in the scratch of paper. This is what you're going to say in the scratch of paper going to hand him. Yes. My answer is New York. That is where you will go to find your investor, God. And he said, that's it. That's the message. Yes. My answer is New York. Yeah. That's it. That's what God had me write on the scrap piece of paper. He said, now you go to the food court and this guy will be marrying like a mechanic's one piece outfit. And you can't approach until he sits down to buy his head for prayer 45 minutes. I knew I had 45 minutes and on the way to the airport on the way in the in the airport on the way to the food court, this is how the devil tries to do things. My daughter calls grandson is drinking a bottle of Elvira. Oh my goodness. Now this is where my faith is. I started praying out loud at the top of my lungs running through the airport to get to the food court. I'm going to knock on the food court people. I was praying all the way there that it would be the stuff would be, I would nullify all the effects of the stuff that he drank that they would be able to find a bottle that they would get him to the medical care place so they could check him out. And I mean, I'm yelling running through the airport to get there. So I finally get to the food court and I said, amen. I was praying this on the phone with my daughter and we get to the food court and I turn the phone off and I waited, it was probably about 10 minutes and here he comes, he had like dark hair, had like a blue kind of a mechanic's outfit but a nice one and he went over and he was taking his time. I'm going to go help him pick the food because he was taking it off. And so he finally gets down and he gets his train and I'm like, you know, I'm waiting, I'm just waiting to get out of there and get my other flight. And so he comes up and he sits down and he bows his head like this, now I'm not a very quiet person. I ran up and I went, wait a minute, God, he lifts his head up and looks at me and I go, here's a note from God and I didn't even look, I didn't even watch him read it. I knew what it said. I turn, I'm running out of the food court and I hear this, praise God forevermore. And this funny and it's the guy in the suit. He got God's answer. Wow. Now I did not sign that piece of paper. He did not know who I was or anything about me and God said he doesn't need to know. He'll just know I answered him. That's amazing. What a couple. I just caught the flight just in time to get on the flight and come back. I was just shaken from head to toe. I was so excited that the devil didn't get to keep me. My daughter called me back. She said they can't believe they got the bottle, like on the little bottle and their child's really smart. It was something he was taking for something. It wasn't the kind you put in a lighter float or something like that, but it was some kind of thing he had to have so often for about three days. And he was like, not very old, I think it was like three or four genius level. He got the, what do you call that thing on a lock? The combination thing? He had that combination lock on the thing that the doctor gave to him, put it in the refrigerator. He got it out and then lost it. Oh my goodness. Now the good news, she finished telling me, the good news was she said when he found the bottle, it was empty. And this is my daughter and her husband talking to their son. I said, did you drink that? Why didn't you drink it? We have to pray right now. What are you doing? You're such an extreme person. This is my oldest daughter. Now honey, did you open this bottle? You know you weren't supposed to do it without mommy and daddy. And I can hear them. I can hear that part before I hung up. And then here comes your husband. Now son. I don't know. And I'm like, dear Lord in heaven, I'd have been shaking that kid upside down. I'd have been praying for him at the same time, but the kids are very calm until they have fun and they go wild. And so they call me back and say, we have to let you know everything's all fine. They said they could not believe they found traces of it in him, but we found most of it on his clothing. Gee. Wow. What a story too. I mean, that could have been probably, I mean, the reality is he's probably got people all over the United States and the earth that he's giving such tests to, or if that for lack of a better word, I don't know if test is the word or assignments, but I don't know. Did you consider that kind of like a test was God testing it was training, training. Okay. Training me. Okay. And so I didn't let the enemy stop me. And yet my grandson was perfectly fine. And that man got what he needed that day because he was flying from that place to one of the places that wherever God said to go to, we had three places picked out. And he was going to go to one of them from his answer. He got in food court. Yeah. That is so amazing. Yeah. I love it. Awesome. Awesome. All right. That was my life nonstop for three years. Well, no wonder you guys can trust you now, Kat. So, all right. So here's a question. Kobe asks, can people, I think this is a heaven question. Can people in the past, like in heaven do something like we do for instance, Kat mentioned she saw King David writing in his chariot in heaven. My question is, can King David, can David write in a convertible in heaven if he wants to? I think David can write in anything he wants to. He loves the chariot because it doesn't ride on the ground. It's flies in the air with chariot flies. Yeah. So, okay. So yeah, that was good. That was easy. All right. But Linda asked, when Jesus died and went into hell and took the keys from Satan and death, death, hell and the grave, why, there's a question, why didn't things revert back to the way they were before he was deceived by the serpent? So it's a why question, which God probably never answers, but why didn't he at that time, why didn't that change everything back? That's what, that's what her question is. That's not how it happens, people. He's not going to go back and change every little thing that you went through or things that you, choices you made and stuff like that. Now, there'll come a time in your life where, let's say, I don't know, you're upset about what you did or the choice you made, Adam certainly didn't make the best choice in the world, but I will tell you this, they are both in heaven, Adam and Eve are both in heaven. At one point, they did repent for doing that, or especially Adam repented for doing that, but he did make it into heaven, which is what you really want to make sure you do. But God, Jesus Christ did fix part of it, people. Then Adam gave away his authority to Satan, which is what he did in that garden, Satan said over what God had said, and that's when he remember after that that he couldn't see God. And remember people, he had to leave the garden because of what he did. Well, Jesus Christ redeemed the fact that Adam gave our rights away to rule and reign to have authority and power and be creators, Jesus Christ took that back. Yeah, when he went into hell and he took back the keys of hell, death and the grave, beat the devil to pieces, left him in the dirt and fire of hell, stripped every gemstone off of him, and even messed up the faces of the principalities and powers while he did that. That was his second part of the cross. The first part, of course, was to pay for the sins. He had to do that first when he died for our sins. Remember, he nailed to the cross all the wicked evil stuff. It's the only reason why Jesus Christ can cleanse you from your sins. But this other part of that, it was finished on the cross for that. But if he was totally finished, he'd have just gone back to heaven when he died on the cross. He didn't do that. He descended so he could have a face off with Satan to show him, you have no right to keep a righteous man in hell. You have no right over them. And then he showed him he didn't have any power over him by beating them and taking back the keys to hell, death and the grave. That didn't change everything in back. It didn't actually literally take you up to where Adam and Eve were and change that time. It changed our right as a believer to have authority over the enemy, which Christ made that perfectly known when he said, I give you power over all the power of the enemy. And then the rest of the scripture, he could say that because he got that right to do that. That's good. All right. So Jody's asked this question. How do our guardian angels interact with each other when we fight? Like if two, two believers are fighting, they each have guardian angels and they're fighting with each other. The people are, she's saying, what, what are the guardian angels doing? If you know, you mean fighting physically or say that I'm arguing with somebody that's a believer and we're just fighting about something. We're not doing good. The question is behind you, we're shaking their head. That's what they're doing. They're shaking their head. They're not saying stop it, cut it out. Oh, they'd be doing a lot more than that. They had their foot raised. How so? Well, their foot. Kick you in the butt. Oh, really? Really? I'm not kidding at all. I had a friends, close friends who did ministry really young. They were, they ministered in the like the, well, I think the early 80s, they're still ministering right now, but this is kind of at the end of the hippie era. And they would go out and they, boy, the mission field was ripe with harvest back then. And I worked on that side. I went on the side of the celebrating and the gugs and all that garbage. I was on the rescuer side, but I wasn't quite as, I wasn't quite as verbal back then. I would like help sew the carpets together in the, in the, I think a congressman or somebody gave us a, an old church and we would have music playing Jesus and give food and coffee to the, to the drug people so we could help them find Jesus. And that's what we were doing. And then they would minister out in the streets later. I'd stay there and help keep hot coffee, hot and stuff like that. But anyway, she was a seer. His wife is a seer. And they'd always, she'd see the angels going with them and they were there ministering and there was these two guys were having an argument, not her husband. So he walks up to them wants to start ministering to them, but he's not really pushing the fact. He's just trying to be polite. And she said all of a sudden she saw his angel with his foot raised. She wanted him, he wanted him, the angel wanted him to hurry up and get to business about Jesus Christ. So they stopped fighting and I'll never forget that you never did kick him. Okay. Because he finally was the angel saying something to him like, you got to talk about Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. And so finally he put his leg down, but I never forget when my friend told me that story that he was getting a little humor, he wanted to rush him along in his mission stuff. Well, yeah, you know, that, that my story about being knocked by an angel a couple of times to sit in the chair. I wasn't fighting with anybody, but I was just kind of probably being a little bit lazy in an afternoon. And he just got knocked me on the arm. Yeah. I felt this nice big knock. And then it happened again. I thought, what's going on is someone coming to the door and there's a crisis that I'm supposed to have heard and it was nothing. It was like, wait, that was your angel doing that for sure. That was your angel as a few years ago. So, all right. So Dee's asking this question, we got time for a few more questions. Dee's asked, what does it mean to seek the face of God? Scripture says seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his face. 1st Chronicles 16 20 and quote, when you said, seek my face, my heart said to you, your face thought I will see. So she's wondering now, what does that mean? Seek his face. That means that you're, you're, you are really focusing on really talking to him. Doesn't mean you have to see him face to face. You want to be near him. You want to know him in a greater depth is what you're saying to him. And when he said, yes, seek my face, that man, he was inviting them to pursue him, you know, in a greater way in the relationship. That's what that's about. That's what I was saying, just find him behind, just spend alone and just talk to him like he was right there next to you because I promise you, he probably is right next to you. Talk like he's there. And one day he'll probably just appear next to you and then you'll really get undone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Kara, let's see. I don't know. I haven't pre read this. I would like to know if we will be able to talk to the actual animals that were on Noah's Ark and hear their stories. Are those animals like the rock stars of the animal world, for example, to the other creature's point and say, look, that's Leo and Bernadette, the lions on the Ark with Noah. So let's go here. I wouldn't be surprised if they did. That's a very creative question. You know, I wouldn't have thought of that question, but wow. So they would be. I mean, they were the ones that were protected for all of animal, all of their animals. I'm quite sure that they have conversations with all the other creatures. I'm sure they do. Yeah. I'd love to know the whole thing. They probably want to hear the whole story from them, you know, give us your point of view. What happened? What did you think was going on? And actually a lot of people want to know that period, no matter who it is that was in the Bible, you know, if it was somebody for God or one of God's own creatures, everybody wants to talk to them when they get to heaven. Very cool. The funniest thing is they want to talk to you because you just arrived. What's been going on? You know, what's been going on? I'm talking about people who've been living there for 40, 50 years. Anything important going on? What can you say? Well, I was going to ask you that question one day, and I think it's set my mind. I wanted to know, do people want news from home when you arrive? They do. You sound like you're saying they do. Oh yeah. They love to hear. They know. They know something is going on, but they want to hear in their own, in their own person's life. What has been going on around you? What needs to be seen? What has God done? Wow. You can be pretty busy in heaven too, even just enjoying yourself, but there's other things to learn and do there, too, in heaven. But yeah, when somebody new arrives, they actually have big meetings, events set up, and it's not like you're going in a conference room. Don't go there. Most of it's outside, and you sit on all kinds of things to get relaxed and everything, and someone gets up there and tells their stories, and they're very animated, but something new has been added to their stories. It's what was going on in the spirit realm the whole entire time. They were doing things in the physical realm. So they have a new part of their story. Let's say they did miraculous things happen to them, or they got to do something miraculous for God, and people, all the attention was on that person. They haven't even got to tell the other side of the story, because you've already found that out on your way up to heaven. Okay. So by the time you got there, you now know the whole in the spirit side of things. Yeah, you know a lot of, especially important things, important or powerful things that happen. Yeah. You know, and you feel like, wow, I never saw this before, this is going to be awesome. So when people go, okay, tell us, tell us, you want to hear what's going on, they will tell that kind of a story is what God showed them. He was doing, when he couldn't see what they were doing, but what happened, it's really awesome. Do you have either, is there anything happening like when you're on your way to heaven or whatever, where your guardian angel is saying to you, what were you thinking when you did blah, blah, blah, is any of that going on? You know, I think they would be the only one. I think nobody else would say anything to them at all about it, but your guardian angel who was there all the time, I always tell people, they'd have questions. I always have said that, be careful how you treat and talk around your angel, they'll have questions for you. I'm not talking, we're not talking about sins, we're talking about maybe some decisions that weren't the smartest or the best thing they ever did, and their angel gets me with them. Okay, what was going on here? Yeah. Fascinating. Fascinating. Okay. Jamelia, Jamelia or Jamelia says, you have mentioned that summer, fall, winter, and spring are four of the Father's favorite seasons. Do you know what any other of the seasons are in heaven? Well, they're not seasons in heaven. What I actually said was God told me he took four of his favorite places in heaven. Okay, places. Yeah, there's too many new, I mean, I can't even, there's no way, thousands of places in heaven people, there's no way I can number that places. Yeah. But what he did when he made the earth, he decided to do something special that would be a little bit of heaven on the earth. And this is what he was telling me, and he said, when I went and I took four of my favorite places in heaven, I took a shadow of them and made them a season on the earth. Well, that's really good. That's really good. So there would be a place where there would be brightly colored fall leaves, I would think. The mountain of spices. Mountain of spices. Oh, really? Mountain of spices. And that became our fall. Is that what you're saying? Our fall. Yeah. Very cool. Okay. Christmas town would be our winter. I love that. I love that. The fall would be our spring. And the surf park would be our summer. The which part? The surf park. Okay. Oh, I love that. Those four places in heaven, which everyone loves to go to, and there's so many, there's so many other places. I know the names of a lot of them, but I probably have to include a lot of those in my third book. But I'm just saying, that's what he did, and I thought, what a wonderful, beautiful way it is. Give us a real piece of him. Now, people are going to say, but some of them are destructive. He didn't make them destructive people. Yeah. They're not destructive in heaven. Nobody burns to a cinder in the summertime. Nobody's going to get sunburn in the summertime. No one's going to freeze in the winter up there because, you know, and he even kind of proves it proves that there is a place where winter isn't heaven because the winter we have is only a shadow of that place in heaven that does exist. That's good. The mountain of spices where everybody loves to go for trail rides. The leaves are probably huge. The leaves are about this big. The leaves never fall off the trees. They're always those different colors, but there's some purples and other colors, you know, on the leaves and you ascend every level in the mountain of spices. You smell another aroma like it was Thanksgiving or like the things in pumpkin pie. Yeah, totally. Every level you go up, you go, oh, wow, this is amazing. You go to another level. The best part is when you get to the top of this mountain range, it's not the biggest mountain range in heaven, but it's one of the most beautiful. You look down into this valley that goes forever. It's called the Valley of the Falls. And in that valley, it is always like spring. Really? There's flowers so huge you dive off of the waterfalls. You dive up in heaven. You can do that. It's for fun and you dive inside of this massive flower that goes like eight people and you roll around this flower and then flop back out into the river and then you go back up and climb back up and jump again. Very cool. Flowers are everywhere in the Valley of the Falls. It's absolutely beautiful. On the spices smells like this. I'm one of those that loves that whole Thanksgiving cinnamon vanilla probably in there and what's the other one? There's another flavor. Cinnamon, vanilla. Yeah. Well, it's all run together and you smell it and you go, oh, it's that Thanksgiving in Rome. So is there any kind of like when you smell that in heaven, does it cause you in heaven to think of Thanksgiving because that's where you first smelled it? I'm just curious if you would have any reminiscent. I think probably my favorite thing out of the entire Thanksgiving would be the pumpkin pie. So when I think about pumpkin pie, that's Thanksgiving to me, of course, thanking God. Of course, that's number one. Right. Yes, but in heaven, you can have Thanksgiving all the time. No turkey is killed for it. Just so you know, no harm is called to any animal, human or spiritual, all the stuff is made. They just, it's just made. Okay. You'd say turkey and it'd be made, but nothing would die for you. Yeah. Yeah. You're not eating. They would not be very happy if you're trying to kill them. What do you think you're doing? I'm getting one feather from my body. Now, this is what a turkey would say to you in heaven, right? Just go on home to your home and, and, or, and just order it. Just order it. So my question back to the other one, let's say that the pumpkin pie, because pumpkin pie is one of my favorites too. It sounds like you and I are a lot of like, we're photographers, we like chocolate cake, we like pumpkin pie, we like the spices. If you're having pumpkin pie in heaven, would you feel reminiscent of the Thanksgiving on earth? Would it, would there be something in that that you would remember that? Yeah. The thing I would remember that would be my family gathered around the table, okay, praying and thanking God for our food. Okay. So you're eating that. Yeah. Okay. Cool. All right. I'm going to give the clock. We got time for one more. Well, I'll just, I'll just, Gary's asking this question. It's a general one. I don't know because you're always revelating, but he's saying, what is the latest thing the father's revealed to you about heaven that he wants to reveal to us? Is there anything that's been recent that you learned that? You may have to re-mention that because I was laughing at Jen, sorry people. Oh, well, Jen. Okay. Yeah. So Gary's asking, what's the latest thing the father has revealed to you about heaven that he wants to reveal now to us? Something new you mean? Yeah. Something new that you've seen. If there is something. There's so many. There's just so many. We'd have a list a long, mile long. Yeah. I'll just tell you probably one of the funnest things people get to do, and I know I mentioned it a little bit about it, but there's a place where you do learn to fly. Yeah. It is, it is like a fun thing to do, right? Yeah. I already told you all, well, this got me, some people saying, well, I don't like you anymore. It's okay if you don't like me. You don't have to let me. You don't have to let me. You don't really want to put like heaven. I will. I will. I'll be okay. I'm not sure why they got so I'll put like where they offended because they thought you should automatically know how to fly. Therefore it makes no sense. No one explained and teaches you how to do it. Steve. Oh, that's what it was. And they got it. And they made it happen. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't not wear just so you know, let's get this clear. He does not wear his superman costume. He does not do that. It's just Christopher Reed. It's Christopher Reeves who teaches you how to fly. Of course, God thought that would be quite fun. Yeah. Our God does have a sense of humor and it is funny watching people how to learn and all your friends come to watch you when you start because sometimes you twirl around. You don't do so well. You need some practice like anything else even in heaven. And so that I think to me is one of the most fun things I have shown when I was up there. I was quite blessed that it was Christopher Reeves though. I even went to contact his son to tell him. Yeah. And but that's what he does. That's what he does. It's called fly by. That's the name of it because God names everything. Every place in heaven has its own name. That's very cool. I like that. And so by the way, you mentioned Adam and Eve in heaven. Yeah. Is there anything that you've seen them do or they do they hang around together because they were husband and wife and and now they're not but they're best friends. They hang around together and everybody wants to meet them because they're Adam and Eve. Right. People go well there's no stars there. We're all stars. God said so. Okay. We're all stars in his hand. That's what we are. We all have light and everybody has their own specific thing. They were chosen by God and they did a really good job with it. I mean, even though they fell, you know, from where they were supposed to be with him. They still talked to not just their sons, but they taught a lot of the other people there about God himself. They talked about it a lot about him and how much they loved him and then what happened with them in the garden and everything. So people want to meet him because they actually are Adam and Eve and don't be too quick to judge. Okay. We all had something we went through somewhere in our life and and made it better, but they're very happy. They're very happy there to know God and to be there with him. They love him very much. And so people do want to meet them and talk to them about what happened. I do think in back to the father thinking of the laughter and we're talking about all of this stuff. One of the greatest revelations to me in this last few years that I've known you is that God loves to have fun and likes to laugh as a real dad to his kids. I mean, he's a judge too, but he's a dad, you know, and he's got dad like qualities that sounds like and he, he likes to laugh and do fun things with his kids. He does. And you know, my father was the greatest example to me as the father and my dad also knew the father and the son and Holy Spirit. I learned a lot from him personally because he has such a humble spirit and he loved everybody. He literally did love his enemies and you talk about the father all the time, but he had talked to the father. This is what the father had said to him about things and not, not, not like seeing him like I see him that way, but hear him very clearly. And I can tell you that he is your heavenly father. He is your real true father. It says that he is our father and we are his offspring in the Bible. It says that he carried us inside of him and then he timed your birth on the earth so he could send you and how did he send you? He sent you through the spirit because you know what, man can't make a spirit. They can't make a spirit or soul at the time of conception, whether it's the Holy Spirit or Holy Spirit, of course, whoever brings you brought you down at one time at the time of conception, brought you down in their hand, your little spiritual being and knit that together in the mother's womb at the time of conception, this would be together yet to touch your spirit to that. So that actually would be a real living human being. And so that's how he did that and he loved you and had been with you all that time. And he would dance with you inside of himself because he's God and he can do it. He'd sing over you. The Bible says that he'd show you some things to come. He wrote something on the on the will of your will, on your will, on the wall of your will when he put it inside of you. And he loved very much this moment right now and all fathers can forgive. They can train you. They can advise you. They can love you. They can play with you. He does all of that. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Karen, do you feel like just praying for the people real quick and as we close out just whatever you feel? Father, I thank you for this day today, God, that you have made and we will rejoice in it because we trust you. We know that you have your hand on all of this. You know everything that ever was is or will be and you know the perfect time to do something in this earth. You are not done yet with any of us. You still have great plans, great inventions, great revelations and great miraculous things to happen and I am excited. So thank you, Father, for drawing them all closer to you, open their hearing. Give them clarity that they can hear you. They can hear Jesus. They can hear Holy Spirit, Father, because you love us. You all love us. And I thank you for sending us here to this earth that we can be a light, you're a blinding light, but we're a light also in this darkness and I thank you for increasing that, increasing the sudden leaves, the help, the protection, the joy, the celebration right now that's in heaven is coming to this earth. Be a habitation of heaven to this earth is what we're looking for. The evil will be crushed down, pushed back for generations to come and we who are on the earth now that you have purpose will do these great things for you and with you and because of you. In Jesus name, amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now Kat, at revealingheaven.com below, I know that people can get their products there. I don't do demons. I, they give the cups and the different things. And then talk about Kat Kerr. What Kat Kerr.com, what can they get there? Oh, that is a spiritual platform that Father says whatever he wants to do. Right there. There's a gallery in it that shows you a lot of places in heaven, things in the spirit, what they look like. There's testimonies, I think, in there. There's interviews there. There's a lot of revelation that teaches you how to do things like pray for your family, loosens from your soul. It's a very powerful site. It's also the only site in the world that I have that you can give to me online if you want to. And I appreciate that very much and may God bless you totally, give you sudden leaves, hold you in his hand, that you feel his presence awake and while you sleep and may the host go with you. We can't, we love you, love your staff and everything and we'll, we will see you again very, very soon. A quick reminder that Nathan French will be on tomorrow. Same time tomorrow is Thursday. Just double checking. I have one little thing to say, go ahead and just get him, you know, this is Benjamin Netanyahu has won. Okay. He has won. He won. Yep. He's like his third time back, he's either third or fourth time when he's won this thing. So interesting. He was going to come back, God said he was going to put him back. So I expected that to happen. Just like I do. Another number 45 is going to come back people. That's good. And just to let you all know, I do have one meeting in December, December 20th at Elm Hunters in Tom Ball, Texas. Okay. Yeah. That's in the Houston area. Tom Ball, Texas with Joan Hunters Place. So that's December, what 15th through the 18th of December. Okay. Yeah. So they can just go to, I think it's johunter.com or something. Yeah. Or so you sign up for that. So I hope you'll go sign up for that right now. So thanks, Kat. God bless you. Thank you everybody. We will see you again tomorrow. Okay. Bye.

you know what to plan for so as you know in a few moments we will have cat Kerr here which by the way cat is knowing that we are going to talk about some things before the show before we bring her on where we give thoughts opinions little pieces of snippets of revelation she always chooses to go in the next room and shut off the sound or put music on or whatever which is very integrity based thing to do so she will not be she will not be listening while we're doing this briefing so when we bring her on and ask her what her thoughts are she's not going to say well about what you said or you know she's not going to because she's not going to know what we said right now so it's really good okay so cat will be on today in a few minutes this afternoon we're putting a special show together with Johnny Endo a new an extra Johnny Endo unfiltered he's got some good things in revelation and counsel and wisdom to give to us so that's two shows today one and two this one right now and the one at 2pm pacific 2pm pacific right am I saying that right yeah which is 5pm eastern sorry about that then Thursday tomorrow is Hank Kuhneman we haven't had him on for a long time he's a high level prophet and I'm really looking forward to what he would have for us today especially as it relates to the election and then Friday Cash Patel if he could believe he's a close personal friend and confidant part of true social he's been some people call him he's like he would be similar to the chief of staff when he was at the White House only he's kind of like the chief of staff for President Trump now in these days and then Monday after that is Johnny Endo unfiltered again so we're putting some really good stuff together to you for you to keep you encouraged and built up and educated and both knowledge and in revelation so we hope you're going to really enjoy that I know we're going to enjoy bringing it to you very much we need him we need to call for prayers for him this is actually two day old information it might even be three days because I think it might have been on the sixth that he went into the hospital with COVID and now this is on his own Facebook website so you can go to the Canadian Hammer on Facebook and read more about Barry Wynch but he by his own public admission refused the remdesivir that he refused to take that or have that given to him at the hospital and they showed him the door and I'm glad they did because it has a very very unhealthy history and in my opinion any doctors this is my opinion and no one else's some doctors are going to be reliable because they know that it's killing patients that's my opinion I'm saying it for Canada or any nation any hospital if you're giving remdesivir it's going to be proven to be a killer drug I'm allowed to give my opinion there's no someone can say we're practicing medicine I'm not I'm giving you my opinion it's a killer because doctors are reporting those things and researchers are so there you have it you heard it here but please keep Barry in prayer he was starting to recover just a little bit on the seventh so I think he'll probably we know God's with him but he needs some prayer alright we're going to go ahead and run a couple of quick things we're going to run the freshwater well so you'll see reminder how badly we need that support keep those wells going in every three days now we're

know the election stuff that we're talking about it's pretty intense and I asked the Lord what he was saying and and all of a sudden I'm going to bring up American Wars in just a minute by the way I think I reversed the order of this let's do American Wars let's do that because I'm going to mess up the order I need to kill Emily so let's let me let me read the comment I've got stacks of notes and I'm trying to get it all in the right order okay today's American Warriors Richard Harley shares his early career serving in Korea then in 1952 when the nuclear arms race was in full swing he and his crew witnessed the terrifying destructive power of new and powerful nuclear weapons as the nuclear threat seems to be reemerging today Richard gives his first-hand account of the devastating power he witnessed in less than a minute you will see the most powerful explosion ever witnessed by human eyes we were supposed to be 34 miles from ground zero well it turned out we were less than 25 we were that close to this thing and there was a 12 second interval from the time of detonation before you could look away in seconds it went from ground zero to 20,000 feet the crater that was put in the ocean was three miles by the time detonation came everybody was saying well this might be it wow well I do hope you'll watch that that premieres today on both the rumble and here's the channels if you have that Emily you may not have it uh we don't yeah there you go and rumble it's American Warriors 22 and on the YouTube it's American Warriors 22 the same thing but either of those places you can watch American Warriors hopefully you'll enjoy that we put a lot of work into putting these together to honor our servicemen and women so alright this morning I got up and was talking to the Lord about what was going on with the elections and all that and I just said what do you have to say what do you want to say and these words came flooding into me in a very very clear way not just give thanks to the Lord but the part that says oh give thanks to the Lord and so I looked that up in Psalms 136 and it says give thanks to the Lord for he is good and his mercy endures forever I'm going to have you Emily I had asked you to pull up a few scriptures where he talked it says by the way in this passage for his mercy endures forever 26 times in this section it says over and over and over his mercy endures forever 26 times if I counted correctly and pull up the next scriptures it talks about where he takes kings down let's see what else you have for us Emily I don't know if you've got those ready for me or not oh there also yeah go back to that one sorry about that those are so seamless that I didn't see them probably to him who struck Egypt in their firstborn in their firstborn for his mercy endures forever what's next but over through Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea for his mercy endures forever to him who struck down great kings for his mercy endures forever this is what the Lord told me to read today and I don't remember which is and slew famous kings for his mercy endures forever and rescued us from our enemies for his mercy endures forever so thank you so much for that Emily I appreciate it one day I'm going to bring Emily on here and introduce you but we won't take the time today that was very very meaningful to me for to me today and for you because this is what God's saying at this hour some things some good news some not as good news and so some people are a little bit nervous about what's going on and we're going to talk about that today but let's pray and medic put something on his website and I asked him to pull that up for us so let's see if that's the next thing here's what he says if you're feeling angry it's understandable it's hard watching another election be stolen now I don't know that the whole election stolen but a lot of it is still stolen because things that we've seen but so he said consider this yesterday there was a red wave yesterday there was a red wave Patriots did their part and voted in historic numbers even some Democrats voted for conservatives we all knew there would be cheating but this time people were watching and recording it all so that's very very good news so now here's a word by a prophetic voice that I trust very Heidi and many of you would know I'm going to say it's a she but you know like we use the name male K for one of our guests we use praying medic often the way you just saw that and she's going by firehawk because firehawks literally spread fires so we're going to cover up her name for now in a few months I'll be able to tell you who she is and why we needed to keep her name out of it for now but I trust this word of the Lord so let me just read that from firehawk so he's calling it the great comeback this morning as I was in prayer bringing the elections before the Lord I heard the Lord say you never expected this I really didn't understand what the Lord meant until I started to read the word and my eyes landed on this verse then Jacob said to Joseph I never expected to see your face again and now God has allowed me to see your descendants as well Genesis 4811 Jacob thought his son Joseph had died long ago and his days were over he did not expect to ever see him again but now through God's sovereign power Jacob was allowed to see Joseph and his children and be with them for all the years to come for years to come so I heard the Lord say many of my people are not expecting to see what's about to happen Jacob never expected to see Joseph again but he didn't only see Joseph he also saw his children many are not expecting to see the face of Trump again but God says get ready for you will not only see his face but also the face of his children and of those who are behind him do not fear or be shaken for I am working in the background to cover America with my blood so I heard the voice of evangelist Reinhard Bonke when he used to declare words concerning a blood washed Africa this time the voice of the Lord declared the coming blood washed America get ready for a great comeback many are to see but I am at work the reality is that I have ordered victory and that's brought to us by firehawk so that's awesome I want to show you this a word that had come in 2019 that was the day of prophet Charlie Shemp I don't think we got the actual transcription but pull that report that's the report based on that word she didn't fail and she wasn't fired but she will be the next Arkansas governor and you see the date up there that's not yesterday or a couple of months ago that was three years ago in 2019 three and a half years ago almost prophet Charlie Shemp said and let you be encouraged by that then we got one other clip by Greg Phillips who was on our show again the other day just got out of jail and here's what he's saying this was well it was 22 minutes ago a short time ago so I don't know exactly how old this is at the second but he says now that we have some clarity around the manning numbers in Arizona we are growing increasingly optimistic about the remaining races few scenarios exist where Kerry doesn't win by substantial margin by 5000 votes and that's Kerry Lake reported by Greg Phillips of course he's a he's a statistician with regarding votes so things are looking really good so alright I think we got all the pieces I think I did all my part and now Kat has been kept out of the room which is good and now they just told me that they brought her in so let's go to Steve and Kat on Wednesday here we go. Good morning Kat. Good morning. Good to see you. Smiles and all now I we've kept you out of the room or you've kept yourself out of the room so we're not going to talk about anything we have talked about this is like we're going to put a fence around this and this you and I are just going to talk about whatever you have to give so let me just start by asking did you get I would normally tell a person that's interested in this did you get my sleep last night but you don't sleep during the night right not really I sleep in the daytime yeah so overnight literally you're up all night right the entire night I am up I go to bed at 7am that answers your questions 7am before the sun comes up Wow that's me so now you and I have not talked about I have no idea what you're going to say or report I don't know what you know in the natural either so I'm going to turn it over to you Kat and see what you got well first of all I'd like to remind the people that God is God and there's no one above him and no matter what you see with your eyes or hear with your ears or are told to somebody's mouth what is actually happening or what is going to happen if it's bad that is not what God is saying you have to understand I know you I know he's mysterious I know he's powerful I know he holds the air I breathe in your air if you're a bullet well he holds everybody there just so you know that you came from him there was no other place for you to come from I'm not going to go into that any more detail than that you have to understand he had plans for you while you were in him and at one point in your life made that known to you well a lot of the wicked decided they didn't want nothing to do with him so they went into the darkness and those who are in the darkness now are still in the darkness you need to understand that you have to know the evil doesn't change but neither does God you can't just point to evil and say it's gotten darker it's gotten worse you know it's going to take all over us and yet you know what God has said already no justice is coming in the greatest detail and amount ever before on the earth now that is very significant more justice will be given than at any other time on the face of the search you're living on right now that's where justice will happen and the father is a very detailed person in every way he already got his list made he already knows who's done what people no one's hidden anything from him but he has his plans because these days you're breathing in right now are the forerunner to what is about to overwhelm this entire earth and what is about to overwhelm the earth does not include evil this is from him right now from this throne it does not include evil people so what does that mean it's going to happen this is from the throne what he's about to do on this earth for generations to come does not include the evil that means it will be removed it will be dealt with justice will be given many people will be gone from the earth completely they won't be here anymore let me take a drink please yeah well and when you say evil but let me just ask a question that to clarify as you go like I don't you talk we're talking about coming into the kingdom age and I'm thinking okay so there's a few bright spots on the earth and dark or is it mainly light on the earth with a few dark what do you mean it will be gone or all the present evil that is operating in hidden places trying to control the world I hope that clarifies it like that you like the globalist the elite all of those one world is that I'm just going to say it people whoever's been cheating stealing lying deceiving I'll just make a list for you those who wanted to bring fear want control it's the only thing they know hell only knows control the only language they speak is profanity the only plan they have is to kill steal and destroy that's their plan it has always been hell's plan so whatever you do don't yourself go into a hole with hell and hell's thinking serious you need to be rejoicing right now if you believe what God has said okay God doesn't go by numbers he doesn't go by man's plans he doesn't go by hell's operations he doesn't go by their activities he doesn't go by any of that he's on his throne knowing knowing knowing knowing what is about to happen and what you saw yesterday was not it see that last sentence again we saw yesterday which I talked to nobody about what you saw happen yesterday is not it's not it's not that it is not his final plan to fix everything and actually I've been telling you for two weeks don't look at elections to change everything yeah and I was serious when I said that that was God saying that don't look at the elections to change everything something is going to happen some way some things will happen there's always going to be spots of sunshine and joy in the mess in the midst of the mess that the Holy Spirit said a mess that they're about to get cleaned up that's what I have to say but I can tell you right now there is no one on this earth in this earth over this earth that can say against what God wants no one or nothing and stop him from what he is about to do with the glory being sent into the earth baptism in fire which is going to be happening us the manifested sons and daughters speaking to the land the sea and the air and it obeying because it has been in travail for us to stand up and start doing it you can't do any kind of a great campaign this is called a campaign not like a political campaign like a military campaign there's been out and about a lot of patrons use this repeated phrase over and over for a couple years now they'll say nothing can stop what's coming when you say nothing can stop what's coming that may have something to do with the election but you're saying it from the standpoint of God or I'm going to ask the question are you saying nothing can stop what God's going to do now stop God from doing what he is going to do next so you had that perfectly clear yes he uses mankind I know that he has put people in place some of them and the ones who are operating and where he put them to do what he asked them to do those of course are always a part of what he does but as far as the overall thing it's not going to stop what God wants these are God's days of glory they are not Satan's days of let's take over the earth I hope that clarifies that to you these are not from the throne these are not the perilous times these are not the tribulation these are not the end what he is going to end is what you have been living in for the last couple years and it will end completely I saw a word today Kat again it's not a prophet per se or anything but there was someone that wrote what he thought had gone wrong which I didn't say openly but there are a lot of people that say that we are yet to have both the house of representatives it looks like we still got it and maybe 50-50 on the Senate but what was I going to ask is why do I want to ask this I'll pull it back when it comes to me but maybe I wasn't supposed to ask it anyway but go ahead if I pull it back I'll ask you again I'm not saying that they won't help change some things because we have great people standing in positions right now that people have clearly shown and I didn't have to ask anybody clearly shown we don't want what they have been addition to us we don't want it true American people do not want what they are trying to shove on us and they are fed up with it and I will tell you this when I went to vote yesterday the line was out the door and stayed out the door the whole time I was there out the door and down the corner of the street and every one of those people were saying these words as I walked past them some knew me some did not know me and they said I'm here so my child can have a future and I'm here someone else said I'm here so my children and my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren will have a future these were even young people saying this and some of them had their babies with them they said I will not let my baby grow up in this world the way it is now so I'm here to vote to make it change that was very clearly what they were saying they were all voting for justice to be given I think what I was going to ask is in 2020 of course everybody in the prophetic the one question is how long even David cried out how long we have gone for two years fighting for the 2020 and now 2022 is just happening and I think some people are like nail biters are going are we going to have to fight for this for two more years do you have any sense that I know God may not give you timing on this but what thoughts do you have I do know this and people may not like me saying it but you all need to understand that number 45 does not have to run to get his seat back right that is correct well that is what God is saying okay he does not have to run to get his seat back it is a big answer for everyone listen very clearly because that is a very big answer right there it is a big answer nobody has to run to get what was theirs all along and there is no way they can keep that whole thing from 2020 from being revealed that is very clearly will be revealed and not just from the people of the right or whatever you want to call us whatever you want to call us the ones who want justice, liberty and freedom of America, patriots, Christians, patriots because I can tell you right now the other side is going to know it all they are going to know it they are going to know what they just did they are going to know it it will have to be announced from that side that is pretty good because that side which we call the left won't announce anything that will make them look better what you are saying is they are going to have no choice this is from the throne and I am not just saying it from me I am a mouthpiece and no one can stop that from being said or known either people are still saying it everywhere but it is not the point the matters is this it will have to be announced from those who have been hiding, lying and stealing all along they the new the new will have to publicly announce who won the 2020 elections and who really belongs in that seat the father who promised that will happen he has promised he has never stopped saying it to me since November 4th 2020 this is what they will do and they won't want to do it but they will have to do it I hope that gives you some joy today I want to make sure you give us anything else you have but I have questions I left it on the printer over there Emily can put you on full screen I will get that off the printer I want everyone to know out there I have faced everything you have even though I am heaven's revelator I do go there all the time I believe there is a God on that throne who carried you inside of himself, made plans, wrote it in a book all the things he had planned for you, everyone out there you made a choice somewhere in your life especially the wicked and that side over there they made a choice in their life to pretend there wasn't a God because deep inside every human being knows there is, he put it in them they are still saying they don't believe it trust me they are going to be believing it soon who are they facing when they die I would like to add that but my children are being taught to prepare for what God is preparing they are not ignorant to all this they are innocent of any of the garbage in the junk they don't hold anything in their soul that brings torment or sorrow or fear they don't keep any of that in their soul the devil gets that for free fear is one of the greatest things he operates in and most of the time it is unfounded I know this thing is going on and things you don't like and things have changed drastically in the last couple of years you know what changing them will be God's greatest pleasure but my kids and my grandkids who are still young are preparing for this great thing of God knowing all the other stuff around them but they know God they believe him they believe his word the most powerful thing you can say if you can't even say anything out say what his word says about him that terrifies demons it shakes hell itself it causes earthquakes in hell when you start talking about the most high God who you serve and you will not serve another that line right there is hated all over in hell this world by the wicked they don't want you saying those words it releases something in the atmosphere but my kids and my grandkids are doing that right now they are making plans for their futures with God on this earth they know what he is going to be doing they are excited about that they do not agree with the evil they will not partner with the evil they will not tolerate evil in them and even though you can't go take something physically away from somebody what you are saying in the spirit around matters very much even to your own soul so start preparing for what God is saying is coming this is an accelerated time so things are about to be accelerated I will just say that and Kat you talked about you don't live in fear at all but also what you are just saying one of the scriptures behind that is life and death is in the power of the tongue I mean you are saying no matter how disconcerting things might look to you at any day or even problems in your own family you are saying don't put voice to it kind of or how would you describe because some people say like some people will actually maybe even need to see a pastor or Christian counselor they do need to share their feelings how would you describe maybe that would be a good opening question for today is we get it that life and death is in the power of the tongue but how do you live a real life without having to sometimes spill your guts or something I mean I don't know I've never heard you spill your guts okay when the first time it comes whether something I say to my face or you know it's out there while you are out there somewhere I don't watch regular news at all I watch the other places if I want to watch something but only if God tells me to it's not like I'm telling you not to listen to nothing I'm not that ignorant okay you got to know some things that are going on in your area especially things like that but make sure if they say something against what God has said I don't want to say these words I know if I those words oh really you'll just say that to the person I know if I those words I say what God said I will say what God has said this is all going to change these are days of greater glory these are days of baptism in fire this is the time for us to manifest his power and presence all over the earth I say that it literally will wipe out anything that was in my soul that might bring fear your soul with your mind what you think your will what you choose and your emotions is what you display so if you're being afraid make sure you say I choose to kick out and lose from my soul all fear all fearful statements negative things all harmful things are crushing demeaning things I lose them from my soul all the things that are lies I will not take that in my soul I will take God's words in my soul your soul will think differently you will feel differently therefore I feel differently I'm not keeping any of the world's lies and stuff that they want to do or even their plans I don't keep it in me I mean think in his heart or soul so is he there's your answer so what are you thinking about thinking about what God has said what God's plans are are you thinking about all the lies that have been spilled out over there that's good you know we're on a good roll right now before I get to the next question someone wrote to me about this and I wrote to them what I felt was a correct answer and they said Steve I didn't know the person they said am I correct are you understanding that Kat says she doesn't sin and you know you know the question you know it's been thrown at you a different time paraphrasing what I said is I said I dear whatever his name is you are largely correct Kat does not choose to sin and then I went on to describe it but then there was another part where I said however Kat does say that there's a type of judgment in the future that will be accountable for all words that were what was that scripture where you were accountable for wasteful words and I said so Kat is saying that is not a sin even though you will have to account for it how does that not a sin because I've always thought man that's what's a wasteful word Kat wasteful word is something that's not needed anywhere like I heard your aunt went out and ran around with somebody okay so it's an accusation there was no proof that had nothing to do how did that empower anybody like I hear there's going to be a big takeover and they're waiting to come to bring the guns and take us all the way to Jerusalem that's definitely wasteful okay because all you have done what did you plant in the soul of that person you were speaking to whatever cannot be used which is either ridiculous stuff unfounded stuff that is wasteful to God because when we speak it says always be ready to have an answer for the answer you think he means but Kat if I did that and I said well you know I heard you running and that was wasteful if the spirit convicted me on it wouldn't I say Lord forgive me for that I would say that as if I had just sinned wouldn't I you can always ask for forgiveness even if you do something it's not the right or the best thing to do I'm sorry I said that I think I was raised with the thought that every single thing I did that was not of faith is sin where there is a scripture that says that I don't want to pick on any words but it's believing in faith for something and when you say just the opposite of what you were believing for that would be different just saying things that are like dumb crazy things that don't really mean anything to anybody those things are wasteful but wasteful and I'll tell you why you'll give an account for every wasteful word you're spoken in that's in heaven you wouldn't be in heaven if you had sin you don't go to heaven with sin people so you're not going to the judgment seat of Christ is not about sins you committed mean account for every wasteful word you spoke that is not that's not sins you wouldn't be in heaven okay so those are other things that you know you could probably do more for God or greater for God or be greater and you chose instead to be not wise so that might hurt somebody it might cause them to be afraid it might cause them to be sorrowful those would be wasteful things but sin is very direct sin is when you are unrighteous okay when you have stepped out of being righteous into unrighteous that is sin we need to live right to sleep because we represent him correct sin you go let's just say okay you just go sleep around you do things that are wrong you murder people profanity is not a good thing that's more than wasteful words profanity is what hell speaks you don't want to be speaking what hell saying so please let go of the profanity people you're not impressing anybody in heaven you're probably not impressing any of your friends around you maybe some demons you might impress them but profanity is literally what they speak in hell that's their language that didn't come from heaven at all it was not something God speaks against profanity and pro being profane living sin free should be very clear what sin is something that takes you out of the hand of God and you on purpose put yourself in the hand of Satan and if you if you said wasteful words to re hit that point again it probably is a good idea probably cathartic or whatever to say the Lord I think this is what cat talked about that those were wasteful words kind of I ask you to forgive me that's that's okay right even though he may not have he might not have always to say please forgive me I shouldn't have done that it's always good to do that right sometimes I'll say maybe I said something every now and then I'll say just say something yeah yeah every now and then if I get upset I'll say something though you know I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that father don't write it down good no I'm not clear about it I'm not clear about it you said don't even write it now it's not profanity or anything yeah something that wouldn't be in me to do or say I have a feeling that's why some people have had I don't get a bunch of letters about this but this guy did it's not real common to be challenged on this with you but that's probably why some people say well of course everybody makes mistakes a wasteful word is a mistake at least and so they're thinking that you're saying I've never made a mistake or I don't make mistakes that's not what you're saying well no I don't make most mistakes that other people make my whole life I walk in the spirit the reason I walk in the spirit is because I will not fulfill the desires of your flesh and your flesh is the one that wants to strike out and say I don't strike out on purpose to hurt people it would be even something you wouldn't even think there was nothing wrong with it as a public testimony not that you asked for this but I've known you for it I think it's right at ten years inclusive of the you can ask my mama people she lives with me I've never heard you say one word against anybody in these ten years so as a public testimony not that you just asked for this I've never heard you say one word against anybody you will talk about for instance one time when we were first getting to know each other you said there was a bible that they made and I asked for the name of it that they made and they had taken all the hard verses out and you were speaking against that bible well that's a teaching that's a wise word that wasn't speaking against a person I think anybody that has read the word of God and you notice there's whole chapters being taken up that are in a regular bible I would not keep that bible I have to be honest with you I'm not talking about Old Testament New Testament I'm talking about if you have the Holy Bible that has Old Testament New Testament you go looking and they've taken scriptures out completely possibly the millennial Christ might be one of them they have taken out wow they don't think that's going to happen I'm serious about this so make sure you read your bible well okay because you don't want anything left out that is against God well and if you someone has that I said I had a relative and I named the type of relative and I just said she told me never years ago we don't believe in hell anymore and I'm thinking so you've got a bible that teaches you what to believe and it teaches that but you don't believe in that it doesn't make any sense to me why would you not believe something that's there that's crazy I don't understand why people I know some people's excuses literally people some of the people have written some of the newer versions well people just didn't understand it so this was their answer I thought I would just change it and I would be very careful about what you do you want to by any chance name that I don't know if you remember the name of the bible you told me that I have a little list somewhere yeah yeah I mean I'd actually I have to tell you which ones I read yeah yeah okay there was one and yes people I do still have the king games don't go there yeah the king games bible is one of the few bibles that are not afraid to take up the words unicorn when they really do mention nine times in the bible but there's some bibles you buy now they're called a rhino I don't think the father's happy with that he has a unicorn why not it's him he makes them does have them in heaven and people other people have seen them in heaven but the bible the normal bible mentions at nine times about the father's about the unicorn the strength of his horn the strength of his body it talks about it in the bible and some people that well I don't like that I don't think that's real well let me ask you can we talk about and change it to an ox or a rhino yeah let me ask this as you brought up the unicorn and now I understand about the unicorn but here's where we got tripped up years ago and our oldest daughter's now been married 10 years but when she was she was the oldest of two at the time and she was like five or six and we would have our watch these things I think was called rainbow bright and they had these unicorns but it was all this magic and stuff and she was getting scared and frightened and we if we came around the corner she was cream of blood curving scream because and we realized that we had to tell her to we would not allow her to watch this rainbow bright anymore in the unicorn it wasn't that unicorns don't exist in heaven because they do but they had taken that and made it magic and sorcery and stuff like that what are your thoughts about that this is for the people I have nothing to do with magic people yeah that is look it up it's the dark arts the black arts you know how they were introduced into the earth they were introduced in the earth by the watch angels that fell and created offspring those guys those guys literally introduced because sometimes my natural doesn't work as well as the spirit to one human sacrifice oh human sacrifice okay was all introduced in the service by the by those ones the ones that fell right and they wanted to be worshiped at the end by being worshiped as gods on the earth that's what happened they introduced human sacrifice they introduced the dark arts which is magic and they try to they try to pretty it up and they try to make it look special I don't like that word a true mystic by the way has also been distorted in the ancient passages of the word a true mystic was one who had a face to face encounter with a living god so there's mystical beautiful things in heaven that are shown to you and you get to see and enjoy in heaven there is no magic in heaven none no sorcerer I'm just going to say no witch no sorcerer okay what are the other ones well you know or you're not going to have a magic unicorn you're not going to have a magic unicorn that does I don't know what they did because I'm speaking out of school but I mean I don't know if you did spell they did take a lot of cartoons and they were absolutely defiled yeah yeah do not let pokemon in your home do not the earth behind pokemon is warring warring go and see what those things do that they're called pocket monsters I know what they're called and they they show them each other to war so what they do is bring violent spirits in your home and I had a good eye opener about that I was on a plane somewhere one time and I was traveling and I got put in the back wasn't a big plane and across from me were two children coloring books that were pokemon the father was sitting almost on top of a third child because they were screaming about how much they hated them and how violent they were going to be and the mom was in the back seat doing nothing and I'm like can I lay my hand on that how can I lay my hand on the kids head and cast that devil out of there and God said this is what happens when you allow that spirit in your home and they actually were coloring and coloring books the other kids they were probably like seven eight yellow one was maybe four who was screaming how much he hated his parents that was violent people that God said this spirit of violence is what you're letting in not to do it what about the older crowd that plays an older game densions and dragons same thing we knew people who did that actually I won't tell you what they ended up by doing to their mom to their mom yeah so there's so in other words this is a no no game that is a no game I think the the biggest no game would be a Ouija board okay yeah you do actually not that I want to empower people to want to go and do it and I'm not telling you to go and do it you will actually open portals to hell if you use that form you know my mother who was straight lays all the way about after I was growing and married she admitted to me one day that when she was a little girl she played with Ouija board and I thought are you kidding I think she only did it once but I broke that off of my family line and all that some of you may not that long ago I told like I was like 30 years ago I'm in a toys I was looking for stuff for my kids those little boy 10 years old excuse me sir I'm just walking through the store can you this Ouija board can you tell me is this bad you know and I said yes it's very bad don't get that he's okay thank you sir you know so that was I just got used me to rescue him from you know rescue him yeah so who knows maybe I'll meet him in heaven yeah I'm not saying any of these things because I think I want somebody to fail or something I'm saying I have to speak the truth people yeah and the truth is there is darkness and there is light there's evil and there's God there's only two things there is no third thing out there to choose you cannot become ignorant and say I'm just not going to do any of it because then the enemy will try to target you if you're not you need to be strong in God you need to receive Jesus Christ as your savior number one number one always always receive him as your savior repent of your sins and the Bible says even the Bible says that you know that if you repent of your sins this is Christ he is faithful and just to forgive you of that sin and cleanse you from what all unrighteousness right so if you want to know what sin is it's unrighteous what you do you're righteous you want to be righteous that means you're right with God when you sin you're unrighteous there's no there's no way around that and I know there's churches at Chichi you can sin all you want to because the blood covered it you know it covered it at your time of salvation if you sin after that you have to repent because God's not allowing people to come up there filled with sin your soul goes with you to heaven people your soul does not sleep in your flesh body your body dies it sleeps because he's going to resurrect it one day but your soul and your spirit they're together will go live in heaven if you're righteous and one day the dead in Christ shall rise that's your dead body it'll rise up your spirit and soul will be put back in that thing and you'll be glorified forever you will live in the glory forever that's what that means you'll never sin after that you'll never sin again or nothing but righteous is being right with God when you sin you go to terrible shows that do Satan stuff you go to terrible movies that do Satan stuff those are sins you can't fill yourself with evil and think that's not sin because what it does is it takes away from the God in you the goodness in you and what happens is you're white as wool that means on the inside the blood when it washes you you're white when you go on the sin you get a little bit of darkness in you and there's gray that's exactly what happens the more darkness you get the more it pushes the light out so that's why it's important to not fill yourself with things that are evil or wicked and I have to say Kat that I you know again these 10 years that I've known you and I've pondered this whole thing where you're saying I don't want I don't go around sinning or I don't sin if I look back to my life and all the different seasons especially there were darker seasons where I was being sloppy if I really look at my life pretty much every sin I chose to do I mean every time I really I did something wrong I knew it was wrong right so it's not like we have problems knowing if something is wrong what do you do with the scripture that says little children I pray that you sin now but if you do sin you have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ how does that apply because he says but if we do is that in other words because we are who we are no Kat I think you would admit that most people walking the earth have not reached kind of where you're walking where you don't sin isn't that probably true they haven't gotten to that I think there's people more than people know that are here in the earth because he literally says in the Bible it literally says be holy as unholy it says that and I'm going to show you another place in the word where it is possible to get to a sin free life I mean Jesus didn't do this so he could all the time just be forgiving forgive him he does he does do that but he wants you to get beyond that how do you ever expect to rule and reign which is your right as a believer you should have a crown on your head right now to rule and spirit realm but you can't sin and do that because you can't mix holy and the devil and think the devil if you take authority over the devil do you think it's going to listen to you if you've been playing with them if you've been in this camp playing and over here you're saying well I'm a strong believer and I live by the word and I've received Jesus Christ as my Savior my sins have been washed away that terrifies hell that does it terrifies it but if you start playing in their stuff then they know they can hook you because they have the right to come after you yes to their stuff there's a reason why he says to live righteously but if the word says be holy and see it's holy that means you can get to that place guess what it's a desire of your soul well you're just saying God would never instruct you to do something that you could never do he wouldn't say be holy if it was impossible to be holy why he wouldn't waste his words and I need to show you another scripture why it's important to make sure you've received Christ okay when the rapture does happen it says he's coming for a church that's the body of Christ without spots that is sin without wrinkles that's your flesh trying to take over okay there you go there's somebody who is living holy you're living holy you have no sin your flesh isn't you're just rolling over everything that God has said to you so you can get there or he would not have put that in there that were coming back for those who have no sin and they're walking in the spirit you're not fulfilling every desire your flesh has usually your flesh wants what God does it usually your flesh does so it shows you right there you can get to that place yeah and I mean you would be transparent to say that it's a journey right in other words I first heard about this on his cruise and you're talking on the cruise you didn't expect people to walk off the ship and from that point on I never sinned again you knew they would be on a journey to get to this place is that fair to say yes it is fair to say because when you hear the truth and you're so really your spirit man as a believer your spirit man craves revelation craves revelation that revelation is pure it's holy it comes from the father himself and when he is revealing himself to you if you love Christ you're going to love what he has said and but I can tell you I know for sure that that there are people in the earth on purpose not sinning and this is a thing that I'm passionate about the father being known Jesus being known Holy Spirit being known if I am all the time being taken to that holy amazing beautiful place called heaven why would I want to settle for the role of hell why would I want to do anything for them I don't market them I don't participate and I definitely don't tolerate hell in my life I don't tolerate sin sin why would I want that if I choose this I'm choosing what the devil wants all right Kat are you ready for the first question the first question we've been having fun with this okay Tanya can you tell me more about the song of songs and what it tells us about Yeshua being our bridegroom of course a lot of people don't understand because you said even Jesus would I think you said once dance with people even in the spirit or take you to heaven and dance with you but how can that be when the romance of any kind is not that kind of love is not in heaven romance isn't in heaven right so I think you're looking at a different version of romance people so there's a different romance there's a totally different the spiritual romance is totally different spiritual romance it's not craved the coming together of flesh people that's not the ultimate goal for that that's you being one in the spirit literally literally just so you know that act that husband and wife do that's the only symbolic of Christ in the church why because in heaven you actually as spirits can go inside each other that's not a different kind of an act that's in the Lord or us in our fellow friends in heaven now we're talking about us in the Lord when Jesus said to his father you and me and me and you that's what he's talking about you cannot be any more closer together people than spiritually being together it's not like that act it's not performing that physical act that desire that your flesh has your spirit man desires things entirely different than the flesh does and when you get your flesh back one day it's going to be glorified it won't desire that stuff and I know you think it will for us so we're not going to ever think that because we will be one together we'll be one together we'll be able to step into the Father Jesus step into the Father Holy Spirit step into the Father and we'll be one just like the Trinity we aren't the Trinity I got to make everything clear to people because the crazy ones take it everywhere okay I'm literally talking about a spiritual existence in heaven Christ will step inside of you turn around look out through your eyes and you will you will love everybody I was going to ask you about the loving everybody I've never asked this before but isn't it true I'm assuming that when I get to heaven no matter what someone was like or looked like or had handicapped don't we see all the children as beautiful all the women as beautiful all the men as handsome wouldn't that be a thing that everybody was attractive but not lustfully or sexually or anything like that there's none of that but wouldn't we see all of the above as handsome or beautiful wouldn't that be always true or do you think everybody looks good and you tell people man you look so good okay you would but by the way there are no handicapped people in heaven well I know I'm saying those that had been yeah yeah oh you congratulate them you look great you look amazing look at you you you you're all you you're so everything you say inspires people and it makes them happy but there's no darkness right it's like the movies they have in heaven there's no evil in it they don't have to have our ratings or X ratings in heaven none of that stuff is shown anywhere it's not produced it's not made it's not wanted it's not desired there's none of it there okay you're in heaven this is a holy atmosphere an amazing exciting adventurous powerful atmosphere to live in but everybody wants the best for everybody even if it was somebody that at one time with your enemy under you will still care about them in heaven so there's a oneness that happens where Jesus is inside of you which you described many times and you're inside of the father inside of the G there's a oneness that is a wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful it is the highest level of being one in existence wow it's a spiritual joining it's a spirit it's not your flesh body very good very good all right Esther's asking this cat how do guardian angels process the evil they see here on earth and I'm guessing our guardian angels that say I'm looking at my younger life and I'm in the middle of doing stuff that I know is a sin what's my guardian angel doing I'm just adding to her question what are they doing shaking his head and say what are you doing stop this shaking his head he may be saying something to you and you think it's yourself saying it he might be saying get out of here now right what you would hear is I need to get out of here right now I need to stop this I need to just go that would be your angel saying that okay good they have the right to do that they have the right to do that they're not physically dragging you away although I think of some of them could they would want to yeah yeah okay good that's pretty clear Jim is asking this when we send our host to take down strongholds over a person what do the host actually do and what kind of freedom does the person experience is it temporary for a day and then we pray each day for the same thing okay that's his question I would say that the greatest prayer you can pray is that they know the truth and then that they're free always that's first but if you want to do something to begin to start them on the path where they can even hear God some of them are so messed up that can't even hear him and I would definitely pray for clarity for freedom from that thing you may send the host to put a stronghold is something like demonic forces coming against a person to either pull them out of the light or pull them into what's wrong or maybe even pull them into something else other than that that would hurt or harm them you totally can send the host to pull down those strongholds especially if it's a family member or someone who's known a long time or friend or somebody like that they even have groups of people who get together just to do that to send the host to do these they have strategic warfare and they actually have lists made and they meet together and their host come and they send them together on these assignments so you can be that you can totally send them to universities where your teenagers are going to pull down the strongholds of lies to open the eyes of them who are attending there or you can actually pray that the professor be shown the truth face to face with the truth and make a decision to stop deceiving there's all kinds of things you we just need to have one meeting where we do nothing but strategic give people strategic plans I was going to ask that because Kat you're up all night I assume you send hosts every single night but when you when you do that I know at least sometimes you're outside maybe all the time but do you have a list with you or do you just go by the spirit and see what God's going to tell you to send I have my list in here so you're in and it says do you does it ever occur to you sometime during the day you know when I send the host tonight I'm going to do this and this to these people do you kind of pre-plan any of that in your head or is it all in the moment no I think about a lot of the things that have to be done or things that people will tell me about or ask for if they send me a card anybody who sends me I guess those who on a continual basis probably contact me connect with me I will lay hands on the cards and some say father whatever they need if this is you will give it to them or I'll say father you know those who bless me I do pray for your finances I best not to get you to give me any money I'm just saying I do pray over those those who pray for me those who care those who want to see things change those who know of something going on somewhere I'm not saying tell me everybody send I'm talking about in a government in another country have people send me things this is going on in this government can you please make a declaration can you send the host and usually what I'll do is say you need to send the host if you're a believer you can send the host you can command the host because the greater you have a greater not chance because you have a greater opportunity if you're there present where this is going on and then you can command them to pull down those strong holds they will do it you can even post them somewhere for 30 days to keep this for 30 days so this situation can change and I had one have a woman who was so determined and one of the countries that we've been seeing some radical change and she came all the way to see me in Florida and brought me the her country's flag and it was under they were under severe attack and everything we all prayed for them in that meeting because we had the flag there we prayed over the flag anointed the flag and declared and sent the host things began to immediately change they started to get help leaving their country the prayer agreement is one of the most powerful things and if it's sending those together it's very powerful to do that if you find people to be in agreement with you make sure it's not like two single guys and girls or a married couple not I'm just saying yeah just don't let anything take what you're doing for good and try to use it and when you know wherever to the other thing wherever two or more are there I'm in the midst of you there's that one and wherever two or more agree is touching anything so I mean if you were had a way to try and describe the quantifier so I pray something I'm sending my host or Doreen and my wife and I we agree to send host can you quantify how much more power the two of us sending it is than just probably ten times more the power okay if you're sending a million you do it together it's going to be ten million okay really if it's a hundred you're going to send them together it's going to be a thousand that's the way it multiplies it's not just addition to the host it's multiplication I didn't know that one I hadn't heard that one that's really really good thank you Kat that's good okay we got a couple time for a couple more here and I got a second show today so we won't stop in a few Brandy's asking when the Bible says Jesus was beyond recognition on the cross I'm not sure which scripture she's referring to I think I do know was it because of the sin that he was bearing or because of his physical beating or both what what do you know it was the physical being had nothing to do because he didn't sin right so he was saying his appearance that they said he had to drink the cup yeah and he became spiritual cup okay I wanted to see let me explain okay it was a physical cup that the angels brought from heaven to him they brought it to him in the garden and that's when he said if possible let this cup pass from me that was a physical cup of what was in it was spiritual every spiritual every wicked evil sin you could commit ever every wicked evil deed that you could do every disease that there ever was that was a spiritual thing that when he drank it he made his decision at that moment to give his life it wasn't at the cost it really was there he knew he was going to go he knew he would do it and that is why he's the only one that has the right to forgive sins people he's the only one who ever bore them they were nailed to the cross that's why he has the right to forgive sins in case you ever wondered I do want to ask this question about that though in that about he's the only one because in the Lord's prayer you pray the Father forgive us our sins so you don't you mean the Father and Jesus can forgive sins is that as opposed to only I think the Father can forgive any kind of a sin whatsoever I think for salvation Christ is probably the only one to do that can do that because the Father knows he bearded that to the cross you know he paid the price to forgive for salvation the Father can forgive whatever he wants to forgive as the Father yeah I always I always get confused about confused may not be the right word but I mean Jesus said you know I'm not asking you to pray only in my name I don't have this memorized cap but you can go to the Father and he will give you in other words he was trying to communicate that the Father can give us what we ask without do you know what scripture I am I don't know if you know that don't ask in my name anymore but you can ask them you can ask that because we were always taught always pray in the name of Jesus so explain that if you can I think that is because they are one the Father and the Son are one I think the Father can bring he can bring help to you he can give blessings to you he can bring sudden leads to you yeah he says don't ask in my name you don't have to no longer ask only in my name he said he's literally saying you can ask the Father also like Father I don't have enough money to do this so Father thank you for blessing me with that money sending that money I need that money he's saying something like that yeah so in other words like the teaching that I was under that says if you don't say in the name of Jesus it doesn't have any power that's if you're asking the Father you don't have to say his name I was so ingrained in me that I don't even want to send send the host many times without saying in the name of Jesus I take power over that but I think you said one time that's not required to send the host didn't you say that you once you realize who you are in Christ then you just say I take power over the power of the enemy right what or I always edit myself because it's such a thing I do I say I wake up when I wake up I say I take power over all the power of the enemy this day okay and I always say thank you Jesus so I still see okay okay so you don't mention him but in other words because I have been given the right to command the host because Christ commanded we get to command them because Christ stopped the storm we get to stop the storm I always thank the Lord no matter what but it isn't like if I don't have his permission his direct permission to do that I can't do that I can still do it because he gave me authority to do it but I do thank him for it. Here's a good one we'll close on this one but I've wondered about this many a times because we know there's a difference between after I suppose after Jesus was glorified and died and all that but here's the question Debbie's asking did Jesus have face-to-face visits with God and or hear his audible voice like the prophets did or do and I'm especially wondering if supernatural things that happened to him when he was growing up how did he figure out who he really was so first part of that is we know people like Kat Kerr who are caught up to be with the father many many many times wouldn't it stand to reason that Jesus would have had that or more while he was on the earth he would have been caught up to his father many times. Does that follow? Well it says in the Bible he went to the mountains to meet with him. Yeah but then I used to think that just meant you know meeting in prayer but you mean meet me. He actually went to the mountains. Okay to meet with him there with the father yeah okay yeah I mean no I read the same thing again I was taught that just meant in prayer that's okay and so there came a time in his life he knew who he was when he said to Mary and Joseph I must be about the father's business when they corrected him for leaving the caravan remember that? Yeah he was in the temple speaking to the high priest and they were so undone by what he knew the revelation he knew and everything he knew at that moment in his life he knew he was the son of the loving God he knew from that moment he already knew he was he was either 12 or 13 he knew he would die on the cross he knew it all probably. He knew who he was he knew that was his father was in heaven and he did go to the mountains to meet with him to talk with him about stuff. Of course he would be able to do that. Okay good. So that was the way the disciples I think. Well and then this one again this is Debbie still asking said I'm especially wondering supernatural things that happened what happened when he was growing up how did he figure out who he really was I remember there was some supposed lost book of the Bible that claimed he had healed some birds or different things but I'm not trying to get anybody to go to other verse books but did he work miracles did he heal family members did he He did actually Steve what he practiced at home to them was not a miracle. Oh Mary knew he could turn the water into heaven's wine and I keep saying that he turned the water into heaven's wine not earthly wine. There was no process taking place anymore he simply turned the water into heaven's wine which I've had very sweet and it doesn't doesn't make you look in your flesh but the even at the wedding they said you have saved the very best we've never had any like this you saved it to the last and that's because he ran out obviously. Yeah Mary knew how did Mary know unless he had done it Mary knew he could do that that's what she said you know go ahead and do whatever he says to do and he's saying what are you making me step out before my time that's what he said to his mom that's true you're going to have me do a miracle at home it was never a miracle when his mother his mother and his brothers and trying to get him wherever he was either Nazareth or Copernum one of those places because they thought he was they seem to think he was going too far and and he said they said your mother and brothers are out there and he basically says I'll tell you who my mother and brothers are they're the ones doing the will of the father which was a super big ouch for mom and brothers but why why would that happen if assuming they already had seen his miracles what were they what were they trying to do because they liked them for themselves oh yeah yeah I'm sure they didn't run out telling all their friends my brother just turned the water into wine are you kidding they probably didn't say that they're thinking they'll all come and get it because remember they're not Jesus but he multiplied the food okay Mary knew he could do these things and she pondered them in her heart when he did them but she also did know one day he would die on the cross that was told to her I guess she was maybe hoping maybe she was thinking that could be avoided but it could be avoided and I think that one of when he said no these are the ones who got us sent me to you know not his family I think Mary knew at that time that things were changing and that probably was going to happen with him but it was not a miracle and this is what the Holy Spirit said what Jesus did at home was normal for them they couldn't do it they knew he could and so but when Mary finally made him step out mama pushed him out of the box and said no you need to do this and he did that that was his first miracle but it wasn't the first time he had done it that's very interesting I never thought of it that way because early on we've seen one it's time here's do whatever they tell you Jesus make this wine later on scene two or three he's there they're going what are you doing you what abandon this you're doing all these things I don't know it is I would love to sit down with Mary and Jesus in heaven and process what they were a lot of people do that well cat do tell people how to get out your two websites if you will because we're going to get going here in a second but talk about revealing heaven dot com for a second revealing heaven dot com is my main website that's where you can go to you'll find the book you'll find a lot of other stuff there they've actually been working on it I need to take a look at it and see what they've done to it they've made some changes to it probably for the better I think they made it better to navigate through it number one and also our store has greatly increased I've asked me to not just share heaven by word but to create items to put in the marketplace that represented heaven that is part of revealing heaven in the marketplace people things can they can have they can wear they can they can say things like I always like to use this cup to show people like this is not a normal cup it says I don't do demons right there so God didn't give me things to create that would bash people Holy Spirit give me ideas how to bash people and so a lot of our stuff like this speaks against the darkness like that and so we have all kinds of things we'd use in your home having your home which is what his original plan was to write the books to go and speak and then begin to create items that we could put in the marketplace and his word was this hell's been doing it long enough it's about time we put something in the marketplace good good and then cat car dot com what's there did you say that's a spiritual platform you can learn all kinds of things by going there it doesn't cost you to go there all it is however the only place on planet earth if you want to give to me online it's on cat car dot com I don't have other places you can give if you see other websites out there they're not they're not mine if you see a way to give cat car dot com is it so if you find somebody else's website that has my face on it asking you to have money at this link for missionaries for the people that's people wanting to steal your money that's not okay wow very good stuff you feel like just blessing the people as we go out here father I just released peace and joy and celebration father just like they have in heaven god I come against every wicked evil lying spirit I come in the host having to go and pull them down over everybody who's watching this platform and be able to build anywhere in this country and in this world trying to take over I thank you god for flooding the homes and the hearts with your presence with your life with your love with your will with your revelation in Jesus name because the greatest days are ahead darkness is not taking over but it will be judged and justice will be given in Jesus name so be it amen amen cat thank you so much we love you very much and your staff okay quick reminder that Johnny will be on 90 minutes from now at two o'clock pacific time and five o'clock eastern as a second show for today in this special election post-election season so all right god bless you thanks again cat we'll see you later bye bye

Greetings and happy Wednesday, feels like a Friday for some reason. Wednesday, November 16, 2022, welcome to the broadcast, I am Steve Schultz, your host and a founder along with my wife of ElijahList.com right there, ElijahStreams, who are in year 25 and bring you the voice of the prophets and loving every minute, but I remain very encouraged about the present and the near future, things are really happening. We're going to bring Kat Kerr on in just a few moments to talk about anything God's giving her, and then we'll have questions for her, so be sure and text your friends and let them know that Kat is on, and we're going to run an episode, a premier new episode of American Warrior, so let me just read that, Lieutenant Colonel Mark Novak spent 27 years serving in the United States Air Force and Air National Guard, piloting the B-1 Lancer and KC-135 Stratotanker, refueling fighters in the air, but when he retired he didn't stop flying, today with over 8,600 flying hours, he's still racking up flying hours, and this nearly 80 year old, with this nearly 80 year old B-29, call it a dog, DOC, dog, one of only two B-29s in the world still flying, here's part of that story. General Doolittle stole my title to my book, it's called, I Could Never Be So Lucky Again. There's eight of us that are left seat qualified, and I have the most flying time of the year. I've decided that I want to be the guy that's more an expert in one airplane than the guy that goes out and flies five different airplanes a day, I'd rather be quote unquote the expert of B-29s. I'll ask why, why do you do this, and people don't realize what those 18-20 year old kids did, they went off to war, went on to them. We are keeping history alive, we are educating the next generation about the greatest generation. So interesting, each of these episodes is produced by my brother, Warren Shultz and myself, and we're happy to bring these to you to honor those who have gone before us and many of them, obviously these are the ones that are still with us, several of those who we've already premiered have already passed away. So many are dying, there's not very many left from World War II, and they're going very quickly. So I hope you'll watch that, here's how you can get on that, American Warriors on the Rumble channel, on Rumble you go to American Warriors 22 or just type in American Warriors, and YouTube the same thing, just type in American Warriors 22 or American Warriors. So I hope you'll enjoy that right after this program, you can go right there and watch that episode, sounds so so interesting. Alright, we want to thank you very very very very much for your support and donations into the ministry, those 24 of us, and to be 26 of us that keep this ministry going, and as you can see we so heavily into charity causes that advance the kingdom of God, well over a thousand people have come to the Lord in Uganda because of these freshwater wells, we're doing many things in the States too, we've done a lot in Jackson, Mississippi with the water projects there where there's been poison in the water. So let me just quickly remind you with a quick spot on what we're doing in Uganda, what you're doing in Uganda, so here we go. It's amazing, as you know Jesus said whoever gives so much as a cup of cold water to one of these, he will certainly not lose your reward, so and that is I've come to understand that you're not losing your reward in heaven, but you're also not losing your reward on earth, God loves to reward in the here and now just as much as he wants to reward you in the here after. So we love it what we're doing, but what I say that wrong when I say what we're doing, we love it what you are doing for these people, it's very, very real, you're changing literal lives, literal everyday needing water lives and God is crediting that to your account, so thank you very, very, very much. All right, time to bring on KatKerrso without further delay, let's bring in Wednesdays with Cat and Steve, there she is, I surprised you, I thought they were going to play that clip, but that's okay, we didn't play that little clip, how are you Cat, how are you? I am so excited to be here today, I've got my celebration, you know, whatever you want to call it, cover on, my prophet's robe, this is my prophet's celebration robe. Really, I love that, I said did you just make that or? Are you kidding? I don't know, I'm not sure that I've seen it before, I've made a D in home economics and not the food department, but in sewing, you've got a D in sewing? I think it was mercy, okay, I had to put this dress that had 10 million little ditzy flowers on it, and they couldn't give you a simple, because you know, you have to cut it out of the pattern, that was probably part of the problem, as long as it leaves with cuffs, it had a zipper on the side, it had buttons up the front, it had a fancy other thing on, and it was the biggest mess you ever saw, I had to wear it to school, one day it barely hit me, and the teacher just shook her head, not here, this is not your calling, but will we make you a chocolate pie next week, I'm going I'll make an A. You know, I think a lot of guys in high school took home act, but I didn't take it, but I think it would have enjoyed the cooking part of home act, but the cooking part was good if it was something I liked, and if it was, I was in all the way, yeah, a lot of people got some good training in that, I didn't even take, I got pretty good auto mechanics, as far as the guys to have their cat, just we lost her. This is an interesting day, we lost cat right in the middle of my sentence, do we know what happened there, Emily, Emily, Emily, do we know what happened to cat? We're checking, let me see here. She suddenly disappeared, either someone pushed the wrong button, but anyway, well what was I saying before that, anyway, I hope you guys are appreciating both the water well videos that we're making and the American Warriors, we work really hard at that, we spend a lot of money on the American Warriors, right now that's virtually all out of pocket, so when you also donate into American Warriors, some of that goes into honor the American servicemen, but mostly it's out of pocket, you know, because it's such an important thing to tell those stories on the water wells, there she is, we don't know what happened, do you know what happened? No, but I sent the cyber host in there to take care of it. Oh good, we have cyber, okay, that's now I know what, okay, yeah, so I don't remember what you were saying, but you were in the middle of saying it, so pick it up wherever you remember. I just know that I didn't make a really good grade on the dress, and this is the funniest part of the whole story, right, I told you 10 million little tiny flowers, which I never would have, I don't know who picked the fabric, but I never would have picked that, and my husband, I think it was our 10th anniversary, I wanted to really surprise him, so he goes and never would, for any birthday anniversary, no matter what it was, he got me fishing equipment. Obviously, I had so many poles, tackle boxes with tackle, I didn't even know how to use. But you don't like fish, right? No, I don't, I hate it, but it's his thing, he loved it, and he said, I'll surprise her, and I went, and he, and for years, nine years, he kept buying me this stuff, I went, if you buy me one more piece of fishing equipment, you're getting a dress. See, my husband is a man's man, let me tell you, but he's a man's man, and he goes, well, I won't make that mistake. He went up by himself and picked out this dress. It looked exactly like the one I made, I'm not kidding, Holy Spirit is so funny, he brought this, just look at this dress, and I, you know, I even made sure the measurements were correct, and he said, I spent hours, and somebody helped me find it, and I opened it up, and I went, wow. And he had everything, the longest time, and it was everything, with a dinty little flower and everything, and I said, well, I certainly say this for a special occasion, he goes, well, our anniversary's tonight, how about tonight? I wore it one time, and it's been in the closet ever since. I just liked it, just like that first dress, and it does sound like, I mean, the Holy Spirit, it was made okay, but still. I think you're going to say yes on this, but did the Holy Spirit have fun with that? Did he do that on purpose? Is that what you said? You know he did that on purpose, he absolutely knew that for him it would be the best joke ever, because I told my husband not to give me fishing equipment, or he'd get a dress, so he thought, well, I'll get the dress, and I'm sure Holy Spirit said, you know, let's take a look, and he goes, well, this one looks good, because he'll talk to you like that. I think I like this one, I think that's a good one, and so he picked it, and I'm like, I have it somewhere, but I only wore it that one time to make him happy, and I'm like, you can't hide in something like that, okay? Yeah, well, just for a second, hang there for a second. So this is the first time I think I've ever heard this about the Holy Spirit, that he would pull a prank on you, that he would laugh about, and he's a prankster himself from time to time? He is the drama king, they actually call him drama king in heaven, he loves drama, whether it's funny, he loves comedy, he's involved in the arts, he's involved in all the arts, he loves the arts, Jesus loves flowers and dancing, and of course talking about all the miracles he did, but the Holy Spirit's favorite thing is to be part of a drama, no matter what, they have dramas, they have plays, they have movies, they have all kinds of performances all over heaven, and they do really call him the drama king, king of king and drama king, and he absolutely will do things to pull jokes on you. That's amazing. Well, that's actually kind of encouraging, because that means I could relate to him as the person of the Holy Spirit, with an actual personality and a temperament, and a sense of humor, because we wouldn't have a sense of humor unless it was given to us by God. You're right. And I've learned so much of that with Kat. Well, Kat, let's talk about, so President Trump talked last night, I think they had a graphic of what that looked like last night, if they're, if they're, he was going to throw up a picture of Trump. So that was last night, he gave this announcement, and so many of us, we wanted him to make some sort of a going ahead announcement. We weren't sure that just I'm running in 2024 was all we wanted to hear. So talk about your response and what God's showing you or anything you want to say to encourage other people. Well, I knew he was going to do it. I knew he would say that. I knew he would do that. Yeah. It'll keep somebody really busy watching him campaign. Yeah, well, you can't take the hidden thing and that. I can't say anything more than that. Well, they can't refuse, even the media can't refuse to cover it like they've been refusing for the last two weeks. They just won't cover him. Now that he's running, they kind of sort of have to cover it. Yeah, they do have to. And that number one, that is going to really, that's really going to really hit them hard on the left because they didn't think he would do that. But I can, I know why he did it. And I can't say why. I will never change what I have been saying. And God has been saying is, just so you know everybody, he doesn't have to run again to get his seat back. Yeah, you have said that. I will say that, but, but being busy and keeping the news on certain things going on and the left trying to figure out how in the world they can stop him from doing what he is doing, I can say there can be a lot of other things happening. Fascinating stuff. So you have not lost your encouragement at all and what, what's going on? None at all. Are you kidding? Why should I? Yeah. I think it's going to be a good thing to see him a lot, people to see him a lot. Number one, that's going to really make people feel good, feel good that he does still care. He never stopped caring people. That's good. And he has never stopped saying he won. Yeah, that's good. That's good. You know, we were watching you. A couple of weeks ago I was talking to my wife and I saw him and I just said, and I mentioned this the other day on the air, but I said to Doreen, I love that guy. And then like a week or two going by and then last night we're watching him talk and do what he's saying. And Doreen just, and this was almost uncharacteristic of Doreen to be demonstrative like that. She just turned me. She says, I love him so much. I know. See, it's good. He's not. Well, I knew at one point, at one point he would come out and begin saying a lot and doing a lot because he can't stand obviously if you heard what's going on. He knows what it looked like. He knows what has happened. And I think it's good that there's someone not afraid to say anything that's happened. He certainly has voiced all of the truth of what he said. And even that encourages people knowing somebody after he does know the truth. They know what's going on. They know how bad it is. They know it. If anybody knew it, people, it would be number 45. Yeah. So good. So keep your eyes on what's being shown out there. Maybe you'll hear what else is going on. That's good. Well, thank you, Kat. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. It's going to be fun to watch the news. Even the fake news to us a little bit. Not that we tend to watch lots of it. Some of it. I was quite surprised at seeing them even put it on. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's kind of like they're kind of have to now. They're at a point where they now have to cover him, even, even if it's to make fun of them, they have to cover him because he's running. Yeah. You're right. They have to. Or they, I mean, they're obviously not doing any job whatsoever. So they do have to cover it. And that's going to take up a lot of time of special groups who would be doing other things will be assigned to watching him. Yeah. Very, very, very good. And, you know, because their ratings have collapsed in the last two years, I mean, completely collapsed, is in their financial best interest to start covering. Because the ratings go up. Even if they're making fun of him and trying to destroy him, oh, we lost Kat again. Do we think that's happened again? Well, this is an interesting day. We need to call more. We'll see if we can get her back on here. Okay. Yeah. So sorry about that, folks. But what was I saying before we lost her? It was fascinating to watch him. You know, I believe, Johnny Endlow and I talk about this on the air a lot, that President Trump, and I call him President Trump. I don't call him former or ex-president or anything. He is President Trump. I do believe Johnny does believe in a whole lot of us patriots absolutely hold these truths to be self-evident, if you will, that President Trump remains the commander in chief of the U.S. military. It is an almost indisputable fact. If you listen to, I don't know, was his rank. Derek Johnson. Oh, yay! Hey, we got you back again. So I was just saying to the people, I hold it as truth that President Trump remains to this day as the president, as the commander in chief. I don't know if I've ever asked you about that, but Johnny and I talk about that all the time. That he is our commander in chief to this day. And you know what I really love is when the left, and we know the news, what we normally call them, I don't want us to get cut off, so what our nickname is for the news, have to officially say President Trump. I can't just say the name. They have to give his title, just like they would do it for, you know, they would say President Obama, they would say President Clinton. I mean, they always still say it because they are, that will always be their title. Yes. For their whole life. That's who they are, no matter what goes on or how long we spend. So that's, that's a legitimate thing they have to say. They can't not say it. Yeah. And really when they say it, I know there's demons gnashing their teeth somewhere. Which makes us very, very happy. It makes me very happy. I've read a bash hell with anything else people. So you may think out there that you may be my enemy, nah, you're not, hell and the devil is everyone's enemy on the face of the earth, in case you wonder, okay. That's who your real enemy is no matter who you are. You have a real enemy. His name is Satan with a little s. That's good. That's good. That's good. Good. Good. Now, Kat, are you ready for some questions about heaven today? Now, let me just make an observation. Our numbers are growing so rapidly from week to week, because people are getting fed on this channel and they keep telling their friends and foe, whatever. And so the numbers are growing. So I know there's a lot of probably tens of thousands by the indication that I've never heard you before today watching this. So give a recap of what it means when we say Kat is going to talk about heaven and how many times you've been to heaven and what does that even mean? Because as if you're saying it for the first time, what would you say? That I have officially been appointed by Jesus Christ in person. Of all of you who have a problem with that, go look at your Bible, see how many people he has visited. Yeah. No, this is not something strange or unabnormable. And even people being caught up to heaven without dying, that actually happened in the Bible. I don't know how many people had that happen. Paul, who could barely talk about it, right? And in the Old Testament, how many were taken then? It's just crazy how many. I mean, there was Isaiah, there was Elijah. I could go on and on. There were so many that actually had encounters and actually saw heaven. And you know, what about Ezekiel? People go read the book of Ezekiel and see what he saw about the living creatures, the throne being moved by them. I mean, it's just wild, the things that happened back in the Old Testament. So this is not nothing new. God chooses who he reveals himself to. I'm talking about the Father chooses. And his son, Jesus Christ, his name was the Word, there was a Trinity. There was the Father, there was the Word, there was Holy Spirit. The Word became willing to give his life on the cross, to make a way for us here on the earth to get rid of all of our sins and gave us the way back to heaven where actually we all came from. So I had a divine encounter back in the 80s, a face-to-face encounter where the Lord said, the Father and He were going to start taking me on tours of heaven. That was not abnormal for me, people, because I'm a seer, which means I see in the spirit realm. I am a prophet. I'm a revelator because I reveal, John the revelator in the book of revelations revealed the throne of God, the Father, in Revelation 4, go read, you have Ezekiel 28, that's an assignment. Revelation 4, that's an assignment. And then you should read the book of Hebrews. Good. Yeah. Oh, wait, real quick. Why do you say read the book of Hebrews? Why did you just say that? It does describe heaven in there. There's different things to talk about heaven in there in Hebrews. It's a really good book that talks about it. There's other books. Of course, the book of John talks about the Word who was with God and was God and made everything that was ever made. So you can go there and read part of the book of John throughout the Bible. There's so many times heaven itself is mentioned. Heaven is the Father's house. It is not a building, it is a world. This house is a whole world bigger than our entire galaxy. And that's where he lives on the throne, that's where Christ sits at his right side. And Holy Spirit can be in every place at the same time, wherever he wants to. So he's there, he's down here. But that's how they set that thing up. When they designed all the stuff, they decided that man would be put on the earth so we could have a flesh body. We lived his little spirits inside the Father, it says this in the Word of God. In him we live, we move, we have a very big existence. That's what the word says. Okay, we lived in the Father this while he is our Father. He says in the Bible, we are his offspring. Just so I want you to clearly understand what I'm talking about. So the Father and Jesus Christ, they had a discussion. I'm Ben Pip from a seven generations of believers who actually believed there was a God. We had several seers in that line. We had some prophets, we had missionaries, we had pastors, we had lay ministers, so many people who loved for God on the earth and obeyed his word. And I walked on the same foundation. I never expected to do this, right? I was the loner person out of 14 of my siblings. I liked to be alone, but I always knew things where things were lost. I knew where they were and God would still speak to me. But I was a seer for the time I was little. I remember seeing angels in our room. I see people's angels no matter where I go. I've seen demons a lot. So I know how hell operates. So all of this has been my life of this reality of the divine. And so when Jesus came to me in person and said to me, the Father and I have decided to take you to heaven on trips so that you can reveal heaven to earth. And they'll know the truth about who we are, how heaven operates. It will dispel grief, it will give joy and celebration to the hearts of the people, that they will know more about us, that be Father, Son, Holy Spirit. And that was my assignment. And ever since that time in the 80s, they have never stopped taking me. I do not take myself. I am not asleep when they take me. Even my natural life is I'm awake 20 hours. I sleep four hours sometimes, that'd be like from 7 a.m. to like 11. I'm awake all the rest of the time. And even a long time ago, God would give me assignments, like go to this place and help this person, take this to this person, I'm going to fly you over here. And when you get there to the food court, tell this person this word, it's too late to tell me it's not real. And I'm glad they have me do it, but I'm a photographer. And my gift is I was sent as a photographer to the earth, okay? That's what I am normally. But I am a revelator, that's what they call me in heaven. And they take me on nonstop, after a thousand times, I stopped counting. I didn't roam around telling people, it didn't matter to me if people knew or not. I just did what God wanted me to do and I obeyed what he asked me to do or where I was going to go. And so I've been to heaven so many times. And so after doing that for years, the Lord comes back to me and says, the Father and I want you to write books about all your experiences in heaven. And what he would do is he would catch me up, let's say somebody passed away, does that mean he's going to do this for your relative? But I did actually host, I was, what was it, what was it called? I helped to make all the food for the people in our church, hospitality. And some people would come and have funerals at our church because we could hold 5,000 people. I didn't know most of these people who brought their families here to have a funeral service. But I was put in charge of making the food for those funeral services and what the Lord would do was catching me up a couple days before that funeral service happened, show me their family member in heaven. I was told their name, these people in heaven didn't see me, I saw what their mansion looked like, I heard them talking about their families on the earth, I knew pets they had, places they had gone, I knew some of their family members' names, I knew what their favorite colors were, I knew what the Lord had made their mansion to look like. And then he would send me back to the earth and I would buy all the food. They were the favorite of this person who passed away. I would design the whole reception, the funeral reception and wear even some of the type of clothing like one person was in the military and I was taken out on this, what are the great big ships called? Yeah, like a carrier, right? Yeah, a couple days before the funeral service, it was going to be at our church, they didn't even go to that church and I saw this person standing in the military uniform, this was the person who passed away, he was standing on the deck of this big aircraft carrier and he says, I'm going off into the sunset. And so the Lord told me, when you do the service, I want you to wear a military uniform. I want you to pick his favorite aroma of a candle called ocean and you're going to put it on every table in the service. I want you to make all this person's favorite foods and gave me a list of them. And when they walked into this service, I never saw them before, they almost fainted and I was wearing the military uniform and they walked in and they went, did you know him? And I said, no, I did not know, I didn't know, somebody's the father, I said, no, I did not know your father, but I've seen him. And so they didn't hear about you, they wanted to hear, so I shared with them what had happened that I had seen, I mean, nothing about his actual service they did. And they said, then you don't know that his ashes were thrown off the aircraft carrier out the sea. Really? God always gave me evidence, I have evidence in my books, there was evidence that I knew the truth because I never knew this person, they didn't know me and yet what I said to them, I'm standing on the aircraft carrier, I'm going up into the sunset, they said, you didn't even know, I was in the middle, I said, I knew nothing about him. But this, they said, but all these things, the colors, the navy blue and the gold and your uniform and these scents of the candles, I mean, they were like shaking, they were so undone, this is his favorite food. And so that's how he did it, he did that for years with me and some of these were just amazing things that had happened and some of those stories are in the book. And so after doing all this for years and the Lord came back, we want you to write a book, you go back to those people who you shared with about the family members, the encounter you had seeing them, we want you to give their personal permission with a written message. And that will be one of the stories in your book, you'll have what you saw, what you did with it and what they said when they saw all this happened so that you'll have an evidence that you really did see that. And so that's what's in the books and so I didn't know after going and seeing all these people who had passed away and I never talked to any of them. And so some were like military people, some were even young people. And one of my favorite stories was about a young person who passed away, but I'm not going to go into that. So I have been taken for years, I've seen so many parts of heaven and I'm taking my spirit in your spirit, you feel young, you're excited, you're really breathing the air of heaven. If you're taking in your flesh, your body is not used to the glory, it will begin to get weak because you're there in the flesh that happened to Jesse the plan is go get his book and read it. And so when that happens, if you're taking in your flesh, they'll bring this copper colored fruit in heaven and give it to you and he did that. And then that gives you strength in your body for whatever reason, I never was given the copper fruit. So for whatever reason, God, sometimes for maybe you know and don't know, but he takes some, you know, because he could take in the spirit almost all the other time. One time he may say, okay, come and you go, your body's gone, they wouldn't be able to find you on the earth at that point. Is that what you're indicating? Oh yeah, Jesse the plan is was taken in his flesh, his body wasn't in the room. He went to lay down in the hotel room and God took him in his flesh to heaven. And he has that story in his own book about heaven and he talks about what he saw there and all the things that were going on and I didn't, you know, I just know that he wrote that book. Yeah. All my stuff I saw and happened, those were all my own encounters. Why do you think, because you I was actually had written this question down for today. So this is a good time to ask that question. Why does God seem to always take you as an eight year old girl? What's the point of that? And do you, when you go and you show up and you're this eight year old girl, do you realize that back in the flesh on earth, you're still this person that I'm looking at right now, your cat Kerr with pink hair and you're the older person that I'm looking at. Do you know both of those at the same time or what? No, I have nothing. I know that I'm back on earth, but I don't even care. Think about it. I'm an eight year old. I'm in my spiritual body and there is a reason why he took me as an eight year old Steve because they don't argue with people. I don't argue about what God shows me. I don't second guess him. I don't try to figure out how they do. I don't do any of that. I'm eight. I'm so excited. I can't wait to get back and share what I saw and the things I got to do and it was amazing. I mean, I also have, God gave me a photographic memory even when I was little. I can remember things. I remember back when I was like, I don't know. I remember being a baby. I remember being a baby. Really? The first year I was alive, they couldn't even put water on me. My mother had to bathe me in oil for the whole first year of my life. God said that was my, he was anointing me. Oh, wow. And you just had something physical going on so they couldn't put you in water? Yeah, water. They just couldn't put me in water. So they said to use the baby oil and that's what she did. She gave me with oil for the whole first year of my life. But I remember seeing in my crib. I remember being in my crib and seeing angels in my room. I remember it. And I remember every single encounter I ever had in heaven. I remember encounters I had growing up, even being very young with the rest of my family they all thought it was strange, but especially my mom thought it was really strange. So I would never go to sleep. I wasn't tired and I never wanted to eat. I eat once a day, still eat once a day. And she wanted me to be normal so I could eat and sleep, but she finally realized, hey, she's doing fine. You know, she's doing just fine. So she finally just let me be me. But I do remember so many things growing up, the wonderful things my dad did to help people, the people I knew that, you know, just gave their whole life to help guys and bless people with their lives. And I liked my dad. He was like my best friend, my natural dad. Wow. He was a good example of the father himself and loving people and forgiving people. That's how he, that's how we live. But the heaven thing, I never really thought I knew that I knew I could see heaven and hell, you know, examples of them that never bothered me. And I thought that was just normal to be able to do that. But when Jesus showed up, I know I say that like it's just nothing. Oh no. I loved, dearly loved Jesus at age four. I received Jesus as my savior because I am a seer, a seer. I did it in Sunday school. I saw Jesus come and step inside of me when I said I saw him step inside of me. No one from that point in my life could ever tell me that that was not real, that I knew that when you got saved, it says that he lives in you, he says that he lives in you. And I knew that was true. So there were so many things that I experienced being a seer that I knew these things were true. And so that was my whole life. You prepared me for doing this. And when he came in person, he never actually asked me to do anything he told me because I had told him somewhere in my life, I will do whatever you want and you don't even have to ask. I give you permission right now. If you want to send me somewhere, I want me to say something, whatever you want, I want what you want. And I get, I encourage people to say that to him. And so all this training happened for years and years and years. And then finally when he came in, he said, we're going to start, you're going to be start taking that after I went for years, he came back and said, we want you to write books about your experiences in heaven. They will dispel grief all over the world. Yeah, it's helped me. It's already helped Doreen and me. We've known you for 10 years. All kinds of grief has been dispelled even from losing our pets that we now understand they go to be with the Lord before we do, you know, that's right, they're waiting on you. And so I, I love what they have asked me to do, but I also told them the day that you are done, I'm perfectly fine. But until then, I'm going to enjoy very much being able to share who you are, who the father is, Holy Spirit, how heaven operates, they showed me how heaven operates, they took me to so many places in heaven, I can name them, I could sketch them and one day I will paint more of them. I'll be painting myself one day, but that's my assignment. I'm a revelator and from the beginning they called me a revelator. And they said your name, your nickname KatKerrves what you will go by and, and then you're going to write these books, three books on heaven. And we're assigning to you to scribe angels who will remain with you until you are done with your third book. I'm working on my third book now and he said, because you've seen so much of heaven, we don't want you to struggle with where do I write the angels will give you the chapter titles in all of your books. And then you will know what you're going to write about because you've already seen that stuff. Well, that's fascinating. I mean, God could have said the Holy Spirit is going to give it to you, but he, he decided to assign it to the angels to give to you, huh? You can describe angels. One is very funny. The other one is very fierce and fiery and he's all about being holy and the other one's a comedian and they rub each other like, you know, it would be like you go with someone who's the opposite of you somewhere. And, uh, and so they did, he did send them and they're actually still right here with me. I know their names. I don't talk to them very much. And what I want to say something where they have to say something to them. And they've already given me half of the chapter titles for book three because I have started working on book three and it's going to be phenomenal. It's going to be amazing. But for all these people saying none of this is possible, you need to be reading your Bible people because yes, there were people in the Bible sat in eight with angels. And a fellowship with angels on earth, on the earth and Abraham, even Abraham met them and saw them. And I could just, there's so many people in the Bible because I was a Bible scholar people not in college. But just at home, my dad taught us how to read the word, enjoy the word and he'd share all the time. So it's real. And you know what? You can use the word against the enemy. You can use it to bless people. You can use to speak things into existence, but only if you have it in you. Make sure you're reading the living word of God. Okay. So good. What do you say to people? Now I can hear people, even new people watching today and they're going, well, wait a minute. Paul spoke against the worship of angels and being puffed up with the, with the worship of angels. worship people worshiping is bowing down to somebody and bringing them treasures. Okay. That is not what I do. Communicating Abraham, communicating with angels. I'm just done this long list, we bought many people, communicating with angels. Communication is not worship. Okay. Receiving directives. How many angels brought words to people, brought supplies to people, brought encouragement to people on the earth. I mean, it's, you know, it's, do you even have heaven in your life? Heaven shouldn't have it your life. Heaven culture should be what you live on this earth. You better be preparing because that's where you're going. If you're a believer, but I never worship anything except Jesus Christ, the father and Holy spirit. That's it. That's the only one they worship. I will only worship the one true God had and I will not worship another. And I certainly do not worship the things of hell. Their images, their products, their apparel, I'm not advertising hell at all. I would rather bash them, crush their plans, push them back using the host of heaven to hold on strongholds and spread platforms. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. Now another thing that I had pre written down, so I'm going to just go there because it's interesting how this is feeds into it. You said the story you told us about a man who was cremated and then thrown over the side of the carrier. So he's buried at sea, throwing his ashes over. You had told the story and this is in heaven, but it's concerning heaven. You've told a future story that the time will come when someone will be resurrected or maybe many people at a funeral, during a funeral, even though their ashes are sitting right there. And if I'm saying, am I saying that right? Is that for the many? Is that going to happen many times? Is that a one off thing in the future? What? I don't think that went off anything. It's the greater works. Okay. Christ said you will do the works. I did and greater works you will do a, a work, one of the works is raising the dead. I mean, that's happening in many places, but it happened quite often actually. What will be happening a lot is mass raising of the dead mass raising likes, let's say there's a whole lot of people that die in one area and God sends you there and says, raise the dead and they will be raised up and they won't be dead anymore, whether dead bodies are still there and everything that is, that is going to happen. That's a greater work. Yeah. The greater work is taking the lid off the jar at the funeral and commanding the, commanding that person to come back into their body. The ashes are their body. It's the right there. He knows God knows how to put every ash back together people and he can put them all back together and that is going to happen. I don't know how often, but it's going to happen because yeah, I got to ask you this because I mean, I told you this that we tried for actually almost three weeks to raise a dead body. We had to get permission to the funeral home to do it there for a while, then they shifted the church began to intercede and basically it didn't succeed. It didn't succeed, but there was discernment that he didn't want to come back. So what's the deal? So someone else, two people could try and raise the dead from the ashes. One would want to come back and one wouldn't. Is that what you would say? I would say God many times gives them a choice. And if she gave them a choice, 99 percent of the time, they would stay in heaven. I would. Not because they don't love you, but they love the father. They love the son more than anything. And the only way you really can truly experience that is to have been with them. I've heard stories of people taking over the throne and he said, you have to go back and they cried. Oh, wow. They cried. Really? Yeah. He said, you, I have to have you, you have to go back and I have to send you back and they cried. They didn't want to come back because when you're with him, when you're with him, the Lord, when you're with the Lord, when you're with the father, it's the most powerful love you'll ever experience. It's not that they're going to forget about you, but if you went there, you would understand. You would understand. He actually put something in and he reached and put something in me. Oh, really? The Lord did. And he said, I'm putting this in you so you will not want to remain in heaven, but we'll be so excited. Oh, really? Yeah. He actually did. Yeah. So it wouldn't be hard for me because I'd be going back, he'd be taking me back and forth a lot and he wanted me to want to come. I can't wait to come back and share. That's how I feel. I suppose he could do that to someone who has already graduated to heaven and they're happy there and he could say, I know you're happy here, but I'm going to put a spirit in you that makes you want to go back because I've got something to do for you. Could he do that? Might he do that? I don't know if he would do that, but because he didn't give me a different spirit, he literally put something from himself that gave me such a hunger to share. Truth about what really goes on there. Is that? Oh, sorry. You talked about that he went to, he spoiled hell and he took back the keys of death hell in the grave and these were moments in time, at least moments, but death is death. Hell is you're on your way maybe and or the grave is when they buried you or I suppose cremated you. That's the grave. So when those times are past, what I'm intrigued because once those moments of time are gone, and it's still not too late if God decides to resurrect them because I don't know what your thoughts. I would have to say that's all totally up to the father. I know what the keys, those keys that that Christ took away from the devil gave him the right himself to go in those little windows of time and present himself because people are praying, someone has to be praying. A believer normally has to be praying for that person that they would not go to hell, that they would know Jesus Christ, that they would have a chance to receive him. And so it says a man is appointed once man is appointed unto man is appointed to die unto under man's point of wants to die. Yeah. And then. Now I have news for people when you die and you're dead, the judge when he's talking about is not the judgment seat of Christ, which is a long ways away for you, even in heaven. And it's not the great white stone judgment, which is the last judgment seat anyone will face before everything's wrapped up and all things will be new. So you're not talking about either one of those judgments, there is a judgment seat of Christ. Okay, that's not about sins, right? And the the great white stone judgment is for all the wicked dad that are taking out the hell at one point and go before the father and he shows them, this is why I cannot let you in. This is why you're going to live fire. Those are two judgments. But when it says that the planter and the man wants to die, thank you, Holy Spirit. Yay. Yeah. Judgment is at the moment you die, there is a judgment. Do I have the right to use the keys? That's for Christ. Yeah. Okay. That's what that scripture means. So there is actually a scripture that talks about it. The planter and the man wants to die and then the judgment has everything to do with Christ using those keys. So you better be helping if you're not a believer that you have someone praying for you, David. I may have brought this. I think I brought this up before and I can't quite remember your, I think one more, one more, one more. Oh, go ahead. Now that doesn't give you the right because he got those keys and he goes to you at that moment. And you have to say, yes, I repent of my sins, I regret I ever did that. Please forgive me. I want you as my savior. If you looked at Christ who came through at that moment, you said, I'm not interested. Guess where you go. You go right to hell. So the people don't mean you're going to go in, it's your answer, your response to him at that moment. At that moment that judgment comes, if that happens to you, I sure hope that you repent to Jesus Christ. Now you can go ahead and watch this. Well, yeah. I might have brought this up and I think what I'm about to say, you may say that's impossible Steve, but I can't remember what you said. So along this line, 20 years ago, a contemporary of Catherine Kuhlman, he was in, he ministered with her and he said, he gave me the name of a person who, if I mentioned her name, she died young and people would know who she is. And he said, she's going to still be resurrected, Steve, and again, this is about 20 years ago. And I said, well, I don't know if I've heard of anything like that, but why would God resurrect her after she's gone 30 years? And he said, because her work here wasn't done. So is that impossible? Was he wrong that that was even possible for some? I am not God and I cannot be God. And since that was not me involved in that situation, I can't really give a response about that. But God is God, he is sovereign, and the only thing I'd ever heard anything like that was people who had passed away and were in heaven. This is part of the reward. They will come back to the millennial reign of Christ, but that'll be him bringing them back. And it wasn't any other time. It wasn't necessarily like, you know, they've been gone 20, 30 years, we'll let them come back to have another life here. That's not it. That is not it at all, because I know that that part does not happen. But I do know in the millennial reign of Christ, which is another whole era. Yeah. That's an era. That's not this era that we're in right now. It's not. We're still in the kingdom age, which means Christ hasn't come back to tribulation, hasn't happened. There's so many things we haven't manifested as sons and daughters of God. We haven't spoken to the land to see in the air, well, maybe to see a little bit and watch it obey us because that's what God, the earth is crying out for that to happen. And we're going to be, we rule with Christ, we're kings and priests and to our God. That ruling is just starting right now in the spirit realm. The great wealth transfer that certainly has not happened yet, all the new inventions and creations that will happen on the earth, the things that will happen over the next many generations that has to happen before that part comes. But once Christ comes and fights and Satan is kicking to hell, well, not hell. He falls for a thousand years in a bottomless pit. Christ will sit on the throne and this Jerusalem is there now. He will rule as king of this world for a thousand years and then Satan is loosed for a season. So those people who were born in that time can be tested. If you're not Bible scholars, you probably know what I'm talking about. So that's why this is not over. It's not over. Okay. So, so that's a whole different era. So the Christ comes after that would be after the church age. Okay. That's after the church age. Then there is the millennial age. If you don't like that, we're millennial people who don't want to put it in your little Bible. As you wrote, you want to put thousand year reign of Christ. I have news for you. It means the same thing. So for a thousand years, Christ will sit on that throne. It was given to him as his father. He doesn't want to miss that part. The father doesn't want him to miss that part. They have reason why they have to have all of these things in there that they had pre decided and not pre decided if you would go or not. That's entirely up to you. So, so these things still have to happen. The end and is not here. It's not here. Okay, people. And we're quite a ways away from the perilous times of the tribulation, although you think you're experiencing it right now. You aren't. I've been taken into some of those times and this is nothing like what that will be. But God right now is exposing all the evil so he can deal with it. So these greater days of glory are coming on the earth. That's what your new normal will be. The greater glory, baptism in fire, manifest in sons and daughters, ruling and reigning with Christ. That's what is coming. That's what's coming people. That's good. You wonder. Good. Hey, you know, you know, I, this is a day I'm just going on the rabbit trail. You introduce something else and say, okay, let's talk about that now. Okay. I've never asked you anything about the millennial reign of Christ. Maybe the millennials today will are all going to be there, but, but let's say the millennial reign of Christ hundreds of years from now, whenever that is, you said it just said it's in this Jerusalem, the Jerusalem that we were going to be there in April or May, you know, that Jerusalem, he's going to rule from there. Is a temple going to be there when he's there or no temple? I'm quite sure there will be some kind of a temple there because he will be sitting on a throne in the temple. Okay. Okay. On that temple mount, right? Theoretically, I would say if it's Jerusalem, yeah, and ruling from a throne, it would have to be in that place. It would have to, it will definitely be that place. Actually, a lot of the Bible's written about that area over here in the United States and other places. We weren't even around when all that was even discussed or talked about. Of course, God knew that we would be here. He knew that we would be friends with Jerusalem. He knew all that would happen, but mainly these things happening, even the battle taking place aren't going to be here. The battle, you know, during the Paris times, when the devil tries to take over in his great big battle move and he loses again, that's going to happen over there. That doesn't mean it won't affect people living here. On this side of the world, but most of those places in the Old Testament, that's where they happened. They happened in the area. In the New Testament, that's where they happened in the area. Even in the future, when they talked about the revelations, those were things that happened in that area. That is the very area where Christ will rule as king of this world, and there'll be natural people in the world that don't want him there, but they can't stop him from being him. Yeah. Okay. What's more about then the millennial reign, he's on a throne, it's in a temple or a temple-like structure. All weapons will be destroyed. Okay. All weapons destroyed. No nuclear war, no wars. He's ruling with a rod of iron, which is, I've never, that's during the millennial reign with a rod of iron. That's over the people who don't want him there. Okay. There will be believers that become believers there. He won't have to rule them with a rod of iron, but this is, there'll even be some wicked people in the earth while he's ruling. There's going to be people. That's crazy. Really? It says they won't want to come before his throne to show off what they have. You know what? Their land is getting them. And he says this in the Bible, that Christ will say, come and bring your goods before me so that I can bless him, and they won't want to come, they won't want him there. And he will say to those people, then you won't get rain on your land. These are wicked people and wicked leaders. They can't rule. They have no power to rule. There's no armies at that time on the earth. And then after a thousand years of Christ's ruling, it says, Satan will be a lustful season to tempt those who are born. People will live to be eight, 900 years old during that thousand years and won't die. So that was a long time. Is this the same scriptures that talk about if you don't come up before, did you just want to celebrate tabernacles that, that it won't go well with you? Is that the same area? It says it will not be, God said, he will say to them, I will not send rain on your land if you don't come. Talk about, okay, we're rabbit trailing today. So talk about people that do the feast and they don't want to miss Passover or tabernacles. To what degree does God like it when people keep that today? Do you keep tabernacles, for instance? I don't. I don't. I'm not, I'm not really, I'm not a Jew, it's okay if I don't. I do sometimes attend different things that they do. I do sometimes attend those things and I enjoy them, but he does not demand that I do any of those things. Okay. I am a believer in Jesus Christ. I don't have to follow Jewish tradition or Jewish rules or laws myself. I, you know, Christ came and replaced all of that himself. Christ replaced that and that's why we follow him, honor him, we serve him. I'm not against any of the Orthodox Jews at all and what they decide to do, that's how they decide to live. They honor God for God. They will at one point have to make a decision about Christ. Yeah. You know, and I, and in this 20 years I've gone to two or three Passover Saders and that was actually the meaning of Christ and we even went to, we were in Jerusalem four or five years ago just on a visit. Terina and I, we did, when it wasn't the tour and we had friends that are not Jewish. I don't think they have Jewish, but they were in Jerusalem. They loved all the feast and so on. We happened to be there on Tabernacle. So we went to a restaurant where they had the booths built, even inside the restaurant, you know, and so it was fun, but it wasn't something that I felt an obligation to do, but it was fun to do. Our church every now and then will actually celebrate the Tabernacle booth. They'll do that. They'll do that. They'll do the Saders. They'll do things like that. We had some Messianic Jews in our church. I think they're probably still there. And I, there you go, it's head of hospitality and I cooked for a lot of the people in the church. Like I did home meals for the church sometimes, people, that was a lot of cooking. And I was invited to the, uh, I think it was, was it the Passover Saders that we call it? Yeah. Yeah. Where they bring unleavened bread. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I told somebody who was getting all the food ready, don't worry, I'll bring the bread. Oh no. What did you do? I didn't bring a little loaf of leavened bread people because I was clueless about the unleavened and the leavened bread. I just needed to have a piece and I was going to help. I had a basket when I made big dinners. It was this big, it was this big green, green, beautiful bread basket with a handle and I decorated it and put about eight loaves of Italian bread and French bread. All the leaven, this is going to be a feast and I was at the door and my friend, Bud Washi, who would give bread away at the senior citizens home, all he could do is laugh. He saw me. He was talking. I'm walking up to the main food table with this big, huge thing and my friend, Meisberg, descends upon me, scoops the bread from my arm and runs up to the next door. Unleavened cat. Excellent. He wasn't up south of me and I went, what happened? And Bud goes, unleavened a bread, you should have walked it up. I think they laughed for years about that. I remember in the 70s, they started doing, this is the Jesus movement years, 60s, 70s. And then they started doing, they would call them agape feast or love feast and there's another word for it. It almost seems like maybe agape, but anyway, then they would, but they didn't do that unleavened. Their whole point was break the bread and drink. So they had big glasses of wine, not this little, not wine, but grape juice. Yeah, we always had grape juice, big glasses of wine and then big old loaves of leavened, nice rice. And then you would tear off a big old piece of nice leavened bread and pass it down. That was fun too. But that was a good, those were good times because they were trying to get into the real spirit of it. Yes. Well, they were quite shocked at my, my offering for their dinner. I love it. We got to laugh. The Holy spirit, he probably sets you up. He couldn't stop me. He couldn't stop you because he stops you at other things. I'll get the pita bread. Okay. That is hilarious. That is it. All right. Let's see. Where should we go here? Okay. So let me just jump to a couple of questions here. So we've got a few more minutes. Let's ask some more questions. So he's asking, Psalm 91 verse 11 says, he will command his angels in regard to protect you and defend you and guard you in all your ways. And then it says in this verse, we, is this verse referring to our guardian angels that have been assigned to us or is the host of the commands on our behalf to protect us or that we command on our behalf? So what's, which angels is he talking? What is that talking about? Or do you want to guard and protect us in all of our ways? Yeah. That's what you said. Yeah. Did he say, does it say he assigned our angels to do that or did he say, well, it says where he will command his angels in regard to you to protect and defend and guard you. That is probably the host, because otherwise he would have said ours if it was our guardian angels. Okay. He would, they know automatically your angels are waiting for you when the mother's carrying you in the womb. Your angels are sent from heaven when you are conceived. So your angels are waiting on you to be with you your whole life. They are the very ones who will take you home to heaven, no matter when that is. So they have an assignment, yes, to protect you, to encourage you, to even maybe mention things to you. And you think it's you like to guide you. They kind of guide you a little bit, especially when you're younger. Like if you may be going to do something that might be dangerous, your angel may say to you, Oh, I wouldn't do that. And they think, you know, I shouldn't do that. I, I wouldn't, I shouldn't do that. And then you'll think, Oh, I'm saying that to myself, I better not do that. So they have, uh, they already know what their, where their boundaries are and what they're really called to do by God, but if he says his angels, that is the army of heaven. Wow. Okay. Very, very good. Uh, okay. You've said before that the Lord will walk through the wall. I don't know if it's the father or Holy spirit or Jesus. You can answer that in a second, but it says, and you're all of them. All of them. And then it says, when God writes on your wall, is it the same kind of writing that he used to, to, uh, to write the 10 commandments or to write or for Daniel? I think when they're talking about Daniel, there was a hand that appeared and wrote on the wall. Is this kind of the same thing? Is it different in whatever, that's what they're asking father literally walked into the room. I believe it was in a hotel room where I was, because you know, I travel and speak a lot and every now and then they give me my own room, which I loved having my own room because then I have a lot of communication or encounters with him. He walked in the room and started speaking to me, I'm going to write the next 50 years of your life on the wall. Make sure you write it down because it won't remain. And so he did write, he said, you're going to, you're going to operate from these platforms and only these platforms and he was already started writing on the wall. So did you like a one in the line and wrote on there what it was and then two, three. So, uh, at that time when he wrote on the wall, because all this time I've been operating as revelator, reveal heaven to earth, let people know about heaven, about time, about things that happen, things that will happen. And then he said, now for these next 50 years, number one will be doing business as CEO of heavens. He says, heaven's headquarters on earth. I'm not making it up people only because we will produce things that represent heaven and put it in the marketplace because God's tired of hell stuffing on all the shelves. This is what he said. And so he's writing all this. So number one was business, number two was revelator. Number three was arts and entertainment because I will help to produce movies and all kinds of different things and the arts that represent heaven on this earth. And number four was, of course, number four was, I'm trying to remember four, there were five different ones. So number four was, uh, I'm trying to think of how I said now, because my mind goes so fast that the slow it down with just a second catch up to my spirit. Okay. It will be about, uh, appointing things for God and, uh, opening up governments. And the last one will be news and, um, kind of news and media to number five is news and media. In other words, we'll have network. We'll have a full-on studio. We'll, we'll do all kinds of stuff in the studio, but we will have TV channels, network, networks that will have TV channels about heaven. Some things will be funny. Some things will be the weather. We'll actually have the weather as part of our, uh, of the, of the news and network thing, news and media. Number four is, uh, yeah, changing, touching government leaders so that he can shape that nation. That's the, that's the fourth one. So we were doing things, major things with presidents of countries and stuff like that, that we will influence them so God can win that country and shape that nation. That's number four. Number five is the news and media. We won't stop doing the weather. We'll just do green screen and you can see what's happening as you're speaking to the weather to change. Oh, wow. Oh, that's great. I love that. When you wrote on that wall and you turned around and said, that is all I'm allowing you to operate in. Do not let anyone else try to make you or a robber for Billy Graham or anyone else that's not who you are. You are my revelator and I need you to do these five things. This is your platform for the next 50 years and after that, I'll show you what's next. You know, if you had prayed anywhere in your past and you said, Lord, make me the Billy Graham of the 20s, 2020s and God didn't intend that for you. Could you just keep praying and praying and praying and praying and he was never gonna do it, right? Cause that was never your call. Yeah, what you need to say is what do you want me to do? Which is what I did say to him and he has said to me before, you are not Billy Graham, that millions will be won because of the revelations I let you give and he also said, you're not oral Roberts, but you will raise the dead and millions will be made whole, not just healed because of what you're doing for me with heaven, it will be automatically happening. So isn't that I won't be there and people won't get healed. It's the way he wants me to do it. However he says to do that, it will happen. Yeah, so for instance, I remember, especially in the 60s and 70s, we would watch Billy, oral Roberts. And back in those days, my parents were making fun of him, but he was real, he grabbed their hand and he'd shake it, and he'd name it Jesus. That's not likely that God's gonna tell you to grab someone's hand and shake it and yell at it, right? Cause that's not who he, how he made you. Probably not. Cause that's he gets to do what he wants with you. You talked about entertainment and now there's new people watching it that maybe haven't heard your spiel about entertainment and heaven and on earth, but I grew up thinking, a lot of the times that I was probably in trouble if I wanted to do entertainment cause that wasn't holy. Maybe I would have even thought, I don't really remember, but I would have even thought of walking through Disneyland. If I was enjoying the music I was walking by and I was enjoying it, that if the Lord came, maybe he'd be sad because that was the way I grew up. Okay, not not that way now, but talk about what's okay about entertainment as a word, as a principle, and obviously there's good and bad. So it's okay to have entertainment on the earth. It is okay. Just don't have any of hell. He basically, that's mainly it. Cause hell has got so much evil and wickedness, extreme violence, profanity, sexuality. That is not what God would call entertainment. He would call that garbage. That is garbage, just polluting your soul that is not ever set, will never be seen in heaven or done in heaven. The movies they have there are exciting, intense, fun, wonderful, and a lot of families like to do things together in heaven, but it's okay. It depends on what is behind it. You don't want your life to be filled with witchcraft. Witchcraft is not in heaven. The Bible says have nothing to do with a necromancer. That word means witchcraft. So we have nothing to do with witchcraft. It's not from God. That comes from hell people. And so what you mean by your own entertainment, would you allow Jesus to sit beside you and watch what you watch? Or where you go? It's very important, especially for this next generation to show them, yes, you can have fun. You can do exciting things, do stuff together and watch things to enjoy, but you cannot go or take them into the darkness and you should not go into the darkness yourself because they'll have a trap for you. Yeah. Okay, Jen is asking this, why does Ephesians say we are adopted because we were inside God as His offspring? So they're saying, if we are God's offspring, why does it say we were adopted? And then it mentions Ephesians one fight, having predestined us to adoption as sins by Jesus Christ. So I guess that's the question she's asking. Why do you have to adopt us if we were already His? That is you, you have to choose Him people. You have to choose Christ on your own. It says so in the word. Everyone who's born doesn't automatically go there. So when you choose to be your own to them, that is like you're being adopted into His family, Christ's family. Okay. All right. Wendy's asking, why should we fast? And what happens, I get this question a lot. The second part of it, this is asked a lot. What happens when I do this? What happens when I speak and tell you? What happens when I fast? What happens when I pray? So Wendy's saying, why should we fast? And what happens in the spirit realm when we fast? If you can answer that. It's a very powerful thing to fast. I would not tell you to stop doing that completely ever because there are times when God will appoint you to a fast. And that fast will be something very specific, either something you yourself are seeking from Him. I'm not saying you have to fast for 40 days and 49th. If God told you to do that, then do that. I would say that you can fast maybe like, if I do fast, it's like, I don't eat. So there's really not food that I fast. If I fast, it's things that I enjoy doing or things I enjoy wearing. Do you feel like sharing those specifics or is it too personal? You've told me, but what God allows you to eat or not eat as a fast? Well, yeah, like I've been on a fast now for some time. My favorite food groups for a long time was like pizza, Dr. Pepper and chocolate ice cream. That was my food group people. Not just to go out and eat that all the time, but that's what I was, I loved it. So father came to me and he said, until you move into your own home, you will fast chocolate ice cream pizza and Dr. Pepper. Wow, how many years is that? Years. Oh man. Years, probably nine or 10 by this time. But I will tell you what, when we are moving, we're going to, I'll have the biggest chocolate ice cream pizza and Dr. Pepper party you've ever seen in your life. That's what I'll have. I still love them, but I will not. I will not unless he says, every time I'd speak on a cruise, he'd say, you can have an ice cream cone. One ice cream cone. And normally people come talk to me about having it with milk. I, you want, you want to eat that ice cream cone as soon as I got it. Very first cruise I went on a cruise where you were speaking and that's the one where we got to know each other and you walked by and we were eating ice cream. We left a little bit early. I remember that and then you said, you said God's going to let me have a little bit of ice cream. I don't know if you'd got it that night or not if you would even remember. I think I usually would wait late. It would, but I can go past midnight. You can't? God, when God trained me in anything, he was very specific because if he said something to me later at one time, it could mean life or death. If I did what he asked or not do what he asked. Now he knew I was going to, but it doesn't matter. He knew already that I would, but I had to see myself that I could do that. And I live a fasted life, not just with food. I still don't walk on the grass in my front yard. You can ask anybody here. He told me one day, you will not walk on the grass anymore. And I don't, on one side of my yard, I never walk on that grass. Is he just giving you something arbitrary to train you to obey and that's kind of it or what? I don't think that's for me to see. I think that's for others to see that I won't do it. It's for others to see you obey even if it sounds odd. That's right, crazy. Yeah. Okay. I mean, that's helping a lot of people watch you right now because they'll go, oh, that's weird because God told me never to wear yellow or something. No, he does do that with some people, okay? And sometimes it isn't so you know you can do it. Others will watch you and let me tell you, there's a lot of people here watching me and they know everyone will tell you, do I walk on the grass outside y'all? No. No, I do not. I will walk on the other side of the driveway, but I will not walk, oh, there goes my drink. Well, it's okay. I drink most of it. Anyway, I don't. I've literally seen you climb across the seat of the car. Because the car was parked too close to the grass. Oh, wow. I will get in the passenger side and crawl across that seat to start that car and go. Even if it's the dead of winter, I will still do it. And that's what you mean by a fasted life, whatever God tells you to fast. Yeah. You're right. Amazing, amazing cat. All right, let's see. If I post Diane's asking, see we've got a few more minutes here, if Diane's asking, if I post some of my hosts at my property lines, okay. This is funny, but it's actually a good question. Will they get, she says, will they get bored? Will they get bored? I get concerned that they just have to stand there all the time. I just want to treat my hosts well. Well, then you have an assignment to give them while they're standing there. You'll just say, I post you four. Four of you will be sentin' olds on two on each side of the driveway. You will have to say something like, and you will mash, bash, and trash every demon that comes by. Any demon who's with another piece, a person, zip their mouth shut, take away their authority that's been given to them, pull down every stronghold, shred platform you see around you. This is your assignments to your hosts. Do not allow anything that would be dangerous to come into my home. Nothing will enter into my home. If I cast it out on my home, you will attack, I'm talking about spiritual being. Yeah. I'm talking about people. You have to tell them, you know, you're standing there, you don't wanna stand there and just be bored, okay? Wherever it comes in the area of your neighborhood, they can go attack it. If it's the wicked, evil, spiritual things, they can, like I said, you can shred platforms, people driving by with demons following them, trying to persecute those people. They can actually shred those demons, come here, not shred them or kill them, but they can pull them off of those things, of vehicles that come by. When I do traffic control, I do traffic control. I send those hosts to traffic control for me every day. And I say, I take power over all the power of the enemy and I command you, host of heaven. You will go everywhere I go this day, or my family members, or my staff, and you will do traffic control for them that we know, hold ups, delays, breakdowns, actions, or acts of any kind, at any time, go host, make toast. And while you're out there, you will go into every car and speak to those people and say, I need to know Jesus. You will rip off any of the evil wicked ones, trying to work around them, shut the mouths of the demons who are with them, that they can't talk to them in that car. You'll pull down strongholds off of any buildings, shred platforms, you can't go in those cars. You can do that. I didn't know you had them. So that really is a good question. So you can give them a great deal more to do while they're out and about for you. Yes, absolutely. I send them into every place before I go in the door, whether it's a store, a restaurant, or a building. I send the host in there first to pull down every stronghold, shut the mouth of every demon, mash, fashion, trash, demons who are in there to cause trouble for me or for people, throw them in a dry place. And then I will go in there and say, I released the presence of God in this building. And then if it's a restaurant, I'll do all that. And I'll say, now I'll have a great atmosphere, great service, and great food in Jesus' name, amen. Really, really good. Really good. It's not one place I eat or walk into or shop in that I do not do that. And if you're walking in a place, someone suddenly decides to, whether you're out and about with a conference or something and they take you to, and you decide to go in and eat with them, but you don't eat then. I know you eat at night, right? But you go out. I go out to work with them. As you're walking, yeah, as you're walking in and you didn't know you were going to be this restaurant until a second before they stop here. Do you, is that when you under your breath, say these things or you took care of her? I don't say it under my breath, Steve. Okay, oh, you don't, okay. When you rule, you don't whisper things. I hear you. So if you're not new about people, you aren't ruling because you have every right to do that. You don't have to put up with a devil where you are. You don't have to check into a hotel. They shred it by the clerks because they hate Jesus. You can stop that. Sometimes it'll start a conversation with people too because they're like, what are you saying? Yeah, I'll start conversations. And if I'm ever in a group, in a restaurant, and they say, would you bless the food? Oh, well. I will bless my plate. And I'll say, Father, look at this food. Doesn't it look good? I'm going to enjoy every single bite. Bless this food for our bodies. And may bless this food for our bodies in Jesus' name. May the Isis have a never-ending crisis. May hell have the worst day they've ever had. And may the hosts make toast of anything around here. Amen. I don't care who's sitting in that group. I'm not embarrassed about Jesus Christ. I'm not embarrassed about who I am. You know what? Every devil will run out of that place. That's what happens. They don't want to be anywhere near you because you are ruling in that moment using the name of Jesus, the authority Jesus gave you. I give you power over all the power of the enemy, people. Are you using it? So good, yeah. When you get to get on the school bus, go host down that school bus. I sent two of them with my child. They will shred bash and trash every demon on that bus. No matter who they're with, they'll throw them in a dry place. Every platform they pass by, they will shred it. They'll give my child favor with the bus driver, favor with all the people on that bus and protect them all the way there. Whether they're in school, they'll kick out every demon around there. They'll stop every attack against them in Jesus name. Go host, make toast. That's how you send your kid to school. Wow. Wow, Kat. You helped a lot of people today in all of this. Thank you so, so, so much. Kat, I'm talking- If you have a right, you have a right to do that. Totally. Well, you know, Darian and I will have said many, many times we were changed people for the 10 years we've gotten to know you because we're always asking you more of this and we're always learning and we're always trained. You know, obviously you're not the only one we learn from all of the speakers we bring in, but I think we have said, if I had to pick the one that we've learned the most from it's really Kat Kerr because, you know, you talk about living a holy life, you talk about sending the host, you talk about living a holy life, you talk about entertainment, you talk about living a holy life, you know, and that holy life thing is very important. Does it not say in the word, our father who is in heaven, holy is your name. Yeah. Your kingdom come, you will be done on this earth just like it is in heaven. It's called heaven culture. And that's what I just explained to you. That is living heaven culture. What I just showed you, that's heaven culture in my life. And then I walk in the spirit very easily because I'm not allowing the enemy anywhere near me. He has not got control of my life, my future, my destiny. And I am not tolerating him, nor am I participating with him. And I'm certainly not advertising him. So good. So good, Kat. Kat, well, tell the people real quickly, because you talked about your book at the beginning, talk about your book where to get those, and you got two websites. If you'll go ahead and tell us those. Yeah, there is revealingheaven.com, which is the name of my book. And I always enjoy, you know, if I stay in a hotel, I usually give one to the person who's gonna clean my room with money in it, of course. I get to talk a lot in the hotels. People wanna know why my hair is pink, and I just start sharing, and I say, well, you know what? If you Google the word heaven, you'll see over 400 hours of me on YouTube talking about it. Cause that, when they'll go back there, and then the next time they'll say to me, they went, oh my gosh, this stuff is amazing. So revealingheaven.com is my main website. That was the first one we had, and it does have our products on there about heaven that reveal heaven to the earth. It has, I think it has some interviews on there, a few interviews, it has some testimonies, but it's where you go mainly to buy our products to find out our events. And then there's catcur.com, and it is the only place online in the world that you can give to me online if you want to. It's catcur.com is a spiritual platform. The father had me create. So whatever he felt like saying, he would be allowed to say it. And I'm quite sure one day we'll be streaming from that. Probably be one thing we'll be setting up this next year that we can stream stuff from there. But catcur.com is where you can give on that site. You can get, there's a photo gallery that shows you things in the spirit, show you things in the supernatural. And some of those, I think you can even download some of those images. There is definitely testimony down there. There's all kinds of videos with people, well-known people who interviewed me, but we are now about to start probably this next year. We'll redo that website. I think we've been working on revealing heaven to make it more navigable, I guess. Navigate around it better than it has, but our studio is gonna be, we'll have a studio built that'll be state-of-the-art studio and also all kinds of other things we'll be doing. But I really, truly love people. It's just in me, since I've got to know the father and his love and his son's love, but Christ made sure that when they called me to do this, that I would know how to teach people how to war against hell and win. I'm so good. Kate, would you pray for the people? Bless them as we go out. I appreciate that. Father, I just right now, I bless the people watching, Father. I impart your life, your love, your presence, your will, your way, your goodness, your joy, your celebration, your expectation of what's coming. Victory is coming because it is ours. Justice is coming because it's God's plans. I thank you, Father, for blessing everybody watching. I send your healing. Power, Jesus Christ, to crush the plans of the enemy, whether it's spiritual, physical, mental or emotional, Christ is the watcher of your soul in Jesus' name. Lose anything wicked or evil, but bind the love and the joy of the Lord in his presence and his plans for your life to your soul. That's the keys to the kingdom. And may you go with the host and crush the plans of hell and bless heaven in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen, amen. Cat, we love you. You have our love to your staff. They're all around you there. I appreciate it. Hey, quick reminder, Chris Reed will be with us tomorrow. Same time. Yeah, it's Chris Reed tomorrow. And then I always get to do this, the others, but I forgot to get to that. So God bless you all. Have an amazing day, Cat. Love to you and yours. Bye. See you all later. See you tomorrow. Bye. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye. And now cheese and your love to your King. We know that your King is like heaven. Alright. Let's go. Let's go, bro, appreciate it.

Music Well, happy Thanksgiving Eve. We are on the precipice of a great holiday Thanksgiving. It is Wednesday, November 23. Welcome to the broadcast. I'm Steve Schultz along with my wife. We founded the Elijah list and Elijah streams beginning 25 years ago, bringing you the voice of the prophet. So happy Thanksgiving. I hope you all will have a great, great, great Thanksgiving. I have recorded a special message for you tomorrow and a story that I think you'll find, you know, really fascinating and will help motivate you in the whole area of Thanksgiving and all that. So we're going to bring Kat Kerr here in just a moment. We apologize for being late, but that happens sometimes beyond our control, but it's happening. You're going to see Kat in just a moment. So we'll be right back after this. Music Giving a cup of cold water is a simple way to show someone they are valid. That you care about them. When Jesus talks about this, maybe what he was trying to say, if someone cares enough to stop and think about what you need or what might help you and they actually do something about it. Wow, sacrificing for the benefit of another. That is loving your neighbor. Thank you for loving us, for giving us a cup of cold water. You give me a cup of cold water. And me. And me. And me. And me. And me. And me. And me. Music And thank you so much for your generous giving towards both the staff that we, every two weeks we pay, I think the numbers 24 people to do what we do. And that is only possible through your giving. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that. So all right, it is time for Kat Kerr and Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Music We're here. We're back. Hey Kat, how are you? Good morning. Good afternoon. It's two 30 year time, two 38 year time. So welcome to the broadcast. So how are you? Thank you so much. How are you? I'm so beyond, if you could be beyond excited, that would be me. So we actually are moving. Yay. Actually, and this is it. We tried our, tried so many different ways to get it done. There's just so much here, having been here almost 20 years with the offices combined with the studio combined with what used to be our home, made it really hard. And so I finally said, God, I need more help. And so I told Margaret, find a moving company that comes in, packs everything, takes it where you need it. And it was funny. Guess what? The name of the company is helping hands. Really? Oh, God said to help. I just, I love the father. I love his humor. And these were four of the most precious people, just country boys, but very professional. And they loved everything they did. And so I really did bless them with a nice little bonus on the side. They were so hard. It's so hard that they packed stuff. They shouldn't have packed. So I mean, I had things missing like my makeup. They were in my room just throwing things in boxes and bins, but it was all going to the same. I had my own storage place that just for those, for the offices that I was in, that it's almost empty. There's a sofa in there, not much else. And I walked around all day the other day. And the father said, your life is never going to be the same. That's all he kept saying. Really? It'll never be the same. It'll never be the same because of moving. It'll never be the same. And I don't, he lost count of how many times he said it to me because he was serious. And I was even more excited. And is he talking about, when he says that, is he talking about, as you said, God doesn't go by a clock. He goes by events. The event of you moving is in time with what the new things he's doing in both your life and on the earth. Several different things. It actually will, for myself, my family, my team, it actually is going to like, it's like the horse race starting, and the gun being fired to go of acceleration in every single area. The acceleration will spread to all those who've been faithful. Not that I'm the big deal. It's not that. It's what God's purposes are for right now. But we've all been declaring and believing and not changing what we were saying will cause you to be accelerated into great heights with God himself to know him more. But the things that he has planned for the earth, he's assigning positions right now. And then he's going to pass out the mantles for that. I'm just really excited. But being in the gated community wasn't like my idea. That was God's. And he said, I'm going to infiltrate you into the circles of the wealthy and the rich because they need me. This is the father speaking. And he said, but I also have two Boaz is waiting and have been waiting to meet you and they're in there. And this has a lot to do with what he's going to start doing rapidly with wealth that will also happen to many members of the body of Christ. So no matter what you look and see around you right now, especially just start declaring acceleration for you, for your family, for your ministry, for your business. And I could feel like the heartbeat of God, the things he's had planned. It's so right. It's right. Like the doors open, by the way. And he says some changes have already been made in America and across this world and they're not going to stop happening. And he said, you will have one celebration, small celebration after another. And then there's a major celebration come that will stretch over the whole earth. And it was that one he had showed me like a couple years ago. I've seen it three times been in that time and experienced it already. And there's such a great joy and celebration for what God will be doing with us. And yes, he is going to use certain people that he has chosen and maybe some military. I'm not sure which one, but I just know but there's something really great about to happen for all of us. So good. So good. These are exciting times. These are amazing times. So, oh, yeah, totally excited, totally excited. And you and I are going to be together in Israel, which that is full in case anyone's asking, but there's so many things, a couple of things that I want to say, but I'm not supposed to say online here. But some surprises in store. So it's going to be fun, fun, fun. You and I did this before we went in the garden tomb. No one will ever tell me the tomb is in a different place. I know some people think it's in the the church of the Holy Sepulchre, I think is what it is, but it's, you know, you were there. So that was very, very profound. We have six buses for with the main tour that you and I are on. And we're going to have so much fun. And then two of them will be the adventure tour. A lot of great people, some parts of the family are going on the adventure tour. They can agonize hiking up Masada if they want to. This was somebody, by the way, this weekend and three and I might my brother in law has found a new girlfriend. I'll just put that way. They probably will get engaged. But they were asking about what kind of nature I want. I said, I like the nature that I don't have to work for. I just want to go there. I want to fly a helicopter in it over it. I want to sit by the ways, but I don't want to hike for five days. Now during this more like the other side, she loves to hike. So when she can, at least as you know, she described hiking down Grand Canyon down to the bottom when she was before I met her and then hiking up. There's a five day tour and I thought, man, I'm glad she did that before I got it met her because she got, I hope she got that out of her sister. That would not be me. No. I'm a photographer. I want to take pictures of it. I don't mind looking at admiring it, drawing it. I just don't. I also do not want to hike. And most all of my children go on huge hikes in the mountains with their children. They love it. They grew up that way. And I'm like, I'm so happy for y'all. I'll keep the camp going. I'll have some food for you and hear your stories, but I want to stay by here. And I think, and God made both types, right? He made the long term hikers and the short, the short term sitting by the campfire and keep the fire stoked and the food warm and the chair soft. So, wow, wow, wow, well, I'm so glad because we know because we're seeing your blue background with the, with the wings above you. Is it, what's it going to look like? Do you already know, is it a different background we're going to see soon? And is that, when does that start? Um, when we find our offices, we're still looking for our office space. We've found a couple of places we haven't chosen one yet. And our, we will have a state of the art studio built there. And until then, we will probably have, have some different places it will be shooting from, but we'll still be with you on Wednesdays until that happens. So yeah, we, we already got to have plans. I've already got plans drawn for the studio. There'll be some CGI stuff in there and a lot of light being used and different things. It's going to be exciting. Wow. Um, but, but you know, I love these. Now, I just tell you this, when we have our operation center built, we'll have a headquarters and operation center, both here in Florida and Jacksonville. But we are going to have some fun places and fun things. Those wings behind me will be a photo opportunity when you, when you come to our offices, if you want pictures taken with wings on, those are the wings you'll stand in front of. Awesome, awesome, awesome. So, all right, now I have a bunch of questions. Make sure you said anything. Are you done with anything you're going to share before I get into them? Yeah, but just every single day, probably going to see things happening that will give you joy and a lot of hope in your heart right now because God is already working things into the place where he needs them to be. But there will be still a major, major exposure of a lot of stuff that people didn't know about. But God always knew where it was. When it wasn't even who it was, people, there's nothing that he does not miss, nothing. So good, so good. All right, I got pages of questions here. It's folded over. There's three pages and a little type. So we'll see how many we can get through the first one I inserted mine because I can't. Here's my question. You said that, of course, people can look over at portals and having to see how the family is doing. And then you said at a different time that many people who come home later that those who might normally have looked over the portal will want to know. I think you said news from home. What's going on at home is, first of all, am I saying that right? Do people want to know what's going on? I think it's pretty close. When people come from Earth to heaven, they actually hold events for that person to speak. Everybody wants to hear the latest from Planet Earth, not necessarily the darkness, what the darkness is doing, but what's going on with God's kingdom on the earth, the people there. And everybody wants to come. So whenever somebody comes home to heaven, they're not going to be misknown. Everybody will know them eventually because they do have events all over heaven and they're the ones who get to speak. The other thing that's been shown to them in the time that they have arrived is they are taking themselves to like little theaters where their life is played over with no sin, there's no sin, no darkness, there's no trauma, no death or anything like that. But you will see every time heaven intervened in your life throughout your whole life, what happened in the spirit when you prayed, what happened in the spirit when there were miracles, what happened when you went places and things happened. So that is added to your news that you have to share in these meetings and everybody knows it's going to happen. And they get really excited, especially family members in heaven, friends in heaven. They know this happens. So you have more to share than the natural realm when you speak at these events that are made for you to share because now you know the other side of the story and that changes everything. So good. Wow. Okay, so my part two of the same question then is, let's, people want some news from home or lots of news from home. Let's say Susie, I'll just make this up because this is all made up. It's not a real situation. So Susie comes home and she's left behind three children. And let's say that Sam is left behind one of her sons. And they say, well, what about Sam? And let's say my question is, what if Sam had just had a divorce? He has cancer. Nothing's gone right. And he hasn't received the Lord yet. What does Susie tell the people in heaven about Sam when they want to know what's going on with Sam? They will know exactly what's going on in the spirit realm about Sam and what God's doing about all those things you just mentioned because they're very well aware of the activities of the Holy Spirit. On behalf of Sam, what his angels are doing, what other ones they're doing that are sent because he was prayed over, you know, he's been prayed over. He's had a scene that's planted over his life. They will begin to see the harvest of the season is life and even know things that God is about to do in his life. So it's never going to be just a normal physical realm that you're going to find out about. When people talk about earth, when they've come from earth, they're going to have all that revelation already when they get there. Okay, okay. So they won't know anything about what he's suffering through right now or they will know some of that, but they'll just see what God's doing. I don't think they'll know much of the suffering at all because number one, they came from here, they know that things go on already, but they are so filled with God when they get to heaven. They know that God is going to intervene. They know he's going to do things in their life and they don't advertise the darkness. They're going to share what heaven is doing about this, how his life is about to change, but God's plans are for him and even his own when he does himself to get married one day. You find out a lot of revelation whenever God gives you an opportunity to speak in heaven. Good. All right, here's Julie's asking this. Do angels have pets? And she goes on, I know the animals would just choose to stay with them rather than being compelled, but do animals stay with them? I guess they mean the angels. I'm not quite sure. So anything about angels and pets? I've never heard this question. Yes, actually, they do have pets and that's why we have pets. They were the first ones to have pets. While we're still living God's little spirits, the angels had pets. Really? And sometimes they go with them on missions, sometimes they don't go with them on missions. Really? Yes, absolutely they have pets. Wow. Oh, I did not know that. This is very cool. Yeah, they sure do. So cool. There's nothing new on the earth. I guess I'm learning that more and more. I mean, it never occurred to me until this. They have different strange pets that we don't have. As long as they don't have toads for pets. No toads, but they do have some creatures that might have two heads. You know, eight eyes. No, I'm not talking about Mars people. I'm talking about the world called heaven where there are creatures, creatures, creatures, intelligent creatures that you would think was like maybe an animal or something. But they're not, especially these wouldn't be ones probably from the earth, but they do still have absolutely to have pets. Very, very, very cool. Okay, Yvonne is asking this. Have you seen what happens in the spirit because you're a seer? Have you seen what happens in the spirit when someone blows a shofar? Have you ever seen stuff happen when you? Yes, and it depends on what shofar it is. It depends on which one it is. It does. One release is the sound of war. I do know that that war and when when that that shofar releases the sound of war, you'll see lightning bolts coming out of it. And then there's some that actually release streams of water extremes of living water come out of it. It's like, it's like a call for peace. Sometimes it's a call for people to gather together, you know, together together to worship the worship so far is one of the most beautiful ones. Because streams of color will come out of that, like different parts of the rainbow, but it's moving. It's alive. And it gets everyone so excited and having about worship. So I'm talking about in heaven. This is what happens so on the earth. I'm present. The same thing happens. And I love to see people blow shofars or trumpets and meetings because they do release things from heaven. So to clarify, so if let's say someone has a shofar that releases warfare on the enemy, will that shofar always and only do that one task? Is that what you're saying that or is it depend on the intent of the some are anointed for specific purposes. And if that is true, then every time they blow it, it will be for that purpose. Oh, very cool. I did not know that this is a day to learn brand new things, but it always is with you. All right. John's asking, what do people with the gift of administration do in heaven? You're going to love this one. They work. They work in central station in heaven. It's a place is the business center. And Jesus Christ is CEO of that central station. So it's not the only central station in existence. Again, there's nothing on the air. It would be like the epic center of any kind of business in the spirit realm or business just business in heaven. Business in heaven would be people are invited to come there. And especially if it's to the main headquarters where Jesus does a CEO and I know Billy Joe doctor and I know that all Roberts both are there. And that's what they do. They get through these mantles on the earth blessings on the earth. And that's actually what happens in this place. And I'm going to tell you one other thing that might surprise everybody, but just show you how much the enemy loves to steal images or things that belong to God. There is a this is a get over yourself people. If you're the ones who are ready to judge me, Here it comes. Hold on to your self people because you don't live there. And I'm telling you things and images there are used many by Satan on the earth. I like marking. I'm just going to go there like marking God marks people when they come to heaven. That would be what you would call a tattoo. It was never called a tattoo in the Bible. It was called a mark and God did mark. Remember, he marked. He marked came. Remember, so the people want to kill him. He's going to mark 144,000 Jews. But when you go home to heaven yourself, it says in the Bible, he will put his mark in your forehead, the mark of your God and in your hand right here in the palm. How about that? Forehead in hand people says it in the Bible, you'll have the name of the city of God in your hand and hit in his name in your forehead. And that's why Satan wants to use it as the antichrist to mark everybody who's going to follow along the Lord of the flies. And so I can just tell you he loves to steal things. And one of the things he steals would be called a crystal ball. And I know going to the witches, the Wiccans, all of that stuff when they have a seance, which is do not go there. And I'm being serious. Do not go to one. If you're bad one, lose it from your soul in Jesus name. It's the way the enemy can attach yourself to you. A lies could be given to you. And they, and some of them, if they really are connected to hell, hell can bring up certain images because they're, I'll tell you why they do it. They're mocking God because in central station, there is this massive crystal ball, massive. Now, before you get over yourself, there is a big rim around it sits in the center of these of these offices. And it says the crystal C S E E is what that thing is called. And when people who work there, like Robert, they walk up and look down to see what's going on. And then they can declare what's going to be set down there, either the intervene or the bless or whatever, but it's called the crystal C. And in this beautiful globe sitting in the central station, you want to more, this is more is some of the crystal C itself in heaven. Like there is a crystal C. It talks about it in the Bible. There's rainbow shooting out of it because gemstones are on the bottom. It's not like a bunch of seashells and rubble on the bottom of the ocean. In heaven, it actually has gemstones that flow from the father. Right. They flow from him down to that beautiful river. And then they form this crystal C S E a. In this beautiful globe they have, it's a crystal club is part of that crystal S E a, but on is engraved letters this time. I mean, they're high all the way around on this beautiful. I don't even know what's made out of some beautiful rim that goes around it. And it says the crystal C S E E. So, you know, what they do with them in these mock meetings that they have for the wicked, they use it to see things, to project things and stuff like that. Because that's Satan mocking God. That image is his. That is the father's. There's one in heaven and whatever Satan could get around, you know, he lived there. Remember, they'll take it and mock it and make a mockery out of it and use it for wickedness. But that, but that belongs in the central station in heaven. And I actually did see Earl Roberts and Billy Joe Dolphy both walk up, look down in there and the Lord said, I have blessed them. They're invited here to be with me. And so I thought that was just astounding. Totally. Yes, I did get to visit that place. And there is business in heaven. That's why there's business on the earth. And remember Christ setting his son is what? Not carpenter. That would be business people because business people have more opportunities to meet people, talk about the Lord and share things with them because you're doing business with them. And actually that's what the Lord was doing when he met with the sinners and people go, why would he sit with sinners? He was doing business projects, carpentry with them. So he had a chance to talk to him about goodness and light and God. And so, and he did use that really well. See who wondered? Yes, there's astounding, amazing things you will see in heaven. You go, well, that was that that's probably not good. But see, you're only you're only acquainted with the darkness things, right? Not what God has and what God owns. So that is his, the crystal se belongs to him. That's really good. Really good. Now you, you said a minute ago that oral Roberts and I didn't know. Doherty, but Bill or Robert, I didn't know him either, but I mean, they were very good friends. I think or Roberts mentored him, I think. And they send, you said, send down mantos. Can you think of an example or even make up one? What do you mean? Yeah, go ahead and make up one. I'm not going to make one. Oh, I mean, can you give an example of anything? Yeah, I can. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, there had been had, they had been having some meetings and I didn't, I couldn't tell if it was Billy Joe doctor's church or if it was an ORU. I've only been ORU once and that was into the prayer, prayer tower. I've been there. And I may share in a minute what I saw there, but it was as a result of some things that people had declared either an oral Roberts University or Billy Joe doctors have been declaring things to God saying yes to him about things. And they were watching and they actually got to send down the mantles, the mantles for the more of God. And they sent them, they, I don't know, they waved their hand over something or whatever. And I could see that they looked like they were made out of light. And they were shooting down to the earth into these meetings and they were landing on the shoulders of people. And they were, they were delighted and thrilled that they had been doing this. And what Billy said was now their lives will really begin to change. Wow. Yeah. Cause we think cat father said in the Holy spirit doing what they do. And then we think of the host, uh, Harkening to the command that we're saying and angels being messengers, but we don't think of people in heaven either in this administrative administration area, the center or other places of doing or saying things that will affect our lives on earth. So it's, it's, is that happened throughout heaven or mainly in this one center or what would you say? I know I've been to that one. So I know they do it there. I know that's, that's what they do there. And a gifts are also sent from that place also gifts for people, things that they need, like houses, cars and stuff like that. It's, that's what the Lord's business is. It is to bless, to increase in every way. Uh, and also to reveal things to you. I will mention that normally, but I see that they, I see that these two would be in a position where they could have already had understanding of that real easy. There is a place called Royal University in happen. It's an actual university that teaches you how to rule and reign with Christ. And that would be normally a place somebody would go in order to be able to do something in that position. But this was a reward for them. This, this opportunity to be there with him was a reward for their lives and what they had done in their lives. Okay. And I can hear some people say or pray or decree, Lord, please ask Royal Roberts to send me a mantle, blah, blah, blah. What about that kind of prayer? I don't know that that's going to work. Okay. Okay. I don't think you can ask them personally for that because they're, they're remember working with the Lord. Yeah. And probably he's probably given them, given them directions on what to do. And that way that they will become, um, probably in a greater level of understanding of how the Lord operates and things that operate in heaven, but you shouldn't hold back on what you believe God hasn't happened because it is beyond your imagination, not even something you would ever think of being able to do, but you as a child, a son or daughter of the living God, you especially should picture yourself in positions like that in heaven. That's good. But will not ever be called a job. Nobody who would think that was a job. It is a blessing. It is a reward. And sometimes you'll get to spend a day with the father and he'll take you places in time. I mean, there's, there's, there's so much we don't understand. Uh, of them wanting to, uh, know us or be with us, spend time with us. And so if that is true, that that's what their heart is, then you better expect to be able to do things like central station and other places like that. Is there, uh, this is kind of a what if situation. How do I ask it? If this is a what if, if, if we knew what is available for us now from heaven, would we ask for more, would we ask bigger prayers? Cause Jesus said you have not, cause you asked not, you know, and if you want to spend it on your less, you're not going to get it. It's basically, if we knew what was available to us, would we ask for more? I think absolutely you probably would ask for more, but God is unlimited in his love for you. And of course his ability to create, to create things or prepare things for you. I think the people just really don't understand that he has great things planned for you. They're so used to just living in this natural world and they see what's around them and they're hoping that they'll have, and I understand that a place to live and food to eat, you can't even get out of that box that you are in to begin to believe for greater or to even know there is greater. And I think if they did ask, if they asked very focused and on purpose that that is their heart cause he's going to look at your heart, look at your heart and if it's got a good purpose behind it or he already had that plan through, you just find the beginning to agree with what he wants to do with you. And I would say I never, I never held God back from anything in my life. Even when I didn't have anything or I wasn't going places or no one knew me, not that I ever, I never wanted any of that. I always wanted to know the heart of the Lord. That was my greatest desire. And I think anyone who goes after him first on purpose, you will never miss the greatness he has where you're never going to miss the blessings. And I'm not saying you have to go win a million people to do this. I have said you have to give some time to him just to get to know him. How do you talk to him like I'm talking to you? Because that means you actually believe he is there and he is there. Yeah, that's good. Really, really good. All right. I'm going to skip one because it's not quite applied. Jill is asking, are there places to go scuba diving and look at all the wonderful sea creatures in the oceans, lakes and streams. And she keeps going, what do whale, seahorses, color fish look like in our, in multiple questions? And are there some other creatures that we've never seen on earth? Can people have parties under the water? Okay, that's a lot of questions. Okay, talk about under the water. One of the greatest things is, well, everybody needs to know in heaven, this isn't for children now. So I'm really careful sometimes that everybody breathes under the water in heaven. Everybody does. You can swim with the fish, talk to the fish, ride on the whales, ride on the sharks. I mean, you really literally could do that. And some people who have the great love for the ocean, you probably have an aqua mansion. And that is a real mansion that sits on a pedestal over the ocean. And you yourself can make it go underwater. Cool. You press something, usually it's like you wave your hand over something, not press something, you wave your hand over something. And I've seen an aqua mansion and they're fantastic. And you can see all the way around through them and you can make them go under the water. And then you have a portal. You go through this portal underwater and it doesn't flood your mansion. You get to go out there and do just what I said. And yes, your friends can come and do it together with you. But you do get to know and understand the creation of God. The sea creatures are amazing. I don't know why I feel led to ask this question. Do some people have, I'm going to use the word pets. Do some people have pets that are whatever sharks? Yes. Manatees, whatever. Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. Wow. So you can have pets. So not to overstate it or understate it, you can have whatever you want in heaven. Is that an overstatement? Yes. Nothing is dangerous. Nothing at all will ever hurt you. They have a place called dinosaur park and that's the name of it. And you can see some dinosaurs. They're so huge. Kids like to go up them and then they slide down them. I mean, and there's tear adaptals that you can take and fly really seriously. And if your head is stuck in a box and you just say, that's just can't happen. That can't be true. They'll probably meet you at the gate when you get there. Because I know the father has one of the greatest sense of humor. He does. And, and, and he literally would do that. He would remember you said that. He made sure they were waiting at the gate and you probably. I can, I can think of a couple of people who said who threw shade on the fact that there's no dinosaurs playing sliding down there. I can just see the, the biggest dinosaur. You just probably got yourself a date with a dinosaur. It's hilarious. And I love the sense of humor of God. We would not. It just as it is in heaven on so is on earth. If we have a sense of humor and laugh at crazy things. So is that in heaven, right? Yeah. It goes God. Yeah. Do all three fathers, son and holy spirit all have a sense of humor. Who's got the biggest. I, I, I know that Jesus is the biggest character. And he was such a character around the year as people never knew what he would say. And when they, when he said it, they were quite surprised at what he would say. And even the fact that, well, you know, they were all surprised that he would sit and eat with sinners when, you know, he wasn't going to sit and eat with them. That was probably part of their attitude that he probably didn't do that. He didn't mind speaking his own thoughts about things like the hierarchy of that day where white and sepulchre still with dead men's bones. That's a quote from him himself. And he would often say what he thought about the present darkness there in that world back in that time. But, um, That's good. We can sit. The drama king Holy spirit is probably beats them all. Holy spirit is called the drama king in heaven. And he loves to play jokes on people. He is so fiery. So he's a fiery thing. He despises sin. He despises evil and wickedness. And he will show up wherever he wants to. Okay. He is also God. And he's about to do that on this earth and quite shocked some people by showing up in places. He likes to turn things upside down. He likes to take people's world and take them out of the normal and the natural and put them into the supernatural on purpose. And he laughs. He does laugh a lot. And I tell people he is my best friend. That doesn't bother Jesus. Jesus is my, you know, he's my love. That's what he is. And everybody else in heaven says the same thing. But Holy spirit has a lot of friends in heaven. And if you want him to be your friend, make sure you got clean language because he won't come around if you're using profanity. That's hell's language. You need to write that down. Hell's language draws hell. Okay. So if you want him to draw hell, that's probably a good way to do it. I wouldn't do it. But I can just tell you that Holy spirit is one of the biggest drama people in all of heaven. He loves drama. He loves the arts. That's what his passion is. Christ loves flowers. He loves to be, he even does gardening. He loves, still built with his hands. He loves sweets. Loves, loves, loves sweets. You'll probably love him for that. And he loves to be with people. And the father just wants to take everybody. And hold him to himself. Wow. Because he is your real absolute father. Wow. He loved you before even the earth knew you. You risen side of him and he would make himself while sitting on the throne, small enough inside himself to play with you. Crazy. Wow. You know, speaking of what Jesus knew and how he responds. Did Jesus know when he called Judas that Judas would betray him? Did he know him at that time? And, and there's a point, I think it was in the garden when Judas walked up. At some point he called him friend. Was he God's friend, even though he was going to betray him? What, what, what do you know about that? I think that he felt that way about all the disciples. You know, I'm sure bothered him very much. He did eventually know that he was stealing from the treasury and he lost him from the treasury. And of course we know that he sold him basically for money. And then of course the devil made sure he heaped guilt upon him for doing it. That's just what the devil does. He gets you to sin and he'll heaped guilt upon you. But the Lord, you know, even when he talked to his father, he said, I have all those that you gave me. And, you know, it's safe for the son of perdition that would be Judas. He chose his own way and chose his own life and chose to do wrong. But he did care. He did care very much about him. There was a point where he did know. I'm not saying he did know when he was first asked to join him. He didn't need a treasure. He needed someone to hello people. Jesus was not poor according to heaven standards. He became poor when he left heaven and moved to earth. So we may be rich and it says that rich in many things with Christ, but he was not a poor person. The caravans at the time, I think he was maybe two after his birth when the caravan showed up. The wise men showed up with all the wealth and they had supplies to take care of themselves from that day on. When they moved to Egypt, they did very well. He had the best tutors Christ did when he had to escape them trying to kill him. And so, no, they did really well. They were well off. He would many times pay for all the disciples' food, sometimes crowds would come here and speak. He would get them food. And so he was. He didn't have anywhere to lay his head in that city when he said the city he was in. But he did have. He was raised in wealth and yet still remained humble and especially when he began to know who his father was and he'd go to the mountain to meet with him. It says that. And he also loved the father and you need to know the father if you don't know the father. Oh, good. So good. All right. Michelle is asking this. We name our pets with names as well as the zoos named the animals that are in captivity. Has God and Jesus given the animals a name to call them too? I mean, I guess she's thinking like Fred and George or whatever. When your animals go to heaven, do they keep their name? I assume that means the name we gave them on earth. She doesn't say. How about the wild animals on here on earth? Has God given them a name? So I guess they're asking how personal. I think the father will name everything. It's his favorite thing to do. And by the way, their own personal, um, steed horses that they ride. Christ's horses name is lightning and Holy Spirit says thunder. And so they name their own. That's why we name our pets. I don't know if you could call them. I guess they're like a pet. They're the ones that they ride the most. They're the only transportation all over heaven. And, um, and of course, the father does have a unicorn with you like it or not. I guess you're going to take those nine scriptures out of the Bible that talk about it. He doesn't like it when you do that people. There are unicorns in heaven. Why wouldn't there be unicorns in heaven? That's good. Good. Good. All right. Um, with how Scott is asking, excuse me with, with heaven being without earthly environment, how do Enoch and Elijah cope with their human bodies? I guess there's, so I don't even know if this is a fact. Enoch and Elijah have only not only have a transformed human body versus everybody else. It goes to heaven when they die. What, what, what is that like? Well, obviously they didn't die. Right. And yeah, the father, he keeps them. He just keeps them. They're never going to have to come to earth. They're never going to have to come back here and die and then be resurrected. That's not, that wasn't the father's choice for them. And I can just tell you that they, I'm quite sure that they had some transformation. It does not say in the dead that Christ, the day the dead Christ shall rise. I absolutely does not include them because they have their bodies right now in heaven and their bodies glow. Certain times they glow. They have frequencies. You can hear them coming before you see them. Enoch's eyes are emerald. I don't know what they were before, but they're emerald eyes. Fascinating. Very fascinating man to get to know and talk to in heaven, because it was relationship for the father and of course with the Lord. But yes, their bodies look strong, very much alive. There's no age in them whatsoever. And I think Enoch is like 300 something when he died. And yet he does not look. He looks eternal. There is an age called eternal. Oh, okay. Wow. So when he caught them to heaven, they became eternal right then. They didn't have to die and get resurrected body. He probably also gave them some glory because that creates a question in my brain. It just popped in. So I guess I'll just ask. It's kind of a weird one. So when we go to heaven, we are, we are feminine and masculine. You said that. But if they're in their body, Enoch and Elijah, do they have gender more so than those who are just going to heaven at the death? I mean, do they have gender? Their whole body is intact. Does that make sense? You understand? Yeah. And it won't be any different when we who are on the earth, when those who are on the earth and they die, die and, and the day that didn't Christ arise. It's your body, your same body that you had on the earth, but it will be glorified. Yeah. And in the same thing, it will be all physical. You'll have your physical body back. Your spirit man will step into that body. It will be glorified. It will look eternal always. And you will still look male or female. You'll still be a male or female. Now it's when it says in the spirit, I gotta say this, people will point out scriptures to me. In the spirit, it says in the word, there is no male or female. They're not talking about body parts. People are talking about dominion and authority. So in the spirit realm, whether you're male or female, you can rule as a king with Christ. Okay. The men can be the bride of Christ. There's two examples right there. The Bible says that the Lord says, know ye not that ye are God. Know ye not that ye are kings and priests unto your God. That's talking about us as the body of Christ. And those are spiritual positions of dominion and authority. So whether you're male or female, you can still rule and reign with Christ. There is no difference. That's what that scripture means. It doesn't mean you won't recognize yourself. It doesn't mean you'll be something in between. No, if you sent you as his daughter, you're still his daughter. If you sent you as his son, then you'll still look like a male. I hope that helps some people clear up some confusion. That's good. All right. Now, it's amazing to me how many questions people have that would never occur to me to ask. And I don't even necessarily look to know this, but it's interesting that people have these questions. So here's Seth is asking this. Does the kingdom of heaven or yeah, does the kingdom of heaven or I guess he means, he might mean heaven itself or the kingdom of heaven. Does it have a flag? And if heaven does, what does it look like? What colors are in it? Are the colors earthly colors, heavenly colors or both? I would, I would believe that heaven most likely has one, meaning one flag, one main flag or many of them. And I was wondering if cat has seen it flying. There you go. Yeah, they do have, they do have several flags that fly over the throne room a lot. There's the line of Judah. There's a father's star, which people usually call the star of David. That is one of the father's marks that he uses all over heaven. There's angels that wear outfits that have the star, you know, like the star of David, which you would call would be the Judah star. When the father chose people on the earth to represent him, he gave them his own image, his own sign and symbol. So that clearly is there. And of course, there's another one that's still with fire. And all these flags have living things on them. They're not just a piece of cloth flapping in the wind, they're alive. What's on them is alive. And so these flags do fly over the throne room and in other places in heaven. And I've seen others, but those main three especially, and they probably represent Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Good, good, good. All right. Tammy's asking, could the trees, not things in the tree, but could the trees in the garden have even speak? We know that the serpent could speak and we know that the rocks and trees will cry out if we don't. So I was curious if the trees could speak, talk, whatever. Yeah, it's called the friendly forest and heaven I have been to you and all the trees talk to you. Some of them will uproot theirself and they'll walk beside you going down the streets of gold. Some will go to their mansion and root theirself there and visit with you for a while. They worship, they also worship, they worship God, but they can have conversations and it literally is called the friendly forest. Even the huge boulders you can sit by or sit on, they'll turn that whole part of that will turn and they'll have a face and they'll talk to you. Even the water, the streams that come off the crystal sea, water spouts will come up out of that water and they'll have faces and they'll talk to you. So yes, yes, they can have conversations. Well, and she's asking, does that mean that the trees in the Garden of Eden, when everything was perfect, could they? Oh, in the Garden of Eden. I'm not sure. I do know that the animals talked, the animals that were there, that Adam named, he called them by name. There's a reason why it says that. He didn't call them dog, horse, you know, eagle. He actually had names for them and when he called them they came and had conversations with him or else they would have been afraid of the snake when he talked and they weren't. It was normal for them to talk to creatures. You know, you're talking about the streams talking or the water talking. Just a couple of weeks ago, I was listening to a recording of a stream and I was, you know, 10 feet away and I just get. Who's talking? Who's talking? I kept saying who's talking and I realized it was coming from this recording of a stream. Is it possible that even now that the streams talk, we just don't really tune in? I'm sure that they probably do talk, but you know, you have to probably, being a seer and stuff like that. I've heard all kinds of things. Yeah, things you wouldn't expect to talk, but they talk in heaven. I know it says it is in heaven. I can't say that that happens all the time. You also could be hearing because I know that there are angels assigned to different things like streams and mountains and stuff on the earth. And you could actually hear them probably having conversations. You know, back and back to the animals or in this case, the whales, which is a mammal really. I have a friend who told me the story. It's been 20 years ago, maybe, but she was on a deep sea fishing tree trip. And then she was in the back of the boat and this massive whale jumped up the way whales do, you know, whatever that's called jumped in the water. And she says, Steve, I heard it say the king is coming. Yeah, does that make sense? Yeah, that doesn't make sense. Yeah. Have you heard other animals talk as a seer or what? Birds. Yeah, really? I've heard birds say things. I've heard a few other animals say things down here. I'm not imagining it. I understand how heaven operates. I understand that these things are possible that God designed and actually he said that in each animal he designed a way for them to talk. And then when, of course, when that all fell apart in the Garden of Eden, he took away their voice because he didn't want them, you know, being accused of saying things wrong and stuff like that. Yeah. I do know this. I know the father has told me that in several generations down the road that creatures will begin to talk. Really? I'm not saying bad ones either. I'm not saying bad ones and they'll be coming to a point where they're not the people won't be afraid of them and they won't be afraid of the people. And that's why it's such a major, major, major change towards the end where it says that the creatures then begin to attack people again. This is a long ways away. Once they have learned the kindness and they understand that we're not going to hurt them. There will come a point on the earth where a lot of that conversation goes on. But then, of course, when the dark days, they will come back one day when Satan actually is going to have his few little years to say they're his. Then things will begin to change, but that's a long ways away. I have another question regarding animals, pets, whatever. So on this earth, we are God gave to men to tend to the animals and rule over them and take care of them. So in heaven, I'm seeing, of course, we have a couple of mini dogs that have gone before and they're in heaven. So who feeds the dogs and what do they eat or do they choose their own feet? Do they get to declare and their food appears before them? What do you know about that, if any? I do know that if it's your own path, they're going to be eating with you. At the table. I have seen it, Steve, and some people like, no, that's not possible. I can't wait. That's why they have the welcome center in heaven. All right. To show you, yes, this does really happen. Yes, you're in heaven. This is actually heaven. Let's go over here. Let's go into this beautiful building and we will help explain to you because they have refused to accept some things. Most of their lives, it couldn't have happened. And when they see it in heaven, they're like, they're totally undone. They're like, just stand and go like this. And then here comes the heart of your son's family to escort you to the welcome center to make sure that you know, yes, this is heaven. It's going to be okay. So I have a stupid question. Okay. It's got to be a dumb question. So if a dog, which I can see him sitting on the table with their hunches, are they there, you know, looking like they're having a chair, not on the table. So, so are those that look like they're in a pie eating contest and slathering into play? Or, you know, I'm saying, what does it look like? I guess it would be whatever you all want to do in heaven. I'm quite sure that they have all kinds of contest in heaven, people love to be a part of that, no matter what kind of contest it is. And I do know that the angels themselves have like Olympic games. It is not the Olympics, but I think that idea probably came from heaven to have Olympics on the earth. Now they do the show, they're showing their ability, whether it's the host of heaven or whether it's the other angels, they love to have competitions. I don't think there's like prizes. No one's going to get money and stuff like that. They maybe don't get something for doing really good and training for them. But yes, they actually have even they have things that they get to do and enjoy. By the way, speaking of contest, you know, we've talked about that and you said people play for points for for the Lord, but are there such things as trophies and blue ribbons in heaven? Or is that all done away with the people earn? There's probably something that they give out. I'm quite sure there's probably something they give out to acknowledge that they are doing really well and something or they've learned how to do things really well. I'm quite sure or it's just a joy of the competition. You know, if you want to be looking for acknowledgement or something, they just want to enjoy what they're doing out there. All right, we have a few more minutes. We have to stop at an hour today. Michael asks, you've talked about all the amazing things you have seen in heaven, but what are the smells like? Melville. Everything almost everything has some type of aroma and aroma. If you actually can see, like, let's say you're walking down the streets of gold and a baker has moved to heaven. Everyone is going to visit that baker, including Jesus, I promise you. And people think I diminish his sovereignty or his holiness or whatever by saying that. But no, he's he's also got some humanity in him and he loves certain things and you would know exactly where to go because you see aromas. Okay, it's not just the smell of the aroma and the aromas are amazing, but you see aromas in heaven and you'll follow these aromas. Like, oh, what is that? And then you see the aroma appears and it kind of takes you right where that where that those aromas are coming from. So you can have some of that or wear some of that because there are oils. There's beautiful things they make for people to wear on themselves. I wouldn't call it a clone or something like that. I'm not quite sure what they call it, but there are different things. Even the clothing, some of them have aromas in them. I think, though, the mountain of spices is a good example. Oh, yeah. It really does exist. And it's like being around Thanksgiving all the time. You smell the spices that you would normally smell this time of year, like right now. And I hope everybody does have an amazing Thanksgiving. And this is a good time to thank God for what he's done and what he's about to do. But it's like, you know, you can almost smell like a pumpkin pie, the things in a pumpkin pie or different spices you would bake with, make things from, or have presents like you would smell like cinnamon. And I'm trying to remember what some of those aromas with those spices would be. But but yeah, every level, there's levels in the mountain of spices in the colors of the leaves is where it looks like fall all the time. And the leaves are like huge leaves, purple shades of purple shades of amber, beautiful, beautiful, and they never fall off the trees, unless you want to pick some you can pick some. But it smells like that and it feels like you're in the fall all the time in the mountain of spices. But I think the aromas of the spices is so amazing to be able to be there in person and smell them. It's a great place to see what an awesome place that is. Yeah, this is a similar one Valerie saying I'm 17 years old, and I love animals with the animals and heaven need my care. So yeah, I can see where she's going with it willing that she need to care for her animals or are they. No, you don't have you know, they're not, they're never going to die people okay they already died. You know, they would be quite well on their own. Your pets probably precede you to heaven. They have friends they visit family members, they can eat pretty much wherever they are or whatever they want, you know, if they have something. They're not going to eat dog food. Forget the dog food. You're not going to need one. You need a little package over that smells horrible. That's not going to happen. They will eat real food people. And they won't want to sit right by you. Good. Now here's it looks like it's a pet day today with all these questions. Do animals go to the throne room and worship God. I've seen some in there before I think though that these were like much bigger creatures. I don't know that they were pets or not, but that they possibly could be pets. But I've seen a lot of creatures that live in heaven. So people think well there's only angels, there's Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and then there's us. No, there's creatures, all kinds of creatures. Things you've never seen. You've never seen before or even even imagine what they would be. And some of them actually are a part of the worship, but they are there worshiping a lot. I do see them there worshiping a lot. Beverly is asking, and I hadn't heard this, but she says, I heard you mentioned that heaven has a top 10 song list. And she's saying, would you share that with us? Is that, did you say that? I did. Is it the same list throughout eternity? Or is it, is it rotating or what? Well, I can tell you the number one song is still the revelation song. Does this exist on earth yet? Yes, it does. It does what it is that I can look that one up. I'm sure you could. I'm not sure what they call it, but I know it is the revelation song. It's about singing about coming before the throne of God is absolutely amazing. Well, I'd love to see to know that one. It's called the revelation song. I hear it in heaven a lot when I'm there. Really? And Mary, did you know is on that top 10 list? Oh, I love that. I love that one. It's by Carrie Job. It's by Carrie Job, the revelation song by Carrie Job. And it's still number one right now in heaven. Oh my goodness. I got to listen. There's a few other ones that are also on the top 10 list. And then Mary, did you know? I love that one too. Mary, did you know is on there yet? I'm sliding off of the stool. Don't fall. I'm not crawling forward people. I'm sliding. Let's see. Okay. We have time for one more. We're right at the hour here. One more thing. How great that hour is on that top 10 list. Oh, wow. So all kinds of classics. What we would call a classic. And then some very powerful. I keep trying to remember the name that anthem. Is that the one where they sing about the second? Jake Hamilton. Jake Hamilton, the anthem is on that top 10 list also. Really? Boy, Jake must like that. Wow. Yeah. He will now be noted. The anthem. Okay. I got to look these up. I hope you all are writing this down, but you can replay this. The ones I use boys. They don't serve breakfast. Yes. I can't remember what it's called, but I know one of them is a big, big house. No, no, no, no. Big, big house. There's a song sung by the news boys that says part of the song is. Yeah. It's talking about like life and heaven or whatever. And they say they don't serve breakfast in hell. That line is in that song. So there are some that are a little bit humorous, but it's by the news boys. News boys. The news boys. It's one of the early seeds. One of their early song. Wow. I got to look these up. I hope you all are doing things about why you should go to heaven and not hell, but it's kind of humorous. It's all done on the lawn of like breakfast cereals. Yeah. I don't know about Captain Crunch. Actually, I meant you, Captain Crunch. It's a cute song. It's like from the 90s. Yeah. Very cool. So God's in, yeah, that's a lot of these are, I mean, some of them I don't know at all, but wow, wow, wow. So is there such thing as top 10 groups, top 10 singing groups, or is it just the song itself? Are there things like that? I don't know about the groups. I do know the music definitely. Okay. Wow. Okay. Describe something one more time. And then we got to go. But you talked about when Kim went home to be with the Lord, Kim Clement, you talk, you saw what he played. Now his fingers were like lightning when he played on the piano. The anointing was on him. You couldn't see his fingers move hard. They were going. So what was the instrument like that God gave him to play? It was a keyboard, but it was round. And I don't mean I'm not saying he, I'm not saying there was like a ring for the keyboard. I mean this way that way, like a Ferris wheel round like that. And he was playing like this as it moved and light was shooting off of it. His fingers were on the inside of the round. On the inside of this thing. It was pretty good size. I can't, I'm not really good with distances. Yeah. Use my map for an example. Okay. He was playing with the inside and this, and it was turning like this. Wow. You could see that it was keys. You could see there were keys, but he was playing like this as it was moving. He didn't have to hold on to it so that it wouldn't fall. But he was really just really lost into this music that he was creating before this. He was before this moment of God playing it. And were his decrees, because he always decreed and declared prophetically, were they coming to heaven and accomplishing things? Yeah. I just know that I would hear, you know, I was, I think I saw, saw him like two or three times only. That's all. But I was caught up and saw him not long after his death. And I heard him, I think I said something, I won't say what he said, but he did say something to his daughter. I think it was, didn't they? Yeah. Yeah. Not giving up or going forward. That's what he was, but I heard him. I heard him. He was sharing that. Really? Playing this instrument the first time I saw him. Well, and she sure, she sure has to, you know, I told, she's been on the show twice now. And I said to her on the air, I said, today when Kim passed, when your dad went home to heaven, I thought maybe because she's, they picked up the mission and I thought, and started sharing his words. And I said, I thought maybe you'd have a year where you could tell you would have told it all. But she's continuing to find more revelation from him. It's unbelievable what God is doing. So it really is. Amazing. Well, can't tell people real quick what they can get at revealingheavenandcatcur.com before we go. So revealing heaven is our main website. And it's where you find out about events. It's also where our store is that we, we, one of our things that God gave us was to reveal heaven to earth. And one of those ways he wants us to do that is to create images of things we saw in heaven or put things on images that are on the earth and offer them to people. So more of heaven would be in your life. He's about, they're about to be some major movies done that are things mentioned in the Bible, but they'll be real, real powerful movies, trilogies even. They're about to be made, they love to tell stories in heaven. And had that been available way back in the day, I'm sure people would have been watching some of the stuff that Christ talked about or the disciples talked about. So I do know that those type of things are going to increase. So that's where you would find this stuff at revealingheaven.com at catcur.com. It's where you get a lot of extra revelation, focused revelation on how to pray or declare different things in your life or over your family, or how to learn to do different things in the spirit. Not anything that's outside the word of God. I'm not ever going to leave the word of God, but powerful things for you to learn and share. And there's a photo gallery also on catcur.com of things, how they look in the spirit. I think one of them is an aquamanchen. There's things like that, I think in the photo gallery. But it's all being updated right now. So I'll have to go and see myself, what they've changed. And that's the only place you can give online. And I think so much for the guardians. It's called the guardian zone. You can go there and sign up to do that. So appreciate all of you who've given. I know Steve, for his supporters, heals the same way. There's things that would be much, much longer to do if we didn't have people to support heavens, heavens actions on the earth and bringing heaven to earth. So good. So good. Well, God bless you. Love you so much. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving for sure. A quick reminder that I have recorded is just a 10 minute, 10, 12 minute video that will air tomorrow on Thanksgiving day. You know, Kat just said heaven love stories. I tell a couple of stories that are really, really, really going to help many of you in the area of Thanksgiving because it's real. It really happened and it will motivate you. Please don't miss that. So God bless you. Thank you everyone for supporting this ministry as well. Have an amazing day. We will see you not Friday because there's no show, but we will see you Monday and it should be Johnny M. This next Monday. God bless you. Thank you, Kat. We love you so much. Have a great day, everybody. See you later. God bless you.

Well, greetings, and I should be saying, do happy Wednesday, because you'll be seeing this on Wednesday. It is Tuesday, November 29, that we are recording this episode with Kat Kerr. We're going to do a couple of weeks of recording, a couple of episodes of recording with her, because she has other things she has to do at certain times, so that happens from time to time. It works really good for us, so it is right now, Tuesday, November 29, and you'll be seeing this on the 30th. I don't think I have any other announcements, let me just give you a quick reminder of the wells that we dig, so Emily, if you'll go ahead and write one of those for us. All right. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate it very much those of you who support this prophetic ministry. There are 24 of us, give or take, that every two weeks we give a paycheck to, so your donations help us do that. And then beyond that, we dig many wells. We'll be up to 77 wells at the end of this month. So God bless you on that. One quick thing. I told many of you that I'm going to play the clip where Kat Kerr talks about the round earth versus flat earth. We'll play that at the end. As soon as I'm done interviewing Kat today, we'll put that on the end and you'll see that clip. She did a really good job. So we didn't need to reshoot it. We'll just play it at the very end. So stick with us on that. So we'll mention it again. So all right, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Well, happy Tuesday slash Wednesday Kat. Good to see you. Hello. It's good to see you. So normally we're a few hours earlier than this, but because we're recording in the afternoon, so you must be wide awake about now. I probably am. Normally we get you as because some people don't remember that you literally stay up all night, every night. And you have for years, right? Yes, I have since I was young. My mom used to come in to find out why in the world was I not sleeping. And so she'd come and check on me. This was all through my school time too. Wow. She'd come in like, you know, at 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3. And she'd be so tired. I'd look at her go, why don't you just go to bed? She finally gave up checking on me. And I still better still do that today. So that's just the way God made me. Well, do you do a lot of your prayer time? Of course, in the middle of the night, you must you just do you sort of come alive in the night hours? Wake up? For midnight to 4am is my most active time. Really? And when you see a lot of my sketches, my writings, you know, I do a lot of actual work work during that time. Okay, wow. Good. Well, you know, I continue to learn more little things about you because we've known each other for almost 10 years now. So it's been good time has flown. Okay, well, Kat, we're going to jump in today. What do you have you probably got something on your mind to talk about before we have questions about heaven? Anything to share? I think some of the evidence that we're seeing now from, you know, you all know what we're talking about. Okay, the justice thing. So the justice that's finally being served is so delightful, I think, for me to see truth being told, and people having to pay for what they've done. And that really has already started on that side. I'm going to try to be not so pointed today. But you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, the ones we've been telling, you know, the justice is going to come and you're not going to escape having to experience it. That is what I'm talking about right now. I think almost every day, at least every week, we're probably going to see something happen that will bring us hope in our lives and even joy and celebration that things are beginning to turn, even though you may not think that yet, it has. And there are people getting in office already, I mean, literally getting voted into office right now, that are starting to say no to a lot of things. And you're probably going to see that increase. Although I do know that there will be one, one huge thing, one big massive thing that God is going to do that no one can deny it is Him. But up until that time, I think He's going to give us days of refreshing and joy and celebration that we have hope for our future because our future is with Him. It isn't with the other side who wants the darkness. We are of the light, the light is in you. Let your light shine. I want to encourage you to do that, especially during this time, during the holidays, especially where people need more help, or maybe they feel like left out of things because of their own situations. Don't forget them. Don't forget to help others in this time. They probably really need it. I am personally excited about everything that's going on. So I hope you keep that excitement. Don't lose that excitement of joy. Don't let man take it. Certainly don't let the devil take it. I don't know that I've asked you. We can't remember if you and I have talked since, we must have talked since the midterms, but the midterms in many ways were still stolen. We got the house, but yet many of the elections were still stolen. What are your thoughts about that? Or has God shown you anything about that? I think it's going to still be proven that they did do that also. I think it's absolutely going to happen. I don't think it'll take very long for that to begin to happen either because of some of the ways they did it. I think there's more people now available that know the truth and want to tell the truth for one thing. And I think even the fact that some of the stations on the networks, I was quite shocked, were not, were willing to broadcasting that were done wrong. That is a major change for what's been happening in the last couple of years. That they actually have some new people. I think even in that area right now, they're wanting to try to keep their own life and their future. So I think you're going to see more of that happen. Well, it's interesting to this a little bit today. I was reading that some Arizona counties are refusing to certify the election for their county because the machines weren't certified, so they're not certifying it. I'm really going to have fun watching that one play out. I hope they stick to their guns. I think that's going to be repeated in other places. As time goes by, I think you're going to begin to see that more and more happen, that people just not tolerating it. They're just not tolerating their lives being stolen and things being kept from them and forced them into a place they don't want to be. I think you're going to see we, the people, begin to stand up more and more. And probably you even have outdoor rallies speaking against it. That'd be awesome. Now a minute ago, you said something big is going to happen that could only be credited to God. In so many words, you said that, is that something that you know and can't say right now or are you just know something big is going to happen? I think that's something I know and can't say right now. Okay. All right. Well, we'll wait for it. I hope you can say it soon or we can see it soon, you know, either one. But you know, I think it will be fun whatever when whatever it is, it happens to give all the glory to God would be the thing to do is that because you know, I'm one of those, one of many who believe that Trump is a crazy genius. He's so smart, but we don't want the story to be what the genius pulled off. We want the story to be what God pulled off. That's right. And so I don't think people, you know, even in the natural realm, it would be almost impossible for somebody to stay in something that long with all the stuff that's been going on. I think people should understand that it wasn't for God and his intervention. I don't know that we would be able to pull off not us, but you know, God of course can do whatever he wants to and he will and he will prove that. But I think the very fact that he's had so much divine intervention for number 45 and that he is still there much to the annoyance and the fear of the other side. I can tell you that the other side doesn't want him being involved. They don't if there's anything they could do, they've tried already to do it. And I think God's hand is going to start moving for number 45 very strongly if they don't. Yeah, you know, and I'd love to kick back and forth, but I know you don't do that because God keeps you segregated, so to speak. You don't get, you don't try to ask other prophets their revelation before, which I like that about you. So there's things I'd love to discuss with you, but you know, I know that you don't do that, you know, but you and I, it doesn't mean you and I couldn't be sitting around the dining room table, which we've done here in this house, but it's just that there's certain things prophetically that we don't, we don't, we don't share prophetic stuff back and forth, so that way keeps it clean. So really good stuff. Well, anything else? Are you ready for questions? Just so I know. I'm definitely ready for questions. Okay, cool. My printer isn't working right now, so I send it to my phone so I can read it to you. So we have one from an eight-year-old boy, Anthony, and he wants to know this. Why did Jesus get baptized instead of baptizing someone else? You mean why didn't they baptize someone else? No, why did Jesus get baptized instead of baptizing someone else? I believe that's what he's asking about, is we know that he got baptized. He had to show his humanity, and in order to be an example for us, I think that was absolutely necessary for him to be baptized in water and then have, of course, the Holy Spirit came down upon him. I mean, there was a lot of reasons why that happened, but also the evidence and the witness that came with that, with the Holy Spirit coming down upon him, proved almost in a way that he was the Son of God. But just because he was walking also as a man, we know that he's called the Son of Man, the Son of God. That was one of the things that would have been required of him, so why wouldn't he be baptized in water? I think that would have been something we would expect. I don't believe the scriptures don't say anything about Jesus baptizing anyone else. Maybe he did, but they didn't say it. Do you know anything about that? I don't know of anything like that, and I'm not saying that couldn't have happened because you know that what is written in the Word right now, what's in that Word, is just a small portion of what it said. It said if everything was written, the books would go around the world. Literally, that's what it said. So there is a lot we probably will find out when we get to heaven that he actually did do. I know that he was non-stop going all the time to reveal the kingdom and talk about the kingdom, but there's a possibility he may have been baptizing people, but at this point in his life, that was his time to be announced, and that's what it was. It was an announcement of him in this world that he was baptized in water, and then the Holy Spirit showed up to confirm that. So I think it was very necessary, but as far as there was so many things I'm sure Jesus did do that I really can't wait until we can all see that in heaven. I'm sure we'll see it all happen. Yeah, it's going to be fun to see stuff that we never knew. I assume we'll still be curious once we get there what happened. I'd love to see some reenactments, or I think you said it's kind of like a video log. You can watch it. It is. It's like you can rewind it and play that scene again or something like that. It'd be awesome. Except it's not just like a video. It's like real. Oh, wow. It's really like that. It's not like a flat picture that you will watch. Even in the theaters I talked about, it's not just a flat thing on the screen. It's got it's like three or even four-dimensional sometimes. Really? Because you see the spirit realm and some of those things. So I'm quite sure the things that Christ did, we will see the spirit realm activity as well as the natural realm activity happening, which will be amazing. Very, very cool. Yeah, when I was at summer camp I taught, I was a staffer at summer camp for three years. Through that I met my wife, Doreen, but we had a thing called Walk Through the Bible. And every weekend then we would, all the staff would get in their Bible clothes and then the people would then walk around. It'd probably be a two-hour walk and they'd walk around and do 20 different scenes and the staff were all there and every time the horn would blow like the shofar, everyone would move ahead. The scene would be over. So we would act out the particular scene. Yeah, it was very fun. I always did the Jacob and Esau. I was the deceitful one. No, no, I did Jacob and Esau and then we did turning the water to wine. So I did, I traded off one year, so it was really fun. You know, that was a fun one to do because everyone was so hot. We turned water into wine and of course we served red punch. Let everybody have it because they were really hot. Anyway, it was fun. All right, so here's the next question. Don is asking this. It's funny that people ask that I would think, well, why would they ask that? But it's a real serious question. God's word says in Genesis 218, it's not good that man should be alone. So he created woman. Was he God saying it's not good for mankind to be alone or specifically males? That's the question. I think it had to include both because obviously if there was someone else there with them, they wouldn't, they would no longer be alone, you know. Right. And I think God did realize probably more than not be alone, he needed help. Yeah, we do that. We play on that part of the Adam and Eve thing because that's what God said. He needed help. He needed a help. Meet people. There you go. Adam needed help. And it probably didn't take God very long to figure out, well, I better do something extra, not that he didn't have Eve playing. I'm quite sure he had Eve playing. But I'm thinking he probably saw very well why, you know. I know in my husband, you know, if I'm not here, he probably doesn't always eat. So you need someone to cook, pick up, clean up, find what's lost. You know, I mean, I think those are some great things that almost every woman has had to do for their husband. And the husband of course, unless they're special, they would not be able to look in the refrigerator probably and find, I'm probably going to hear from people about this, but you know, it's true. It's true. I can't find it in the refrigerator. I don't see it. It's not there. And I move one thing. He goes, oh, there it is. Boy, that sounds so much like home here. So I think of God realized what he saw when he made the animals, right? Yeah. To each and I guess he figured, well, I better make him a help that you need somebody. Speaking of the helpmate and the woman, it says that God made man in his own image. And then it adds male and female made he that. That's right. So what's the deal? We see Father, Son, Holy Spirit. There's no female. I don't think that is actually what he was trying to say. Okay. That means mankind itself. That could be male or female. I think that was more like that. More like that than say, you know, make man in our image. Mankind was someone who could think on their own. They can make plans yourself. They had a soul that they could use to create. I see what you're saying. So when I see what I'm saying with him, and it says actually in the Bible, it says in the spirit, okay, there is no male or female. What that means is no, no, no dominion of one over the other in the spirit realm. You can be a king as a woman, or you can be the bride of Christ as a man. Right. As mankind, that was like mankind. Let's make me an hour image male and female. He made them to represent the fullness of a person. And I think that probably was what he meant more than there's somebody who's a female and that's God. And so the attributes, you know, the father carried us inside of him. And I think that's why he created as a way for man to come to the earth to be born to the womb of a woman. And he carried us himself. You know, that's where we lived. In him, we lived, we moved, we had our being. And I think it calls the father, even the fathers got different names of, you know, being the nurturing one and the caring one. And I think that the attributes that have to be displayed of the fullness of them, it probably would have to be male and female, not necessarily meaning that there would be a female God. Yeah. I mean, certainly for all time, the father had in mind that when we were all restored into heaven, all of us that received him, there would be men and women in heaven, who he had created for that purpose to be men and women in heaven. So that's interesting. Yeah. We have the sons and daughters. And I think if you look at it that way too, male and female are also sons and daughters. I said, just not husband and wife. Yeah. And we are sons and daughters. It talks about that in the Bible. But I think that mainly in more means that mankind itself, you know, a mankind can, like I said before, we can think on our own, we have a soul, we can be up with our God, we can choose whether with our mind and our emotions, what we want. So I think it was probably that there is no female God. I know that there is a spirit of wisdom and she is got a feminine image. So there are several of the key spirits in heaven, not that they're higher than anyone else, but I do know that there are some that have feminine images. Is that in fact, let's talk about that for a second, because Proverbs talks about wisdom a lot, a lot, a lot. Is it referring to not only the characteristic of having wisdom, but that spirit in heaven that has the. It actually calls wisdom a she. Yeah. That's what I was thinking it did. So yeah, it did. And she is coming in and she does have like a gown and stuff on and she does hair. And so she does not just that there are other also other there's many different spirits talking about them in the Bible. Okay, but wisdom is definitely one that is a feminine. Okay, that's very interesting. Yeah, that's very interesting. All right, let's say, okay, I'm going to ask this one. I wouldn't ask this myself because it's like hell is bad. I don't need to know any more about it, but this person's wants it. She said, Kat said that heaven is round and so is the earth round is is hell round too. That's what he wants to know. No, hell is not a planet. Hell is a spiritual place created in the spirit realm. It is the place where the wicked dead. That's their abode. That's where they go when they die. It's also supposed to be the abode of, you know, that's where hell is with all that hell right now. Abraham's wisdom would have been the different or the opposite of hell. It's where those kind of righteous by God. That's where they died when when they went, which was a beautiful place. And it was a great gulf that divided Abraham's bosom or paradise called the same thing, same thing in the Bible. And hell was quite a distance from there. And so those are both spiritual places. You couldn't go down there in the earth looking for them and find them. And and that's where the spirits of the dead, they would go either go to Abraham's bosom paradise, or they would go to hell. Well, I'm pretty, I'm getting to know you pretty good because I we talked about this question before you came on about whether hell was around. I said, cat's gonna say it's a spiritual place. Yes, I know you will. Okay. Lana is asking this after we get to heaven to live forever with Jesus, Jesus, the word who is the word I think she's saying, will our Bibles or special revelations we received while on earth be in our mansions? I know we wouldn't need these things, but but they're special treasures. So she's wanting to know Bibles or revelation that we receive. I suppose she means scrolls of revelation. I'm not sure what she exactly means by that. I think she's wanting to library with these things in it. Well, you know, I do know this, I do know that there are photographs that you took yourself that you love that are very special and precious to you. There are either copies of them or the same thing that those are hanging on the walls in your mansion. I know that much. So I can't answer that whole question. Yeah, I am quite certain that any revelations you got on earth, you would retain them. They wouldn't go away from you. That was something that was put in your soul and remains in your soul unless you take it out of there. So I'm quite sure all the revelation you got, the things you heard God say to you, encounters you had, you'll never lose those. Those will definitely be be going to heaven. Well, there's a lot, there's a massive massive library in heaven, I'm thinking, and our books of our life or our book of life is in heaven. We wait, what? Go to the library to read it or slash watch it. I think that's given to you personally. You keep that in your mansion. Okay, you would keep that one. Yes, you would. Okay, and I am fascinated with the photographs. You've mentioned that before and I'm thinking, to me, for some reason that it's the closest thing I've ever heard you say that is like having that part of earth. Like, for instance, if I have a family photo and we're at a picnic, I'm just making this up and everybody looks good and everybody's laughing and everybody's happy, maybe even a couple of our guests are there and I always love that picture. I'm just making it. And if that was in heaven, it just seems odd to be in heaven reminiscing about good old times at that picnic on earth. But is that, you don't forget the good things. You don't forget those. You don't take it the wonderful things and the beautiful things that you got to do with your family members or your good friends or stuff like that. Those are good memories then. Those are good memories. Those aren't taken from you. So why wouldn't you just have a picture of it? That's good. They do have photographs in heaven already. I mean, you already have other stuff on the walls of your mansion. Like when I was taken and I saw that son of that one prophet whom I will not mention, and he went into, I think it was his father's mansion. I think he was actually staying there. And when he walked down the hallway, he saw pictures of family members who weren't born yet. Oh, wow. Because they're outside of time. Yes. Wow. Yeah. They were still, they were young enough. The couple who had lost the son was young enough to still have children. And they had several family members that I personally knew were not on the earth at that time. And so these were people who were going to be born and they were in a family photo. They were all in a family photo. So if God were to allow it, okay, and I went to heaven right now, I might see my great grandchild's snapshot up there. Probably. With him and me or something like that. Yeah. Probably. Yes. Wow. That's pretty amazing. Pretty amazing. All right. Okay. I think I asked, okay, Mary's asking this, since we need to be born again in the spirit, okay, when does that the spirit that God knits together with in our, in our flesh in the womb become defiled or dead, thus requiring rebirth? So I guess you're saying God knits the spirit, our spirit with this, and she's wanting to know what about when we're born again in the spirit? I guess he's kind of wanting to know when did the first spirit get defiled such that we have to get born again? I'm not, I'm not even sure I know how that all works. I don't understand the question. I don't think that is the correct way to say that question. Yeah. I got born again at age four. Yeah. I mean, I didn't have an old defiled spirit he got rid of because I got born again. That is a process of giving yourself to Christ. Okay. That's what born again means. You're not the same you were before because now you have Christ living in you. It's that choice that you make to include him in your life that doesn't wipe out your spirit. You still have the same spirit. Your spirit is you and that is knit together at the time of conception, at the time of conception in the mother's womb, you know, in the mother, okay, at the time of conception, there's a little daughter flesh that forms and when that happens, the father sends your spiritual body, you down to earth and he attaches that in the womb to that daughter flesh or there would be no life until the spirit of life was added to Adam. There was no life at Adam's body was made. It was perfect. But then the father leaned over and breathed the spirit from himself into that body and it said he became a living soul. So without that, there would be no real life. So your life begins at the time of conception. Your angels are sent then waiting on you to be born. So I know that for sure. I know that's how that happened. Let me ask this occurs to me to ask this right now and I have a feeling someone's watching that's going to apply to because miscarriages are kind of common. A lot of people dream I had a miscarriage or dream had the miscarriage when so there was one child we have that we now believe is in heaven because I started understanding that when I read your first book. Can you try and talk to someone about what happens they they they're brand new, they're Christians or maybe they weren't even believers yet and suddenly they had a miscarriage and they had barely gotten a week or two along until they found out and then it was gone. Something happened. This guy to really take that almost nothing almost nothing. You know why it's something Steve because the spirit is there. So you can't say how small it is at the time of conception and when he says at that moment I knit you together in your mother's womb that's what he knit together that data flesh in your spirit at any time after that. Anytime I've seen a little tiny I've seen little babies big. Anytime after that should that child pass and not make the other way through. He definitely is going to come and get that little baby is still a baby and you will get that baby given to you when you get to heaven. Do you think you know there's been people that have had multiple miscarriages and there's but I think beyond that that one's easier to grasp but beyond that there must be people who have had miscarriages that it was so early on they don't even realize they had a miscarriage it would be that right and would they would they arrive in heaven and suddenly realize I've got children? Absolutely I happen to know that for a fact that that is what happens because when life begins it is a life and whoever's carrying that child that is their child and God's not going to ignore it he's one who knitted together he took that little child's spiritual body yeah took it from himself and nicked it to the mother's womb and then it became a real person that was a real person that was that baby and whether it's a week two weeks four weeks however long that is if that baby for whatever reason does not make it to full term then yes that baby will be waiting for them in heaven. Well I have a question to ask and Kim Clement wrote a song it was it was a post 9-11 it was about the loss of life in the Twin Towers and especially the children that were taken and one of the song lyrics goes he's singing about the children that were lost and he sings has a line that says I will give them back to you I never I never asked him about it I don't know what that means would God ever take a lost child and and re give it to this parents in the form of of the next birth anything like that how hard have you been thinking Steve absolutely correct is it absolutely correct and I'm not the only one who knew that uh there's somebody that he needs on this earth that is so important he will sometimes actually take it and then put it back in himself and then he will resend it at a different time send it back to the same people yes he does every now and then he does that I know Kim Clement actually did know that himself he knew that oh wow wow and I know for sure but he had me tell somebody that and really had yeah I said God's not done with that child so he will if he wants you to know that he has taken it back into himself it was she wasn't very far along at all and uh that he will send the baby back because he needs that baby he needs you to be the parent he needs that baby here and so can I drill down a little bit on that dream I were talking about something else and we were about embracing the love of God and I had said I kept saying God doesn't just want to embrace you he needs to we were just and for some reason I knew that God needed to do that and had to do with God's love and who he is so what do you mean by he needs this person I mean he can create anybody at any time what can you try and define why does he need this child he knows from you have to understand he's been carrying us before the earth was made yeah before this earth you're sitting on or you're living on was made you were already in God in him you were in him we've all all been from the beginning to the end because God has been there and we were with him we were never not in him and he's still sending them to the earth to be born on the earth and he has got his own timeline and the things he has mapped out himself that will happen and there are people he chose sometimes in the lineage and said I will put this one here I'll put this one here 20 years later this will be here 30 years later this is how he plans he plans things and so if if the enemy however reason or whatever happens tries to stop that from happening you know at the time of when Moses was born they were trying you know fairly right when he was born so he was starting to get rid of them he didn't want that person to be born but that person was born correct Moses was born and even the same thing with christ they had to go hide why because they were trying to eliminate all of them because somebody special is coming the enemy knew what that would be the devil knew that they were coming and so he tried to stop that or prevent that from happening and yet christ was born christ did did come to the earth and was living living so that there are other people that he has on purpose chosen and he will not choose another he just will not choose another wow and i've had of course people who are don't know what they're saying say to me you know well i believe god chose seven men before he chose you but they said no that's totally incorrect that is incorrect people i was chosen out of a long line seven seven different generations of people i was chosen out of that family line to be here for the very purpose that i'm doing now he chose me to do it and yeah i'm there's 15 kids in our family i was chosen for certain reasons out of that out of that that generation of people and he wouldn't pick someone else and he told me he wouldn't pick someone else so i hold on oh oh well that's the second time i've done that on the air that's let it be there are some times he just will not pick someone else yeah i like that i like and by the way i mean when someone was probably trying to make you feel good by saying he took he he he offered it to seven men first and then he whatever they thought they were accomplishing but that would if that even if that were somehow true that would have that would have be a picture of a very unpowerful god who tried seven times and failed yeah you're right seven seven times it worked anyway okay let's see let's see um let's see diana is asking this i know you have said we have spiritual authority over our homes and workplaces but do i have the same authority in prayer and sending the host to my former workplace even though i have no longer work there okay that's the question i think that would depend on where that workplace is number one because i know where you live is one of the strongest regions you rule in and i think that probably that might make a difference um or for you know you can you can probably send the host almost anywhere you want to to try to protect people or help people uh no matter where they are but your family's a little bit different when you're sending them to protect your your individual family that you live with that you're that you're totally connected to but i don't think there's anyone god wouldn't approve of you sending them to do something for them i have a question that relates kind of like that and that has to do with the soul ties i've had many people over the years when we're getting inner healing or whatever they'll say well steve you need to break this soul tie with this person or you have an unhealthy soul tie with that person um so i guess i want to ask you number one is that does that seem truthful true to you and number two if a person if i let's say i'm overly concerned about this relative and and i just want them to get saved but i worry about it so my soul is there an unhealthy soul tie i can have towards even a loved one like being too concerned that it's my job to pray them in is there an unhealthy aspect i don't think that would count as an unhealthy soul tie uh steve i think that's your you really care and love for them and unhealthy one is where there's abuse okay yeah that's abuse and i understand all that because i've i've been an intercessor most of my life most of my grown life and we did that in groups so we would get together and we would pray for people but if we minister like it would i i didn't ever minister on a platform before i did any of this but sometimes there would be groups of people in the church we would pray we have special prayer meetings people come forward for prayer um and we saw that because i've always been a seer but there were other people in the intercessor group that also could see things on people and we knew that they had an unhealthy soul tie and there was severe abuse and um they had gotten free of the person but they hadn't they hadn't broken that soul tie it's very important to do that because when you break a soul tie in the name of jesus christ then that that person or that tie can have no effect on you i know a lot of people don't understand that when you create a soul tie that's because of a close relationship a physical relationship there's certain things that would qualify for you to have a soul tie you don't have a soul tie with everybody obviously there's not just people you have soul ties with sometimes there's places you make soul ties with oh interesting healthy places and need to break that soul tie something you can't stop thinking about you want to be a part of or is a part of your life if it's got darkness in it that's a soul tie you made possibly you don't want to keep that soul tie if you're living people who are in the darkness influence you on a regular basis and you you like that person for whatever reason then you should break that soul tie but it always has some kind of abuse or darkness in it and what i would see sometimes is i would see like if i would look at somebody and i saw like it would almost be like a rope coming out of them but it would be twisted really looked at somebody that to me that is a twisted soul tie that means there's abuse there's control it could be drugs that they're on it could be all kinds of things that they had created you can create a soul tie with stuff or things also like drugs like pornography and it controls you has a way to control you you have to break that and you actually have to say i choose in my world to break that soul tie and you say what it is in jesus name i no longer will have anything to do with it i will not not be a part of that anymore if you want that broken and then that is literally broken in the spirit and it cannot affect you in any way whatsoever anymore you know i've had people in my life just on one hand i suppose that i i had to forgive over and over and over until it became complete because it would keep coming back yeah the the feelings have hurt if if i'd forgiven someone over and over and it comes back is there a potential soul tie that needs to be broken that would help that or is it just there possibly could be there could possibly be okay cool um sanders asking is there a special place in the heaven or a special honor given interesting questions people have this is interesting especially or a special honor given to animals that were sacrificed as a part of the old testament atonement such as the spotless labs that were offered uh or the scapegoat okay so that's the question is there a special i mean yeah what are your thoughts on that that sanders wanting to know i do know that god loves creatures also not as important as we are of course there i do know that he does have a special place in this however creatures now we think probably anything that had had paid a price would their life or something like that i'm pretty sure that they're in heaven that's good that's good all right angela is asking do people who follow their genealogy as a hobby on earth get to do genealogy searches in heaven or continue pursuing this hobby in heaven i don't think you need to pursue anything they'll be showing up at the gate to meet you yeah everybody's there right i'm curious about that they will be there and say i'm this i'm your family i'm a family member from like you know two three thousand years ago i was part of your family and and i just want to say hi welcome to heaven they literally would do that i'm from 500 years ago i know you don't know me but and then they look a lot like you especially that does happen also interesting but you don't have to look for anybody they will be looking for you it's a non-needed hobby then that's right and you said uh not that many episodes ago that everybody has their own unique vibration and people hear or sense you coming i just i i mean it sounds like you there would be like millions and millions of different vibrations is literally there's an identifiable something that comes off a person so you'd know they're they're even walking up is that what you know i'm quite sure that they're i absolutely know you know when enic is coming because his is very very powerful um and you just learn how to connect that with them when when you probably meet them for the first time to see it you'll never forget that it's sometimes something you hear always something that you feel it's interesting very very interesting all right we're all right faith is asking the scientists and inventors on earth have to experiment and fail to create new things given that we will still create in heaven is there the potential for inventions to fail in heaven on the first few attempts of making something new or does everything work the first time because things are perfect in heaven interesting question i'm gonna just use the scripture or to back up but i'm gonna say okay i'm quite sure that you will learn to create things and i always will tell people you will not create people that's just not ever gonna happen god's not gonna have that you're not gonna have your own race of people and start out start life on a whole new planet you wouldn't want it anyway but in the word of god it says that when the when the when the when the father and the word created together and that's mainly how they did everything yes the word made everything there was ever makes that was his part the father would speak something this is when there was nothing else in the father would speak what he wanted the word would step out of god and that wasn't his living place it's just when you they were gonna go create sometimes and then the word would make it and this is what the bible says if he liked it it remained in other words if god liked the way it looked you know he said he wanted it the word stepped out and made it and it says if you liked it it remained if not it just went away it says that in the bible so that was i guess they're practicing on something and maybe that was an apple tree let's just say for instance or something like that maybe they were thinking about making something together and uh so if it didn't quite turn out it would just go away then they would remake it probably today liked it now where did you say that's in the bible that you'll have to find it it god usually tells me to tell people why don't you search for things that shouldn't be that hard to find okay okay hard to find anybody finds it that's that that if you liked it it remained and if you didn't like it it did not remain interesting not talking about people i'll talk about people but no different things okay yeah interesting stuff okay john's asking this are there treasuries in heaven and how can we withdraw from our heavenly accounts to use here on earth well i can't tell you exactly how to do that i do know that if it it probably has a lot to do probably with the way you're living your life maybe or what you would want those things for if it was what you wanted the money for that's very important to god if it's not to just waste it on yourself that doesn't mean you can't get things for yourself i'm saying you don't want money just so you can have greed right that's very key and anybody asking for any kind of money or stuff like that but god doesn't mind you being rich by the way it says christ became poor that happened when he left heaven he was not poor on the earth okay he left heaven to come to earth it says he became poor that means he left heaven so we might be rich rich in money rich in many other things you know because as the body of christ we should be over things we shouldn't have to fit with poverty or things like that i'm hoping people don't have a poverty mentality kick that out if you do and start thanking god for the blessings and i think gratefulness and thankfulness has a lot to do with those kind of things like um asking god for those things or wanting those things from god i know gratitude for he's already given you or just a grateful heart has it goes a long way with with getting stuff from god like that so to further on that question is if your heart was right if john's heart was i just really want i've always wanted to feed the poor and yeah i might build a nicer home but i really want to feed the poor throughout the earth and can i contend with god to open the treasuries of heaven for my family line so that i can do that is that an appropriate i think i think that would be something that would be perfectly fine to say to god okay good good good all right kimberley's asking adam and eve were placed in the garden of eden what was taking place outside of the garden was everything perfect everywhere until adam and eve gave into temptation that's one thing i've wondered too what was you know i don't know how big the garden was i think it was probably a pretty good size but now you have to remember it says he made a garden east of eden right and i know we all call it the garden of eden yeah we do that's what we named it but it says it was east of eden what eden was a city it was a city that had been made on the earth for whatever reason god had wanted it there the garden he planted and made for adam and eve was east of that place so there were other places i don't know much else about that except that i know that there were other places that god had put on the earth because he enjoyed them or loved them when he was making the earth so wow that's that is true it does say that so all right um bek uh let me make sure i'm not skipping anything here bek is asking when we get to heaven will we be able to watch movies of jesus growing up that's her question i'm quite sure we will all be seeing those movies of jesus growing up that'll be fun i want to see him uh i'd love to know to what extent if he never sinned and every kid sins every kid you know it has to be uh punished or disciplined was jesus would could you see jesus being disciplined without having sin in order to do it you know what i mean in other words that's that he was without sin so yeah yeah so but i mean is there a discipline that is there a discipline that he might have to undergo that didn't require him sinning to have to be another word he was corrupted by joseph that's what i'm asking kind of because in training and he was not just a son he wasn't like a son to him he wasn't of course his father he was he was the one that got to raise him but even in training in training him to do things and do them right i'm sure that there was times he probably got got some maybe some it would be better if you did it this way you know there is a scripture that says jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered that is in the word so so there was an obedience that he had to learn but it wasn't because he was sinning no i don't think it was because he was sinning so all right annie is asking this cat i'm starting to discern and hear others thoughts i've heard of other seers able to do the same please explain this gift and if you've experienced this god knows the thoughts and intents of the heart is he offering us this same gift that's your question i think that depends on how close you get to god himself um he has allowed me to hear the thoughts of people in meetings or even see into people's souls i mean i don't to me that wasn't strange not for me yeah i'm sure that's probably not normal for everybody but i think the more time you give to god and the more you know him i think there's something that just happens by the hand of god yeah you know along that line of what you've always been able to do um i know some people uh we probably would know this one too but she said she would say well this is for everybody and this gift is for everybody and then she would describe all of these seer type gifts and i see angels and here's these diamonds that are gold and here's some feathers and all the different things uh that she just kind of lives in this thing and she said this is for everybody but she is operating as a seer yeah and other people can live their whole life and not have something show up on their bed that was lost you know yes i understand so is it so is it so is it really not quite accurate for her to say this is for everybody it's almost it almost comes off as well then what's wrong with me since it's not happening to me you see what i mean i think some people desire things some people don't desire things number one not everybody wants the same thing even if things are available for them or some people don't want to pay the price it takes to have those things or to be accountable for those things that could be a very detailed answer given i do know there are some things that are available for everybody and that is to know jesus christ is your savior you know to know him as a friend to know him as your king to rule and reign with christ that's available anybody who wants to pursue that so there are some things that are i wouldn't go so far as to say that everything is yeah yeah it seems like um the there i know many many seers now and they seem to operate in very similar giftings but the people around them don't you know it just yeah all right amberlyn is the name says you've talked about how demons vomit on people at the end entrance of bad or evil movies at the movie theater as they walk in are there angels that stay at the entrance of good family faith-based movies at the movie theater and if so do they release anything i think yeah anytime anything that you would watch you would have something to do with christ or some importations going on in the movie or the or to reveal the you know the the presence or the the relationship that christ wants you i'm quite sure that there's blessings attached to that okay um and on the vomiting thing um i guess i want to know how extensive or okay let's say someone goes to a pg movie and it's pretty good all the way through and then there was one scene that maybe shouldn't have been in there is is a demon standing there ready to vomit the ones that i've seen or had been like our regular ones stuff over those theaters those are the ones that i've noticed being there not not the other one i see okay so it's kind of a degree you have to say oh father forgive me for seeing that or i lose that from my soul if you don't want to keep an image or something that was said and you're in a movie and it didn't advertise that that was in it you definitely need to not keep that in your soul yeah yeah okay melanie's asking this you said god puts a mark on us in heaven what is the purpose of the mark in heaven again so it's like i guess you're saying that god after someone graduates and goes home to be with the lord then god will put a mark on some others or what in the bible he will put the name of the name of the city of your god will be put in your forehead and the name of your god in the palm of your hand and those are things that he does for everybody who comes in okay okay yep it's in the word isn't it all right i mean so she she's saying what's the purpose of it it's just that that's what he chooses to do right he's just do it because you belong to him okay you've given yourself to him so you mark all right we're making progress here michael's asking this please explain the trinity oh that that only took two years please explain the trinity scripture says says one god scripture says there's one god yet many prophets speak of three manifested is it one god manifests three ways that's his question it is the godhead it's called the god the godhead is the trinity that's what he is and yes as father son and holy spirit and yes they make up that that means they're the ones who rule everything that's what that means they are the head of all of heaven and that's why it's called the godhead or the trinity it's the same thing they have the ability to step inside of each other and step out of out of each other if they want to that's why it's also called the three in one there would be the father on the throne christ gets up steps inside the father holy spirit comes and steps out of the father that is the three in one and that is exactly how they explain that to me and showed it to me or and is it just as possible that the god i that if you went on a trip to heaven and god said the three of us want to talk with you and sitting on three chairs his father son holy spirit okay okay so either one of those has that ever has that ever happened to you yet by the way the three of them at the same time yes what yes on earth and really all three okay that's very cool anything else you any details they came and saying to me on my birthday when i was 55 wow very cool got wow very cool that's precious all right paul is asking did god create adam because he was lonely we know he created e because adam was lonely he created he created every because that was always his plan okay all those spirits living inside of him he didn't plan to keep them in there forever people they were to be made that's why the earth was actually created so we could have a physical body okay so we can be with him on the outside and not continue to live on the inside that's as basic as you can get that's good that's good all right diana is asking cat cat mentioned that satan did not recognize jesus because as a man he looked different than what he did when he was the word in heaven did satan ever realize who jesus really was she said he was okay at one point where he said i am he or something like that yes yes yes he knew them but until then he kept searching well you have to understand the word did not have a physical body and he did not look like that because he came from when god made him flesh when the word was made flesh that was jesus tribes right yeah would have an image different in his flesh body but he was willing to keep that body forever so he was willing to change his very appearance he was willing to change his appearance because he knew if he did this if he came and died for us that means he'd have to come in the flesh he'd have to have a flesh body it was different than his spiritual body your spirit man when it goes into that died of flesh your spirit man takes on the image of that body that's why people look like their parents their grandparents that's why that's why that happened and so you know mary had an image right yeah father had an image too by the way you know jesus had you said flesh and blood doesn't inherit the kingdom of heaven it says i don't know if that means so does that mean we don't have this what about what does jesus have in heaven he's still flesh in heaven right but also that's different yeah but is it glorified flesh because he's because he kept his humanity or what yeah okay his body was glorified because when he was when he died on the cross and his spiritual body went down into um abraham's bosom and then he crossed over to hell so he could tear up hell before he came back up when he came out of that grave he was instantly his body was glorified it was glorified but he still it even then it changed him a teeny bit because you remember some people didn't recognize him on the road yeah speaking to him but um but yeah he he looked totally different than what he was in the spirit one and and of course we know that um this for living in heaven he knew what he looked like that's why he kept asking to try to find out who he was but he wouldn't say it then when when jesus you know now that jesus is in heaven forever you know preeminent everything you do every word you could pick is he somehow still his mother's son at the same time he's her savior i mean have you seen this the mother's son relationship in heaven with which jesus or what i see a savior relationship just that yeah just savior relationship he has the memory of course of who she is he knows she carried him of course i'd say it's a special relationship but but he he had that's what he gave him gave her to john said john behold your mother and demerie behold your son because he had to die as her savior not as her son okay well okay all right my phone's messed up all right let's see where i am here uh we're burning through these good we may actually get this whole list today let's see how we're doing here Cheryl's asking this can you please explain what this scripture means matthew 1112 and it says quote and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force i've always believed this was regarding spiritual warfare and i still think that but i don't understand how the kingdom of heaven can suffer violence god doesn't let evil in heaven right yeah that's not what that means right okay that's not what that means the kingdom of heaven calls forth that word suffers in that scripture means to call forth and the holy spirit took me back and he said see this scripture here suffer the little children come on to me that scripture right there means call them have them to call them forth so how i have them to come the kingdom of heaven calls forth spiritual violence in you because you have authority over the enemy so that is not about heaven being attacked by people okay yeah so it just means uh but but when it's the kingdom of heaven is really talking about really primarily that scriptures about what's going on here on the earth right now right the kingdom of heaven on earth suffers violence because heaven itself maybe i i'm thinking she's confusing also that with heaven itself because because she adds god doesn't let evil in heaven right so she's connecting right she's right she's right that he doesn't let evil in heaven yeah but this is the kingdom of heaven calls forth spiritual violence from the inside of us okay that's not like bad violence that's like the wrath of god and stuff to stand up against for this evil okay good good good all right jp jps one of my husband's greatest joys and passion in life here was when he was a police officer now that he's in heaven i can't help but wonder what he might be doing being there is no need there's no need for policing in heaven because he loved it so much and it was a big part of who he was does the father still use that probably directing traffic yeah what because what do police officers do in heaven do they need directing traffic yeah possibly yeah it sounds like because you've talked about what you'll do in heaven is your gift but it sounds like he loved his work so much it was his gift or he had a hobby that he didn't talk about okay so normally your gift is usually your hobby your job is not usually your your gift yeah unless you are a gifted singer and you sing then an inventor who who does it has work and it's his hobby he would do if he made nothing he'd still be an inventor yeah so um right samantha is asking how do i pray for my children to be delivered from drinking depression suicide and for their salvation i would say the way that uh you know most people already you do that you number one you pray that they will be free in jesus name you those are the some that you can command the host who's having to pull down strongholds of that stuff that's building up around your children that would be the best thing to do i would say pull down the strongholds yes strongholds get in their lives and they don't need to be there that there's one of the reasons why the host right there is to pull those down that they won't be able to affect them anymore is there um i just want to ask this is there a sense where a mom i'm not saying that samantha is this person but i'm saying could a mom be find themselves in a judgmental place about this child and this child and this child so that their prayers are a little less effect because they're judging them for this and this any thoughts about that i don't really have any no okay just okay just praying for it okay yeah right all right uh ann asks i'm a feeler and lately i've noticed that when i walk into a room there are times in a certain spot i feel hot another place it feels cold cat have you felt different temperatures when you enter when entering a room if so what does that mean to you i don't really um i don't really notice temperatures and stuff like i know james call talks about he's a feeler but i haven't heard him talk about it much so so are you a feeler or mainly a seer i'm a seer you see things so you'll see where a demon is or an angel is or yeah okay uh okay lauren's asking this can you taste colors in heaven um i do know that you can taste flavors you can taste aromas and the aromas have colors aromas have colors so that that type of thing goes on all over having so many different things that you wouldn't expect to be there are there they're amazing okay can you taste colors uh there's a yeah there's a song chris rice i think is a smell it's called smell the color nine it's interesting okay jules is asking we're down to the last two questions here uh jules asked cat when i pray there are times i see a physical feather manifest does seeing feathers physically appear always mean angels are present sometimes it does i think most of the time it probably would mean that okay and last on the list this is the first time we've ever completed the list so here you know faith is asking this what are some practical ways that we can start establishing the culture of heaven on earth you have uh one simple everyday example i would have to say invite heaven number one you know most people don't wake up the morning and start thinking what is god what would god want what would he want to say what he would what would he like to have happen in my life and i always thought that out i would say father i want whatever you want for me whatever that means but i do want to create a habitation for heaven in my home that means you're not going to play bad stuff watch bad stuff say bad stuff so you actually have to adapt your life to want something like that because heaven's not going to hang around where profanity is where where hate is where arguing is it's like a lifestyle change you have to decide to make yourself if you want that to happen but we do have a lot of angels here most of the time and they do come and go but uh it's because of the way we order our lives that's good that's good yeah you've always been very consistent about that well cat um talk for a moment about what people can get revealing heaven dot com and when we close out i'm going to remind people as we close i'm going to play that clip that i promised to play but i'll say goodbye to you first but uh tell me what they can get revealing heaven dot com and cat her dot com well now revealing heaven dot com is our main website it explains to you uh who i am the things that i do and also where you can find products is where you can find about events okay now cat's just frozen for me is it just me she's frozen she's same here she's gone now did you kick her out or she just disappear so we're waiting i'm waiting for a cue from the team are we waiting for her to come back or i'll tell you what if she's gone by the time she comes back we'll just be saying goodbye why don't you why don't we close guys by playing that clip i promised to play for you and we'll just close with that this is cat talking about the round earth so um so go ahead and play that and this will close with that here we go there's so much i could say but the bottom line is there's this thing going around about the flat earth talk talk to the people about this thing and what what does god put on your heart to say about all these people believing in the flat earth first of all talk a little bit about what they think it is what they think it is not what it is okay right someone had it in their head it always starts with a thought in somebody's head a man's had not god okay obviously uh so what they do when they think well i really for some reason i believe and some of them can use ancient maps from when people cross the ocean and they actually would draw at that time they drew it flat they didn't know they have no conception of how to draw like a curved earth and show a map with the water and the travel um uh the travel route of where they were going to go so it made sense to draw just a flat thing and then show the ship it going ship going across and a lot of the charts were made like that way back then some are even still made that way it's just out of convenience but whenever these thoughts come usually it's the enemy and i have to tell you the enemy sometimes doesn't just give wicked thoughts he gives stupid ones i have to say stupid because yeah if he can't get you to go into sin if he can't get you to fall apart and just you know dissolve and give up your whole life then he will get you distracted and some of the biggest distractions going on in the earth right now are some of the most ridiculous things and but this flat earth thing they consider it a thing it's a society which means it's a group of people who've dedicated themselves to prove the earth is flat millions of dollars have been wasted on that and i know you'll say what about mass or what about all that stuff i'll address that in a minute but they will come back to you i know people who got out of it and i mean literally got out of it they had to call say i'm they had to call and say i'm no longer part of this take me off of the roll don't cut me in anymore i'm not throwing my money away because they had revelation from god the earth is round okay a world is round okay and the earth is a shadow and a type of heaven so the earth and the planters are styled after heaven itself heaven is a world before the flat earth thing came up probably somebody who believed in the middle earth decided to make it a flat earth because they could never prove there was a middle earth earth there was a whole middle earth society probably maybe 50 years ago or before that a little bit that they believed because the bible talked about descending and they talked about abraham's bosom or paradise and so people began to look for paradise and there was a whole group unfortunately started here in florida there were the middle earth people middle earth society and they said if they walked along the beach far enough it was a downward thing they would then enter into the middle earth well we know that's a joke just like the flat earth society is a joke and i think because they could never find middle earth they decided to call it a flat earth and therefore they began to search the scriptures to find what things they could make to find to prove the earth was flat and they came up with two different ones which don't mean at all what they say they mean uh number one if you don't have revelation from the father part of the word is talking about the spirit realm it isn't always talking about this natural realm there's a scripture that talks about the four corners of the earth and that is one of the main ones they these in this flatter society see there's corners that means it has to be flat it can't be round and the first time i heard that i was like i was in shock i laughed out loud when you do realize that scripture is talking about the north south east and west those are directions that has nothing to do with the earth is flat whatsoever and and then there's another one that talks about the the columns there's columns or pillars that are holding up under the earth and so they say look it's flat it's sitting on a table like thing there's a structure with legs on it and do you not realize that those two pillars are angels that are talked about in the book of genesis where when their time comes they're thousands of feet tall if you ever could go to the spirit realm you would see uh that they're there they're waiting waiting for what well it talks about in the bible in the last days when one angel will put one foot in the middle of the ocean and in the middle of the land it says it very clearly and that's what one of those columns or pillars are sometimes those are angels and having been passed and out above the earth i can see the two angels standing there but i did need to give you a scripture that says jesus sits above the circle of the earth so let all of the flat earth be flushed down the toilet where it belongs because this is a world made by the hands of god handmade by him for the purpose of sending us from himself that we would come into this natural realm and have a physical body that we would keep with us through all eternity so basically that's it

Well, I'm wishing you a happy Wednesday on Tuesday. We were recording this on Tuesday, December 6th. You will see this in the morning. So happy Wednesday to you. I'm Steve Schultz, founder along with my wife of both the Elijah List and Elijah Streams. We are in year 25 of bringing you the voice of the prophets. So welcome to the broadcast. We're going to bring Kat on in just a few moments. I'll just give what your appetite for this, I'll tell your friends. A lot of people miss the Israel tour with Kat that is this spring, and they just really wanted to do the event with her. We're about to announce her cruise that will take place in August, but you got to be first in on this stuff too if you missed it. You want to go on a cruise with Kat. This is the day. So text your friends, email your friends, whatever, text your email or all of the above. So all right, we're going to read with Kat in just a moment, but first this message. And a few more weeks. We will be up to 77 wells in Uganda alone, not counting what we've done in Nepal. We're looking at some other wells in Ethiopia. So this is all your donations to us. You know, first and foremost, it runs the organization and the 24 employees here. But then when we have extra, then, you know, we're looking at what you give is kind of like a tide, if you will. And so we then tied on out to these causes and God is really, really busting this ministry for it. So you are helping us have the favor of God on us because you're giving us and a lot of that we're then tithing on out to, to provide water. Over 1000 people have been saved over six, eight church plants there. So in Uganda, just because of the water. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So all right, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Kat, so we have a cruise. We got to talk about a cruise. Okay. Talk about it. And then after, after you say if you, oh, there it is, we can go back and forth between the flyer. And let's just tell people as you talk, this is the flyer for it. And we're going to put a number on the bottom. If you want to put that there, Michael, some of you might want to write that down real quick because we'll go back and forth between Kat and this flyer. Yeah. You go to heavenlycruises.com or these, this phone number that they will answer that at heavenlycruises and they know you're calling because they want to fill up that particular. They just, we're just announcing it. Don't miss out. Some of you missed out on the Israel tour with Kat. So Kat, say anything else you want to say about the cruise and what you do. This is going to be a really wonderful Caribbean cruise. It's my favorite part of the Caribbean. And I want to thank Pastor Sharon of heavenlycruises. We've done quite a few cruises with her, so this will be another great one. You don't want to miss this one. And it's got St. Thomas and it's got my better side of the Caribbean. I'm not crazy about the Western Caribbean. I love the Eastern Caribbean. I think that the places are much better to go to. The people are happier there. Really? The beauty of the beauty in Splendor. I think on St. Thomas, one half of that whole island is French and the food is absolutely like in heaven. Wow. And the other half of that whole island is Dutch. So you actually get to see two different countries just by visiting that one place. It's just one of the places we'll go to. And so it's going to be real exciting. We'll have awesome worship. Of course, I'll be speaking. We'll definitely have our greeting, or what do you call that, Jess? Meet. Our meet and greet place where we get to meet everybody on the cruise before we ever go anywhere. I love doing that. I mean, that happened because people were trying to find me all over the ship and it made it much better if I just said, here I am. That's good. Let me say something to Michael because Michael, as the show goes on, let's leave HeavenlyCruises up.com. But if you can fit it and say heavenlycruises.com with Kat and anything like that, I would go across the screen. You can decide what you can or can't do. I won't micromanage it. You know that never works out good if I try to micromanage anything. So anyway, this is really good, Kat. So I'm very excited to help promote this. A lot of people were really disappointed and they didn't get into the Israel tour because they want to be with Kat. So this is their chance to do that. This is a chance to go. And like I said, it's definitely the better side of the Caribbean. And even the atmosphere in these places are wonderful. The things to do with your family, a lot to do on the ship, a lot to do on shore. You won't regret coming. And I will look forward to seeing every single person to make sure you sign up pretty quick. Yeah. Absolutely. Do they still do? Is it Sharon? Is that her name? Yeah, Pastor Sharon. Pastor Sharon, do they still do the thing with HeavenlyCruises where they bring people in on one of the other days at sea and then they prophesy over them? Are they doing that still? We usually have a prophetic team on board. Okay. We have a prophetic team that actually has real prophetic meetings. I don't know if they teach you how to prophesy, but they do have classes. You have, I think, prayer time, also during that whole week, and sometimes we have a surprised guest. I'm just going to say that. I won't say anything about it. Okay. I'm not going to say anything about it, but it will be absolutely wonderful and definitely a wonderful time to go to hear God, to know what God is saying, you know, every day that you're there. And it's just going to be a wonderful time, especially if your family gets to come. You're going to love it. That's good. Good. Good. Yeah. Even the thing, I won't say the names either, but even on the Israel tour, there's some surprise guest that we've been pre-announced. So that's on the Israel tour. And then if you're having that on the cruise as well, that's whoever, you know, anyway, it's going to be fun. We're doing, we've got some real bonding time. You and me doing the Israel trip before and Captain Bing comes with you and that's going to be fun. Will, will Bing, Captain Bing be with you on the cruise on this one? Absolutely. Yes. I'm pretty positive he will be, especially anywhere in the Caribbean, if there's any chance of him going fishing anywhere while he's on that cruise or on shore, he's definitely going to be doing that. That's good. Good. Good. All right. Well, I've got a bunch of questions on heaven and all other things biblical, but do you have anything on your heart before I get into questions? It's just so many exciting things happening that people have already heard about, you know, things that have happened with the court, things that have happened with other people. And I know some of the races will not really what everybody thought they would be, but do you remember what I said to you? Remember I said, don't count on the midterm elections to change everything. I knew that wouldn't do it. I know there will be some great changes that happen because of that, but God's got a lot more than that plan that he intends to do. Good, good, good. Good stuff. So all right. Well, if you're ready for questions, we have an hour today. We're 10 minutes into our hour just for time to say, because I know you've got a thing you've got to get to. So a seven year old Ethan is asking this question, are there nerve guns in heaven? I want to have a Nerf war with Jesus in heaven one day. That's his. Jesus probably would want to have that Nerf war with you because he likes to play with all of the kids a lot. And I wouldn't be surprised. And if not, maybe that's something you will create yourself up there. Oh, cool. Very, very cool. Okay. All right. Now, Tammy's asking, now that was the one child question I have. So this was a question that has actually has occurred to me before, but I've never asked it. But Tammy's asking, are we all children of God, whether we're saved or not, or do we just become children of God when we get saved? I think I know that while we carried him, we were called his sons and daughters. You know, and I know it is, of course, it's very important to make sure you receive Christ as your savior through some time throughout your life here on earth as the whole purpose really of heaven being there is to make a place for you to be able to come back to the father. I just know that the father carried all of us inside of him and at the time of conception our spirit is nipped together in the mother's womb, that's what the Bible says. So I would think he is your original father, really, the one who carried you, who was with you the most before you ever came to this earth, his very greatest desire is to have everybody come home to him, that's really what he would like to see happen. Do you, let me ask it this way too, because this might be a partial answer to that, that was coming at it from another angle. If every child born on this earth is assigned at least one and sometimes two angels, I think you've said, then aren't those two angels being assigned to these yet unsaved children, if we can put it that way, because they are all God's children? Absolutely, yes, and I do know this, that every child goes to heaven. There's not a child left on earth or left to go to the other place. All children go to heaven, and that is, I'm quite sure, an opportunity somewhere in there. I know that even when they arrive, even little babies, not that they have to, to be able to get back into heaven or get into heaven, but they want to know Jesus Christ as a savior. And of course, at the time of conception, your angels are sent then from heaven, and they'll be with you your entire life watching over you, guarding you. They may even perhaps sometimes say things to you, you may not even realize it's them, but that's their whole purpose for being there, is to help you to get to know Christ, that you are protected and kept. So I think that you matter that much to the Father, He does that even before you realize even what angels are or anything is. So yes, that is when your angels are sent from heaven, your guardian angels are sent at the time of conception. Let me ask one further thing, when children, if they were suddenly killed or something, they would simply go to heaven, whether they're Muslim or any other thing, they would go because they're a child. When they become an adult, and now they're 18 years old or 20, and now let's say some, one of them is becoming a criminal, whether it's a terrorist or there's just a criminal. What are their angels doing? The angels apparently have to give them freedom of choice. So then what are the angels doing, protecting them? There are other ways they can influence them, really. And they may not even know that who's influencing them, they'll actually say to them, I shouldn't go in there. They'll say it like, I shouldn't go in there, but I wouldn't go in there or maybe I shouldn't go in there is probably what they would say. They can be things like that to influence them, to help influence them, let them know, this might not be a good place, I didn't think about that. And so it's really their thought lives that they can impact by saying things that God would say to them. Did you know, I believe God loves me, I think I need to know about God. And so there are ways that they can influence them and help to steer their direction. Sometimes they do just save their life. That's interesting. I want to ask a question that's related to that because you just, you're going to play it to see if I can pull it up. I'm not sure if I can. It's going to be too complicated. I'll pull it, I'll write it up in a different time. Okay. Okay. Michael is asking this, again, I don't know ages of how old, if a bodybuilder like Arnold Schwarzenegger goes to heaven, will he have the physique of a normal guy or would he still appear to be all these muscles and muscle bound, if you know? I don't think your spiritual man has a lot of muscles. You have a spiritual body and it is you and it looks like you, but of course you're young. And I think most people are overtaken by that. You're not really into, well, I don't have a lot of muscles right now because they don't have the physical body. Your physical body is the muscle part. Okay. Your spiritual body is your mind, your will, your emotions, and you do have a body of arms and legs. You can learn. You can do all kinds of things. Of course you can eat food, which is a good thing also. And so, but your spiritual body is really not thought of even in the same way and heaven is on the earth. You can still do fun things, create things, make things, take people to fun places, create fun places along, you know, whatever your gift is. I just got to go to that gift thing. Yeah. So if, but if someone says, let's say they're not working out because you're a spiritual being, but some people on earth, some guys were six and a half feet tall and they were big built just by, from birth. They didn't have to work on it. They were just big guys that could lift. They were probably, they would, it says you'll be known as your known Steve. So recognizing you were known, you wouldn't be a little wispy, skinny, nothing. Okay. If that makes you feel better, if you were tall and big, then you would be tall and big in heaven. Okay. That's good. That's answered it. All right. Here's when Melanie asks this, she says, I've lost my hair due to some medical issues. And this is an interesting way she said this because you'll, you'll see what I mean. She says, if I want more hair in heaven, can hairdressers there actually grow hair super naturally without add-ons, or is that something only the father can do? I'm not quite sure if she's saying I'm going to go to heaven bald and now will he grow hair? I'm not sure what her question is. You can have long hair or short hair, curly hair or short or straight hair when you go to heaven, whatever you want, and you can change it whenever you want to. And she's not arriving in heaven without hair because she has no hair on earth, right? You're not because you know, no matter what issues you had on this earth, they're gone. Yeah. You have no issues. There's no handicap people. There's no, nothing like that. So if you don't even wear glasses, no one in heaven wears glasses. You don't need any medical assistance or help or anything like that. You're totally whole and free of any issues or symptoms in your body whatsoever. You will have beautiful hair. Okay. When that spiritual body steps out of that physical body, you will have beautiful hair. Okay. When you were young and slim, I saw a woman who was in her nineties and I was there when she passed and when she stepped out, she looked like she was in her twenties. Wow. Beautiful hair. I think the story is in book one. I think her story, Mrs. Mack is in book one and she looked so young. I was really blessed. For her, I was blessed. And let me ask you a question I've never thought to ask this because of what you just said. You see people step out of their body. Some entity, God himself or father, son, holy spirit or angels, someone decided when she steps out of her body, what she's going to be wearing, what her hair is going to be. Who does that? Who decides? I'm not quite sure who's on that team, but I do know that you do. I know people say, well, we have a little shift if people draw people in heaven, bless their heart. They only know they get a robe and a gown. Yeah. People make it look like a bathrobe and a nightgown and they're very, very, very wrong. The outfits you're given to wear in heaven are absolutely stunning. They're amazing. There's beyond comfortable number one. That's what I thought about them. But no, you have a whole wardrobe given to you in heaven. It's like huge. It's like probably thousands of square feet. All the things you're given to wear while you're there that you want to do there. So don't worry about what you have to wear. You're going to look amazing and you'll be so happy that you're going to see Jesus Christ. That'll be the number one thought in your head. Oh, you'll get so undone when you see him. Everybody loves him so much for what he did for us. But I know these are normal questions people have, but no, you will look really good. You're going to look good and people will say that to you when you get there. Man, you look good. Everybody says that to everybody. If you're young, you look healthy, you're happy. I never really thought of that question today, but it just occurs to me because God is so intimately involved in everything down to the head number of hairs. Someone decided what like my mom's going to pass very soon. We almost thought we lost her last week. If she's going to go home, she was back in the hospital and it looked like she'd had a stroke. It was fine. But at some point she's going to step out of her body over there in Bend, Oregon. God's decided what she's going to wear. I just think that this intrigues me right now. I've never thought of that question before and what her hair is going to look like. Oh yeah. She's just going to love her hair normally, normally. The women's hair I've seen is longer and very beautiful, wavy, beautiful. I've never seen any women with short hair and having it all. If they want to, I guess, but not when they come home to have them, they've got beautiful hair. Well, that's interesting that you would say that in all the trips you've never seen a woman with short, really short hair. No, I haven't. Not when they can have long hair. Yeah. Yeah. That's very good. All right. Here's Marcy asking. She says, my favorite part in your book, Revealing Heaven, is where you talk about Jesus pouring out his blood on the mercy seat. I think she's keying off of the word seat because she says, is the mercy seat part of God's throne and heaven, is Jesus sitting on it? If not, is it located somewhere in the throne room? So she's trying to figure out where geographically this seat is. And I think she's meaning, she thinks the seat means you're going to sit on it. And that's not what the mercy seat is, right? Mercy seat is like an altar. Yeah. It's not a seat, an actual. It's not a seat. Nope. It's more like a beautiful, it's very beautiful. It's like a bench with things emblazoned engraved in it. A beautiful things on top of it, but that's where he poured out his blood on the mercy seat. There's a picture of it. And I keep saying this. There's a picture of it in one of my books and he's pouring his blood out on that mercy seat. And it's actually, it's a very, very important part of the throne room itself. Yeah. Up by the throne. It's up there by the throne. That's where it is. Anyone can go up and see it and see, I guess, probably examples of his blood may still be on that mercy seat. And I think the word seat must be, if we were to instruct someone else, we'd say, well, that means that you talk about someone as on the seat of power in Washington, DC, or the seat of the government. It's that kind of seat. It's a place of importance. It's also a part of something else. Okay. What's that? It's a part of something else. I can remember what the name of it is. You mean the Ark of the Covenant or? It is very close to the Ark of the Covenant. Okay. But I do know that it's not something you walk up there and sit on. That's not what it is. Yeah. It was a seat or a place made, especially for him to pour his blood out when he came back. And do you have a sense whether that mercy seat is in a temple next door to the throne? Does it feel like it's a door away or something? I think it's very close to the throne. Okay. When I saw it, it was in front of the throne. That's where I was taken to heaven. I saw it in front. I saw Christ pouring out his blood. I could see over his shoulder and I saw every wicked, evil thing, every sin that you could have had, every evil, wicked thing that could have happened to you was appeared on this seat. It was not a little tiny thing. It wasn't huge. It wasn't a little tiny. I saw it and he pour one drop of his blood on it and you'd hear this. Oh, wow. Like it's. And then he raced it. He totally erased it. Like it was. Like a U.I. poured on it. He dogged it. That's what it did. Okay. There was a word adultery. It would be poured on the word adultery and then it would go disappear. Adultery. That's exactly what he did. Okay. All right. Now here's Lori's asking, what do the streets of gold look like? Are they solid sheets like concrete, slabs, brick, gravel, cobblestone? Are the golden streets in heaven different colors? They're like transparent. Okay. They're like transparent gold that you can never see the end or how deep they are. Really? You can never see the end. You cannot see how deep it goes. It's the most glorious thing. It reflects the glory of God. All of the streets reflect the glory of God, the gold, the streets of gold do, but people are always so undone when they see them. It's not a, not even a color that you can actually say, well, it's just gold like a crown. It isn't quite like that. I just know that it's transparent and you see the life of God flowing from them and they go many places in heaven. There's other places you can go. The golden streets are not the only streets in heaven. There are other ones. There are paved ones. There's country ones. There's beautiful ones. There's ones filled with flowers and you just walk on the flowers and they separate from each other and then they come back together. There's so many things I could talk about, about ways to walk around heaven and just go around heaven. But the streets of gold is definitely something everybody wants to see the streets of gold. Let me ask a question about all of these different kinds of streets even and different kinds of things. So does the father or Jesus who's the ultimate, I mean, together the father speaks and Jesus is the creator, does that keep going and do they keep making new things for eternity or is it made by the time I get there, it's kind of done? I don't think it's ever going to be done, Steve. I think that's just a part of them that they are and they are creators. And as far as I know, every time I've gone, I've seen new things created, other stuff created, things that never even got to see that were created. And I think when someone new comes home to heaven, a lot of creativity starts happening because of what they do with their own gift, what they do with their life on the earth, probably determines other things that are made and built there, some for them, some for people to enjoy. Good, Karen is asking, as we approach Christmas and are busy decorating for the season, I feel as though we have been bombarded by a crazy amount of, she's saying gnomes, g-n-o-m-e-s, gnomes. Is it harmless to buy and use gnomes as decorations in her home, harmless or harmful, I guess? As far as I know, I've never known any evil gnomes, gnomes people, they're not demons, okay? They're not demons, they're not witches, they're not any of that group at all, they're cute little characters that are usually in kids, I don't call them fairy tales, but you know, a fantasy to me is a good, decent, fun, adventurous film made or book written by people that doesn't have witchcraft in it, okay? And those are one of the things I've seen people use instead of the other stuff that is fun, they're usually exciting, they're usually helpful. So for me, it's not something I don't think that is a real, real thing, it's something that has been made for people to enjoy or fun little things. We have gnomes. Okay, you have gnomes, well, if cats got gnomes. Oh, then they still don't yard with gnomes every single time, I'm telling you. Oh my goodness, well, you know, I could have a gnome there, no, I, I, I, I, I'm not saying people can't make them look evil, but they're not, they're not as known as an evil creature people. There are gnomes out there, unicorns do not belong to the devil, they're not something that belongs to the New Age movement people, they, they live in heaven, nine scriptures talk about the unicorns in heaven. And of course, the devil would like to take everything that is wonderful and beautiful and turn it into something that's his own, that's evil, but unicorns don't belong to him either and neither do gnomes. That's good, good, good. I've never heard that question asked or answered. Good. So here's what Don is asking, when Jesus was in the tomb and he took his first breath after resurrecting, did God breathe it into him? That's your question. Um, no, no, he didn't have to go in and hell and give him out to multiple cessation people. Jesus of his own free will accomplished what he was asked of God, die on the cross and take back the power and authority that was given away by Adam so that we as believers could have authority over all the, all the devils and all the evil and the wickedness. And so when he finished his last assignment, which was to strip Satan, leave him in the dust in the fire of hell, take away the keys of hell of death in the grave and, and let him know you can never hold a righteous man in hell. That's what it was. Can't hold a righteous anybody in hell. And then exit hell, I'm quite sure, probably at the, at the blow of another lightning bolt because it started off the extended from hell, went all the way up and out of that tomb. I'm surprised at the, that the, um, the thing holding it close didn't blow out of the way because the son of God was coming back from, from, from, from hell to the earth and no one can hold him there. No one had power over him there at all in any way whatsoever. And he showed them that. That's why they're so terrified of his name, his blood, his power, his authority and his followers. There is a dualism, sometimes two truths coexist that we don't understand. For instance, in that story or in that concept, there's one passage that says the same spirit, holy spirit that raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal body. So that's how he was raised by the spirit. Yeah. And this is said at another place, I have the authority, authority and power to lay my life down and I have authority to raise it back up. So it was kind of a both end, right? Yeah. Okay. That's the closest I can ever get to it. It's like both, both things were true at the same time. Okay. Glenn asks, can a miscarried child can miss, can the miscarried children of an unbeliever who are in heaven pray for their parents to be saved? So they're unsaved parents, the child is miscarried, goes to heaven, now can the child pray for these parents to be saved? That's the case. Oh yeah, they definitely will pray. They will pray for their families and for their parents. They absolutely will. They'll just pray for them all the time. And this is kind of a silly question, but so you're saying that a little tiny baby that is gone, taken to heaven, literally is given a certain amount of decree power, praying power, whatever to, to, to get their parents saved. Well, I wouldn't say they don't have, they don't have here to give them power if their words alone will affect them. That's kind of what I mean. Over them. So we can't say that they gave or given power to do that theirself. Yeah. I mean, that's the power. And to clean it over their family members on the other side of Jesus Christ. I think what I was trying to say, and I wasn't doing a good job was the power in their words is really the, I should have said it differently. Does he have the powerful concept of decreeing a thing and seeing it come, but it's God does all of the work. So okay. And they have already known they've gotten to know Jesus Christ when they got that they probably received them. That is given to them to receive them. You don't have to receive Christ as a child when you die. You're an innocent thing. And so you would go to heaven anyway, but they all want to, and they actually have ceremonies where they go before the throne and receive Christ as a savior as they want to. And they understand his power. They understand his authority. They understand the importance of being there. And of course they would of course pray a declaration is a strong way to pray. And of course they're going to go up there and declare over them that they were no Jesus Christ as a savior. They want to see him in heaven. Good. All right. Nick is asking, my father who has passed away was an actual cowboy at a ranch in Texas as a young man. He loved riding horses and his job was breaking in new horses. I'm thinking he would love that job in heaven. Is there such a thing in heaven as breaking in a horse? Oh, I'm quite sure there is, but it probably wouldn't be as easy as it was down here. Oh, really? Where the horse would be talking to you the whole entire time you're trying to ride it. And it may be telling you, you're not going to do that, you're not going to do that now. You don't really need to break horses like that, but they do have horse shows. They have rodeos. They have all kinds of things like that going on in heaven. And so they still ride bulls. It's a whole lot different in heaven. No one's going to get hurt, but you're going to have to be really quick and fast and know what you're doing. If you think you're going to ride that bull successfully or the horse. Yeah. Good, good, good. Jessica is asking, does it rain in heaven? Yes, it does. And they actually have a rainforest in heaven. Really? Yep. It's one of the beautiful places in heaven. And in the rainforest, I know this sounds strange. It rains in many places, but if you have a mansion that's built into the trees in the rainforest, it wouldn't have a roof on it and it wouldn't rain inside your mansion. It would rain all around it. Oh, the rainforest. I haven't talked to a lot about that. Yes. Of course they have it. That's why we have them on earth. But let's say now, okay, so I get the rainforest thing, but let's say I live out my, I have a mansion in heaven that's out in the country and it's beautiful and I love sunny days. Will there be days in heaven where rain comes through? There's a rain over on my property or is that what you say? What's that? You can ask it to come. Oh, I don't want to. I don't want the rain to come. I want the grass to stay green and the sun to stay out. I'm not a guy that loves rain. I live in the Northwest. Don't you mind when you find out that the rain sings in heaven? Well, okay. Maybe so. I mean, if you live in the Northwest, like I do, it's stop raining, is that it? Oh, well, then you probably, I'm sure Jesus would do it, exactly where you love it to be. Yeah. I think no matter where it is, you're going to love it. That's good. Good. All right. Annie has this question. I had a dream. The younger woman was praying for me in heaven with a group of ladies. They were praying for me this thing, quote, on earth as it is in heaven, on earth as it is in heaven. I realized shortly later that it was my grandma who lived into her 90th year and she was in her 20s in heaven. When others in heaven pray for us, quote, on earth as it is in heaven. What does that all mean for us who are here on earth? Are they praying for our destinies, promises, what? They want you to live heaven culture. That's what they're saying. Oh. Right. It's a whole new way of life on earth, called heaven culture, and there's a little hint given in that prayer, my Jesus Christ, all right. What does it say that we should do? What? Wait. I didn't say. Our Father who is in heaven, holy is your name. Right. This is honors as it is in heaven. Your kingdom come. That means the operations of the kingdom that Christ always talked about, the spiritual kingdom filled with power and blessing that we are supposed to be in charge of while we're on the earth. That's what that scripture is talking about right there on earth as it is in heaven. That's what they're saying. That's what their prayers on earth as it is in heaven. They want you to live the way they're living in heaven by the choices you make, the words you say, the things you express, who do you serve with your life? If you live heaven culture, you're going to show people. They're going to know you believe in Jesus Christ. That is a given. So it is actually a way of life. And that's what they're saying. Your way of life, be on earth as it is in heaven. We know you're not in heaven. Yeah. You can, the way you operate your life, that things can happen similar to what they're in heaven. And you can live with no sin, right? No sin, no, no unforgiveness, none of that stuff will be in your life. No fear. None of that will be in your life. If you're living on earth as they live in heaven, you'll be filled with joy, life. God's presence, God's purpose, God's will, God's way. And you'll be taking this story over the enemy all the time in your life. That's one of the reasons why we have the host of heaven. And so even the host of heaven are a part of living on earth as they live in heaven. And that's why they say that it's something very important to them. They know what that means. Well, and can I say it this way? Is this fair to say it like this, that they are so supremely happy every second of every day, course they don't have day and night as we have. They're so supremely happy and they're just wanting you to get any piece of that. So they're saying on earth for Joey, as it is here on earth for Joey, is that about the same thing? I think you would live in peace, joy, celebration. You would live knowing that God does love you, that Christ did die for you. All these things are like normal living. It's like breathing to you on earth. That's good. Very, very good. All right, Carmen's asking, could you provide more insight on this scripture, Revelation 2112 that says, the city wall was broad and high with 12 gates guarded by 12 angels and the names of the 12 tribes of Israel were written on the gates. Why do angels have to guard the 12 gates of heaven? What are they guarding them from? Okay. We're not talking about guarding like an enemy is going to attack you. It's mainly like making sure that, I don't know, it's like maybe making sure people get where they need to go, things like that, more like that, that you're, I think there's another word for it besides. Yeah. It's probably an imperfect translation because we all know they're not guarding, you know, they're not. Yeah. They're nothing attacking heaven people. Yeah. Yeah. There's no one or nothing attacking heaven at all and I do know that even policemen don't guard. They help with directions. They give directions. They help them to get to the right places. So I think these are probably sentinels, they're more like a sentinel being stationed in a certain place to make sure if anybody comes by there, they need to know something or anything like that. It's more like giving that. It wouldn't surprise me if they were more like honor guards as we see them. Yeah. Some presidential things, they'll have honor guards. They're not really guarding. They're giving the majesty and they're stood at attention and they're showing the importance there, but they're not stopping something from them or so. Yeah. Okay. Anna is asking this, God is the grand creator of all things and that includes the night sky with all the stars and conservations, but what about the zodiac? Should we believe in astrology if, yes, to what degree it is God's idea and creation after all and Satan stole and defiled it on purpose. So I don't know how you... I think God's idea was astronomy and not astrology. Was he painting pictures in the sky with stars though? Did God attend to have painted pictures? I've heard the story of redemption was actually in the stars through the pictures that the stars painted. Is that a legitimate thing? I think all kinds of things happen in the stars and I think God made them number one for lights in the sky. One of the reasons he made stars was to... And by the way, he loves them. And did you know that nebula, which is like color art in the sky is actually a nest for baby stars and stars when they're placed there as they grow and grow pretty soon they will leave there. Really? Yeah. They become part of another part of the cosmos and stuff like that. I do like stars, I do look at stars a lot, but I never even considered that they might be part of the zodiac. You know, people have all kinds of things, their own understanding of that and their own mention of that, but God created the cosmos. And by the way, in the old text, in the old writings, it's mentioned, I think, I hope I get it right, I think over 150 times, they don't say the universe, the universe according to man was made by man. Oh. The big explosion, you know, that kind of thing. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. So I call it the cosmos all the time because that's what God calls, it's called the cosmos and it's a variety, so the cosmos was made to bring light everywhere out there, even where you can't see or you think it would be so dark when you show up anywhere in space, there's light everywhere, the stars are there, the nebulas are there, the planets are there. And I just know that God made them with his own hands. God spoke, his son came out, the word came out and made every single one of them. They never made them to be worshiped. They never made them for that purpose. They had real purposes why they made the sun, the moon and the stars and all that. I have a question about, you know, we know that the moon in the sky affects the tidal waves or the tide and all kinds of good things. The ocean waves. Yeah. The ocean waves and then we know that the sun helps with seasons and his heat and light and all that. So if those are for the greater lights and maybe the lesser lights are stars in the distance, are those stars in the distance, even if there's billions of them, are they in some manner having an effect on the earth by where they were placed? I mean, God's effect, not some weird astrology thing, but do you happen to know if they have an effect on earth? I think there's, I think like I said, they were meant for light in the night sky. And I do know this, that the earth was actually made the first time before the sun and the moon were made. He made this earth millions of years ago in the beginning, in that beginning was the beginning. And then after that, we know by verse, whatever, everything is the kind of fun. I don't have time to go into all that tonight. I can just tell you that God has a purpose for everything he makes, has anything to do with darkness or evil or wickedness, but yes, you're right. Satan would like to take every image of everything God ever made and make it look like he made it. Satan didn't make anything, only iniquity was found in him and that's what has ruined everybody's lives even right now, doesn't mean God can't put things back together because we may as well go there and say, yes, he's going to, God's got a plan still for this earth. He's not done with the people. And I don't understand everything about the cosmos, except I know who made it. Yeah. Totally, totally. Okay. Here says a viewer. We don't have a name asks this question. How would the father like us to nullify witchcraft in the workplace do you have insight on this? So they're in an unsaved environment at work full of witchcraft, I guess, how do you nullify it? I don't know if this right viewer knows about the hosts or any of that. Yeah. The first thing I was going to say is if you are commanding the host event and send them in there, hold on every witchcraft spirit, every witchcraft spirit shred platform they try to operate from for the platforms. Yeah. You can't ask them to kill people. There are spiritual beings that are so full of that stuff and involved in that stuff. They can do things against them. So that would be my number one thing to say, or you can just say, God, let them become aware that this is going on, that this is that what they think is true, that they're good. They are not. Okay. You can say things like that. Pray over them. Always pray where you work. You have a lot of authority where you work because that's part of the realm you live in. You need to take authority that that's how you do it. You take authority over any witchcraft operating in that place and have it cast out in Jesus name of the people who made free from that stuff and declare that it's not going to affect you, not going to affect your family. The statements you make yourself about knowing you have authority because of Jesus Christ are very important, but, but not normally I will send the host after all kinds of things, any kinds of spirits like that are dark spirits. Do you ever I've done this with a when I send the host and no one's ever told me to do it or not do it, but I'll send them out to, you know, to fight against the enemy and I'll say, I will send them, but I'll say, Lord, give me the meanest, onriest host take off there. And I mean, I know that some, some fighters are more onri and take less guff off the enemy than others. Cause even you said there is. I'm quite sure there are quite a few that are just like that Steve. Yeah. So I do that. It's at least for my entertainment and the guy can say no if he wants to, but it's fun. I had fun doing it. So. All right. Yesenia. Yesenia asks this. Have you ever seen in the spirit what happens when a believer has communion, either corporately or individually? Does something happen that you see in the spirit when they take communion? I know that, um, I know that the God had considered extremely holy to take it. Yeah. And I remember one time I was, I'm trying to remember where it was, I was somewhere and they were doing communion, but it was like, it wasn't like it should have been given. It wasn't, it was like, Oh, let's do this. We'll pass it around. We'll take it. We'll say our prayer and shouted from heaven. I heard these words so loud. This is holy. This is how I mean, so loud. It almost like it felt like it shook those sanctuary I was in. And that's what they kept yelling from having. This is a holy thing. This is not a simple thing. This is not a man thing. This is not a familiar thing. This is a holy thing that orders your own life and the way you live and the things you believe you need to treat this as a holy thing. And that was shouted from heaven. I was so undone. I wrote it down when he gave it to the pastor and he said, well, I'll check into this later. Well, later that night, a prophet came in on the stage. Guess what? They were yelling. Yeah. This is holy. About the communion. Really? He opened his mouth and said, this is a holy thing. The communion is a holy thing, don't ever treat it like it's a familiar thing. This thing has to do with your own life that you're living by the Christ, the Christ blood by what he paid, the price he paid. This is a holy thing treated holy. That's good. People got down on the floor. Really? Wow. He was really serious about that. The ham communion is one of the most holy things you can do to recognize the price Christ. Well, you know, it makes sense because Paul at one point says, I decided to have nothing to do except focus on Christ and Him crucified. Well, that's what communion is, Christ and Him crucified. He says, this represents my body. This represents my blood and do this as often as you can do it. You're remembering me. You're showing the Lord's death till He comes and the passage. So there's something about that particular act that the Father wants repeated over and over and over and over and over again, thanking the Son, right? That is very special. Yeah. Wow. Wow. Okay. Kurt says, what happens in the spirit when you, oh, this is, people have these different questions. What happens in the spirit when? Okay. What happens in the spirit when you give to the needy? Every time I give to someone in need, I feel this overwhelming feeling of joy and love. It's like waves of God's presence all of a sudden. Can you explain what that means or what happens exactly? Okay. When you give in the meeting, is that what he said? When you give to the needy, yes. The needy. The needy. Oh, the needy. The needy, right. Oh, the greatest desires. It even talks about doing that in the Bible. Yeah. My dad spent most of his life doing that and even now I get great joy in helping people that need help. Yeah. The more the needy, I'm just so happy that I got to be a part of helping their lives. We represent God on this earth. We really do, by the way, we help people the way we give. I always tell people, if they have more, if they have extra, find somebody who really needs it and bless them with it. Number one, there's no way you're going to escape being blessed. Not that you do it for that reason, but sometimes nobody has anyone to help them. Like in the Bible, when the poor person didn't have any help and then someone came and helped him to get some stuff done, I think helping the needy is one of the greatest things you can do with your life. Even if you just do it, even if you don't necessarily do it as a ministry or anything like that, I think considering others more highly than yourself is so important to God that he put that in the Bible. That's good. That's good. Rita is asking, can you explain generational curses? Now, that could be a whole three-week seminar, but explain what generational curses are. Rita is asking. I'm not really sure because they can be many different things. Some people think that generational curses sometimes are not. Sometimes they're things you get stuck in your own soul and you do the same thing because your parent did it. That doesn't necessarily mean it was a curse. Somebody will have, being alcoholic and because they hang around with them and get used to being with them, you'll just start doing it yourself. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a generational curse. That means you've allowed that same thing they did to get in your own soul and you didn't get it out of your soul, but you started doing it yourself and sometimes things are passed down because of that reason. I'm not saying there aren't, but I don't really do generational curse things. I was going to ask you that, Kat, because as a seer, so you're not saying you've ever walked in a room and seen a generational curse on someone like that. That doesn't, you don't get that? Probably not. I would deem them in their soul. I would. So you would see that. I would see what it was in their soul that they needed to get out. Like you might see unforgiveness on them, for instance. Yeah. Okay. That's the big one, isn't it? Talk about, hey, because we've been asked a couple of times now, what happens in the spirit with this? What happens in the spirit when somebody forgives? Now, I'm asking it. What happens in the spirit when someone forgives? That's one of the greatest things you can cause to happen because you're willing to forgive. Now when you forgive, that means you act like it never happened. Yeah. You can't just say you forgive, then you talk and blab about everything wrong that person did. That's not forgiveness. Okay. That's not what that is. When the father, when he forgave us or when Christ forgave, they act like it never happened. So true forgiveness, that's what that means. Number one, you terrify hell. You terrify them. Wow. Really? The human being in their brain, when it happens, whose demons around when you forgive, they will scream out loud, no, don't do that, no, don't do that, no, don't do that. They really do. They can't seem that they don't want their plan going, you know, going wherever you want to call it. You know, they don't want to have their plan ending up being worthless. They want you to be angry at that same person so then they can have a battle starting that you end up hating one another. So when you choose, truly choose to forgive somebody who has truly wronged you. It is one of the most powerful things you can do in the name of Jesus Christ is to choose to forgive and Ask the Father not to even write it down. That was a that's pivotal when he started teaching on that All right, Carol's asking Hebrews 114 says are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will Inherit salvation. What tribe of angels are these ministering spirits? From and how do they help us? Okay, I guess they're trying to figure out what that means. Who are the ministering spirits? She's asking It's usually I'm sure it's probably some of Gabriel's group that minister to people And they can they can do that by they may follow or go with somebody who does that And that's part of their ministry and they actually go with them to help them minister Maybe they maybe they give them not more anointing But they probably will stay in there and cover them and protect them from anything the enemy is trying to do against them While they're ministering or they're just angels sent out Probably not by theirself usually they're sent in twos or threes even they are sent out like that and they'll find somebody Probably really hurt or wounded or something and they actually will go find others and influence them to come and give them help That's one of the ways a minister is to get helpful people that really seriously need help Or or or people who are actually praying and asking God I seriously need help. I'm so desperate. Please send me help They will find someone to influence to go and help those people So it isn't necessarily one-on-one that these ministering angels are doing it with a person Sometimes there's people who are out looking to help somebody and they will find them and have them not necessarily say look I'm a ministering angel. I want you to go help these people But they will influence them by what they're saying to them or the things they put in their thoughts I have a related question whether it's the host or these kind of spirits or any, you know, whatever kind of angel I think these spirits are probably with Gabriel. They're not army So my question is If they've been whichever kind of angel has been influencing you throughout your entire life And you went bad and you kept making bad choices and finally You you just you went hell was your you died in hell was your place There's I would think an angel who has spent your in there your life trying to influence you and they lost Is this a discouraging event to that do the angels feel like we tried and we failed you have any sense on that? I don't really have anything to say about that I've not been involved in stuff like that Most of the stuff I'm involved with is the influence that they also give people who are praying for these people If these are people that they've been guarding and protecting as they are are their guardian angels Then they will use every bit of influence. They have theirself Or they'll even go and minister through other ways as they'll get people to come along their path and minister to these people Sometimes it's easier besides a family member to minister to somebody who really needs help than is Then the family minister family ministering to somebody so they will actually go find other people And their number one job they normally do is to get them to come along the path of the person that they're wanting to get born again But I would think your rights to you I think it would be pretty hard in some ways for them to miss heaven if they've got if they've really been with them all that Long time if they were working for the Lord in the beginning if they were doing stuff for the Lord in the beginning I think there are other ways and things that they can do to pull them back onto that path that they were Yeah, good. All right. Now just so you know, we have six minutes left. I'm going to honor you needed to be doubted So six minute warning greg asked have you ever seen the armor of god? What does it look like? Is it like roman armor? Redeville or medieval or something else? And I don't know if she means god's armor or or put on the full armor god Is that is he talking about that or god's what he wears? I'm not sure Well, I'm not sure what he means either. I know that the Lord has armor. I've seen his armor It's very supernatural looking. Okay, doesn't look like something from Rome at all Okay, it's it's I can't even describe the color of it or even what what substance it may be made out of But it is very powerful. I've seen them on his own warring chariot Coming down from heaven on it and I was in a meeting and he rode right in just like that into the meeting on his chariot And I just about fell on the floor And he came up and picked my hat and he said do you tell them the first time I came as a savior the next time I'm coming as a king As what they're king And he's not talking about coming to take him home on the rapture rug either. No You're not talking about that kind of thing. No Okay, so that's annie's edie adie. I think it's edie the way it's But you said there are transport systems in heaven, but what about message systems? If you want to go see a friend that lives on the other side of heaven Is there a way to send a message or I'll say or phone him up or whatever? What would you just go staying where you want to say and yell to him really? Yeah, that's it. Give me a call We're on coming to see you or why don't you come and see me? Yeah, you can just say it wherever you're at and they will hear you Okay, that's good. Catherine asked God gave Adam the task of naming all the animals. What Was this an act of any spiritual importance? Is this like his introduction to his role in the world? So I guess spiritual importance or just a fun thing to do. I would be maybe she's asking I think he was given Adam authority in the garden That's what he was doing and he asked him to name the animals. He didn't call them horse cow You know pig he actually gave him names and they had conversations with them With the animals. Yeah, like pet Yeah, like that. So dr. Doodle, which is a great story. It was it was really that way in the beginning Yeah, it really was that way. They had I mean even the father has he has his own unicorn Jesus is on a horse lightning A holy spirit has a horse named thunder. This all started in heaven It was a thing in heaven that started and so Adam was given direction over all these animals in the in the garden That was part of his job and he named them Okay, well, all right. We got three questions. Let's see if we get to them on moda asked How important is it to test the spirits? Could you teach on that? We don't have time to teach on it a whole thing, but how Simple actually go ahead If any kind of anything that comes up to you, let's say that Peter's in the middle of the night or in the daytime or walks Through your wall whatever and it says come and follow me. I have something great to show you Do not go with them until you test them. That's what the bible says You're giving a test to find out if that that spirit is from heaven or hell It's really one of the most important things you'll ever learn to do Don't just go because you're giving permission no matter where they take in no matter what they show you That they will tell you that is truth that doesn't mean it is truth There is a mock heaven and a mock hell And the demons will take you there and they don't look like demons and they'll convince you certain things happen And I know that actually has happened other people like they've been taken to a mock hell And they'll tell you tell them people are in hell because they wore blue jeans and they'll believe it because you know Why they had a real encounter Wow, real encounter doesn't make it real What makes it real is when you ask them this question are you of the spirit of the most high god? Who sent his son to die for the sins of this world? That is the test question They cannot lie If they are not from god, they will disappear or they will shut their mouth and then you tell them to get out But if they have if they say yes, it is I I am from the living god Then you will know that that is from god and it's the simplest thing you can do but most people don't do it Okay All right. Well cat. That's our time. I want to just say real quickly on this revealing heaven.com Which is on the screen. That's where your products are the cup in the foreground and the pen on your lapel. That's not a lapel, but but it says I don't do demons Those are some of the problems one of our favorite things the holy spirit gave us that is a quote to put on things And of course, we do have this tumbler that says where did I don't do demons And that lightning bolt is to remind satan How he was kicked out of heaven Yeah, so good. By the way, if anyone whenever robin bullock comes on He doesn't come on every week these days because he's very busy But when every time he comes on he's wearing that same pen that you made you all made Yes, yes, he gave one to hank. I think we gave them I think spirit force. We gave them several other pens Yeah, and robin is very diligent always putting that on as a prayer of him So all right, and then your other website where your spirit is a spiritual website with the training Yeah, the is it the KatKerr.com or KatKerr the KatKerr.com. Okay. All right. And as you've said to other people That's the only stuff. It's just yeah. Oh Jen said is KatKerr.com. Yeah KatKerr.com And it's the only place people can give is on that site. No other place. So The KatKerr is my facebook page, right? Okay, good KatKerr is the only way that you can give online to me. There's no other space out there There's no one There's no fake place saying if you if you give to this person, then I'll do this for you. That's not me I'm not gonna do that We made one place for you to give so that it would be safe for everybody to give and we're very grateful Especially to all the guardians those who are part of that And uh, you all remember to bless steve too because steve is like a guard at the gate That has a prophetic mantle on himself That he allows the prophetic the true prophetic voice of god to be heard around this world Many times over and that helps to give you truth And I want you to say thank you to him too and bless him too because Because we've been doing this for over a hundred weeks now. Yeah, we We've been very grateful for the opportunity to do that, but if it were not for steve, we would not have to do that I feel like we have tons of other questions that will come up to even though we've been doing a lot So, all right. Well, that's our time. We need to let you skip out of here KatKerr So I'll let you do that as soon as the credits roll you can go a quick reminder to look at Especially through the first part of the program We had the phone number and the website for those who want to be on KatKerr's cruise If you don't get in right away, you might not get in so go go go so here it is again heavilycruises.com Or or the phone number 209-588-9565 do not miss it It's it's in august, but you've got to get in quick in order to get in so don't wait any further God bless you everyone.

swing shift in retail years ago that was like the worship you either want to work really late Julie none of that but we do a second show from two to three and sometimes three to four which would make it seven o'clock if someone's on the east coast so that's not we're not going to gravitate towards that we won't say no looking at something but it's going to be very unusual for us to pick something that far away we could but we don't we need people that when we say we're going to do a second show today it happens mostly within Pacific business hours so we're not asking you to stay late if we

donation so we appreciate that very much it's on the screen there we can help us donate that so all right without further delay let's bring in wednesdays with steven cat here we go greetings cat how are you see you're draped in the american flag or yes i am and isn't that something i didn't even know what you'd be wearing that's pretty cool yeah red white well i got the red i do have red white and blue don't i oh awesome i wanted to be sure i got the red in we're getting too closer to christmas and i'm trying to get that in so oh you got the red in okay i got more red yeah we're very patriotic we're totally patriotic so i i love having you on cat you've always got so many great questions i know that you answer so you're doing a move next time we broadcast you'll probably have a different background unless that unless you move those pictures behind you right so it's going to be a maybe the beach oh really okay actually that's where i am right now yeah because i actually have moved i have personally moved from this address okay we we have a place to stay for about 30 days at the beach and um and we're all there my mom and jan uh have a condo we have one and it's absolutely gorgeous we may do our next broadcast from there well wow well it'll be part of be a different background by then if that's the case so yes we'll get used to it and you don't know you've got a permanent place that you're looking for but it's not ready yet is that the deal yeah for the offices yes okay all right yeah i'm trying to keep up but i know that's where you're out and i know you've been very you know you guys your whole team has been uh very hard working but very tiring it's very tiring we've all been working really hard trust me but it's so worth it because after almost 20 years somewhere it takes a while to get out you know to pack up and get out of that place when you're separating personal stuff from business stuff especially and um we have found our location but it's not ready for us yeah but for the offices we're still looking that's good well well 2023 is the year we're all going to be you know i'm you know we're in this one location i've lived here for 23 years in this home and it's an old farmhouse we fixed it up we remodeled it so it's nicely done but we you know we we moved out here 23 years ago and we started renting this place and then we began then we began talking into selling it to us on contract we did that for you then we bought it so it's a whole long process where we inherited this and yeah yeah to me i'll tell that story one day but anyway well uh cat we usually ask we've got lots of questions about heaven and the bible and all of that but we usually ask if you've got anything to share before we jump into questions so anything today i think i have never received so many um powerfully exciting hopeful texts from people about what's going on right now out there in this world right now and uh and there are great things happening of course you know you're not going to hear them on the regular news it's just not going to happen and a lot of the things justice is already being served to people and uh and they're paying a they're going to pay a dear price for their life in the way they lived it because this is seed time and harvest which means what you've been seeding for the last several years is what you are about to harvest and that would be for the good the bad yeah yeah but robin bullock talks about that too desney seed time and harvest and see when it's seed time and harvest that means like you just said the good the good people have a harvest that's good and the evil the evil doers as the bible calls them that's such a good harvest yeah because some people think this is the end time harvest and it's not the final end time harvest no we're not ready to take care of a billion souls people and i keep telling people that that will happen that really will happen and so we're not ready for that we're getting ready for the great stuff that's going to be happening really soon and so i stay excited about that and that chocolate cake you have on the ad now i love that cake see yeah yeah we had an angel food cake which is beautiful and delicious but i said cat likes chocolate so we better change that so i took it a while we got it fixed up and it looks delicious man it does look delicious i want one right now no don't send me chocolate cake people i don't have any place to keep it right now yeah awesome awesome awesome well okay anything else before we jump into these questions no i think that's it there's more hope in the air right now that we've had in a very long time even just for everyday people because of things that are already happening and some people are really taking into their own hands to provide needs for things that we we need that's been kind of taken away from some of us but anyway you know these are great days who are you know already we're not waiting on them they're here and so i can just say please stay excited and i know if you're not used to walking in the spirit and understand all that step out and start doing it because it's so worth it when you see god really beginning to move his hands can be so powerful the celebration that i was shown so i'm just i just stay excited about all of even us stepping forward putting our foot on new land so to say from when we've been for so long is a major change for me just to shift that inside of myself let me ask something because it's been a while since i've asked you to detail that you said you you were shown a celebration describe how real was it were you taken into the future or did you see the division i was taken in i was actually there and the people were running this is the difference between night and day so i don't know something i don't know if that means something will happen in the evening in the next day will be totally different i'm talking about freedom liberty and justice happening but i saw people running out of their homes and buildings who didn't even know each other they were grabbing each other they were laughing they were celebrating people were dancing and they just all they kept saying was you know justice is here justice is here we're free we're free we're free and i knew they were talking about well i know robin calls it the reset i'm thinking can't hank may call that also but i'm just saying it's when god really does move his hand because he is taking back this land and not just america but this country this whole world right now and that was where it was shown then it was taken from our land america overseas to another country and they were doing the same thing it was just celebration in the streets people were people who never hugged were hugging they were crying they were laughing they were so excited it was so real to me that this powerful powerful celebration would take place and i think i was taken even to a third place and saw the same thing happening so this was all over the world that this was happening and i cannot wait for everybody to actually get to live that experience that's great you know i no wonder you can you know i can almost hear people say well no wonder you okay you saw what it's going to be but you know you are a seer but god literally transports you in time i love that you know yes yeah he actually takes me in time wow i love that i've talked to several people i know uh manuel johnson has talked about that he's been going forward and backwards and you the same thing god will take you back in time or forward in time so awesome awesome all right well listen i'm going to jump in with some questions and we got we got a little bit of feedback last time the last two times we burned through 25 questions in that hour so they said slow down and give us longer answers so we got so we got quite a bit of feedback that kind of said the same thing so we're going to slow down and get the details on this but um i want to talk about for a minute for a bit the before we are come from the from inside the father and and then we're brought to this earth before we come is there a moment in time where the father takes you and tells you what's going to happen what talk about if you anything you might know about the sending part of it sending part well i know for myself i actually was shown at one time and i'm sure others were shown i actually have had a few people say i keep having these dreams of me and these were people who some of them didn't even know who i was um i keep having these dreams of me and i'm like laying in god's hand what is that but i was a little thing i was a little tiny thing i knew it was in heaven this is this person speaking he was in heaven but i didn't really know what was going on i couldn't hear what was being said and i said oh that was god showing your what you were chosen for to do on the earth that doesn't mean you were showing everything that might possibly go wrong or what people may possibly do to you it was god's plan for you in this flight and i do know that sometimes he even does every now and then he does pick people from a generational lines to be married together to be married on the earth and sometimes he does that he'll show them separately possibly this is why we're in him this is not on the earth i'm talking about right now and so but i i have been shown several times but inside god the father is not body parts not like our body parts so he doesn't have to have those to live okay he doesn't need things like we need them he is god and he he doesn't didn't appear somewhere in time i hear people say well he appeared somewhere in time eventually he was here no time comes from him people you got it backwards time comes from the father he knows what times are and when times will happen he knows that it's his thing that's why he is the only one who knows when christ will actually turn in the rapture nobody else knows that date and time and so that's why he can say that it comes from him he knows when everything is going to happen and what what he chooses that he wants to happen and so yes sometimes he does share things with you when you're still inside of him you're like a little spirit you're about to be a little tonguey spirit lady you got little arms and legs you run and play inside of him there's a holy hill that you can choose to go up inside of god there's also other places and you can slide down the river of life which flows from him personally that's where it comes from it doesn't come from somewhere in heaven it talks about the crystal sea that's still the river of life and it flows from his very person sometimes it'll even flow down the steps in the throne room and if children are present there they will actually play in that same river so those are some things you get to do when you're inside of him you jump on the stones of fire which carry revelation they carry all kinds of things that he I guess it's a way he just keeps it inside of himself stones of stones of fire and those stones of fire carry revelation I've heard Robin I think talk about that too and and some other a few other prophets I've heard them talk about the stone of fire Ezekiel 28 is where you'll see that mentioned if you're interested in the Bible where it says that Lucifer used to walk upon them and that's absolutely true because that's what he that's one of the things he did he was anointed cherub he was not wicked or evil there was no evil in him at that one time and he would lead worship for god that's what he did he was anointed and chosen for that purpose he chose to want to take over himself and so he made a mess out of that but he knew we were there he knew that we lived inside of the father it says in him we live we move we have a very being the bible says that it's self talking about the father we did live in him we moved in and out on the rays of the of the rainbow we would flow from him that also flows from him and part of that is created by the stones of fire underneath the river of life and there's fire inside of god in that river wow now I know a lot of people say that's not possible it doesn't have to be possible for you yeah yeah god people and yes there is fire underneath that river he has fire he has carries fire he carries lightning he sends out lightning bolts in the throne room those are a million megawatts of love we love to hit we love to get hit by them if we're in the throne room yeah but for satan what were they to him okay lucifer when he became lucifer it kicked him out of heaven that's how powerful those lightning bolts of love are and that's why we put one on one of our images because we wanted everybody to remember satan was kicked out on lightning bolts from god himself michael held him up in the air oh really god let go with some some lightning bolts from himself and it took him it even says it in the bible he was kicked out of heaven i saw youth fall as lightning is what the bible says they're talking about lucifer who then became satan and so a lot of things went on so much activity went on in our in our own lives before we were sent to the earth we were sent to the earth so we could have a body that's why he made the earth there was no physical anything it was all spiritual spiritual um heavens a spiritual world it's a spiritual place we were spirits at that one time we were all little spirits and and the father is all spirit he can be a spirit whatever he wants to be and so anyway there's a lot of things in the bible but it's not necessary one after another you have to really seek for that yeah but it does talk about walking in the spirit here on the earth if you walk in the spirit which is what he wants you will not fulfill the desires of your flesh which gets you into a lot of trouble good but yes there are times i've heard people talk about they remember god saying something to them when they lived in him really about what they would do on the earth so that's actually the question that was asked yeah yeah that's good now i i want to go further about the earth and the children but before i do that you talked about we're you've always said we are on the inside of the father and you said that before but i always get more detail when i every time i come to the stones of fire i wasn't sure i remembered that but okay so we came from him now later on or some or maybe before god creates the the heaven full of angels did they come from inside of him or was it was at a different year okay okay they did not we are his sons and daughters he carried us and it says that it says that he is our father it does say that he carried us inside of him and that was just where we that's where we were before he sent us to the earth no the angels were created spoken into existence and actually created by god by the word and uh that's where they came from so i had a question here i'm going to pull it from a different part i know where i am but it's a miss it might miss my head someone had asked and now we're at a good spot for that well what about reincarnation she wanted to know is that possible or why is it not possible if it's not possible um how what would you say about what was the thing that the enemy was trying to do by telling you you know you go back you know you die and then you come back as you know so talk about reincarnation versus the word if you can anytime the enemy can bring a division or deception he's going to do it in as many places that he actually did do that and he doesn't want anything special to be known or thought of about god himself and so he has to find things that he could cheat or steal away from god which doesn't ever work by the way but but no reincarnation is not possible now i do know this that i have met people who used to believe in it but when i talk to them about how they lived in god because their big deal is we lived someplace else first before we came here right and i tell them they're actually right and when i say that word it opens up it opens up volumes of me getting to speak to them because i'm not shut them down and i went you did live somewhere before you were here you lived inside the most high god everyone who was ever born sent to the earth that's where you came from he is our father and you were you were carried by him you were sent to this earth so that you could then have a body and then eventually receive jesus christ and then you would have a way back to the father but satan wants you to believe that you can be anything or that you were somewhere else before you were actually even in heaven that's his whole point that you know that god's not not not on the up and up but he is like he would be he's lost almost everything he's ever had satan and so whatever whatever he can try to do to mess up our minds he's gonna try it but no there is no reincarnation however you do come to this earth it's appointed under you wants to die and then the judgment comes to see are you going to heaven or hell people so guess what you will live somewhere else but it's still all tied to what god's plan is or what god wants he wants you to come home to heaven to be with him that is his plan that means you live in him you come to the earth and live here you choose the sun then you go back to heaven and live and then on the new earth which will be made one day for all those who receive jesus christ it's where you get to live through all eternity a wonderful amazing powerful place so satan takes i guess the basics of that whole thing and twist it so you'll become confused but no you're not going to come back as a bird you know you're not going to come back as a bird or whatever people say all kinds of things you could come back as this and that but you won't ever be you again but that's not true because you'll always have the same spirit and the same soul you get one spirit man that's what you get she don't get more than one and so you live in that little spirit inside god he sends you to the earth and knits you together what does he knit together that little spirit living in him he sends it down here and at the time of conception he will knit together that spirit little spirit your spirit to that dot a flesh at the time of conception that's when your life begins here but it is still you it's still the same you that lived inside god now you will have a physical body and now you will have an opportunity to receive jesus christ as your savior as you grow and you get older you'll understand that he is the son of the living god and he is the only way christ is the only way back to heaven so that's about as basic as i can get yeah that's good a whole lot more detail yeah well and i want to take this because i you know i'd sat down and i thought well what i haven't i asked cat about this process and i got a couple questions related to that so we're sent by the father you just described how we're knit together you put your spirit and soul together i knits them as like they're like blended together as almost like one spirit does it look like two a spirit next to a soul a spirit within a so what is it no your soul lives inside your spirit they're both spiritual things like if you're not a seer you're not going to see somebody's spirit you're not going to see their soul but as a seer i have seen spiritual you know i've seen people in the spiritual waters i've seen them their soul lives inside their spirit man i always try to say it's sort of like an engine kind of because the choices you make with that soul is how you will live your life and that's what the word says as a man think it's in his heart his heart in the bible when it says his heart you're talking about your soul your soul is a very core it's the core of your spirit man so it's actually there's a there's a soul and then you have you you have a spirit and then you live in a body that's the proper way to say it but you cannot separate the spirit in the soul you can't separate them there'd be no life at all when god made adam's body when jesus made adam's body the word made his body he was perfect in every way perfect body everything but there was no life until the father leans over adam's body and it says in the word he breathed the spirit of life that's your spirit man he breathed the spirit of life into adam's body and then he became a living soul that's when he became a living human being because adam of course was made by hand he was made by the word and and and the father and our people can argue i don't have time to argue about any of that but i know whatever the father spoke the word stepped out because they would travel where there was nothing it's the sexy what they did they travel where there was nothing and then the work then the um the father would speak what he wanted the word would step out and he would make what the father wanted which is why his name was the word yeah so that's how they did adam's body when they came down to the earth and they made a frame for a frame which is mean like an outliner design for adam's body and he was perfect in every way except there was no life that spirit of life that's your spirit and your soul together that was breathed into adam's nostrils as it said in the word and then he became a line so there's no life there's there could be a body there but if there's no life there's no life if there's no spirit or soul and so that is what brought adam to life when god breathed that into his body and so that's how it happens with you whenever that died of flesh happens that conception yes the father does send he chooses who goes he sends your little spirit man with your soul in it and actually attaches that to the spirit didn't attach it to that dot of flesh it would go right back to heaven with it with this you've taught extensively on taking care of our soul keeping your soul clean as an act of my will I lose from my soul you've talked extensively about that and then now you're clarifying that the soul is within the spirit they can't be there two different things but they can't be separated so the spirit that contains the soul the soul can get wounded and messed up can the spirit get wounded or is it just the soul I think it's probably mostly the soul because that's where your emotions are okay the soul is your mind what you think your will what you're choosing your emotions what you display yeah it's very easy to find out what's in people's souls just by how are they acting how are they talking where are they going what are they watching I mean really you can pretty much tell the the lifestyle of a person will dictate what your spirit man is being fed through your soul and that's why it's so important to make sure you don't let darkness into your don't let darkness in you're not let darkness in yourself and that's how it's done is by whatever is given to the soul whatever like I said what you read what you think what you say what people say to you can affect your soul yeah and that's why God gave us the keys to the kingdom to lose out of our soul what we don't want there in the name of Jesus and then we can bind the things of God to our soul which you make us powerful for him joyful joyful happy excited about God the things he has for us so if you're going through a time in your life where nothing happy is going on why not talk about what God wants to do why not talk about the plans God has shared with you instead of talking about what hell wants you to take that's good good good all right I'm looking at my questions here here's the next one I have written down I want to ask so God sends the child and it's the spirit and the soul are knit together and the child is actually I looked it up today to make sure I understood it's actually microscopic at the time that conception takes place you can see neither the egg or the sperm with your naked eye if I'm if I read that correctly but if that was the had a spontaneous sometimes it's called a spontaneous I don't like the word abortion the medical term is spontaneous abortion but let's say there's a spontaneous miscarriage and and just a day or two after it's almost still microscopic that miscarriage happens does and that child goes right back to the father if I'm understanding right and when is that now is that child now and having to receive his or her rewards what does that home going look like when when they only lived on the earth seconds or minutes or days they knew who their parents were they did absolutely yes it doesn't matter if it's a couple days if that is that knitting together takes place Steve that is a living human being beginning in the womb and so therefore unless there was a reason that God sincerely wanted them on the earth and if he did then he would take that little spirit and put it back inside of himself and rescind it I know that has happened but 90 percent of the time it just remains in heaven is a little tiny and I've seen little tiny really babies in heaven and when they wonder if let's just say they go to heaven let's say they've been here on the earth for a week yeah and that knitting together took place within that week then he would take them to heaven and they would grow they stay in these beautiful nurseries God is prepared for them don't think of nursery like in a hospital nursery it's not anything like that there's these beautiful furnishings for babies to sleep in it well they don't sleep they lay in them they have almost look like big seashells almost beautiful fabrics birds come into these nurseries and sing to them they take them for rides on their backs wow all kinds of things Jesus has planned he visits them and they grow very very slowly and so by the time their parents arrive the ones who were their parents it could have been 40 years later 50 years later that it would still be like a young baby when the people when they came to heaven if they were believed was of course wow and they would then then would have the very baby that was miscarried wow that's okay that's good now i um so contrast now our pets you say go to heaven too which i was delighted those are two break breakthrough understandings for me when i met you and read your books is that my wife and i had a miscarriage that that baby's in heaven we've named it like he said to name it and so and when we go there we we don't know if it's a boy or girl because it was too undeveloped at that point yeah but we gave a name but now contrast that with a pet i'm assuming you're you're not going to say a pet pre-existed but i mean maybe you did i've never asked the question are pets created only here on earth and then the the follow-up question is do they have a soul and or do they have a soul-spirit combination like you just described you're the human i knew you were going to ask that question you know me too well well number one they would have to have they would have to have a soul and a spirit okay or they couldn't make choices or decisions okay even um when i can take you to the word again when no one was told to put the animals on the ark god said to him you can check it out in genesis people put every animal on the earth that has a spirit of life in them um we already know what the spirit of life is that's the spirit in the soul that's what we put in Adam and so the that's what he said so they do have however he sends them or when he sends them and i can't answer that they were there before i just know when they were created at the time he made them uh in the same way of course you know when conception takes place in that pet or that animal whatever uh there's going to be a spirit of life added it just happens that way uh so but as far as saying did they live in god i don't know that but i do know that they have a spirit and they have a soul or they wouldn't number one would have never been put on the ark right to survive and uh and they would not be able to make choices uh when you die and go to heaven some people believe in soul sweeping in other words they think the spirit only goes to heaven and the soul in the body go in the grave well that would be not a good thing for you because that's like sticking you in there your soul never sleeps it's always awake and it's always active it's always thinking it's always making plans and so uh i'm sure that pet you know yourself if you have pets they have attitudes sometimes they're good sometimes they like you sometimes they don't like you a cat especially yeah they may like you one day maybe don't want you to pet them the next the dogs are always happy no matter what so they have different attitudes different natures to them so i just have to say that every every pet that goes to heaven they all have a spirit they all have a soul god said they're not the ones who sin they did not they don't have to receive christ as their savior like a human does because we make that decision ourselves to do that although i'm sure there's a lot of them that love jesus christ that are in heaven i'm talking about your pets so you won't escape having your pets in heaven people and yes they will still know that you and they'll still love you so be nice to them that's good that's good all right here's my my last question i've wanted to ask you this for a while in Matthew 10 this i'm going to read it it says that jesus is talking uh to at least his disciples i i didn't look up whether this was to the crowds or to the disciples he said i did not come to bring peace but a sword for i have come to set a man against his father a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's enemies will be those of his own household what was he thinking is what i want to ask him you know what can you clarify any more of that i don't know that that if i do i think it's because everybody chooses different things and i think that really has a lot to do with it that you have people in your family you know they don't want christ it doesn't matter what you think or try to say to them they made their decision up well that always causes some form of conflict deep whether it's minor or major conflict that does many times cause that and so that's what christ meant when he said that because of his choice of living holy and asking us to live that way and there's reasons why he does he knew that people would be separated by that even in their own family and number one your family is your family even christ had to face not necessarily abused by them but even they did not honor who he was on the earth if they were not impressed with him that he was a son of god they were not even impressed that he could make water out of wine or multiply the food they just wanted it i'm not saying they treated him mean but i'm just saying it says very clearly in the bible a prophet is without honor in his own home and that doesn't mean my family doesn't love me but they still look at me as me most of them you know all the time but there's some that think well you know you're a nice person you know a lot and i'm just saying in general i'm quite sure that jesus even jesus had to face that it's just the way it is well it made me wonder the way it's worded if it's translated correctly is was it part of the gig that he knew that he knew you were going to be become the man or woman that he wanted you to be through this you know they used the expression like what is it a pearl is is made by the rubbing together of these irritants is was there something in the plan of god that knew that this had to be worked through by us even to our loved ones not agreeing with this was there something that was in that for us i'm quite sure that there's always is steve it's always something you're going to have to push through it's a good word for it push through to run after what god has given you or said about you even though others even those you know very close to you may not have agreed with anything you say at all you still have to learn to love them it's a good i think it's we could either say dying to your flesh work or just to choose the right things to say and how to treat people regardless of how they treat you esteem others more highly than yourself would definitely be something that probably would be included in all of that thing that you're talking about because no matter what where i've gone or what i've done or what i've said i also have to learn to love some of my family anyway yeah i think you know i'm on this for a good ride they have no idea what my life is even like even though i've offered many of them to know i'm not talking about the ones who live with me but you know i have over a hundred family members people wow and so that was a lot to push through even just growing up yeah it is growing up you learned to love one another you learn to get along you knew that you were different you knew you would not always agree but even growing up you had to push through that yeah so true love god show up in their life or at least they know that you care so i have to say yeah when god chose us for particular things to do he did know we would face that stuff but i have to honestly say with him with god all things are possible and if you're spending the time you need to spend with him then he will be the one that even if he has to restore parts of you or what was said about you or against you he will surely do that you know i had i don't know if i've told this on the air before but i had a i had a word when we were first getting into that we understood the perfect this is 35 years ago and god began god i showed up by the holy spirit i don't have time to tell the whole story but when we you know god the bible came alive and god became alive to me not that he wasn't alive but i began to you know see it and a prophet came prayed over each of us and one said first you know he didn't know me i didn't know him he said your first fruits the things that will happen to your family and friends will happen to you first and that was kind of like a life word and i thought oh okay i guess i'm alive now so that must mean i'm supposed to go out and be fruitful and share this with my family and friends not so much because all i did was get myself in trouble with the family and here i am 35 years later almost 40 and a couple of those huge number of family members on each side a couple of them have understood the love of god the grace you know and so i i'm i'm looking at this thing from a distance and saying man you are a very patient god and of course i could see all the stuff he had to work out and me through that i had to realize i wasn't the savior i guess that i thought maybe back then i thought it was supposed to be the savior you know noah you know and no his arc so anyway i just thought i i i have to believe that god saw the process and it was going to be really good for us so all right here's the question cat um now i know the answer to this because most born again believers will already know the answer to this but denette yet i don't know if there's an in missing yet or denette the bible says we may have entertained angels unaware is this true also of fallen angels i have heard that familiar spirits can take the appearance of our dead loved ones and then she continues can they which i think she means our dead loved ones can they walk on earth in human form that's the question she's asking i do not think that ever happens at all there's no dead family members that are walking around in human form on the earth and uh if i'm wrong god will certainly correct me about that but in all the years that i've been doing this and they've known him i've never known for that i've known for them to appear let's just say they died went to heaven they may appear just to say hi i'm here you know like every now and then and i don't know why he does something but they're in this spirit body they're not in the physical body at all and um okay so there are a lot of people you see it on especially over the you see it as um religious movies christian movies especially back in the day and they would and they would say someone then became my angel my loved one got killed in autumn now she watches over me she's one of my angels i can feel her presence i know she's watching over me we'll talk about angels and humans no angels are only angels and they're made an angel they're created as an angel we as humans are birthed from god himself so there's a major difference in both of them okay we don't become an angel nobody becomes an angel when they die you're still you and you're using the gift god gave you on the earth while it's used on the earth a natural gift you're doing that in heaven like making fun things for people to do enjoying time spending with them all kinds of things like that angels will always be angels so you cannot say one turns into the other okay okay that's good there are a lot of people now we had talked about this before the program today and they said well we'll make a clip of this until people can can uh what what would you say to somebody how to get out of that they believe their entire life that they're angels or their father and their mother are watching over them and and now you're popping that bubble so who is watching over them what are they feeling if they say i can feel that when they they come in the room what would you say their parents if they're in heaven no i'm saying if your guardian angel is there you can you feel their presence a lot okay so some people can feel their own guardian angel they were sent by god at the time of conception your guardian angel is sent then waiting outside the mom for that baby to be born they will be with you your whole life here on the earth and many times yes you can feel that presence you can feel the presence around you now if your family members are in heaven they're definitely declaring over you they're going to declare that god that god gets from you what he needs from you that you share him clearly that you become that you come to know him and so that type of thing is happening in heaven but as far as your family members being down here around you no that's not that's not your family okay all right we have just we have to be done by the end of the hour here so let's we got maybe one or two questions here betsy's asking identical twins have beautiful have a beautiful connection and can often feel and know it's another one of those feeling sensitive they can often feel and know what the other twin when they are in pain or struggling emotionally i know that the father and nits our spirit to our physical body at conception how does this work in the case of identical twins do identical twins have twin souls or a soul connection what would you describe how would you describe what twins i don't know unless that's just because they're in the womb together they have that connection so i can't other than that i can't say anything yeah it's all speculation at this point then isn't it yes okay by the way i appreciate that about you you don't try to make up something that god hasn't shown you yeah no i'm not going to make up anything yeah that's that's really good jewell's asking i've had open visions of blue flames what do blue flames in the spirit mean to you blue flames usually come from the heart of the father i've seen that coming from him a lot while he's on the throne and stuff to me that's what the blue fire means okay house fires like i guess a lower grade fire it could be like yellow orange red something like that the blue fire blue and white fire some of the hottest fire there is and those both come from god good menace is asking uh genesis 217 says but of the tree of knowledge and good and evil you shall not eat a for in the day that you eat this you shall surely die the question is how do i how did adam know what death was going to be when when god said you will surely die or if if you know that of course how did he know okay we don't know and there's a follow-up question by a different person and they're saying why did the father put the tree of good the knowledge of good and evil in the garden in the first place if you know i think because people had to have the opportunity to choose yourself they got to choose yourself who they were going to serve what they were going to believe it wasn't something god made them do and i think that's probably the that's probably the real reason why it was put there because it was like they would be tested no matter what they were going to have to make a decision as adam did and eve did they made a decision and yet we know that as at time the enic lived on the earth he always chose what god wanted he never would have chosen i think believes that if he had been in the garden first i don't think i don't think he probably would have chosen wrong i think it's all about the relationship you have with god himself and uh the more you believe he is real the more real he will become to you and i think that's very important to know that god is never going to force you satan forces and controls that's what he does god does not god lets you have freedom to choose and that's why it's so important to make sure that you're choosing the right things that's good by the way you mentioned enic because he walked with god and said how many years they were whatever that was and then the time in some years and then god took him that's right and so does that mean he bypassed what we what they call paradise or abraham's bosom he goes straight to heaven don't be right he's in heaven he's always been in heaven so he would have uh does he was there something has god shown you i mean we i know lots of people yourself included who walk with god who are who are faithful who are devoted their life is only about god i mean is that possible to walk in an enic like style it was it was so profoundly good that god just said you're out of here right i yeah that's it that's it and i think god has a plan for your life and mine was to be here mine wasn't to go to heaven early or stay in heaven early he wants me here as long as i will that i am willing to say that's good well cat very very good tell people uh that's our time today tell people about your two websites you i see revealing heaven dot commas on the screen tell people what they can find there yeah that is our main website that's where you find our

Well, Merry Christmas everybody. You are watching this on Wednesday the 21st. We happen to be recording this on Tuesday. How can I do this? It's so confusing. Everything's backwards. Anyway, it is actually Tuesday, but you will be watching this on Wednesday the 21st, which will be four days out from Christmas. We're going to bring Kat Kerr on. We're going to talk about different things related to Christmas and everything, but we were just discussing where we want to go today. So it'll be fun to see what all God has given Kat today. So a quick reminder before we bring it into Kat is that a quick reminder of how you're sowing into Uganda, into the freshwater well. So let's see that spot real quick. Here we go. Music And we thank you so much for your sewing into this ministry. You know we talk about about the wells because so many want to give into that but of course every single time you donate a significant portion of that is supporting this ministry of the prophets. So whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophets reward the Bible says so. You are receiving rewards for sewing into the receiving prophets and you're receiving rewards for giving a couple cold water one of these. So this is a reward making place to sew your your hard earned money. Those of you who either just give or you consider to tie whichever way you choose to give we just appreciate you giving into this ministry. It helps so many people for so many ways and so many reasons. So alright I think that's it. So without further delay let's bring in Kat. Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go. Music Well I'll say happy Wednesday since that's when people will see this Kat. How are you doing today? Oh I'm so excited to be here. I love this time of year a lot. I do too. Yeah Christmas is totally my favorite time of year. Lots of family. You know one year you made us those. What are they like? What did you call those chocolate things? What was the name? Oh they were good but they had you know to me I'm remembering an oatmeal taste but did they have oatmeal in it? It is basically a fudge recipe with oatmeal peanut butter and walnuts in it. Oh no wonder it was very addicting if I could use that word. So anyway well Kat Merry Christmas to you and yours and being Kat and being sometimes here sometimes you'll have to get them on until a couple of growner dad joke to the whole viewership about when we're waiting for Kat and being gets on the microphone and tells dad jokes. He's got worse ones than I do and mine are better. He does. You'll probably be a member of the what do I call it? The lame joke club. The lame joke club in heaven. He does good lame jokes but they either make you laugh because it's funny or they make you laugh because it makes you laugh. So anyway well Kat you've got some things to talk about. We were kind of shifting as we came on the air so I'm just gonna throw it to you and just tell us what's on your heart today. Yeah well probably a lot of revelation that people have not heard or maybe they've not even wondered about. There's so many things the father has shown me revealed to me. Most of the time he'll take me to heaven and show me or he'll take me back in the past and show me part of it and part of the future and show me. One of the things he showed me that really blessed my heart was all about what was going on in heaven before Christ was born. In the earth. In the womb you know. Before he was put in the womb of Mary how did that all happen and what was going on with that and he actually showed me. So that's what I'm gonna talk about today. I actually do have a poem that goes with it. I'm not gonna share the whole poem tonight but I would rather explain to you what was shown to me about the decisions Christ had to make about having flesh on him. How that changed him forever. What that meant that the decision he had to make about how important that was and even why did he have to make that decision. It was so important that his son come in the flesh. You know that he walked the earth and experienced the things that we did and even know how we feel about things. Of course we know that that also meant that he would die for our sins because you know that was all compromised back when Adam gave up the authority he had and he chose what the enemy had said. He chose over what God had said to him about who he was. He chose what the enemy said. Therefore that took our authority. A lot of our authority where in the earth and Christ was the one you had to come and redeem that. And so yes there is a whole thing a whole scenario about how that happened. And so I'm just going to tell you the very first part of the poem you may like you may not like it. Well that's up to you. So it starts with this and the year before Christmas when all of the father's house every creature was stirring yes even the mouse and so that is the first line of that poem and it does talk about in the poem about Christ coming in the flesh how that happened and why that had why that even had to happen. So yes there were many meetings held in the throne room and even in there's a board room that the father has he has different people come in Christ comes in many times and they discuss things that are about to happen and how they're going to cause that to happen. And one of the most important ones was how is Christ how is the son of God who was then called the word and even the reason why he was called the word the father would go somewhere with the word and he would speak what he wanted made and the word would step out and make it. And we know in the book of John it talks about things like that even what I'm going to talk to about tonight is it says that the word was with God and the word was God and that the word became flesh. So right there's your scripture about what I'm going to talk about so just how that was happened how it would impact the earth how authority would be given back to the body of Christ because of Christ being willing to die on the cross and really take our place. And so that's what they discussed and even the host had to be brought in he had explained he was the lord of host he had explained to them that they could not intervene or interfere with this host situation and coming to the earth. He didn't want them cheering up people and stopping the plan that they had to make this happen. So even the host were involved in all of this all of heaven was involved at one point there were not people living in heaven at this time other than Elijah and Enoch they were the only ones that were there in the flesh. No one else was they were on Abraham's bosom if they died and they were counted righteous because of their faith in God they didn't go into hell they went to paradise. And so all of heaven was a stir they were all talking about how the word would have to become you know flesh and where flesh it would be different and they would all have to get used to it. And even the word had many discussions with his father about it he had to make a hard decision and he finally said yes I'll do it. He knew it was our one chance to really be redeemed that we would be allowed into heaven and that was what was necessary that you couldn't take sin into heaven at all. You had to be righteous you had to receive Christ as your savior so there were many things that even that they discussed before we even knew about it on the earth. And so what happened was the decision they finally made was when the time came close and they knew that Mary would have to carry the Son of God that they made the plan that Christ would be turned into a seed and act as the seed of the woman people that's right there what talks about in the Bible that would be Christ where he had to be placed in the womb as a seed and he had to be attached and knit together in a very womb because that's the only way that could happen. So the Holy Spirit talked to him all the way down to the earth is actually what happened. Talked to him they were yes they were both God of course but they were very very very good friends and the Holy Spirit was talking to the Word encouraging him letting him know that he was really giving himself for everybody and it would change all of eternity for everybody and it was really a beautiful story it was a beautiful thing about love and sacrifice and willingness and even later on we know in the garden he struggled with that a little bit you know that he didn't want to drink the cup that was discussed that he would have a cup brought from heaven he would have every sin every wickedness every evil in it and that Christ in the garden would have to drink that cup the reason he went to the cross wasn't just to hang there it was to take that stuff and nail it to the cross forever which is why he's the only one that has the right to the only one to forgive our sins because he's the only one who paid a price for those sins and so all this was said in a lot more great detail than I'm telling you now but I'll probably do a CD or DVD about it one day it was still a beautiful story of sacrifice and love and so he knew that he had to be willing to do all this he knew that he would have the twelve disciples all this was explained to him although as a child when he first of course was born heaven showed up people why wouldn't they they knew who he was they knew he was the son of God they knew that he was there to give a sacrifice of himself and I think the one thing people probably don't think about was the ones who came in the sky and saying was the army Gabriel announced that this divine conception had taken place Gabriel got to be an announcer but the ones who sang for the army because Satan the ones who were kicked out with him were the worship angels that he was in charge of did you ever think about that one third remember one third uh Lucifer was over them because the worship Michael was over a third for the army Gabriel was over the third for being guardian angels and all the worker angels and stuff like that so they were already divided they were divided into groups and the one only one thing to convince that he was going to take over was the ones that he was over so all of the most of the worship angels were kicked out of heaven with with Lucifer so the ones who came in the sky weren't what you would normally think of which is why the shepherds were so afraid that actually is the truth you see an army show up in heaven in the sky there's mostly creatures and they're strange looking but powerful I think they would make any shepherd afraid so even those things were explained in this whole thing that I was shown told and then shown by the father and so yes Christ had to be born he was born in the manger as it says in the bible and he grew up as like he was a known in the natural to be the son of the carpenter Joseph a master carpenter and so that's how he grew up in his beginning of his life but you know when they had to escape to Egypt later you know that right because I think Herod was after them and so they had to leave and they were warned to leave and go to Egypt and that's where they went to be protected then he started studying in in different to dialects and stuff like that he was very well learned and educated they had great wealth to take with him because of the wise men coming and so he did really escape as a little baby it took I think a couple years for the wise men to kind of show up to bring them and stuff but they didn't bring one jar of something and one little cache of something there were three caravans from three wow so they had enough wealth pretty much to last them for the rest of their life I know the word says that Christ became poor that we might be rich but he became poor the moment he left heaven you know the wealth that they had there and how rich they were there you would understand why that was said that Christ as far as being supplied besides the fact that Joseph was a master carpenter well liked in the city and had many jobs given to him Christ also as he grew of course became a master carpenter and he was invited it said that he would sit with sinners and talk to them and people why would he do that he had carpentry jobs with them that's why he had contracts with them this whole beautiful story could give himself and I can tell you that Satan didn't know who he was that's why he questioned him that's why he went to the mountain of you know where he was mountain of temptation and he talked to him and everything about stuff he didn't really know who he was because his flesh looked different than the spiritual body he had in heaven and so that was that he would forever have that spirit that physical body would be forever be his and it would change the way that he looked not who he was obviously and so there was a lot of decisions he had to make about his own eternity and he said yes every time the other thing I do know is that that cup that held all the stuff in it is said in the Bible that Christ would go to the mountains to meet with his father you know this is as he was growing and he took him one time he took a cup to him a beautiful cup he had hand carved as a carpenter gave it to him and that was the very cup that that stuff was put in when it was brought back to the earth that's how the father of God was given to him and so that's the one that those two angels were sent on a mission from heaven into the garden with that cup and they stayed with him he had to make that decision to drink that cup so you actually can see the actually died to himself when he said to his father it's possible that this cup passed for me and yet he didn't but not my will be done for a year will be done and then he drank that cup so if you understand this is the father was given this great revelation on himself on his son on the life that he would live here on the earth and why he was the only one that could forgive sins people are saying how can he can only forgive he's the only one that took it to the cross and so I have a little bit more than that but that's what I wanted to share with everybody so on Christmas day you don't have to tell me it wasn't necessarily Christmas day that all this happened but let me tell you it is celebrated that's why it's called Christ mass it's to celebrate Christ and who he was and what he did for us in this earth and so I hope you enjoyed this little bit of revelation and maybe make sure you think a little bit differently about the price that he paid for you and I and why you will be allowed back in heaven as a believer you will be given access to heaven not just having the all of eternity in the most beautiful amazing stunning place filled with splendor and wonder and love and life and creativity that's where your future is that is who has you in his hand the son of the living God. Now just to clarify because we were trying to talk on the air how we would proceed today I have questions here I want to make sure you if there's anything else you want to share I'll give you that open. No, I'm done. Okay. Alright well you know I got a couple questions about the Christmas and first let me ask those first these are different people let's see which is the one or so Debbie's asking this something by the name of Debbie what does God think about us telling kids there's a Santa Claus now I mean I don't know for sure what she means does she mean what does he think about us trying to teach our kids or Santa Claus or does she mean having fun with the Santa Claus figure I would you know maybe you could just whatever you want to say on that issue about Santa Claus Well I would just say this he's in heaven that might cause a little row with some people but St. Nicholas that was the other thing I usually talked about at Christmas time St. Nicholas was a real person he lived on this earth he was from Turkey I think he had he was a high up person in the church and the one thing he would always stand for was the validity of Christ being the son of God he would never tolerate someone coming to the town trying to convince people that he really wasn't the son of God he didn't handle that very well he had a staff and that wasn't just a lead to just edge around he would actually confront these people who were heretics and all this is true it's all recorded in in history books and other places like that but he would not tolerate that happening he was also very wealthy and yes he actually this very person which was called St. Nicholas people don't like the word saying it says in the Bible we're all saints of God so just you know that we are the saints of God that's what one of our names is the body of Christ and so St. Nicholas was called that because of his relationship on behalf of Jesus Christ and what he stood for but he actually did get gifts and leave him for children that was something he did in his life he had decided to do that and he blessed children especially those who couldn't have anything of their own he blessed them all the time and he did this for most of his life I'm trying to remember what country that was in I don't remember right now but anyway that was something he did so we're talking about a real person we're not talking about a made up plastic thing in the sign of a store or something like that so St. Nicholas really existed on the earth he lived in Turkey he did give gifts to children so all that part is very true and you know when you go to heaven you use your gift well that's what he's doing in heaven that is what he's doing in heaven and he gives out gifts still to children and Jesus Christ actually comes and they create toys together and he's not like me saying this but you know I'm a person of truth and all I can share is what was shown to me or told to me and so I don't think he minds I don't think he's threatened by him I think that this is the one time of year that people actually forgive each other they help each other they reach out to do things that they never would do before I think this is the beautiful wonderful time of the year it's not just about the Santa Claus is there isn't it's about giving it's about caring it's about sharing and this is looked forward to by many people in the earth sometimes the only time they get something given to them sometimes the only time they get to attend a service that actually talks about the Son of God and so that's the way I always look at it I don't look at it like Satan Claus or something like that that's outrageous and God doesn't think of him that in that way either especially since he lived there he would never call him that you'll find out yourself one day when you get there and you'll see that all of this is true but this is a beautiful time of the year please consider helping somebody that's good reaching out to others that have less than you do I think that would bless the heart of God more than what you think about man's tradition and with the fact that Saint Nicholas was really a real person of course you know I'm guessing he's not wearing a red suit in heaven but maybe he is I mean what have you seen you've seen anything with a beard with a robe he had a robe on I think it was red a red robe he certainly has a white beard absolutely and he lives where it snows in heaven oh that's perfect so now what do you think then Kat or what what the parent may also be saying well what if I want to take my little two and three year olds and say let's go see Santa in the mall what what about that that good is that okay then they have to make their own for their own child we kind of always knew that that was something that just portrayed a person who really lived on the earth and that we were excited that somebody actually cared to give yeah that's my own decision that's the decision you have to make for yourself I don't think people should be criticized there's so many people involved in the Satanism and witchcraft and nobody says anything it's like I guess it's okay to do that but not to do for somebody who's doing kind good things I want to ask a question now about the fact you know I absolutely accept that Satan did not know who who the Christ child was at first and yet it's surprising because there is that place where the where you just described it where they're saying unto you is born this day in the city of David a savior who is Christ the Lord so I'm thinking was he just not tuned in did he not know what a savior was or did he not know that God would be would even do such a thing he wasn't aware that that had even taken place I guess he wasn't aware at all about it he was not aware okay so there'd just be no knowledge okay he wouldn't be asking him those questions yeah well right yeah and what he knew was when he actually heard them say it yeah when he actually heard them say and when he answered the question said yes I am the son of the loving God at that moment he knew who he was so Karen's asking a general questions about you talked about the birth of Jesus she's wanting to know if you have any other insights on the shepherds the wise men or the star and you did just give new information about the they came on a caravan with all of this wealth so that's that's if they weren't wealthy be the caravans were coming from three different places they were in the from the east but they were coming from there in that star was put in the sky absolutely to guide them to the right place okay well and it does make sense and so they were if they weren't wealthy before because of Joseph being a master carpenter they were instantly wealthy the moment all of this gold frankincense and myrrh were given to them that's right and that would have carried him for most of his life wouldn't have okay so that was that was a small token gift at all so okay I don't know if they have any other questions there I think I think that's it on that that I can extract from it okay I think those are Christmas questions I've got so I'll just go ahead and down the list then Kat for all these new questions Mary's asking Mary's asked this I've always thought of the horse Pegasus is there one in heaven I guess that's a winged horse I asked someone what's Pegasus because I didn't know so Pegasus was a winged horse probably out of Greek mythology but they want to know are there winged horses in heaven well you know the Satan did know I mean Satan knew they were there he would take anything of a verdant twist at making anything else he could on the earth which he did a lot so a Pegasus they do have flying heaven absolutely yes they do why wouldn't they yeah they do have them there but you know these type of things we're talking about Satan knew that he knew the things that God had there he knew the places of this in heaven wherever he could take a twist and bring deception or lies he did it he was a big copycat because he couldn't treat anything himself yeah good alright so that they do have that and he's asking this dear Kat would you please explain what it means to be timeless and I guess they're I guess she's out she's talking about in heaven without clocks in the passage of time I guess is what she's saying do you have any other way it's hard to describe timelessness without discussing time so what would you say about that well in heaven a lot of things are planned according to events not a calendar and they're just announced they're announced in heaven that this is going to take place and or so and so is going to have this here and you can go see that and be a part of that it's just stuff that's kind of known by people and they learn to live that way they learn to live without clocks without calendars without things like that they just know that whatever they need to know about or is going to be new or something then they will receive announcements like that and everybody will hear it at the same time I mean from a practical sense it seems like if the unit they're going to announce heaven Williams is going to have a show a comedian show which you talked about they would have to know that it's about the start so everybody hurry on over or what they would just know immediately whenever that was going to happen they'd say these are some things that will be happening you know coming up happening and then they'll just know okay this is about the start make sure you get there make sure you get a place and stuff like that and they just do it without even thinking about time when you're caught up timeless means you don't age ever okay that's what you're describing back to several times about you were shopping you went to reach something on the shelf suddenly you're in heaven you had what he might have taken you to two or three places in heaven and shown you things and then when you come back after that somewhat long encounter it's a second later right so I mean that's kind of timeless right they didn't have passage of time as we would understand passage of time well that leads me to wonder if my father who went before me and my grandparents who are there and would it seem to them like when we go from for another 50 60 years down here after they've left does it seem like a few days to them that we think they don't really understand the passage of time they're not looking down for the conception of the passage of time things have happened you know those things have happened but they don't really think wow it's been 10 months since I've been here or seen anything they don't think like that yeah it's me and my pea brain I'm thinking someone had to train them to act and believe timeless you know but alright so good let me just get that one Ruth Ann says I know that there are no tears or sadness in heaven but are there tears of joy I wait now just thinking about seeing my parents I think probably there are tears of joy and when it says you know when he'll wipe away all tears it's at the end of the Bible that's after all of the living and all this stuff has been going on after everything is over it's actually at the judgment seat of Christ where he shows you things that maybe you should have done or could have done but didn't and he says he will wipe away all tears and the former things will be remembered no more talking about the way that your life had been had been on the earth but I think there are tears of joy why wouldn't there be yeah yeah alright Jacqueline is asking this well every once in a while a question gets through and I usually edit them out because they say when was the last time you were taken to heaven and you usually say I go all the time so how would you answer that if someone said when was the last time I'll go ahead and ask Jacqueline's questions when was the last time Kat was taken to heaven? I would say probably yesterday yeah whenever I'm sitting usually not doing not really doing anything spiritual actually and then he'll just come and catch me up and show me different things that are in heaven or things that are about to happen a lot of what I'm showing is the celebration still about the celebration that's going to happen on the earth how life will begin to change because these are not the worst days on the earth people think they are but they're not and I just have to tell people they're going to change very very very majorly change on this earth yeah yeah I think I might have asked this one time but Erin's asking this do they have cruises in heaven like a cruise ship that would go somewhere they do have ships as huge ships some of them are like sailing ships and some are different types of ships so yeah but you can go not like a cruise line or anything but you can totally take cruises in heaven so it's not like a when we think of a cruise I think of a seven day cruise I don't think they do that you've not seen anything like that okay though there's your answer right there say that again some people imagine is a ship oh no that's a different thing altogether isn't it well because you have said some people have have mansions that are as big as a city you've said and so there must be some sort of equivalent if someone was highly rewarded but love ships and wanted to live on one it might be a massive massive ship I guess yeah it would and you can take friends on it family on it very cool okay so Betty is saying this most of these I have not pre read so I'm getting a fresh one three angels brought me a message Betty saying three angels brought me a message they were white robes with gold sashes over their shoulders which crossed in their front upper body there was a gleaming gold amulet in the center of their chest where the sashes crossed or converged what does the gold represent in the angelic ranks that's the question I don't know if it's something I think that they just have different things that they wear at different times I've seen those same outfits on some of them and it may be maybe a mission they're going on or something like that it could be something like that or something going on and having an event in heaven and that's what they were asked to wear for that so I don't know the reasoning why they would have different clothes or stuff like that to change it I do know that they do of course I've never been to my knowledge but I would think gold would be everywhere everywhere everywhere you'd see gold everywhere the streets are the most beautiful gold it's like it's the iridescent almost like a clear gold you cannot tell height or depth most of the time you just know it's there and it's just filled with this beautiful beautiful gold and people do walk on them all the time I've heard I don't know if it was Jesse Duplantis but someone who went to heaven were talking that the streets of gold almost had a translucent property that you could almost see through it okay this thing kind of almost see through it like a white gold or a seasy alright so Joy is asking this what is your Kat's favorite part or place in heaven what do you look forward to the most when you arrive in heaven for eternity so there's a kind of two quick questions what's your favorite part and what at the moment you arrive in heaven what do you look forward to the most I guess it's the question I love to be in this room I just love the way the people adore Christ and they worship the Father I really love that atmosphere and the beauty of the seraphim dipping down into the glory cloud and the living creatures are so powerfully amazing so I have to say this is probably my favorite place seeing new places I haven't been or people who I know of course I can't talk to them or people who I knew on you to see that they're there and heaven I do love that also can I ask a question about the throne room versus because you said everyone has their own garden where they can meet with Jesus anytime they want to so if someone if you were to go tell your friend this is my what if I just I've spent two hours with Jesus and she might say I was just with Jesus in the throne room since he's omnipresent would something like that be said because he's all places at once oh yeah it would be said people know that he can be anywhere all at the same time yeah that's fascinating to me because it's a little bit weird to me I have to think about but on the other hand the fact that I can have him to myself when I want him let me ask you this if you've seen if you may have seen this are there some people I don't mean selfish as a sin I'm not talking about sin are there some people who are so intent on spending time with the Lord they just almost never let him go they just want to spend I think that they don't do that because they know there's other people who want to see them and be with them I'm talking about them theirself yeah okay okay so that's just not a thing yeah Marilyn is asking will we see our prayers which were not answered when we were alive fulfilled in heaven so I don't really understand what she's saying if there were prayers that were not yeah will we see that maybe she's saying when she goes to be with the Lord and there were prayers not yet answered when she was on the earth will she see and get answered by those that are remaining on the earth will she actually see it come to pass from heaven she'll look down and see it answered I'm not I'm not sure that's the possibility okay yeah boy people getting creative with these questions I've heard you talk about this a few times what do you know about the Nephilim both past and present so present means are the Nephilim on the earth but today that's one question the other one is what about the Nephilim back then what do you know about them the Nephilim were the offspring of the angels who fell into sin the ones he became that became worshipped and the Nephilim were their offspring that they made with with mankind the Nephilim were not those fallen angels are they so are there evil creatures or what are the evil beings no they would look just like humans they were born from a human you know it says that they it says that those angels you know took women for their wives or just took women and out of their relationship Nephilim were created they would look like probably maybe really huge large humans some I guess when they died they would look like anybody else they would probably go to hell if they were evil and wicked I don't know about the others but I do know that they are not the ones who fell they were not the ones who fell into sin they were the ones who took the women and created offspring the Nephilim were their offspring I do know okay I'm not quite clear while the offspring which are called Nephilim were any of those can they be saved some of them I'm not sure about that part I do know that some of them were not good and they did evil things even on the earth but I'm not sure that they all did okay and are you know are there Nephilim alive today that's what the other question I don't know about that either okay I would think that they were human they were human they were superhuman they all died eventually I mean they didn't have an eternal life that they lived in that body that human body forever well maybe I mean spirits still on the earth in other words they couldn't have this would have all been before the flood Kat or the Nephilim before the flood right were they were the Nephilim alive after the flood or only before the flood I don't really know that either he hasn't really all I know is for sure is who they were and that they were born in human form okay they were born in human form they had a human life they lived they were probably super strong super smart beings but I think they all did eventually die okay all right Jennifer asks I know a mom whose baby died of SIDS which is sudden infant death syndrome and she is still grieving over this loss a few years later is there anything I can say to help her understand that her baby is waiting for her family in heaven that is exactly what is happening and that baby is waiting and will be given to her mom when she gets to heaven no matter how long it's been she will get to raise that baby in heaven well I mean isn't it true that the very thing that she just said is what you would say you would say people that I know and love and trust will tell that your baby went to be with Jesus and they are with Jesus yeah so that's the question yeah that's the answer all right Maritza is asking this as I was cooking she says as I was cooking I looked out the window and saw a translucent dove its wings were fluttering and its colors were so beautiful is this the Holy Spirit the dove is translucent and clear in heaven so those are the two questions I think doves can be any color in heaven that they want to be I know that's one of the symbols that represents Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is a powerful being he is God also and he is usually invisible he has fire coming from him he has colors of the rainbow coming from him so I think that they because of the word what it talks about the dove people say that by the way you mentioned several times even today you said the Holy Spirit is God in the throne room there must be times when the father and the son are sitting on the thrones and to his right is Jesus to the father's right is Jesus is the Holy Spirit ever sitting on a throne with the other two or is he he just stands to the left he just stands to the left yes because it seems there's a well there like a well there's an oil of the Holy Spirit there's activities that he's doing a lot involved with a lot in heaven and of course even though he has come to the earth because we know that Christ said I will send him he also is a multi-layered being so he can be in heaven he can be in the earth okay well yeah for some reason I maybe I don't know if I've asked you this before in heaven the father and the son have you ever conversed with all three together they're all there to to converse with Kat I think a couple times I have Holy Spirit like my best friend he lives in me and so he talks to me nonstop all the time he's a talker huh that's good David's asking this how do you worship and give praise to the Trinity what does worship look like in heaven will we automatically know what it is what is pleasing to them so I mean that's kind of throne room stuff yeah I just think that they get they all get worshiped in heaven all the time and the three in one you know I mean I talk a lot about the Trinity to myself that they can they have the ability to step inside of each other it would be the Godhead and then when they step out of the three there's three of them can you clarify Kat on this the Holy Spirit Jesus said I'll send him but he won't speak of himself but he will speak what I've been given it's like so I was raised we never talked about the Holy Spirit because he would never he would never talk about himself he would only speak of Christ or the father and that was what I was taught was true so when I began to talk about the Holy Spirit being my best friend it seemed odd to me because I thought no no he was just here to talk about Jesus all the time well he does talk to me about Jesus a lot I mean he does talk about things that are about to happen he talks about shows me things to come that's what he does it's his purpose he walks with us and it goes to our life with us so okay so here's one in the scripture where it says do not grieve the Holy Spirit by whom you were sealed into the jay of salvation so he has feelings I assume he could get those feelings here because it says don't grieve the Holy Spirit by whom you were sealed I think I'm saying that right do you know what that would be how would you know exactly what that would be I just know that he was sent for a purpose and we really need him in our lives I think that you have a whole lot more of heaven and have more revelation when you have them in your life because that's one of the reasons it's here yeah so I'm gonna keep gonna ask you a couple more questions about the Holy Spirit because this is really on me today but when you wake up in the morning how do I ask this question does he start talking to you and you hear his voice and he's sometimes he'll talk to me but usually I start talking to them I say good morning to them okay I say good morning each one of them that I'm so excited that they're in my life and I'm so grateful for all that they do for us so I usually start the conversation yeah and I may mention this on the air one other time my spiritual father Wade Taylor who's gotten to be with the Lord about 10 years ago now but he and I prayed together on the phone every day for five years straight with a couple of exceptions and so he really sowed and sowed and sowed everybody we would be talking and once at a great well this only happened like twice as I remember and he something you know something made him sneeze so he was talking or praying and he suddenly sneezed and he said excuse me Lord and I remember thinking wow I wasn't I wasn't anything except wow I felt like I'm thinking to say because you would even say excuse me to the Lord because you say excuse me to someone else if you pardon me or whatever so talk about this balance between so Wade was a friend of God clearly but the balance between him as your best buddy your friend Holy Spirit and Jesus and maybe even father versus father as judge of all the earth is it depend on where I think of the father as my father and that's really the way I think of him most of the time that he carried us before we were sent to the earth that we had a special relationship with him and of course the Lord is my king he's my king he's my savior and Holy Spirit is my best friend because well he's a drama king never one because he loves to explain he loves to share he loves to be a part of our lives and I think that's probably the best way I can it's not so holy and above that you can't know them they are of course they are but that's the way I think of them and that's the way that I spend time with them it sounds like when he loves to explain things would you say the Holy Spirit's a great teacher he likes to teach you things I think if he teaches me something it's revelation it's not a word but yeah so but he's explaining he'll give you some revelation and then explain it to you alright Lisa is asking can you tell us anything about Job have you seen or heard anything of him in your visits to heaven of Job? Job yeah Job of the Bible I'm sure you know I haven't seen everybody yeah sure probably not a lot about Job now here's a how is this possible thing so here's Heather asking how did Jonah survive in the fish that doesn't mean you know the answer to this but it's the question so I'm reading it to you how did he survive in the fish that's the question yeah it's pretty simple isn't it I think it's pretty simple he kept him alive and he kept him alive inside he had a purpose for him he still wanted him to finish what his assignment was he should go to the land and tell the people yeah okay Sandy's asking this Kat people are always saying to watch a specific movie or to not watch it because it can open the door to the enemy how do I know how to discern movies for myself I guess she means how do I discern which movies to watch or not watch I think she might be saying well I think if they have wickedness or evil extreme violence profanity and sexuality I think it should be pretty simple but those things wouldn't be in heaven they shouldn't be in your life yeah I mean some of them in ours would probably be automatic warnings wouldn't they I would certainly think so yeah and then you don't have to work very hard to look at reviews that's right there are Christian reviewers too Cheryl asks has Kat seen the lambs book of life is it a real book do names ever get removed or have you ever seen a name get removed I haven't seen any get removed I know that they can be removed I know because the word says that they can play that your name not be blotted out it says that it is a real book that's looked at at the end time so in other words let's say someone as a younger person received Christ and was in the beloved their names written in the lambs book of life it can be removed under certain circumstances is that what you're saying I think you would probably be real severe circumstances really really probably so it's pretty rare then yeah that's why I would believe it I believe it would be back when I was raised I thought I was one of the most common things known to me you know that God was waiting to get you sorry but that's how kind of I was raised alright Lori asks have you ever this is a longer question this is like two or three sentences have you ever seen angels singing and do they sing their own songs I see in scripture that God sings over us they are living creatures in the 24 elders singing in Revelation but I don't see other scriptures that speak of angels singing and our worship services we have actually heard angels singing very high in pitch above the congregation can you reveal about anything about this to us I guess mainly the question is have you seen angels singing I guess I have seen them sing but they sing in many places of course they sing in heaven they sing during the worship lots of them do some of them are on the stage in the band like up there where other people wouldn't see oh they play an instrument like a heavenly instrument oh cool wow that opens up a whole lot of questions for me but so would these be instruments that we would recognize or are they completely odd instruments we've never heard some are completely different than anything you've ever seen a regular keyboard like we know it the keyboard would be round okay like what you described with Kim Clement yes just like that okay okay that's fascinating Brad is asking this looking at our time here a couple more questions do the hosts celebrate before battle and before battle and after they have a victory in battle if so do they sing or dance and celebrate like we do do they get to eat celebration cake and feast do they have I know that they have a lot of they eat a lot of I can't say the same thing but I'm sure that every now and then they will partake of other food in heaven and I do know that the angels have really a whole separate life of things that they do that they're a part of aside from their assignments on the earth I know all of them but I do know that they do have other things that they actually do in heaven that we don't do yeah I'm looking at that and is there any such thing this is me coming in with a question around this one if they have celebratory times of after they win a battle do do guides angels if they're not if there's not enough prayer support do they ever lose a battle do they lose a skirmish with the enemy I don't think they lose a skirmish I think once they've been sent and assigned especially if it's by the father they're there till they win and I think some people if they give up too soon that might be the only thing that will affect maybe taking longer for them to win so when you make your stand keep your stand don't change what you've made a decision with in your life especially if you've asked for help you know that thing where Gabriel tells Daniel that he tried he worked on for 21 days against the Prince of Persia and he finally got Michael the archangel to help him get through he was it sounds like he was he was not prevailing he was either losing or he simply couldn't move forward and he finally asked the head of the host Michael captain of the host I guess they sent Michael yeah can a person when they're you know we send the whole I think that that that was a decision made in heaven to send Michael okay okay okay so wasn't all right Brittany let's see we got a few questions here Brittany asks you mentioned that people in heaven can have fish and other marine animals as pets have you seen places where fish come up out of the water um yeah there's they yeah fish actually don't have to swim to live they can live with the air or not reading air um so can people and so I have seen sometimes something like that oh okay and Amanda's asking how can you tell the difference when it's the Holy Spirit Jesus or the father talking to you I've had this come to you before I can't you how do you know who's talking are their voices distinct when you hear them or is it some other way if I hear what I'm sorry how do you know the difference between the Holy Spirit Jesus and the father when they talk to you their personalities are different and she's a personality father speaks to me like he is my father and Jesus always like um like I mentioned before you know he even Jesus takes me to places in heaven sometimes if the father doesn't the Holy Spirit doesn't so it depends on what's on their heart at the time to share with me or do with me okay and then last question on my list today Ruth asks this are Jonathan and King David still good friends in heaven oh I'm quite sure that they are all they went through in their lives down here on there's I'm quite sure that they are still good friends oh good good good well can't we get to them they're right at the top of the hour too that was exactly the match here so um anything else you want to add before maybe I'll ask if you'll pray for the people I just really want to pray for the people yeah okay Father I thank you for this day this beautiful day you've given all of us that there's hope in our heart joy in our heart God because we know you are in charge of the people don't

Hello, and happy Wednesday, 1227, obviously the date is different 1228 Wednesday, 1228, 1227 is we pre-recorded this on Tuesday, so I first up right of the gate, I want to apologize for my shirt, it's got all these tiny little dots, and it's doing this crazy thing, digital video does not like patterns like this, and I know that, but it was too late to change it, and I was like, you know what, whatever, I'm just going to point it out, it's a living, moving shirt, that's what it is, in the spirit of what we're talking about today with heaven, and all that stuff. We are, we're going to jump right in, because we've got only about 40, 40 minutes, so really quick, just wanted to remind you that we're streaming to three locations, that's Elijah List on Facebook, Elijah Streams on Facebook, and then Elijah Streams on Rumble, which is the happening place, there's a big old party happening on Rumble and everywhere else, but yeah, so subscribe, like us, all that good stuff. Also, really quick, we're going to play a quick video on the wells, and then we're going to just jump right into Kat. I'm here at one of the water well conditions, and you saw my joy, it's been a heavy downpour, but everyone is stuck in their suits, they're excited about this miracle that is happening in Rite 8, today, joy, joy, joy is so much. So much said, thank you so much to everyone that has made this possible, the people right here are overjoyed, and they have trust in God. Thank you! So, really quick, I forgot to tell everybody, I'm filling in for Steve, this was recorded on Tuesday, his power is out as of the recording of this, that's why you're seeing me again. I get to hang out with Kat, so it's going to be great. So, you have a message I have been told regarding this new year, this is the last Wednesdays with Kat and Steve of the year, before we move into 2023, so I want to just let you go for it, okay? I just want to let people know that God has never changed his plan for all of us, and I know some of you, probably most of you, have never had to stand so long for something to happen. But you know, God has his reasons, and I'm not saying he really is behind all this, you know, the enemy is, we know that, the enemy wants to try to take over the world, that's his plan, and he's going to fail so miserably, probably the worst fail he's ever done except crucified Christ. It even says in the Bible he would have never done it had he known what that would have caused him. So, guess what, the day's going to come when he would have wished he never did any of this, because he's so openly revealing evil to people in the world who never saw it before, but guess what, who's greater than evil? I will tell you who is, the Most High God. He knows exactly what's going on, he knows everything that's been done, said, planned, all of it before it ever happened, he knew that. He actually had me several years before all this started to say, that he was going to expose darkness. Of course, I didn't know at that time how he was going to do it, but he is absolutely exposing all of the darkness. Why? Because he's going to take it down, people. These are the greatest days we'll ever see on the earth, literally the next 100 years, no matter what you think, roll up your rapture rug, Jesus isn't going to come and have a pathetic testimony of who he is, and I know a lot of people, I'm not making fun of you because you're concerned, because you're afraid, you need to be talking about what God's going to do. That so empowers you. It connects you to heaven, it connects you to the Father, it connects you to the Son, the Holy Spirit, and I will just say this, there is nothing that will stop happening what God has planned for this world. It is not going to work, no matter who's doing it, whether they're doing it or anything else. This is his time. These are his days of greater glory, baptism in fire. Are you kidding? So many people getting born again, running into the kingdom, and I mean every kind of group you think out there that is not wanted by God. He loves everybody. He cannot agree with evil. Evil cannot enter into heaven, because then it would be just like the earth. If you want a good reason for that to happen, but I can tell you right now that he knows what he is doing. And everything he said on November the 4th, 2020, he is going to do all of that. So go find it, because I'm telling you this is exactly what will happen. And I'm excited, no matter what. I've had to go through things, we've all had to experience things, and I'm so excited, I can't hardly talk right now. Anyway, I just want you to know that God does have a plan, and guess whose plan matters? His does. So this is the word of the Lord to you and anyone interested. Who thinks that they are greater than I am? Who thinks they are more powerful than I am? Who thinks they know more than I know? The earth is mine. The fullness thereof is mine. These people, they are mine. I have planned for their lives. I've called them, appointed them, anointed them. Listen to the words of the true prophet. They know what they are saying. They hear my voice. And you will never be sorry that you stood and did not turn back, because your reward will be so great in these days. And you will laugh and laugh and laugh while you're celebrating these days that are coming on the earth. And darkness will be crushed and pushed back, and people who are wicked and evil will lose their place, their money, their position, their name, their plans. They're going to lose it all, because they cannot stand before me and lie. I know what lies are. I know what they sound like. I know who the great deceiver is. He will not win. He will fail, fail, fail, fail, fail. And everyone who sides with him will fail also. Prepare for great joy to begin to flood your soul, because this year, this next year will be filled with so many things of greatness, excitement. And I can tell you what, no matter what comes before you, you may say, I will only serve the Most High God. I will not receive any wickedness or evil. I will keep all those evil reports out of my home. I'll evict them right now. I'll go get my front doors blown open and say, I evict all of the wickedness out of here. Every word spoken, it was wrong. It was corrupt. It was defiling. I will not allow it to be in my presence. That's what you need to say. And you will say instead, but I choose to bind the love of God, the life of God, the presence of God. His will, His way this day, because this earth will be filled with Michael. Amen. Wow. Yeah. Amen. Amen to that. And I'm going to pray for people to know. By the way, I know I just pray and hold up all these people, Father, watching this, no matter when they watch it, God. Flood them with your presence. Flood them with your love. Flood them with your plans right now, God. Heal their infirmities. Heal their lack. I thank you, Father, that you have such love and care for all of them. You do care. We lived in you before we were here. You knew us before we were born, before we had flesh on our bodies. You knew the plans you had for us. And I thank you, God, for showing that to everyone out there who loves you, who wants to know you, God. Forgive those who have sinned, God. When they repent, I thank you. Expect goodness to come. Let God show His goodness to you. In Jesus' name, I declare to be so. Receive it. Amen. Amen. Amen. Something that I say a lot on the show I host, Elijah Fire, I've been saying it a lot the past couple of months, and I think it's worth repeating, especially on here, is I think there's a lot of, in the world, there's a lot of over-emphasis on the plans of Satan. And as if, and what I find happens is a lot of people go, what's God going to do? God, you've got to stop this. And God has really given me this revelation about how it's the other way around. That Satan is always doing something in response to what God is doing, because if it was the other way around, it would mean that God, like, Satan has plans that God doesn't know about. You're right about that. Yeah. And the reality is that... God knows Satan doesn't know about God's plans. Exactly. Yeah. And so it's whatever we're seeing, all the evil in the world is in response to what God is doing, which I make a point to point out this. Especially all of this stuff that is targeting children. God is doing something within children. And Satan is trying to stop it. And obviously, you know, the media glorifies that, those efforts more. But I'm very excited about 2023, Kat. Like, very excited. I'm very happy. Yeah. Yeah. So we have a couple of questions. Oh, we got a couple of questions. But first we're going to ask one from me, which is crazy weird. And it's a 100 percent legitimate question. I just wanted to know. So obviously we know that our pets go to heaven, right? We've talked about that a lot. Can I increase the size of my cat so I can ride it like a steed? I've always wanted to know. Like, can I ride my cat like a horse? I would not be surprised at all. It is heaven, okay? That's where really the impossible is possible. I don't know why he wouldn't. And they probably would enjoy that very much anyway. Yeah, I would say yes. Okay. Yeah. Always, always wanted to know. So, okay, so we've got, we're going to go through quite a few of these. Okay. Ella Dea, she's age 11. She asks, can anything we imagine be in heaven? I'm wondering if there's anything like an ice cream land in heaven. I'm pretty sure there is definitely an ice cream land in heaven. If there's jello land, why not ice cream? Why not? I'm telling you, the ice scoops are huge, by the way. If you do go to an ice cream shop in heaven, which they do have, but why wouldn't there be ice cream land? It is where things are created. It is. The spirit of creation is there. We do learn, get to learn to create certain things, not people, of course, but many things. We use our own imagination. We will be creating things. So why not ice cream land? Yeah. Amen. Yeah. Why not? I would like to go there myself. All right. So Steve asks, when we command our hosts to take demons to dry places, should we pray that they be bound and chains until the day of judgment? I don't know that. I don't know. It depends on your authority and the level of authority that you're at that you do that. That's probably what that means. I do know that they're taken to a dry place. They don't like dry places. They don't. They're like mold, mildew, that oozy stuff and stuff, things like that. That's why they're told to be taken there. And it does say that in the Bible anyway. Just talks about the dry places. So no, they hate to be taken to the dry places. Well, and I have a question that kind of piggybacks off of that. So I've heard people say, and I bind you and, you know, you are bound until the day of judgment. But I would imagine over the course of however many years that people have prayed that enough to bind every single demon. That would mean there's no demons. I'm just curious how that whole thing works if you have any insight into that. I know because what he told me about binding and losing was to lose all of the darkness and bind all of God. That's the keys to the kingdom, the binding and losing. That's what that's about. I know even I as an intercessor was taught to bind the devil and there's nothing wrong in saying that. You know, I'm sure it has something to prevent him from doing things. But as far as the level of all that stuff, I don't know. Yeah, yeah. And honestly too, that binding and losing, you know, losing darkness, binding things of God to you. It's amazing. Like anytime that, I know Steve talks about it a lot, I do it daily as well. And it's amazing like when you can be in this, you feel like you're in this fog. Like, you know, maybe there's a communication breakdown, really coming under a spiritual attack. And you do that and you take authority. It's amazing how much of a difference it makes. Yes, because it says we know Christ is the restorer of our soul. And he says, Jesus said, use the keys to the kingdom. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. So if you choose to bind the things of God like I just prayed, then it's going to happen. You know, why not bind the things of God to your soul? Nobody can take them away from you. That brings you joy, celebration, creativity. It brings you God's plans. That's what that does. And when you lose all that, like things you saw that maybe you didn't mean to look at or things you did that you didn't mean to do. They're gone. He comes and takes them away like they were never there. But for me, that binding and losing actually makes sense. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Alright, so Brandon asks, we have heard stories of angels joining humans to worship God. If a third of the angels who follow Lucifer were the worship angels, he's saying this is like a hypothetical. If a third of the angels who follow Lucifer were the worship angels, is it the messenger angels who are doing the worshiping now? And what do angel worship sessions in heaven look like? We actually replace them. Oh, okay. Our worship of God replaces, that's one of the reasons why they hate us to worship. The ones who used to worship that were kicked out, we actually replace. Our worship replaces the worship they used to give to God. And yes, almost any of the angels can, the host can worship. The host actually worshiped on the outside the manger on the day Christ was born. When a great host appeared and the shepherds were so afraid because the host looked like creatures. The only normal looking one was Gabriel. Gabriel showed up, he made the announcement, but it really said that they were so afraid of them that they wanted to hide. And that's why, because it wasn't what they would expect. So I do know that the host at one time had to take choir practice. Oh man, I love that. Your own guardian angels do worship too. They worship too. So in, I guess to kind of go off of that, our own guardian angels worship too. So while I'm worshiping the Lord, they're worshiping as well. Are they waging war so that I can be uninterrupted? They worship with you at home, wherever you are, you know, in church, same choice, they will be there to worship with you. Yeah. And your guardian angels are actually under Gabriel. Okay. They're not members of the host. They're called angels. The host are called host. The army of heaven is called the host. So your, your guardian angels are under Gabriel. Awesome. And they look more like people. Okay. Because there's a lot of different types. Yes. Yeah. I saw this great video. Someone had done like an artist rendition of what angels, like some of the angels described in the Bible. And it was, you see it and you're like, yeah, I could see why people, people would be afraid. Like they're, they're pretty hardcore looking. Yeah, they are. Yeah. So. All right. Daniel asks, no, sorry, Pat asks, does our heavenly planet have cities underground like in fantasy movies? Are they talking about heavenly planet? I don't know. You can answer however you want. I know that there's underwater. I know that they have the crystal sea. They have maintenance underwater on top of the water. There's so many different places, different types. I can't even number, you know, how many different ones they are. So I wouldn't be surprised, but it wouldn't be underground like here at all. And actually the spiritual ones like Abraham's bosom that was underground city that was made by God for Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all those he counted as righteous. They had a river. They had lights down there. It wasn't like a dark place in the middle of the earth. So you have to have a lot of understanding about spiritual places that have been built. So I wouldn't be surprised that they would be some. And then I think I'm just remembering there was this one time you talked about, do you say something like floating like doors like that you can go through in heaven that lead you like they're like almost like. There's just like a door in the air. I can't remember how you described it. Is that reading your own property? You have property in heaven and go to prepare a place for you on your property. There are doors that are about six inches, seven inches above the ground beside your own mansion. When you step to those doors, it's other places you made for you in heaven. That's cool. Yeah, my friend of mine, I was talking to him, he actually got to see his part of what his mansion looks like because he's like really big into fish. And he has a lot of aquariums. And he said it was the whole wall was an aquarium and that the fish actually could like swim out of the aquarium. And I keep absolutely so cool. They can swim in the air. They don't have to be in the water. Yeah, that's so cool. So okay, Kai asks, who are the people talked about in Matthew 721 through 26. It says not everyone who says to me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my father in heaven. Many will say to me in that day Lord Lord, have we not prophesied in your name cast a demons in your name and done many wonders in your name. And then I will declare to you, I never knew you, depart from me, you who practice lawlessness. I think this is an area that Satan really grabs this scripture. There are people who sin willfully sin while they say they are a Christian. That's what that is. So it could be people that are womanizing behind the scenes, but they're operating as a minister. It could be, yeah. Yeah, you cannot do evil things and think you're getting into heaven. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that one is a scripture. I feel like a lot of people, Satan is really used to like inject fear into people. Yes. I think it's really important. No, if you love the Lord, I know people, they make mistakes. They repent and stuff. That's not somebody like that. That's someone who on purpose willfully sins anyway. Yeah. So Kai, let that be a jet propulsion into 2023. You can walk free of condemnation if your heart is to please God. Your heart is to serve God. If you slip, you repent, you move on, right? Yes. You know, that run sprint into 2023, Kai. It's fine. Go for it. So, all right. Daniel asks, is there computer programming in heaven? I was, okay, I have another question that I might ask, but yeah, answer this one first. Is there computer programming in heaven? I think it's not anything like what we have here. It's such high tech, there's no way you could even try to describe it. Yeah. I'm serious about that one. They have things that we use for different things, but it isn't anything on anybody's level here. Hmm. Yeah. I think my question that kind of goes with this, because I was thinking about this earlier was obviously there's technology. You mentioned technology, because I think my assumption was always that, because we can still create in heaven, right? Yes. Yeah. So, so there's technology obviously, but it's powered by light, like you said. Yeah. And all of it stems from the father, right? So, but we can still create. I think she actually, yeah, he, we actually learned to create certain things. And yes, he works with us on that. Yep. Yeah. So cool. Can't wait. Love it. Wendy asks, what exactly happens when you release the anointing over things? Oh, I can tell you that one. Okay. Blue fire comes out of your hands. Number one, the anointing is one of the first weapons given to us. It said, when you receive Jesus Christ, you receive a deposit of the anointing and it lives in you, right there, people. And when you release it, it actually will destroy the works of the enemy, no matter where you release it, where you release it over. I will always tell people to release it over your family's homes, places you're going into before you go in there. Make sure you release the anointing and send it in to pull down these strongholds of Satan, you know, trash any demons that are in there. The anointing is very powerful. We've even done like tests with people where they've released it in the seats of a waiting room in a doctor's office and people would send them and they'd jump back up and sometimes the people would be healed. So the anointing is definitely something given to you. First John, 227, go look it up. So the anointing is a very powerful thing. It's one of the first things you are given as a believer. And so it sounds like, I mean, it sounds like a pretty no-brainer, but Christians should probably be doing it more than some of them are. Like every day. Like every day. Like I should do it a lot more. Everywhere I go, I'll release it into my car tires and you can. It's tangible. Oh, that's awesome. Everywhere I drive, it destroys things of the enemy. Yeah. I do that on, well, I'm on the freeway. I'll become aware of like, if I'm talking to the Lord or whatever, and I'll just get a sense of certain people. I'll be driving by somebody and all of a sudden I'll feel the sadness coming from their car. I'll like, just like, just start machine gun praying over everybody as I'm driving by them. So anybody can even children can learn how to do that. Awesome. Awesome. All right. Uh, Mia asks, can you go into heaven if you haven't fully forgiven others and have been interested in your heart? How does, how does that hinder you from, from going? I think that there's chances that he gives everybody, you know, you always have a moment if you've been serving him, loving him and maybe not understanding what you've been doing. And there's a big difference in, in holding unforgiveness inside of you and being upset about things. There's a big difference. And I think only God knows what that is, but he does give you before you get there. He'll give you a chance to repent of things. Yeah. Well, it's even like you were talking about with people who have fallen, given into the temptation to commit suicide. Um, and, you know, you talked about that it's a willful laying of your life down because that's right. More often than not with someone who commits suicide, they're not in a right headspace. They're, they're not. Yeah. They're not in control of their own mind. They're under a severe, probably severe, um, you know, attacks of the enemy where they can't think right or even plan right. And it's not that they want to end their life. They want to end the suffering. And that's what God said. Yeah. So he knows, he knows, he's the one who showed me that revelation that most people who have done that, if you look in the dictionary and look up the word suicide, it says willingly, knowingly, intentionally killing yourself to end your own life. So this, this person, obviously committing suicide is in the right mind. So these people who are taking their suffering away, they are not in the right mind. That's the difference. Hmm. All right. So this next one actually kind of goes with this because it's about mental illness. It says someone I know has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Have you seen the Lord heal this problem? Is it a demon or a sickness? I think it's probably spiritual. Most of the time it is spiritual, depending on how bad people have it or how long they've had it. There's almost always some form of demonic involved in that kind of stuff messing with your mind, especially with fear. You know, fear is one of Satan's biggest weapons. And so I would say that's, that's what I would go after. I'd go after to end the fear in their life and declare over them. I have seen people heal from it though. I can't believe it. Yeah. Okay. Susan asks, when I'm ready for bed at night, I pray and see in the ceiling swirls of color, usually green, blue and yellow, but it doesn't last long. What does you take? Do you have any insight in this? That means you have a prophetic gift. Ooh. That's exactly what it means. Hmm. Susan. Yeah. Do different colors mean different things? Is it? Really? It's just swirls of color. Okay. Sometimes like little whirlwind swirls, sometimes just little like bursts of light and stuff like that. Especially sometimes if your eyes are closed and you see it, that definitely is a prophetic gift. Hmm. Well, Susan, that's exciting. Keep pressing in. Yes. Okay. Roger asks, I've been told by doctors that I need a heart transplant and slash or a heart pump for my existing heart. How can I contend, he used quote unquote, contend for God to give me a new heart from the body parts room in heaven? I would have to say ask then start thinking of him instead of asking all the time. I think thinking him has a lot to do with it, but there are times part of a service like we've had powerful services in our church at New Life years ago, we did a lot and there would be like three, four hour worship services and all of a sudden you would feel the whole atmosphere change and Jesus was walking on the platform. Now our pastor didn't necessarily see him, but he would stand up and say, Jesus is here to shout out what you need. And I literally heard people say, I need a new heart. I need my mortgage paid. I need, you know, all these things. And then we had like two nights later, how many people had those prayers answered was phenomenal. They were phenomenal. Yeah. Come on. All right. There we go. Roger, just there you go. You're welcome. Amanda asks, what do Michaels and Gabriel's homes look like in heaven? Do they have homes? I can't remember if you said they've had homes. Do they even have them? I've been to Michael's headquarters. It's a castle like 500 feet high where all the hosts are trained. I've been there. Cool. I've been to that. It's powerful. It's amazing. Do they all train is just amazing. Do the host. So you've never seen their houses, but you've just seen the headquarters. I've not seen Michael's home personally. No. Okay. Not. What about Gabriel's? Nope. I haven't seen his either. Nope. See, that's the cool thing, Kat, is that you've been to heaven however many times and yet there's still so much that you get to experience yourself when you actually, that's exciting. Yeah. Do the random, do the host have like one specific type of weapon that they use or do they like? No. They have many weapons. They can become a weapon. Oh, okay. They can become a weapon themselves before they arrive to the battle. Like transformers. Yes. Transformers were the first ones. That was them. That's awesome. Crazy. All right. Carry, carry, carry in, carry. You know who you are. I have heard Kat speak that you have the authority to do a sole cleanse on behalf of your children until they understand. Does the same authority stand? Does the same authority stand to do a sole cleanse on behalf of your spouse, so children but then also a spouse? I think in some forms of it, yes, but it's mainly for your children who don't know or understand if they've been, had to be like bullied at school or stuff like that and they're all upset and they can't handle it. You have the right to let your hand in their head and said, I is the watcher of their soul. Command all of this to be released from their soul right now and Jesus name it will be like it never happened and Jesus comes and takes his way and it's like they never experienced any of the backlash of that. Okay. So Mary Ellen asks, are there mountains in heaven? What do they like? Yes, there are mountains, but Kat, what kind of mountains are there? Mountainous spices, which you're talking about in the Bible literally exist. And a lot of people like to go hiking there, camera, take camera equipment and go up there and take pictures and things up there. But there's also the father's backyard and that's what he calls it. His backyard of the tallest mountains in all of heaven, they're called the Titans. And I have been there. Wow. Amazingly beautiful. Wow. But then you have mountains, of course, that's why we have mountains down here. It says the earth is the shadow and a type of heaven. So that's why we have rivers. That's why we have snow. That's why we have all these other things because heaven does. Yeah. Oh man. And the mountain of spices, whenever I've heard you mention it, I've heard other people mention it too. For some reason, I always imagine like actual spice, like a mound of spices. Is it spice plants? Is it? No, no, no, no. It smells. It's the smell. Okay. Like it smells like pumpkin pie. It smells like the aromas are amazing and it changes as you go up to a new level. It looks like fall all the time in the mountain of spices. Wow. That's cool. Okay. That's even, that's because I honestly thought of like, it's got to be cooler than what I'm thinking. Yeah. All right. So Leslie asks, I am Chinese and as far as I know, I'm the first in my family line to have accepted the Lord. Yay. And my family line in China would most likely not have known Jesus. How would there be a cloud of witnesses for me? There could be many reasons for that. But some people who get born again, you never even know people, significant people prayed for these people back even 100, 200, 500 years, a thousand years ago, there was somebody praying for them to know Jesus Christ. And so at that moment before, right at that moment of death, he gave them a choice. And that's how they would be there. That's how they would be in heaven. So I have a question with that. So, you know, I was in missions for quite a few years. We spent a lot of time in intercession, praying over nations. So obviously I've heard you talk about, you know, if you're praying for a celebrity or praying for a loved one, there is that moment of, hey, because you had so-and-so, Jesus comes in because your mom prayed for you. I am here. Do you want to accept me? Can the same apply if I, I spent a lot of time praying for the people of China, not any one person particular. Yeah. I think it's because of the love that you have, the love of God and you that you want to see them free. That's why when it says the pointer and the man was to die, and then the judgment, that judgment right there at that moment is, can he use the keys to let you on? It's not talking about the judgment is not not the judgment, see the Christ or the great thing, what you have judgment. It's when you die. Is there somebody significant that's been praying for you, standing for you? But it's if he, that's why he got the keys, keys away from Satan. Awesome. All right, so Andrew asks, if we have a fully, if we are a fully manifested Son of God, what does our relationship with angels look like outside of just commanding them? It depends. You command the host. You don't command Gabriel's group. You don't command every angel because they answered a God directly, right? Yes. Yes. We are allowed to command the army of heaven because Christ was the Lord of hosts and therefore we have the right to do that. And when you get there, you will get to know them well, you know, from this side, it's mainly warfare, but up there, it won't be, it'll be doing different things with them. Yeah. It's interesting. One time, speaking of angels, you said, because Steve asked, Hey, is there anything that we can do for our guardian angels? Like, and you said one of the things you could do is just thank them. And it was interesting because I remember, I remember I was sitting right here on the floor, it's like my, my, my space, you know, like it's my office, but I do a lot of prayer in here too. I was sitting right there and I just said, thank you. And immediately I just felt this wash of light. I just wet. I just started weeping all of a sudden. What like, what is there? Was he pouring? I don't know, like pouring something on me or he or she or whatever. It could have been. It really could have been just or just gratefulness, thankfulness. I always tell people you should thank your angels or with you your whole life. I make cheers for mine. Okay. Yeah. You're the host with the most you make the enemy toast. They love it. Yeah. Awesome. All right. Let's see. Okay. First people. Okay. Andrew asks about guardian angels. I've heard people say they believe they have a guardian angel, but they don't believe in God. How would you suggest ministering to people who believe this? That's a good question. Well, God is the one who made them or they wouldn't exist. So I would say they would be proof that he exists because they can't make themselves. They don't have the ability to do that. I would think that they would be great proof that God does exist because they are there. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we just got a couple more questions because we're almost out of time. Time flies. Katie asks, are there spiders in heaven? If so, if they are spiders, but they're friendly. Oh, they better be cat. They are. They're better. I'm not the biggest spider fan. They are different. Okay. There we go. Diana asks, what do you do when you're trying to live a Christian life, but your spouse chooses to watch evil things? Oh, there's several things you can do. Number one, take a release anointing into the channel thing, whatever you change the channel with. I forget what they use all the time, release anointing around the TV, evict the demons that have probably showed up because they opened portals for them. There's all kinds of things you can pray. You take authority. You live there too. That's your property. That's your territory too. You don't have to put up with them being there. So I'd say, take authority over anything that's invaded your home, evicted out of there in Jesus' name, send the host to beat them up and to keep them out because your spouse may be wanting the one thing, but you still have the right to have the peace and the love of God in your home. And usually the anointing will cause them to lose interest and you need to pray that they'll lose interest in what they're watching. All right. So Sam asks, how do we worship and walk in the spirit? What if you're not filled with the spirit? Walking in the spirit is doing the things God weighs, His way. That's why He wants us to walk in the spirit, not the flesh. So the choice, walk in the spirit, you're going to do what God wants and listen to what He says and choose what God would choose. Walking in the flesh is what your own flesh wants, your own mind wants, and then you come into conflict with God. So that's the difference between the spirit and the flesh. And then Antonis Preacher asks, are we supposed to worship the Holy Spirit? Absolutely, yes. He is God too. Holy Spirit is God. He's a third member of the Trinity. He's not any less than Jesus or the Father. You absolutely should worship Him and thank Him. He's with you. And if you ask Him to come inside, He lives in you, He's with you all the time. Yeah. There we go. Yep. He's part of the Trinity. And then last but not least, illumination, our very own illumination. I can assume it's her because I've never met anybody else named illumination. Sometimes I felt a hand touch the back of my head, my back or my head. Would this be my guardian angel or administering spirit bringing me comfort? It would be your guardian angel. They do it all the time to me. There you go. If you feel it, turn around and say, thank you for caring. Yeah, I need to be more attentive to that for sure. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, because I've felt that too. So okay, Kat, I would, that's it, we're out of time, but I would love for you to pray for people and then, and then we'll just, we're going to close this out. Close 2022 out. Father, I thank you, God, for putting joy in the heart of people and hope because hope is here. It's everywhere. You all should be looking for it. You should be expecting it. You should wake up and say, Father, I expect your things to happen for me. I expect the promises you gave me to come to best. I expect the days to be filled with greatness because that's why I'm here on this earth, to do things with you, for you and because of you. And therefore, that is what I am believing for, not the lives of the enemy. Amen. Amen, Kat. Amen. Amen. Well, obviously you have revealingheaven.com, people can go there. They can find out all the good stuff. They can find you on Facebook, all the good stuff. So Kat, thank you so much. Have a wonderful rest of your year. Thank you very much. Yeah. So everybody, that's our show. We're joining us tomorrow with Dave Hayes, the praying medic, with Steve, Steve will be back in action on Thursday. So tune in then at 11 a.m. Pacific time. We love you guys. Love you guys. Love things. Yes. And we will see you guys tomorrow. God bless. Amen. God bless.

Well, good morning from the great state of Oregon and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. I'm Steve Schultz, founder along with my wife of the Elijah list right here and Elijah streams that you're watching online. So we are a year, still year 25, bringing you the voice of the prophet and when we had April, we will start our 26th year of doing this. So it's amazing time. It's amazing year. We're going to bring Kat Kerron here in just a moment. As always, we're looking forward to what she has to deliver for a word of exhortation or prophetic, whatever God's given her, and then we'll get into some questions. I think that's all I have it with the only other announcement is a quick reminder of the, of the wells we're digging in the garden, so here we go with that. I'm here at one of the water well commissioning and it is so much joy that has been at every one of God's himself. Thank you! Thank you! Yeah! Jesus Christ! Yeah! I think our total count of wells from the beginning is like 83 wells. And did you hear this young woman? She said, this is a miracle. Well, you know, all on our part, we raised money from you and we got it done for them. But to them, it's a miracle they prayed and prayed and prayed because even of 83 wells we provided over there. There's a lot of land over there and miles and miles between villages where people have to walk and find water some way, dirty water usually. So thank you so much for helping make this possible. That celebration was all about the new water well that you helped us dig. So I'm amazed, amazed. So all right, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Good morning, Ms. Kat, who's having your coffee or tea? It's not coffee, it's Pepsi today. Well, it's Pepsi. All right, without a wake you up right there. So you're at it. You're not at your normal place. No, I'm not. What can you tell us about that? Yeah, well, we have completely moved out of our place. Finally, it took months, people. I always tell people, I'm going to give you a big tip. Don't wait until you decide to move and get another place. Don't wait 10 years, 15 years. You won't like the result of that. We've been there almost 18 years. And let me tell you, we have accumulated stuff and not just stuff for us. All of our business stuff, all of the things that we offer. I mean, there is so much stuff in this place. The 2700 square feet sounds like a lot to you. It isn't when you've got, you know, mixed families living, all of your staff coming there every day. I mean, it's just been, and we're so busy. We're not even thinking about this. And all of a sudden, while we're moving, that means everything. The staff is on night shift, day shift, all night shift. And we actually hired a company to help us get out of there. But the boy had, we accumulated stuff. So we gave a whole bunch of stuff away. And, but we got it done. That was something required by God that when we're out of the place completely, then we're going to get our new place. All right. He didn't wait till that happened. About a week ago, we received notice finally that all of the renovation and stuff to spend been done to this beautiful place that we chose. And God said, yes, you will have that place when you're packed and ready. This is God. Now this is how specific he is when you're packed and ready. Like you're going out the door to your new place. That's when you will have your new place. Well, he left no out to say, well, we'll take part of the stuff out. We'll have half of it ready. If he ever says something to you specific like that, please make sure you do it his way. Yeah. Your way. So he told you, are you saying he told you in advance that when you got everything out, that's when you would have it? And my, and they know it because everything, every time I got a word from God, my family got that word. Jen, they all knew what God was saying because I didn't want any arguments. You know, sometimes if you're, if you're a revelator, you're a prophet, you'll hear things others won't. My family had the joy of hearing everything God said to me. Wow. So it, because we had to have agreement, that's the second thing. Make sure you have agreement with whatever you're going to do or whoever you're going to do it with. That's even going into business, going into ministry, even getting a new home. And so that was required also. That's been my whole life to, to be in agreement with whoever I was working with. And so God really proved himself true in all of this because we didn't hear anything. Now we wanted this house and we were going to buy the house. But I told God, if I buy this house, I don't want to go in and then renovate for a year. I had worked so hard and we actually have saved for almost 20 years to get in this area that he wanted to send. He's about to infiltrate. This is what he said. You're going to hear some, some, some not secrets with the things God's been saying to me. Yeah. Years. He has said to me, I'm going to infiltrate the circles of the wealthy and the rich. Wow. And this is the other thing he said, the king will move in to the queen's harbor and take over in the spirit. So now you're hearing things I heard and my family knew. And I'm telling you, it doesn't matter if it's been 15 years, people you think waiting a couple of years and I know what we've been through has been hard. It really has been hard. But let me tell you what, you're making a way. What's happening now is making way for the generations coming. Some of the greatest ever on the earth, some of the most powerful operating spirit realm in the prophetic, speaking to the land, the sea and the air. That's what you're going to be seeing. Not whatever they're saying is the new norm. That may be their new norm, but it isn't ours as the body of Christ. And so all these things he's been saying to me, which I have been following to the letter, whatever he said to me in his last 10, 15 years, especially, I have followed to the letter. He's driven my crate, my family crazy. So I'd wake up and say, okay, God says something, come out here and hear it. I was going to make sure they knew. And they know, they know cat. They know if cat hears it, she's going to obey, right? There's no arguing or what? One crazy thing, you know, sometimes he'll say something that makes no sense to you. If you're in training, he'll say things to you just to see if you'll do it. He told me what 10 years ago, Jen, maybe eight years ago, do not walk on the grass in your front yard. Now I'm telling you things. This is all true. And you go, that makes no sense. Of course, God doesn't. And he doesn't have to. He's God. He made everything that ever was made. He knows everything that ever will be has been or is right now. He's not clueless at all. And I can tell you right now, if he says it, then the best thing you can do is do it. So if you don't start trusting now, if you can't trust him within these couple of years we've gone through, how can he trust you with millions of dollars, lands, properties, buildings, businesses? This is what's coming to the body. You don't know what he means when he says, well, the wealth of the wicked, look how much they've got. Look what they've done with it. We're about to get it, the just and the righteous. And I can tell you, I know what he means when he says that. I know him well. I don't know him completely, but I do know him. And when he says that he means it, and what he has said since November the 4th, 2020, is exactly what he's going to do. So if you want to go look that up and listen, you'll find out what's about to happen. Because he has never changed his mind. And almost 20 years ago he said, you will live in this place one day. There's no way on this earth I could have done it. There's just no way that could have ever happened. Most everything I ever got, I gave away because I have a great love for people. My dad would give our food away, our cars away. I mean, he would come in and say, well, we don't have this anymore. We'd sit down and pray and God would send it. I was raised that way my whole life. My brothers were saved from dying, being shot point blank and didn't die. I mean, we saw so many miracles that they can happen in our family. I was born with a gift of faith. You were. I've never heard you say it like that, that I remember. So you really, you were born with it, huh? So was my dad. And so was his mother. We were born. He put it in us before we came. He sent us on purpose because of what we would have to trust him for and believe him for as example to others. So what you're about to see is the fruition of me not stepping back, not believing what hell has said, not believing what man has said, not believing what is they require of you. It doesn't matter if you're not known by man, you're known and raised by the hand of God. They're going to eventually know who you are, not because of me, because of him. But yes, he did say that. And I refuse to walk on the grass in our front yard. I wouldn't do it. And if they didn't park the cars right, I'd have to go in one side of the car. Oh man, really? You were that obedient. You were that obedient. Oh, she knows. I was obedient. And I remember the day that the father said to me, I will no longer judge you by obedience because you have learned the joy of obedience. But I will judge you by your love. And your love is extravagant. Spect extravagance for the rest of your life. So you never know when something small starts out, but you decide to go past your own wants, your own needs, your own desires. Everybody's trying to tell you how to do it or why you shouldn't do it is what you hear the most. My family gave up doing that a long time ago. And so he means it when he says it. And he has a purpose. I choose to believe his reason, the one who held the earth in his hand. Why would I not believe him over everybody else? So, Karen, you don't require... And speak like this and have no fear. And I tell you, I have faced mountains. I have. I'm going to talk to them later, not today. But I can tell you, he is faithful for everything. So having told us that for almost a year, no matter what's going on, this is what's going to happen. A week ago, before we were actually done, we received an email saying these people were ready to deal with me. Do you sometimes ask the Lord when he gives you a crazy thing? Do you ask him why? Or do you ask him how long? You don't. That is not my business. My business is to obey. My business for him, because I am his best. No, I just do it. You just do it. The more you trust and you see his hand move, the more you believe, the more he gives you to do. So, no, this is about to happen. We all know comes from our obedience and our trust and our belief in God. Because we found this home and we wanted it. And we were about to purchase it, but because I said, I don't want to do a lot of repairs and fix ups in this house. It was a beautiful home. And then all he said was, okay, the next thing I knew an investor bought that home. Now, a lot of people said, oh, you lost it. Oh, and you don't know God, do you? You know nothing about him if that's what you think has happened. No. Well, that family never moved in because they didn't buy it for that. This investor has spent all this time fixing it exactly the way I winded up while not even knowing what I wanted. And a week ago we received an email. We cried with happiness that they are ready to sell it to you. So good. So good. You know, the whole thing about. We still have to make sure this is what the words he spoke to me. When you're packed and ready, like you're going out the door to your new home, that is when you will have your new home. So packed means packed. Does it mean semi packed, partially packed? You know, maybe, maybe go back and get something else until it was all out. We couldn't do anything. So that's how important it is to hear what God is really saying to you. And he doesn't have to make sense to me. Most of the time I don't make sense. That's because you become more like them, which is what we need to be. So good. Well, Kat, you know, I have other questions I want to make sure you. I encourage people to never give up that God does have a plan for them also, not just for us. We know that acceleration is here in so many ways for us, for many other people right now. And I'm just going to say, just keep thanking God that you're listening and thank him for helping you to listen and then to obey him. That's good. That's good. Wow, very faith building cat, both in the obedience thing, because that's instructive. I'm listening to that because I'm in an obedience season of my life like never before. I'm not like Kat Kerr obedience, but I'm way more than any time in my life. My wife keeps saying, you're so obedient. And it's nice to hear, but I know that I'm probably just getting started obeying because God will then raise the bar and he'll amplify it. Right. And I can do something else. There's a lot of that going on in my house right now. So I hear you and then the faith thing. It would be nice to have been born with the gift of faith like that, but that didn't mean it was easy. You still, he still didn't, would you say then God, even though you had the gift of faith, he still had to stretch that gift of faith or stretch that. It was stretched automatically just because I was willing to do it. It was stretched automatically. Okay. Cool. All right. Well, you ready for your first question today? Okay. So some of these, these first three are my own. I may have asked some form of this a long time ago. So here, but it's been really long time. So those who leave and go to heaven when they've died, they now graduate to heaven. Are they ever invited to like the council room in heaven to counsel with God about things yet on the earth? Is any of that happened after you graduate to heaven? Actually, yes, it does. Father has a board room and he calls it his board room. And it's because that's where he invites people in heaven to come in here, what he has to say and what he's going to do. And then sometimes he asks their opinions. Not that he moves down, but he just wants them to be involved. So yes, that does happen. So if somebody gave an opinion in heaven about such and such, as long as it wasn't against his will, he probably would he say, oh, okay, I'll do that. Would it be like that? I would say that was interesting. We'll think about it. Okay. Like that. Yeah. What about cat after all things are said and done? Well, no, let me change my question. What about you're there? No, I'm going to say it this way because I don't know how to put this in time because God's outside of time. But are there are there things that God will say, what do you think we ought to do here in heaven with such and such? Is there any of that planning and inventing together the future? Absolutely. Yes, Steve. Why do you think we're his sons and daughters? That's his desire for us to want to do that. He absolutely does that. So you're not just left. Well, you arrive, not even sit and watch everything happen. Enjoy it. It's not really like that. There's so many things you get to be involved in. God loves to reason together. And that's what he calls it. Let's reason together. And that's what he calls it. You know, he even through time itself, even in the Bible, he would ask sometimes the other prophets or people like Abraham or someone else, what do you think about this? I mean, he would actually ask them that for a reason. He was serious about it. So yes, we actually do get to learn to invent. That's why there's creation lab. Doesn't mean you're going to be a creator and make people, people automatically think when I say that we're going to have our own colony of people and live somewhere. You wouldn't want them. You would not want them. Think of your family. I mean, you've been with your family. How would you like to have several million you are responsible for? That wasn't fun for Moses, was it? That's good. That's really good. You'll create things and places. Absolutely. Yes. None of them will ever have defilement because it won't even exist anymore. There'll be no more evil anywhere at one point when the lake of fire thing happens and Satan is known in there. And I always like to add this just because I like doing so this Holy spirit. There'll be a point in Satan's life where he has no power, no authority, no position, and he will be the biggest target of everybody who ends up in the lake of fire with him. Wow. And he will have no power. You know, if you have, you said there will have the power to create things, but not people. So if someone's in heaven and they go, I know I could ask God for this, but I'm going to create a little cabin by the rushing whitewater river here where I can go fishing or just hang out. Are they going to be able to speak into that and create it? Or do they have to build it? Or what? What do you mean when you say that? Let me get there. He won't tell me everything. I just know, yes, you have a say and yes, you do get to invent. I do know that for sure. You know, you just went into my third question, so I'm going to jump to that. And I said, no, actually it was my next question, ironically, which was if, well, is God or does God withhold from you, Kat, things that he's not ready to share with you about heaven? In other words, there's things that you know that he might want to share, but he doesn't want to share them with you yet in heaven. I don't think so. I think whatever he gives me through revelation is something he intended for me to have. And there's something that's not for me right now. He just doesn't even mention it. So you don't feel like, how do I say this? He's keeping secrets. I don't mean in a bad way, but like you'd say, my dad has some neat secrets. I can't wait to learn one day. Something like that. I see him doing things sometimes. And if he doesn't share it with me, I say nothing. I mean, he'll show me things sometimes. Like I've seen his, what he calls his, his backyard. Really? Tell us. I think I mentioned that he took me to a new place. I think this was a couple of months ago. I may have briefly mentioned it, but he loves the mountains, by the way. He loves mountains. If you will go back and reread the New Testament, there might be a good idea for people. He used to go to the mountains to meet with his father and it says that in the Bible. When he was growing up on earth, Jesus, he would go at different times and meet him in the mountains. That's where he went to see. In the mountains, in heaven or on earth? On earth. Okay. Well, he lived on earth. He did. Yeah. And I think I shared that one time about how when he was becoming a carpenter under Joseph, he was making, he learned how to make cups, beautiful cups out of wood. And he actually took one to his father at one time when he went to go meet with him. He said, look what I've made here. I've made this for you. It was not the most beautiful thing ever, but it was really nicely made, perfectly made. And he gave it to him as a gift. And he not had no idea himself at that time that years later he would have that given back to him in the garden. And it was filled with everything he had to carry to the cross. And it was something he made with his own hands. So see, sometimes every now and then, if we do things with God, we don't know what they will mean eventually. Christ himself and those two angels, I'm going away everywhere right now, but you're asking me. Yeah. The question is right now. Cool. That when he went and he, when he took that to the mountain and gave it to him, of course, the father was very blessed, he brought it to him. But even he knew what would, he did know at that time what it would be used for. He knew that it would be sent back to his son. And it was sent with two very special angels. Not, I don't know that they were hosts, they could have been hosts. They looked like humans though. And they were the ones who were in the garden that rode the stone away. They were the ones that were with him in the garden when he had to drink that cup. They were with him at the cross and their reward for having done this because that was so hard for them. To put it here and see him, you know, when it was so hard for him that he, you know, he sweated great drops of blood, that was real blood people. That wasn't just something else. Knowing what he would have to carry in his holy body to that cross, which gave him permission to forgive sins. No one else has permission. They don't even think about it. Why, why only him? Because he's the one who bore all that stuff to the cross people, no one else did. So he has the right to forgive you of that because he abolished it through his sacrifice. So he had to be with it. Those angels had to be with him and comfort him the whole time he was going through that. They were also the ones who waited with his body. They were in the tomb waiting for him to come up from hell on the third day. And they were the first ones who got to greet him and see him when he came up in his glorified body after defeating hell and wasting hell. And stripping Satan of his keys and all kinds of other things that he took away from him and when he went to hell on the third day. And so we don't think of eternity and the scope of eternity or even just on this earth, our journey on this earth of what things may be a part of our life again or be used for certain things. But Christ did get that cup given back to him. But he did meet, it goes back to the mountains, the father said, so he met the mountains. That's where he would go to see him and speak to him and be encouraged by him. And so the father's favorite place in heaven, one of them is his own backyard, which you can see for miles that you could measure it. And his mountains, the biggest mountains in heaven are called the Titans. Really? Just tell you that is his backyard. And it's the most beautiful place. There's different creatures there. I've seen some of his own creatures that he has, like his unicorn. I'm just going to tell you the truth, whether you're wondering or not, was there and it was a beautiful place to visit. And he said, this is my backyard. And I was so blessed that he would even take me to show me that. Totally. It was very exciting to go there and see that place. And he does go there to pray. Even he prays, of course he does. He'll pray there. People only picture him sometimes on his throne in the throne room. He has other places he does go and as it is in heaven, I'm talking about the father right now. There are other places he goes and sometimes he'll just show up and visit people in the mansion or bring them to himself to see him. If you knew how much he loved you and what they themselves had decided to do in the scope of eternity, that we will all be together forever and never again be touched by evil, by wickedness, by pain, by suffering, by impairment. None of that exists right now. No, I've got to ask you this because you just said that. We obviously pray to the father in Jesus' name or we pray to Jesus. Why would the father, who is the one we pray to, what would he need to pray? It's like a declaration. It's like a declaration. Decorations is a very high form of prayer. Like you declare and decree a thing, it shall be established unto you. That, those decorations, is a form of prayer. And that's how he does. He'll make a declaration about something. But it's still him making, is reaching up to do something for you. And so when he does that, that is his form of prayer that he'll declare a decree a thing and nobody can stop it from happening. Awesome. Now you, Kat, obviously you are one of the most preeminent visitors of heaven I've ever known or heard of. There's probably hundreds or even thousands that get to do this. We just don't know who they are. But since we on earth are also mere mortals, like Jesus was kind of on the earth, although that's probably a weird truth about that, because he was both a man and he was God. But as both man and God, wouldn't he have had the opportunity that Kat has to be taken to heaven from time to time to visit his home with the father? I'm sure that he probably could have. I personally know that he did visit him in the mountains. I knew that. And if I'm told something or shown something, I can share that. But being a revelator, I can't necessarily give most everything I say is not my own opinions. I gave these a long time ago. And why would I give head knowledge when I have revelation? Revelation comes from the heart of the father or from his son or from Holy Spirit. They're all God. And I have met each one of them and they have things that are different about them. They have things they like, colors they like, places they like. They're not robots, people. These are real, real powerful beings who time comes from them, comes from Father Kerry's time. He didn't appear. I used to say maybe he appeared in time. And I found out how wrong that was. That's so ridiculous to think that time comes from him. He has his own timeline and what he does, he does according to his timeline. So I know what's been happening isn't on yours. But what he has actually been doing, and I have to keep going back to that because I'm so full of that. He's talked to me so much about these days on the earth right now. And what we're stepping into right now is absolutely necessary. If you're going to do something so big that it will remove the lie that says there is no God and that will be removed and all these things happening. No one will not believe that there's a God. You're going to have to believe that God, you pick him or you choose darkness. There's not going to be a third choice on this earth anymore. There will be a third darkness. And that's one of the things that will happen through all the things we've been going through. People will know, they don't know now that there's evil out there. They surely have learned that. God does have a reason to expose all evil. And probably maybe eight, 10 years ago, he actually had me start saying about exposed evil like I never had before. And it will not be able to escape justice. I did not know these were the things that would be happening. I didn't know it would be this way. But I trusted him anyway. And you have to trust him. What else choice do you have? Would you rather be in the hand of the Most High God or under the heel of Satan? Because guess what? He is our doormat. And I am going to have doormats made that says Satan is our doormat. I'm making him honey. You can believe that. And there's no telling what it's going to say when you step on it either. Yeah, that would be good. Okay. My last question before I get into these others is this is an actual, I never shared this publicly, but like 35 years ago, I had a dream that was so real that it was as if I was there. It was, we were having in the dream, a church picnic at our property, which we had at that time, 35 years. And Jesus came to sit down with me and he was sad. Everyone was playing volleyball. It was a great church picnic. And he was not upset at the volleyball. He wasn't upset that there was a picnic, but he was hurt amidst that all that good clean fund that he had been forgotten. So two questions. Is it possible that I, it was so real that I, he was literally visiting me in that dream. I guess that's the main question. Was, is it possible that that was real? Or was it just a vivid instructive dream? It could have been either one. If you remember something years later in this very vivid, and you, and you have the same emotions every time you think about it, then he probably was there. Wow. Because, you know, I've had lots of encounters of this and that, but that was the closest I've ever had with the Lord himself. And he was sharing his heart. What do you think about that idea? I mean, obviously, you know, the Lord is much or more than anyone that I know of him being sad amidst a really wonderful picnic and I felt no judgment against the picnic. I knew there was no judgment. How would you kind of put that into words? I've always tried to, in some way, which my staff know I do all the time. I'll always, in some kind of conversation, no matter where I'm, I will always include Jesus. In some way, I will talk something about, I'm gonna say something about him like, isn't this a wonderful day he let us have? Is the day not beautiful? Does the Lord not give us a beautiful day to do this? And that way, I'm acknowledging him to be a part of it. It's not necessarily that I didn't invite him to eat with us or do something like that. I remember quite a while ago when we were on Forgot Home, which home when we moved like 31 times, that was required. I remember one time we had moved and I was very happy about it and very grateful and I bought a little thing that said, I'm so grateful and put it on the wall. And the Lord came in the room and he said, this is even for the heaven thing started. He said, you know, I'm so honored that you remembered me. I'm so honored. He said, I wish that the body was a little bit more grateful. That's good. I wish they would show a little bit more gratefulness. You know, for the things I do, the simple things, even the simple things I do, not necessarily involve him that you have to say, you know, you don't have to invite him to come, like I said, you don't have to ask him to come sit and eat with you, although I have done that many times. He doesn't necessarily come when I ask him to. He usually comes when I don't even know he's coming. But just to show more gratefulness, grateful for the things you have, grateful for the small thing he did for you, didn't expect. And I had that way back then used to talk about, let's start being more grateful to the Lord for the things he's allowed us to do or get to go or have in our own life or things to give away. I think it was more like that, Steve. It's probably something that simple. Like this day is beautiful. Isn't this a beautiful day to Lord? Maybe we get to have all this fun together. We're having this great time together. Just something that simple, I think, just a little bit of recognition that he was a part of that. You know, the whole thing with gratitude, you know, the 10 leverage were cleansed, but only one came back and made it come. We knew he had the Father's heart in him and they were in each other. That's right. We said, didn't I cleanse 10? Where's the other nine? My question is, obviously, we know that that's what he desires. Have you seen, do you feel like practicing gratefulness like that all the time? Does that invite him to have more activity in your life? I think it absolutely invites him to come. I think he'd be wanting to come. I know he watches for things. He watches to see if he is invited. He's watched to see if he's included or, you know, do you ever, whether you ask him and I tell people you can ask him for more than your needs. And that's automatic. And that's okay because he says it's okay. What about asking for something more than that? What about going beyond that? Like ask, you know, you maybe ask him to make sure that you get double blessed so that you can give that same blessing to someone else. That would really touch the heart of God, that you're including even others and esteem others more highly than yourself. I think that's something we also should be practicing at some time, maybe not 24 hours a day. But I do know that they do watch. The father has a book he writes things in so that he can remember the things that you have done even without being asked by him. So people think of them more as like they're high and mighty way beyond me. You know, I can't have their thoughts. That's wrong. I can't understand the things they do. That's wrong. They would never give me something like that. That's really wrong. I think we limit them by the way we live our life in our own man, our man's head knowledge. We limit the things just because sometimes like we say, I'll never do that. Well, you just said it. How are you going to do it if you're telling God already? I'll never do that. That's your expectation. Yeah. You lower or even limit God sometimes for the things he can do for you because you think that you're too beyond well, I mean, people will say this and they think they're being humble. I've done it a hundred times, thousands of times myself where God's got more I'd say things like God's got at least in my heart, I'd say God has more important things to do on the earth. There's people being raped. There's people, children being abused. He doesn't have time for my you know, my child's question about a red bike that he wants or my grandchild this or that because he's working on world problems. Talk about that for a minute. I think he wants us to work on those world problems, Steve. I think if we were doing more ruling ourselves and taking the authority he gave us which I do all the time. I mean, at any given time I will send 10,000 of the host to areas where they are doing human trafficking where they're abusing those children and I will ask the host to hunt them down, the physical people. Yeah. Expose them and rescue those children. So see, I don't leave that item in my life. I don't leave it out. That's a given I'm going to do that. And sometimes I'll spend all night long sending them back out and out and out again for different things like that. And I think that should be a part of our life. Don't think that you are powerless. Powerless because you think you are. That's not what the Bible says. That's not what the blood of Christ gives you. That's not his authority. That's not what his word. I'll just go down a long list that says he wants to see us rule. We rule by what we say. We rule by how we live. I want to be sure that I get this other aspect of the same question. I get now that we need to be ruling much more than we are. But for those who are trying to develop at the same time a more and more personal relationship do they need to grasp the intricacies of what God cares about in their own life? Even though there's wars all over the earth what God cares about the intricacies? Yes. He did that even in the Bible. He cared about certain people. Even what people call unimportant people. He cared. He loves every one of us. He even loves the bad ones that don't want him or could care less about him. Jesus said he's married to the backslider. That means he's always going to pursue those who have abandoned that first love they had before Christ or abandoned even their relationship to have them back because of his love he had. But he can't just say, well I'm working on this so this is just going to have to wait over here. They are multi-purposed gods. They have the ability to be everywhere all at the same time. So they're not even worrying. They are working on those things. But guess what? They have time to work on things for you too. Yeah, that's really, really good Kat. Alright, so Carla is asking this question. Do you sometimes wish you could just stay in heaven? No. And why? Because he put something inside of me that didn't want me there. The first time he came to meet with me and sat on my love seat which I loved that he chose my love seat and put his arm around me and I thought it was going to melt into the floor. That was the very first time he told me about what I would be doing. I mean he came and visited me before that but when he actually came for years of training me in different areas to increase my faith and send me on these trips that didn't make any sense but I went out on anyway like go catch flights so and so to this airport and be in that airport with this note with you I mean he did that for like three years and I never told me why I was doing it he was just going to do it. And then when he began to explain things he said well we have a plan for your life remove me from my good law job, remove my husband from his job and how do you like that? That's how he started things. Jen's raising her hand too. We had no choice but to trust him for everything and when we started doing that we had better place to live we had more food to eat than we had before although we did well in the natural we did well but he did warn me I'm taking it away he did tell me he said I'm going to take away from your husband too and he was still in time with me and then he said your husband will come down to the altar and give you back to me for ten years because I'll be taking you all over the world and I need his permission that's something that probably people don't know he did and he did it he did it I mean for ten years I would come home and be there day and a half change the cases and leave you somewhere else to talk about heaven and God and I did it people go well you have an easy life you should have lived it because it was not easy to do something but the trusting part was simple but the way I had to live wasn't always simple and of course people hated me people spoke against me I had a whole lot of that just to learn to give up and I didn't have time to deal I had no time and it was better just to forgive him and let it go which I tell everybody you should do so I know it wasn't but the magnificent amazing love that I would experience when I was with them that consumed every fiber of my being inside now that felt so very much in love with the father with the son with the Holy Spirit it wouldn't matter what they asked I would have just done it and that's when my heart got through no matter what anyone's saying to me and I used to learn to tell people in the street corner who had lost up and they'd lost this and they'd lost that and I'd go to them and I'd always bless them and I'd say you know what if I stood on the street corner and I had nothing not a house not clothing, not food, not shelter if I had nothing but I had Jesus Christ I would have everything in my life I ever needed I meant that I really meant that so when I speak sincerely from from my life not just something I've heard or something I've seen but what I've had to live it makes you different it does make you different and there's no way to even fathom it's like where the Bible talks about having itself no eye is seen or heard or entered in the heart or mind of man but God is prepared for those that love him that is one of the most truest scriptures in the Bible no one suffers when they go to heaven no one is sad, no one is hurt, no one is sick no one is even upset they died that's the last thing they're thinking about when you're in his presence which you have from being with him and knowing that your family is in his hand and sometimes he will show people the future of their family after they get to heaven so it's worth it all people it's worth it to love God more than anything to love others more highly than yourself to forgive without question when you forgive without question that means you don't bring it up again you act like it never happens because when you do that it is the devil's worst day you have just pierced him completely that you're not willing to play his game of hate and then the Holy Spirit can pursue those people that you forgave that is the last thing hell wants to see happen and yet it's one of the greatest gifts you can give God is to forgive others so there are so many things going on there right now there's so much preparation for these days of wonder and glory and fire and baptism and fire is going to be amazing you'll get to experience that and also the glory coming to earth because we carry it we create it for him and he lets us carry it and the things that happen will begin to release that it's not just a thing it's a way of life so good Kat man I'm sitting here because I'm going to see if we have time for two more questions here we'll go a couple minutes over because you're on fire today, I mean you've got really all over you and it's really neat to see faith is asking this Kat the Bible describe angels I don't know if this is accurate but she says the Bible has described angels that have eyes all over them do these eyes look like human eyes or do they look completely different I don't know if angels have eyes all over them what do they do? they absolutely do the living creatures have eyes they have eyes not just in their wings they have them in their forehead they have them in their arms I will say they look like human eyes they don't have eyelids they're always looking and seeing and these are very high level intelligent creatures that face the throne of God and if you ever try to picture them there's four of them that have like single heads and then there's two more that have foreheads under the arms of the throne that hold up the throne and they have four different heads the same foreheads that are on the four living creatures and so yes they do have eyes sometimes some of the seraphim do the seraphim are more worship type things they live in a glory cloud over the throne of God and they have blue fire their hair is turned into blue fire because of the holiness of that place when I say over the throne I don't mean it's like two feet above it I mean it's way above it the throne of God is massive and they'll dip down over the throne of God just shout things to God Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty they face the throne all four of them will face like here's the throne in the center of the throne room the throne room is round and there's four sets of steps and right by each of those steps are the living creatures and they stand in face the Father and the Son sitting on the throne the Holy Spirit over to the left and that's where they stand and shout the throne room begins to shake and you will begin to shake and you'll lift up off the floor of the throne room that's not no normal place not like walking to a king's palace trust me it's a very powerful beautiful place and so yes they have eyes they have eyes and it talks about I think an Ezekiel might talk about them I know somewhere you may talk about them in the book of John maybe but yes there are the Seraphim the Cherubim the Cherubim that's what the living creatures are they're from a tribe called the Cherubim and they're not little tiny fat baby angels people that's not what they are you can't even measure their height or scope you can't even measure it they're so big let me ask a silly question because you know you talked about it being round I know you said this before but this is the first time I'm really seeing the round and the four sets of steps but it seems like it doesn't seem like it would be set up so that facing God that I could get on the back side of him it almost seems like he would always be facing forward to me do you have any sense of that I've had people and heard people who ran up the back steps of the throne and they were standing right behind him and what with what he was standing behind God in the throne they did yeah because there's four sets and I've said it over and over again and Gary Brooks who was a good friend of mine was caught up to heaven one time he was in worship and the portal opened and the angel came down and just picked him up and pulled him up into heaven he was on the back steps of the throne there's four sets that probably will be in one of my maybe in my last book that'll be a sketch I put in there but he made his own room around so the people could be all around him most people draw the throne as a speck in the distance and all this masses in front of him he didn't do that you can go up there anytime you want to so it's like step steps a platform so it's built more like this believe it or not which is another image that Satan stole and at the top of that would be the throne and underneath it is the room where they go to go grab the horn to the altar and a lot of people go in there and pray in this place it's actually under the throne that also talks about it in the Bible but the living creatures are there that should declare over them but they also do things they bring scrolls they read scrolls they will reveal things and have into people so they actually have I don't want to call it beauties but they have things that are asked of them by God every now and then they'll travel somewhere actually Jewish an Orthodox Jewish man and met at a meeting and I was talking about one of the living creatures and he came back he was shaking he was shaking and he goes I know you've seen them I know you've seen them and I said oh what I knew what he meant and he says the creature and he said I was on a hill and I didn't want Jesus Christ and I was crying out to God show me yourself show me, show me, show me and he said all of a sudden four figures appeared in the sky and one at a time they came right down in front of him and they were each of the living creatures it's so the terror of God of the holiness of God came on him he got born again wow and because of the way I had described them that's what he saw he knew that's who that was and he said don't ever stop talking no matter what anyone says he did you ever, ever, ever stop sharing you were hearing truth, you were seeing God and he said I'm so grateful that you're willing to share it and then he left I never saw him again but he was Orthodox too that's amazing did you say did you mean he got born again right there or he had already been born again because of what he had seen I think he got born again let me talk about it made him really happy wow I have a question, last question about under the throne because the Bible talks about it I assume this is revelation but it says in there that there were the souls that were under the altar crying how long the Lord till you and I think they even used the word avenge our blood they were the souls of the mark can you describe that because in heaven we think of patience and praise and no sadness that almost sounds like impatience and sadness I don't think it's impatience and sadness and I don't really know what era of time that these they came from so I didn't really know what they had experienced herself but yes and so there is a place that's under the throne of God and I know that's one of the places where those people go to pray and declare for to be avenged and that's what they're saying very very good well Kat as always the spirit's on you but it's a real special anointing on you today would you feel like praying for the people for a few minutes and as it goes I will definitely do that Father I thank you for this beautiful day that you have made that we can enjoy it, that we can share with each other God, your fruits and your revelation your plans for man I'm so grateful for that that you love us, that you sent your son, your wonderful son and I'll probably always be

Well, it's happy Wednesday for you and it happens to be happy Tuesday for me while I am. We are recording this the afternoon before Kat goes on as some her schedules are different. So this is being recorded so the clock behind me it says Tuesday but you're seeing this on Wednesday if you're watching it live. So just wanted to let you know that I like to give people a quick reminder. We're going to get right into Kat here in just a few moments. I like to give people a quick reminder of the wells that we're doing in Uganda. We're going to this year we're going to be telling you a lot about the other projects that are underway. We don't do as much of that because we're doing more of the wells but we're doing lots of things in the US too. Alright, without further delay, let's watch that spot on the wells. Her day starts around 7 a.m. After getting dressed, she washes her face using whatever water she has left over from the night before. The rest of her morning is filled with chores. She sweeps, works in the garden, and weaves mats. Her favorite thing to do in the morning is make a hot cup of tea. One of the highlights of her day is seeing her neighbors and friends that pass by. It can get lonely being by yourself. Jaja Gureti is fortunate to have a water source in her village because of Elijah's streams. Her friends and neighbors help her collect water so she can enjoy her cup of tea and care for herself. But that's not the case for everyone. Everyone has access to a clean water source in their village. Not everyone has someone to help them, but you could be that someone. By donating towards the drilling of clean water wells in Uganda, you are helping thousands of people, you are giving them safe, clean drinking water. That's amazing. I always learned something about watching some of these many times, and today it's standing out to me that we do, you can see that they're sweeping the floor, the dirt floor with some of a rough broom, and they're weaving a very primitive basket. They live in these mud type huts, I don't know what they're called. I haven't really examined the huts that much. And yet you'll see that the women have these colorful dresses. So I'll have to ask Michael, how does that work out that they're able to get their hands on some of these really nice, pretty, I don't know, nice is the right word. They look like good quality for them, and yet they live in this, the squalor of poverty where there's not even any water nearby, you have to walk and walk away. It's a real contrast, studying contrast. So all right, we have Kat Kerr coming on here, looking forward to this. So without further delay, here's Wednesdays with Kat and Steve, here we go. Well good afternoon, I guess it's about evening your time, about 6pm for you. Yeah, it's still early for me. Your day is kind of just getting started, so anyway, so good to see you, Kat. We're excited about, got some questions, and after you share whatever's on your heart, we'll talk about the subject of questions, but let's not do that yet. Let's go ahead to whatever you want to share to the people. All right, I just really want to encourage people that God is still speaking to me about everything, actually. Everything that he has been speaking over the last couple of years, he's still talking about it to me, so for him it's not like I made this decision and then we'll see how it happens, or if it happens, that's not God, that's man. I can assure you that if God has made a decision to do something, he's going to do it. And I've seen himself prove himself over and over and over again to us. We spoke last week about our home, which we're very excited about. I think finally yesterday we finally got everything out of the house that we were living in, and I think we may have mentioned that we're having it fixed up for the owners, they've been good friends of ours, we're tired now, and they want to sell it, so we're going to help them make some more money. And see, that's the way you esteem others more highly than yourself. We're so excited for what God is doing to something for us, we're going to do something for someone else. I think that's a good thing for people to do. God loves it when you help other people, but I will tell you this also, all the justices he talked about and all the other things he said would happen are actually happening right now. Some of it I have not been allowed to mention yet, as soon as I can, I will. There are other people already talking about things that are going on. I just know this, and you know what, one thing I'm very blessed about was the game, the football game, which I never watch football games, where I know the guy almost died, and all of a sudden is it not amazing how quickly everybody went into prayer? Yeah. Isn't that something Steve, everybody was praying everywhere, even on the regular network channels, and they said they didn't care if they minded or not. I'm like, wow, did they see God move for him? That was amazing. That was amazing. That was amazing. I saw a headline yesterday, I haven't seen this story, because I don't watch that much news these days. It's too depressing, but I saw a headline on the net, and it said he'd been checked out of the hospital and sent home. I didn't know that, and I'm thinking, are you kidding? He went from they had him in an induced coma, which they do, if they think they're swelling on the brain, they'll put him in an induced coma, but wow, that was amazing. Everything Republicans, Democrats, they were all praying together. The football teams who didn't care about God for a while, are all of a sudden not beseeching him on the player's behalf. I'm like, you never know what's going to turn people's hearts. I think everything that happened in this last week or so, that was the most miraculous thing that happened, that people actually sought God himself for who he is, and for prayer and for healing, and I just think it's so amazing of God to show that he loves people, he does love them, he does care. I have to think that's probably still the highlight for me was that miracle that happened to that young man, that young player, and how many people prayed all over the world. It wasn't just here in our country. It wasn't even just the teams, and even other teams are still praying. I thought that was really amazing, and even at the Jaguar game, did you all notice that they prayed for him, and he's not even a Jaguar. That's so good. I love that. I just want to make that point, that people who are always against God never know that they're going to have to call on him. Can you imagine the millions and millions of people that saw that? There had to be a couple hundred players and staff that were on that field. I mean, I don't know how to, it looked like it was hard to count. There was a lot. There was a whole lot of people there. Anyway, I think out of all the things I could have mentioned or talked about that God was involved with, it was that game. It was the miracle that happened. So good. So good. I have a question to ask you, Kat, about I have, you know, I know you for 10 years. I know God is always, always talking to you, always taking you on trips. Okay. I get that. I have no problem believing that. And I actually have no problem of accepting that he's telling you something you're not going to be allowed to say. I didn't know some people say, well, how come you can't tell us bits and pieces more? People must ask you that. I've never asked you that. How would you respond to that? I think people trying to say, when I'm allowed to, I will. You will. Okay. Okay. All right. Now, is there anything else you wanted to share? I want to make sure before we get into questions. No, I'm just so grateful for all the people who've been standing with us for us to have a home because as you know, Steve, we've been living in our offices for 10 years. And that's not like having a home, trust me. Our home became our office and then we lived there for quite a while and we didn't really have even much personal furniture in there. We had a lot of stuff after being there for almost 17 years. You know, this took so long to pack, but now of course we're also looking for office space. We're actually going to have an office building that's going to really help promote and accelerate what we're doing for God concerning our heaven, the heaven assignment that God has given me. So we're looking forward to all of that and looking forward to many changes for people, blessings for people, God moving his hand for people. You're going to see a whole lot more of that happening, but I'm still really, really still happy about what happened with the players. Yes. So, so, so good. Really good stuff. So, all right. Let's talk about the questions. We've got three or four ready to go and another three, four behind that, but just before we came on the air, you and I were talking and the staff were talking and we've been getting a lot of questions where people say, what about this scripture? How do you explain this? And they give you another scripture. You have never represented yourself as a Bible answer man. You're a revelator, right? So, so people are not supposed to be asking us or filling us up with questions about what to explain the scripture and we kind of got in more into the weeds by doing more of those and then we're forcing you to say, I don't know about that. Yeah. Yeah. So, tell people, maybe off the top of your head, we were just talking about so you don't have notes or anything. What type of questions they should be asking that you can answer and that you like to answer? What type of questions? Probably things you always wanted to know about God, about Holy Spirit, about Jesus Christ, things you always wanted to know about heaven or the future, like just the future in general. Those are really great questions to ask, places that actually exist in heaven, things you get to do in heaven, what do they look like, what does the food taste like, you know, what is your mansion like? Has everybody got the same mansion? I mean, there's so many questions you could actually go to and ask about that subject, which is the number one subject God has asked me to reveal is reveal heaven to earth. Yeah. It's like, you've seen the location, geography, if you would put it, it's a spiritual place, so geography probably doesn't apply, but you've seen the landscape, the layout, the places, and is it, does it, does it seem to you that there would be almost infinite number of questions people could ask you about what you've seen if they, if they only knew what you knew? Yeah, they probably are. Okay. They probably are. It would probably be, I would say, unlimited, almost. Okay. All right. Okay. Now, we talked about a question just before we came on that I said, give me an example of one that you could answer that people don't ask, or you, they, and so you, you just came up with this and you said, so if someone said, what happens when you die to the anointing that's in you? Because everyone has it. So what happens to that? So that's my question. I'm going to throw, I'm going to throw that question back to you. All right. Yeah. So, you know, I will actually mention the scripture to start it. Okay. Cool. First down, you're 27. All right. When you receive Jesus Christ as your savior, that would be everybody who could say, you get a deposit of the anointing and it actually lives in you. I am not talking about being anointed to sing or create things. This is an anointing that goes to every single believer and Jesus Christ actually gives you a deposit of the anointing. What does the anointing do? It destroys the yoke of darkness, no matter what you pray it over. Actually, the disciples used it all the time. Even Peter and Paul did. When they said that Peter shadow heal people, that was not his shadow. That was a cloud of the anointing. The more you release the anointing that abides in you, the greater it becomes. It grows and grows and grows, it becomes like a cloud in the spirit. And then when you walk past people, things begin to happen. And that's what happened to Peter and Paul. People got saved, they got delivered, demons ran out. And this is all actually scriptural stuff. It's just that when you, of course, in heaven, everybody knows about that now. But that's one of the most powerful things is actually a weapon given to you when you were born again. And no matter what you're praying for, you should release the anointing into those things. We used to release it into the seats of chairs, we'd go somewhere and see what would happen. Some people would jump up, some people wouldn't know what to say. Some people would just start saying, glory to God. We have a lot of testimonies that were recorded where people got healed, their family relations were brought back together because they applied the anointing that they carry. And guess what? When you die, the anointing is for your body, it stays with the bones. It does not go to heaven with you. You don't need that anointing in heaven, you need it on the earth. And so like, for instance, when Elisha went up into the hills and died, and then years and years later, I mean, his body turned to bones, right? And soon somebody over the precipice of a dead person, they touched Elisha's bones, their dead body, this is scriptural. And they came back to life because of the anointing that was in the body of Elisha. So there is power, God gives you power in that. The more you release it, we release it into our car, and where we drive, the anointing makes like streaks on the road, and the spirit, when people drive over it, things will go and begin to invade them from God. We release it in the buildings when we go by. It's a really awesome way to pray for your family. Release it in the clothing you give them, gifts you give them, phone calls you make to them. They can't see it, but it will begin to invade their life and bring God into their life. So if I release, I'm going to give it to maybe an unsafe friend, and I'm going to give them a shirt. My wife and I give someone a shirt. We release the anointing, maybe both of us do it, and that's going to be good. Now here's, I think I know we're going to say this, but I'm going to just say it. So we give it to him, he wears it once, and then he washes it off, the anointing is gone, right? No. The anointing will never leave what you apply it to. It never dissipates, it never stops, it never goes away. That's why it's still in your bones when you die. Even death didn't take it away. So he washes it multiple times and finding one day he gives it to Goodwill and someone buys it at the Goodwill. It's still on there? That would be surprising if he gave it to the Goodwill. Well he may not realize it's on there. You know, I was... If it was going to begin to happen and he would feel good, he would probably hear God. Oh wow. All kinds of things begin to happen because it ties you to God. That's what it does. The anointing, that's what the anointing does. And it's not, Kat, am I hearing you say, let's say we give a shirt, but we have the anointing, but we don't say the prayer, we don't release it, we just give him the shirt. He doesn't have the anointing if we just give him the shirt, just because we have it doesn't mean he has it. Unless you wore it a lot yourself. Oh, okay. Unless it was going to look like that. Oh, the anointing will actually seep into things that you wear that are yours. My dad, his favorite thing that I got from him when he passed to heaven was his old beat up sweater. He wore it more than anything else, there's so much anointing in that sweater. Now in his ashes, I still can touch the urn and feel his anointing. Really? Now in Israel we were there, I got to go into King David's tomb and I could feel the anointing that King David carried coming from his body. That's crazy. Now you said we get a deposit, does the anointing in us grow over time? Can we have more anointing? If you use it, yes. Only if you use it will it multiply. That's right. Well, that's good now. People didn't know the world sitting on their anointing, doing nothing with it, not even knowing how powerful it is to help people. Doreen, by the way, my wife, Doreen, you've met Doreen, you've been here in our house. She got ahold of this a number of months ago and I didn't get it as fast, I guess. Over my head, she's been releasing things everywhere. She goes all over this, all over that, sending people and I'm going really, so that's a real thing and I had forgotten that it didn't, I mean, I knew it was real, but I didn't remember that it didn't wash off or anything. I think in my pea brain I would have thought, well, I don't know how you wash up something that's spiritual, but so if you use it, all right, what else did I want to ask, I think, so it's not like you can't say, Lord, increase my anointing because you're saying it's an automated thing. If you use it, you'll get, it will grow. It's up to you, it's up to you to increase it by using it. That's good. You know, there's not a lot of teaching and you're the only one as a revelator that I've ever learned that from. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that and that anointing does remain. Okay, cool. Well, you know, Peter and Paul, that's why they released it into fabrics and they would relate on people and people get healed. Sometimes they get raised from the dead, sometimes the demons would run out because they put it in a piece of cloth and put it on the person and so people are quite sure about them and line up for those pieces of cloth. Well, right. And I, you know, again, my pea brain, I'm just, I try to be like everybody else. I'm going, well, so they did that and they released their faith in the cloth, the person, you know, exercised their faith with the cloth and then they got healed and it became, it was a faith thing to me almost one thing is not fake. No, I don't mean fake, a faith, F-A-I-T-H. Oh, faith. Yeah. F-A-I-T-H, yes. Yeah. Yeah. So, but you're saying it's not just faith because it's, it operates outside of faith, right? Yes. Because the people who are, it's given to or whatever someone's praying or releasing into them, they may not even have a clue unless they're told later. But the healing is based on the anointing and the strength of the anointing is based on you, how often you use it, you release it, it grows just like it did for Peter and Paul. Can you contrast or, or, or give me a differentiation between the anointing that you just described and someone will say, well, Ruth Heflin was, was famous for praising until the glory came. Yeah. I believe a few times I've experienced the glory, I know I've seen it a couple of times. What's the difference when the glory comes on you versus the anointing that's in you? Can you kind of, I know it's very different. So what's the difference? Well, sometimes the glory is, the glory is tied to probably something else you're doing or that you're involved with or how long you've been involved with that too, but the anointing, the anointing that breaks the yoke always can be used and can be used by any believer, no matter whether you've just started doing it or you, you learn about using it, that's always available to you. These other, like the glory, the, the glory falling and everything. Sometimes God does that, but sometimes people are actually do carry the glory. We will eventually carry the glory. Actually, that's the whole purpose for it. How do I know Christ in you is the hope of glory. You begin to understand how he operates, how he wants you to operate. You create glory for God. And then I would always just give it back to him and to the time, give him back the glory. Yeah. I want any glory made for what I do for him until he finally said, do you not realize you're supposed to carry it? Carry it. I know you're supposed to carry the glory of God. Yeah. Knowledge, the understanding and knowing of the glory will cover the years like the waters cover the sea. How is that going to happen if you all don't take it there? Well, and as this, I've heard this many times by people that teach on the glory, they'll say, if you, if you wait for the glory to come, the healing is easy in the glory is that would be your kind of also true. In other words, there's a healing in the anointing and there's healing in the glory. I guess the best thing is all of the above, right? Yes. Even the baptism and fire, these are things that will begin to consume the earth. There's a measure of them now, but it's about to be something in this accelerated time on the earth. You're going to see a lot more about the, about the glory and about the baptism and fire. Okay. I want to come to another question that this has been on me for a week or two or more. I didn't hear anyone teach on it. I just began to read Ephesians and I've been, I keep going back to it where right in the first chapter, maybe the second one, I think it's the first where, and I'm looking at the passion translation in this particular case, but the truth is the same. It says that the, that the same love that the father has for Jesus, for the son, the exact same love he has for us. And I'm going, wow, that is that really true? I know it's true. I would have said it's true, but to hear it detail. Here's my question. How do we, this is ethereal, so how do we tap in to the love that the father has for the son? How do we grab hold of that so that, because I feel like once I get that in my deepest part of the soul and spirit, then I would understand how much he loves me with that scripture. How would you tell someone to get ahold of how much the father loves the son? I think it's pretty obvious reading the word of God and the things that he did for his son, how much he loved him, but how much he loved us also that he was willing to give him. I think it's one of the best ways to understand that is to see that he was, of course, I would have to say is number one, his son was, and yet he was willing to sacrifice him for all of us because of the love he has for us. I think it's one of the greatest examples of tapping into that love that God has for us. But you'll never be the same when you ever do that, when you actually get to do that. You won't. You'll always seek out more and more his love to know him more, to please him more. Even his son said how much it was his, you know, how much he loved to please the father, and he could only say what the father said or do what the father did. He totally was tied into the father and the way that he mentored him in his whole life, Christ. I would have to say for me, that probably the number one way to find out about it is to study what he gave up with his son for us to know him. That's good. Really, really good. All right. Where do I want to go? Let's talk about, we talk about this off the air too. Do people, you know, my accent, my name means crowned one, Stephen means crowned one, and I've always liked that once I heard it because we were supposed to, you know, we hear about casting our crowns or we'll receive, when I was a little boy, they'd say you'd get a crown in heaven, but the question is, do we have more crowns and why would we do things with them? Are we casting them all in Jesus all the time? Talk about crowns. There will be a time in heaven when we do. We get, everyone has, of course, a soler's crown. If you win people to the Lord, that's one of the number one points you have, but I have been in people's mansions and seen like eight different crowns. You actually have a crown room to keep them in. And then you can take them and wear them around heaven this fine, but there will be a mass thing that we all do together, that we do. Everyone has a crown. You get a crown when you go to heaven, and we will sell that at his feet just to honor what he did for us, you know, and the price he paid for us. So that is actually something that will happen in heaven, but you have actually many crowns that you can earn in heaven, and it's amazing to see God's willingness to bless all of us in heaven. You earn it on the earth, and then you receive it in heaven. Is that what you're saying? Yes. You have a soler's crown like, okay, so our people donate to us and so that we can support the prophets and also to dig these wells, and you're going to, for instance, and without me even realizing it, people started getting saved. So several thousand have gotten saved because of these wells we dug, and I didn't even realize it was going that way. Is a soler's crown for the people that gave in to that ministry, does that still apply? Yes, absolutely, because they caused souls to be saved. That's huge. That's huge. All they did was donate. I can hear a person say, well, I just was supporting your ministry. I mean, I get a soler's crown. I've never let someone do the Lord, and I get a soler's crown. That's right. I like that. A lot of people probably just grabbed onto that, let's see. Let me jump in. These are my pre-written, here's Elijah, who's age 10, is wanting to know, do all the colors in heaven have a special different meaning, and do you know what any of those colors mean? Yes, so. I know a few of the colors mean, and for other people, they can mean different things, and if God starts connecting with you with colors or numbers, then you will learn different the possibility of what they could mean. I do know that one is a prophet's color. I know purple means royal. I know that the father, well, the father loves teal, that's one of his favorite colors. You must know that in the Bible where it talks about when John stands before the throne of God in heaven, and he sees the rainbow, and he says, I saw a rainbow like unto an emerald. He did not say it was an exact emerald color. He was talking about the color of teal, because teal is one of the main colors that you'll see around the throne a lot in heaven, and so I do know that that is a royal. Royal is purple. I know that revelation is probably teal. Some people would say it would be emerald, and so there's other colors, of course, red, the blood of Christ. There's ones that people know. I think blue stands for prophet. There's other different things, but like I said, God could pick different colors to represent different things for you. Okay, because he's a personal God. Yes, he is. He would say, for you, red is glory. For someone else, red is the blood. That's right. Okay, cool. I just remembered what I was going to ask you, and just popped back into my head. I remain fascinated with trying to grab hold of the answer to this. Once people go to heaven, and they're so happy, and it's so blissful, and kind of the former things are passed away, and yet they look in down to the portals, and they see, I'm fascinated to understand our memory, our memory from earth, like when you're walking in the glorious house, and you're going to the places in heaven, and you're doing all things, you're in the throne room. My question is, to what degree do they remember events, or things, or relationships, and wonder what's going on, is the entire memory intact, when you go to the Lord? I would say things that are really special to you, especially family, especially events that you've got to be a part of, and stuff like that. Of course, those are always going to be special to you, but people are so concerned with Jesus Christ in heaven, but then he talks about us. He'll talk about certain things, and certain events, and stuff that you were a part on the earth, and he was happy that you got to be a part of those things. I think it goes both ways. I don't think everything is white from you. I know that you don't know about anything tragic, or bad, or stuff like that, but of course, you're going to remember your family, and you make plans for them to come. You keep lists of places to take them in heaven, so it's not like you're forgotten by them, or stuff like that. Are you kidding? They can't wait for you to get there, and see what's there, so yes, they are literally making places to take you when you get there. I think where this got sewn into me as a question, and not a problem or anything, but I'm just like, man, I see, because a prophet that would be known, I mean, I don't have his permission to quote him, but he wrote a book, and in the book, he said, he was had some visitations to heaven, and one of the visitations, he saw a former pastor or something that had been a mentor to him, but he had also picked on him, and kind of wasn't very nice to him, and he said, when he saw it, when he had this visitation to heaven, this person said, I'm sorry for how I treated you on earth, would that happen? I'm sure that it does happen sometimes. It's not required, and nobody requests it, but people just want to say it sometimes. But they would remember, I think that's where I'm going, they would remember that they didn't treat you right. Yeah, I don't think it's something they dwell on, I think that they're aware of that. Okay. All right, let's see. Amanda is asking, are there war dances in heaven, like we see in many tribes throughout the earth, have you ever seen them? The reason I ask is because twice now, I have felt led to do what I can only describe as a war dance with stomping and sharp movements. Oh, yes, they definitely have some, and some of them have war drums. Some have lightning staffs that they dance with, and they absolutely look like something just like that. So yeah, you wouldn't see stuff like that in the throne room, especially when they're praying over different things or different things. You totally would see that. I see these angels with their host. They have blue feathers as part of their hair. Really? And I've been in Colorado, and I think Reno, and most times they showed up, there was some of the most powerful prayer and a warfare being done, and those angels were there doing that. They're doing warfare on our behalf while they're in heaven. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, they were on the earth doing it here on the earth for us. Yeah, I think years ago, I heard you talk about pageantry in heaven. What have you seen as far as pageantry? Do they have gatherings where massive pageantry and flags and? Yes. Flags, especially, and whenever they're on the flag, the images on the flag come alive, and it's just some of the most beautiful things they've ever seen, and they do love pageantry in heaven. I know some people don't think it's not something you should have in church. I wouldn't encourage them. Even dance done as a holy thing, I think is something that's very powerful to do in your church services, and they also have things like that in heaven also in the throne room. That's good. It's not that they put flags in heaven because we thought of it down here, right? No. It's the other way around. Yes. They're already doing it, so well, many people, I know a number of them, and there are, what would be the way? Obsessed isn't the right word, but they are so, so into making specific flags with specific symbols in certain things like an eagle or a lion or whatever, and I'm thinking, I mean, I know that it's a gift, and I know it's a desire, but I don't have the same, but there are so into making this just right. Is that just the Lord birthing that in there? I'm sorry. Well, yeah, so when they have this obsession, it's not the right word, when they're just getting all of these creatures on the flag, they're getting this passion from heaven to do that very thing. Is that right? That's right. Okay. Cool. All right, here's, if you know this one, and I saw this question in two different forms, so I'm going to read what it's written, and I'm going to read you the other way I saw this question. This one, it says, Kat, I'm curious about why the northern lights were created on earth, and what is their purpose? And the other question that I remember seeing was, are there northern lights or what amounts to that in heaven? If you've seen them. Yeah, so it's come from the stones of fire, that actually is one of the things that creates the rainbow from the father, yeah, and they move these, when the father talks about his bow, his rainbow, and those colors around this throne, they move like the northern lights, that's what the northern lights represent. You know, you said just stones of fire just now, I've heard you say that the stones of fire were in the father, are they also in heaven outside of the father, if I can put it that way? Yeah, there's huge ones outside, he has a throne, he also wants to throw it outside, and there's a mass of stones of fire around that throne. What can you try to describe what they look like and how to, there's a mountain out there, there's a mountain outside the throne room, a mountain, and embedded in these mountains are some of the stones of fire, and they burn and the rainbows shoot off of them, just like the northern lights, they also walk around his throne, they also go inside of him and outside of him. So there's really some spectacular things that I don't always have an opportunity to talk about, but totally the northern lights, I always knew the northern lights was something from God, and I've never seen them in person except when I was a little girl in New York. But I love the movement of how they move back and forth like this. Yeah, totally. The rainbow is not stagnant like this, it moves in and out of him. You know, in science fiction terms here, they use an analogy, I guess, you think of, if you saw stones of fire or something, you'd think of, well, this looks like a, this is acting like a power source, if you see something on a, is, are the stones of fire kind of like, like that? Are they just something to look at, or are they doing? No, they bring revelation. Revelation is carried in the stones of fire, and they're used for other different purposes, but mainly that, I think mainly it's the revelation that comes from the Father. And okay, I'm looking, we have seven or eight minutes left, so as we're wrapping towards that seven or eight minute, is if they're revelation, I love that, by the way, do people that go to heaven, if they went and visited the stones of fire, would they have revelation coming to them? More revelation? I think people would. There's different areas on the city streets and where the streets would go that you have that you can get of revelation. Okay, cool. Mike is asking this, Kat has said that the Lord can send a layer of our soul out to minister while we sleep. Yes. Does she know if I, if I will have control of this in heaven, I don't know what he means control of this. He's trying to be fully present, visiting with one person fully present with Jesus, working in his workshop and so on. I guess they're saying these, can your layers go two different places in heaven? Oh, I don't know about heaven at all. I know that I'm going to be out on assignment for something. Interesting, that's an interesting question. And Jasmine is wanting to know, here's one for heaven, does Jesus wear jewelry in heaven apart from crowns, if so, what have you seen him wear that you would consider like jewelry if there's anything like that? I don't know that I've really seen a lot of that type of thing with him. I think the crown, of course, he's got more than one crown so you can wear those whenever he wants to. But I really want a few moments at the end to pray for the people if that would be our option. Yeah, I want you to finish that question and then I'll let you, we'll just do that, okay? I know he's got some bands that have things written on him, wristbands. I've seen him with different wristbands, I don't know what it's saying. He also has, I don't know what more to call it, not necklaces, but they're almost like a thing. It's like a necklace you wear, but it's got a key, but the key looks like a gemstone. And you fit them in different places in the city wall to open gates for you. That much I didn't know. Very cool, very cool. Yeah, go ahead and do what's on your heart as far as praying for the people, yeah. Yeah, Father, this day I thank you in Jesus' name for your power being felt everywhere by everybody, God, I thank you for your love, your life, your presence to be seen and felt everywhere, God, that you will be done your way in this day in Jesus' name. I thank you God for wholeness and healing and life and hope and joy to come to all the people out there this day, Father, in Jesus' name, because they know that they can trust you and that you love them more than anything, that thank you all that you've given to us and made possible for us, Father, in these days, to know you more and also to help us be more like you in Jesus' name, so be it. Amen and amen. Now we give your website every time, it's revealingheaven.com and KatKerr.com. I do encourage you to give in to Kat Kerrs Ministry. That's the one place on the internet she said you can give to hers at KatKerr.com. No other place if anyone's asked you for money in her name or her picture, it's not her. It's only at KatKerr.com, so Kat, thank you so much, God bless you, we love you very much and we will see you again next time. Yeah. Oh, quick question that tomorrow, Julie, when is Derek on, who's on tomorrow? Derek Johnson is on, we're recording him tomorrow, I thought, okay, well, yeah, we're recording him, I'm very curious. I think we got that, well, join us at 11 and you'll see which, oh, tomorrow is Kat, that's what's going on. No, I'm sorry, that's what's going on, it's, this is Wednesday for you and so Derek Johnson is tomorrow. I'm totally screwed up. Yeah. All right, hey, thanks a lot, we'll see you later, okay, bye-bye.

Hey, everyone, welcome to Elijah Streams. Today's Wednesday, January 18th, 2022. I'm your host, Kelsey O'Malley. I'm filling in for Steve Schultz. Now, you guys might notice my clock says a different time and different date, because we are pre-recording this episode with Kat. This time just works better for her. And if you guys know and follow Kat, you know that her schedule is totally different than most of us on the earth. She's very heavenly minded, and she goes by the time of heaven. So this works a lot better for her. And we're just thankful that you guys are here with us today. I'm thankful to be back with you guys. I feel like I haven't seen you in a while. So blessings to everyone. Thank you guys so much for praying for me, for those who have been sending me emails about my son. Me and my husband are due with our third baby at the end of February. And I am growing and getting bigger. I'll give you a quick little side shot if I could. Maybe of the belly there, we're growing. He's getting real big. He's doing real healthy. And we're doing great over here. My kids are so excited for our family to grow. And I just appreciate all the prayers and the love that you guys have been sending to me. Before we bring Kat on, we have one quick announcement for you guys. We just want to thank you again so much for each and every one of you who have given of your prayers, given of your finances, even given of your time to this show to support everything that God is doing right here. Thank you for supporting all the wells. You are changing lives every single time you give. I can't thank you guys enough. The smiles on these children's faces, it's worth every penny. It's worth all the effort, all the time. Everything is worth it to see them give glory to our Father in Heaven. So let's play our newest well promo. MUSIC smiling faces. I just love all those videos. Whoever's creating those too, you're doing an awesome job. And thank you again for sewing into what Elijah Streams is doing. You're making a huge difference in so many lives. And we know that we want to store up our rewards in heaven. We want to store up our treasures in heaven. And it's, it's amazing to see all that they are doing and partnering with. So thank you, Steve, for your heart and warren for your heart. And everyone who's involved in these projects is just amazing. So without any further ado, let's bring on Kat Kerr. Hey, Kat. Hi. You look beautiful today. I love your new background. Thank you. It matches so well with your hair. Our new background to the new temporary place. The new temporary place. Then there'll be another new studio. Yeah. So how, how you doing? What's, what's been on your heart recently from the Lord? I know he's given you a lot of downloads. I'm understanding more and more how important it is to be willing to take his journey or his preparation time. You know, even though he's made it clear this is what's going to happen. This is what I will do. Trust me, there's going to be some prep thing behind that. That's just the way he is. He wants to make sure that we are fully ready to step into the new with him. And so if there's something still in your life, not, not wrong, but that you don't understand fully or maybe we're working with new people or doing new things in a new place, he's going to make sure in this season of acceleration, you get to experience that. So you're fully prepared to step into the actual new of your life. And I can say this is definitely acceleration time. We've been experiencing that. So many things going on right now in our own lives. My family's life, Jen, my mom, myself, my husband, of course, and in our staff, we're experiencing new things too. And I got us preparing to solve for that new place, new offices. Yay. Oh, we're so excited about that that we won't be living in our offices anymore. If y'all didn't know that God actually has us doing that for like several years. And now of course, and so now we're actually going towards our brand new home that we've already selected and we're going to be getting it. But even now there's some things he still wants us to learn with each other, experience with each other. So that's why we're here, but we're near the beach, which we love the beach here. And so this is our second beach place. We have moved fully out of where we were. Yay. Jen says, yay, because you have no idea how long it's taken us to do that. We were there for almost 17 years. And let me give you a tip. I already gave him one. Here it is. Don't wait forever. All right. To get rid of things you don't need. You don't want. Make sure they're not hanging around in some corner somewhere, some closet somewhere underneath the table somewhere. I'm telling you, we found so many things in this whole, this whole journey of getting rid of stuff, moving out of the place that we were living in for so many years. It took us a whole lot longer months and months to do it. But God is sad. Get rid of everything personal out of the office. Make sure it is in storage before I move you into your new place. And we finally did that. We had a big celebration ourselves. I think I had chocolate cake like twice. So now we're on this journey of prep together for things that we need to know and understand that he's going to be doing with us. We're going to be doing some new things. We'll still keep doing, you know, chat with Steven Kat. We're going to be doing that. But we have a lot of other things already on our plate that he has shown us. New things in the offices that will be taking place, new products we're putting out. We'll have a place we can actually create products ourselves and have lots of storage to put them in. So we have been very, very busy. So number one, when God is clear to you about what he's going to do with you, he means that. So be willing to do his will, his way. And we made sure we told him, you have permission, God, to stop us if we're not hearing clearly. This is something we need to add or give you permission to let us know about. It's so important because then you've opened up the door completely for what he has for you. And so all I can say is these are great powerful days coming on the earth. I know you've heard me say that I can't change it because he hasn't changed it. And I've learned to know him well, not just his voice, but him. And so that's really one of the main things on my heart is letting you know these are days of preparation. And I know to you, they may look different and even to the world, they may look different. But God is fully aware of everything that's going on. And I'm telling you, hell is about to get the butt kicked royally and crushed and pushed back for quite a long time. So even though you've experienced a couple years of hell trying to rule in this world, Jesus Christ has every right to rule as the Lord of glory. And we are all given him permission to do that. So I can tell you right now, things are going to be different in a God way. Hell will not be our new norm. It will never be our norm. It's not my norm. So I just want you all to know that we love you so much. We thank you for the prayers. You know, really probably hundreds of thousands of people are praying for us right now for us to have all the God wants for us. We're praying the same thing for every single one of you. We pray for you all the time. We hold you up in prayer. We know that there's many other people and other leaders out there who are hearing God were so happy for that, that they realized God has a plan for your life in these days even more than all the days before this time. So yes, look forward to suddenly exciting things to happen. More and more justice coming in our lives and in the lives of this world because people are certainly ready to see that happen. So thank you for sharing with you today and love on you today. And I can't wait until we get our actual home home. We go from this place, which is beautiful at the beach. We are, we will be inside the gate God wants us in, but the home that we're going after is not quite quite ready. And so therefore we will be renting a place in there. We've already been approved. So we'll have a little taste of being inside those gates. It's going to be glorious. And we're looking forward meeting a lot of new people there and doing things for God. So that is my heart is to share that. Now, when you, when you said God's preparing you and your staff and there's been, you know, you've had to clean out and God said, get rid of this. Or the amazing thing is that we think, Oh, Kat Kerl, she knows, she knows everything and she's experienced everything. You know, and then to hear you share, it's just encouraging because to hear you sharing God's preparing me that you've not reached some pinnacle that is like, you know, God still can't deal with you and prepare you for new things. It's encouraging to all of us because I think we all feel like, man, God, what you are preparing me for something, but I can't put my finger on it. Yeah. I can tell you, he's being very clear in this time, though, with us also about the things he wants it needs for us to be a part of. And I think a lot of people don't realize that's what he's doing in your life. Sometimes you don't understand. If you ask for clarity, he will give you more clarity. You have not because you asked not. And it's so important to have clarity on what he wants with you. And just looking at looking at what I just moved the camera. Anyway, so yes, these are wonderful days. You'll experience new things. I will we will we all will. And so you you're for runners. I have to say that because the whole story of just tell them they're for runners. You are for runners and the powerful things of God coming on the earth. You're not here just to watch or just to hear or listen. You're here to be a part of it. So therefore, here, let's all say this together. Father, I give you permission to get my attention to get my attention. You need it. If you need it. I'm not listening. I don't want your will. I want your will. Your way. Your way. The only God I serve. You're the only God I serve. I will not serve another. I will not serve another. Amen. Amen. Well, I want to get into some questions because I know our time is a little bit shorter and we have some great questions here. But I want to start off with a question that is an amazing question. And it's, is there a difference between the father, son, and holy spirit? Can you know them each personally or is it just, do we kind of lump them together and it's just one spirit, you know, that we can only know? Well, tell you, nobody in heaven lumps them together. No one in heaven thinks, oh, this is the Godhead. We just have to worship them as the Godhead. We can't know them in the other way then as the Godhead. And of course, so each God, father, son, and holy spirit, they're God. I mean, they're not just with him. They are him. They are him. And they do many things together. They create together. They go, go places together. They have group meetings all the time with everybody. And so, but they have different personalities and I'll explain a little bit of that because I think it's really exciting. The father is of course our father. And the reason he says that is because you lived inside of him literally before you were here on the earth and he sent you here. And the reason he sent you was so you can actually have a physical body. And having you are a little spiritual being, maybe about this big. See if I can get that to see. See if I can get, anyway, let's read that over here. I'm not very good. There you go. You're about a little tiny spiritual being this but you were, that was your spirit. It wasn't anybody else that was you. You lived inside the father. That's where you've always been. And we've been with him from the beginning and actually you saw things eventually in heaven. You will probably remember some of the things you saw before the earth was made. You still were in him. And it says he is our father. It says we are his offspring. It's very clear about that. And so yes, he is your actual father. You had a temporary one on the earth that he sent you to. Now I didn't need to say a few other things. If that father was not good to you, that was not the father's choice. People on the earth, they have a choice to make up their own mind. They choose who they will serve and some that sometimes reflects on us. But one day in heaven, you will know who your real father is. It is the heavenly father. And he acts like a father. He goes out on outings with all many of us in heaven. He'll just have you come up the throne to visit with him. Sometimes he takes you somewhere by himself so you can get to know him more. So it's an amazing thing to see the heart of the father. And Jesus talked about him all the time when he was on the earth. He didn't stop talking about it. He would go away to be with him sometime to the mountains. Even though he was still on the earth and sent on assignment to be Jesus Christ, the son of the living God. He also was called the son of man and the son of God. That's who he was called. Because of course, Mary was his mother temporarily. She was chosen to carry the son of God and then birth him. And that was why so he could have a body like us so he could connect with us Jesus Christ. And you know what? We had to have someone righteous die for us. Someone who died for our sins that could forgive sins had to be holy. And so that was one of the reasons he was sent. And just even knowing him more for himself. He's a real character. He was a character on the earth. And people, even sinners, like to sit with him because he was exciting, interesting. I'm sure he didn't bash them all like most of some Christians bash people. I know you cannot agree with people who sin. I'm talking about you right now in the earth, you people. You Christians, you can't agree with sin because we're not supposed to. But you are still supposed to care about the sinner and pray for them that they would come into the kingdom, that they would know Jesus Christ. And so, but Jesus himself, I mean, think of what he called one of his favorite things he always said was to the one, the one, the high priest, maybe not the high priest, but you know what I'm talking about? The leadership in the temple who weren't treating people right. And Jesus fair season, Sadducees. Yes, Sadducees, fair season. And Jesus said, you're sure white and sepulchers, full of dead men's bones. Now, if that's not a shot at him, I don't know what is. That is not saying you're not doing right. I don't like what you're doing. It's wrong. Jesus Christ did not mind giving his opinion on things. And so his disciples really never knew what he was going to say or do. He was exciting to be with, though, and live with on the earth and do things on the earth. But I'm telling you, I can tell you three of his favorite things. If you'd like to know, yes, flowers. He was called the Louis of the Valley. Is that right? Yes. The Rose of Sharon. Well, what was he called all these flower things? He loved flowers. And how about this? Even where he was buried, it actually was the garden tomb. I was taken back in time one time. I don't mind sharing that because it happened. I was taken back in time. And that was the day that I was... I had started asking for baptism in fire because I knew that was... That was a powerful thing to have. It's still coming, but God is giving it out in measures. So I found out a friend of mine had received that one. I want that. So I started asking, asking, praying, praying, praying, praying. And one time at church on my word, you were caught up front if you were going to be in the ministry in any way or be a part of it. And the Holy Spirit said, you need to get down there. You are getting down there. I didn't think at that time that I really probably was. When I went down, I had hands laid on me. The power of God, the fire of God hit me so hard. It was like a blowtorch. It threw me back into the congregation. And the usher who was supposed to catch me was thrown back into the congregation. Also, and I laid on that floor for hours shaking with the fire of God on me. And two angels came picking me up, took me back in time. I'm just telling you the truth. They took me back in time to the tomb of Christ right after he had raised from the dead. So when I showed up, I was not having a dream. I don't dream. I don't sleep long enough to dream. It was not a vision. It was an encounter. And I had probably hundreds of thousands of encounters. And so I was so undone. Let me tell you this though. Traveling through time is just like you're watching a Star Wars movie or Star Trek. You know all those lights that shows when you go warp speed and they shoot at you. That's exactly the way it looked. I'm like, I'll never forget that time. That was so, that was just crazy. And so I saw all these lights shooting at us. And all of a sudden we stopped. My feet touched the ground. And when it clear, I was outside the tomb of Christ. And outside the tomb of Christ, the stone was rolled away. I knew where I was. I knew that's what that was. And when I looked, I was standing behind a few trees. There was Christ standing in the garden people. Here he's just raised from the dead, right? This King of Glory. And he's in the garden, but he has his back turned to, you know, where I was. I'm quite sure he probably knew I was there anyway. And Mary had come around the corner with spices and stuff like that, you know, to anoint him. She went in the tomb and the two angels were in that tomb and they asked her, you know, why have you come here looking for him? And then she said, where do you take him? So she stepped outside. She asked him, how about this? She thought he was the gardener people. Why do you think that? Because he was standing in the flower bath. Sometimes the answer is the simplest answer of all. And so she said something. Where have you taken him? Thinking he was a gardener. And he called her. He called her name, turned around. He knew exactly who she was. And then she knew who he was. And she ran at him. He said, don't hang on to me. He said, I haven't been back. You know, I've got to go to my father and your father, meaning his father in heaven, meaning he had not been back to heaven yet at this point. He said, go tell all the others, you know, where he went, go tell them what you've seen. And I heard all of that. And I heard all of that. Now, the crazy thing was, some of it was not in English, but I knew exactly what they were saying when they were talking about it. So that was one of the greatest encounters I ever had, getting to go to the tomb of Christ, seeing the stone have been rolled away, heard Mary's testimony about her, you know, talking to him and didn't know where he was. It was very powerful. So you let me tell you this. Don't ever discount yourself that you cannot have encounters with God. You don't ever think you can't because he wants to know you. He wants you to experience things. And I tell you, if you really want to, you don't have to ask him 500 times, ask him once and then thank him for taking you. Because in these days of glory and baptism and fire, many encounters will happen for people who never have one before. So I'm praying that that does happen for you, that God sees your heart and knows that you want to know him more, want to know Christ more. And I'm telling you, you'll never forget having an encounter. Your mind will go over that over and over again, and you'll probably be able to envision that when that happened to you. And that's the way it is with me. I never forget when I have encounters with God. So just expect something different, expect something new. These are new days on the earth that have never existed before. And he's going to include us. That means the body of Christ. And you're doing powerful things to become a test, a test witness and a testimony to the power and the love of the living God. You know, one of the questions that was on here to Kat was about the baptism of fire. And let me just find it real quick, because they were asking, basically is the, okay, here it is, Sharon want to know I'm spirit filled, but have also heard of a baptism by fire. Is that the same thing? If not, how do I receive the baptism by fire? I will tell you this, that it is an event. I do know it's an event that will happen on the earth and probably in mass at one time. It is, when it talks about baptism by our yes, that's what it's talking about. It's about the fire of God invading your life. It will wipe clean the walls of your heart and your soul from anything that doesn't belong there. God doesn't want there's one thing that will empower you to have such boldness. You have to understand that when the Holy Spirit showed up, remember that when they all were waiting in the upper room and the fire of God, the baptism of fire and the Holy Spirit brought it through the whole wall. I've been in that place and let me tell you that that opening, that portal of fire is still there. It's still there in the place where he came through. They were so powerfully impacted before that time. This is like when Christ, Christ had, you know, they had taken Christ and they were very concerned about that happening. Some of the disciples were not wanting to be seen out in public and yet after this encounter with Holy Spirit who filled them with the fire of God and with speaking in tongues at the same time, they were so bold they didn't care who heard them, who saw them. They had no fear in their life. It was the powerful thing that same thing will happen to you. It was so enfolding you to be a testimony of Jesus Christ and they began to impact everybody in that city after that happened. So yes, that is baptism in fire. That fire does come from heaven and actually some of the hosts are involved with that. It says that his angels fill his people with, you know, fire of God. So part of the angels or the angelic or the host are part of that whole thing, bringing fire from heaven to earth. It was in a calendar. I think one of our calendars we made, I think it was the one last one that we made. And by the way, just so you know, we're not going to stop making calendars. We will be making some new ones coming up soon. But the baptism in fire will be very key to the how we live our lives in this time, that and walking in the glory. Both of those are powerful things will be happening in these days of acceleration. So it's a different baptism, though, than if you get baptized in the Holy Spirit, let's say with evidence of speaking in tongues. But the fire of God is tangible. You would know if you got baptized in the fire. Yeah, you don't know if it's different. Yeah, I never had to ask anyone. You think I got baptized in fire? It was like I broke my heart with some hands. The heat of that fire when hands were laid on me, and it was my pastor and it was just someone God used to impart that into me. And I had been seeking it, though, I have been seeking it. So yes, baptism in the Holy Spirit is a separate baptism that is available right now to people. As soon as you get born again, you can ask the Holy Spirit to bathe your life and ask him to fill you. And she's speaking in tongues, but the fire is a holy, powerful level. I can't say it's more important than tongues. Tongues are very important to you, but the fire of God will empower you and embolden you like nothing ever has before. Amen. Would you pray for people that they've been asking and they've been crying out for the fire of God? Would you just pray for them real quick if, you know, however you're led by the Lord, that they would also experience that fire of the Holy Spirit? Yeah. Father, right now I just speak to everyone who is hungering for that baptism in fire is something you'll never be the same again. You may get a measure. I only had a measure. I didn't still get it in bonus, but I had a measure. I'll never forget. It changed me so much. So God right now, I just impart right now the measure I have received to anyone hungry and asking for it right now, receive it and Jesus name that it will embolden you, cast out all fear, all arguing, all, all, all, all the things that one's saying. Any confusion in your life right now in Jesus name, fill them, fill them, fill them with a measure. It's the same measure right now. I impart it. Say, I received everybody right now in Jesus name. Amen. There you go. Amen. All right. Make sure you're commenting right now if you're feeling the fire of God because you will tangibly. This is a tangible feeling that I'm not saying this. If you begin to feel hot even later tonight, we've had people who did receive a measure when I prayed. They got in a shower four times. They were so hot that they didn't know what it was. Do you not realize you received a measure of the fire of God? That's why you're hot. So thank you for it. Enjoy that while that presence is there because when it first comes, you can get really hot and it should be hot just to fire of God. So that's what you're experiencing. You need to understand when God really begins to touch you in many different ways. There's different ways that you could experience those things, but fire of God brings heat people. Yes. And you'll see such a change in who you are because it does it. It gets rid of you, your selfishness and you're like it gets rid of you, people. It gets rid of you, which sounds silly, but that is what it is. Even here, we're in a new level getting rid of stuff that we don't need. Not outside things. Yeah. Yeah. I know continually, continually we have to get rid of all the stuff that is worn. Yeah. Anything that pulls you away from God's path or don't argue with people. Don't be unhappy. Don't don't complain a lot. I'm not saying I do. I'm just saying some of those are situations in your life. Need to let him go and just let God finish what he wants to do in you because then he gives you more of him in you. Yes. And that's the ultimate goal right there. Nothing better than him and us. That's right. Okay. I'm going to get to another question now, Kat. So Cheryl asks, do the demons know that Satan is defeated and their ultimate end is the lake of fire? Oh, I doubt it very much. He's probably lying to them. He's probably lying to them saying that they're all going to take over and they think they're taking over right now. I don't think he tells a truth to anybody. Yeah. They all find out eventually probably sooner than later. Yes. Amen. Okay. Kim Kim asked my seven year old nephew sees a lot of things in the spirit. He sees things move in mirrors too. How can I tell if he's seeing good or bad things in the spirit? I think it depends on how he explains it or even how he acts after that, but definitely explain to him that he needs to if something shows up, he has to ask the question. Are you of the spirit of the most high God who sent his son to die for the sins of this world? He even says that's a test question. If you're not sure if it's of God or not, then you need to ask that question. You can make up other ones, but that one is definitely from heaven. They can't lie if that very question is asked. Okay. Normally if it's a spirit that doesn't belong to God, then they can't answer. They can't even say they can't lie. Okay. They cannot lie. So that question and that's the one that I sometimes use myself just to test. Although I don't necessarily have to. I do that to each other that it's okay to do that. And most of the time they, the others will disappear, they'll be gone. They get really terrified that I even know that I have to or should ask that question. God is very pleased that I do ask it. So you will ask anything that shows up in the spirit. Come and go with me. I've got something wonderful to show you. I'm going to show you a whole new place. You know, you've never seen before and you just go with them. Don't do that. You ask them, are you of the spirit of the most high God who sent his son to die for the sins of this world? And usually they will just be gone. They'll just go and they won't respond to you if you ask that question. And there's a difference between, because when you have an encounter with God or if you're seeing something, it is so real to you, whether it's a counterfeit spirit or an angelic presence, the fear, I think, because we're in human flesh, right? We have that lighter fight system. So is it the fear of the Lord or because the fear of the Lord is not fear of the enemy? Like, could you explain the difference between the fear of the Lord and fear if it's a demonic presence? Yeah. Fear where you are afraid, afraid. That's usually from the enemy. That's one of his greatest weapons is fear, even though it's unfounded fear. I mean, there's no reason for it. The devil still likes to use that. The fear of the Lord is that you don't want to do anything that would hurt the Lord. That's the difference and that is actually the truth about that. You don't want to step out and do something that would upset the Lord or hurt him. And if people don't realize that's what the fear of the Lord is, it's not afraid of him. It's afraid of how you may make him feel if you choose the wrong thing or do the wrong thing. That's a great explanation. So if your seven-year-old nephew feels fear, like heart-pounding fear, then I just want to ask this too because I feel this prompting of the Holy Spirit. How should she pray for him if that is happening to him? Maybe he comes in and shares an experience and he is like terrified. How should she pray over him? The first thing I would do is break anything of the enemy off of him or that's trying to impress him, especially witchcraft. And what she actually does is she could go, I sever all witchcraft trying to attack the self to me because many times that's all it is. Not that that's not dangerous. It's just it's probably a lie but that doesn't matter. You don't want that. She also has the right to lose that from his soul and that's what she should do. I choose as a watcher over your soul to lose that entire encounter, those feelings, that spirit. I lose that out of your soul like it was never there in Jesus' name and I bind to your soul the love and the life of God and the truth from Jesus Christ and then it will be gone. Awesome. Awesome. So Lynn asked, sometimes I hear singing at night like choirs. That's amazing Lynn. I also have heard musical instruments. Only every now and then I can pick up a word for the singing. She said, what am I hearing and why am I hearing this? I'm sure you're hearing Heaven's choir. I'm sure that's what it is or some of the angels who sing from Heaven. I'm sure that number one is what you're hearing. And I've been in many services before where I have heard Heaven's choir singing even with the people singing on the platform. I've heard them. I've also heard instruments being played that work from this earth and many times I actually can hear the words of what the angels are singing that are present or that came to share worship from Heaven. So those days are going to increase for people. So make sure your heart is open to receive that. When you come into worship service, understand Heaven is present. If you're glorifying God, if you're worshiping Jesus Christ, Heaven is going to be present. Okay? Don't let yourself get distracted, focus in on the worship, you have to close your eyes to listen. You may hear something you don't expect to hear which would be really awesome. So I know that is what you're hearing. Yes, that sounds glorious, Lynn. We just pray for more of that in Jesus name. Tony asks, I have heard you often say that if we've lost a child through miscarriage or even through abortion, then they're given to us when we get to Heaven. She said, I have a son whose ex-wife aborted two children that he very badly wanted. She's repented, but when he gets to Heaven, will he be reunited with his children or are they given back to the mother? I think they get to know both of you. I think this is just the way God does it. If the mother is in Heaven and she's repented for all of that, of course you would want to know him, but those who raised him do not miss out on knowing him in Heaven, spending time with him in Heaven. So I think it's something that's probably shared between both of them. So they both get to be with their babies. God is so redemptive in everything. Okay, last question for you, Kat. When God heals somebody of something, does he send those symptoms or diseases somewhere, or are they just taken from the body? I think she might even mean like if it was a spirit of infirmity, maybe even. When God heals somebody of something, does he send those symptoms or diseases somewhere, or are they just removed from the body? I think they're just removed from the body completely, sometimes like they were never there. To be healed is one thing, but to be made whole is like it never happened to you. And really, I always pay for people to be made whole in Jesus' name, but normally they're just taken away and they're gone forever. Yeah, praise God. He is our healer. So Kat, before we, well, why don't we pray first and then I'm going to, that way people can find where they can follow you. So why don't you pray however you feel led to first and then we'll get all the information about your ministry. Father, I thank you for all those listening God. You know what their needs are. You know what they're asking you for. You know what they're expecting in their life. I thank you, God, for answering their prayer, for showing them your love, to show you, show them that you care very much about them, that these are glorious days coming on the earth, Father. So I thank you right now to send all those things out, Father, that the sudden leaves, the excitement, the joy, the celebration that's coming, Father. I thank you for giving that to the people listening and watching, even if it's later, Father, that you are a God that loves. You are a God that sent your son to die for the sins of this world, for the healings for the people, by his stripes we were already healed because of his word that he has given, Father, the promises even that you have given, Father. They are true in a man in Jesus' name. I declare them to not miss one day what you have planned for each and every one of them, Father. Bring family members back together in this time, God. Show them your mercy. Show them justice for what's been done against them, God. And let us live our life for you, for Jesus Christ, for Holy Spirit, in these days to be a witness in the testimony of the saving power of Jesus Christ, the healing power, the love of the Father, and the celebration of Holy Spirit. In these days, may they receive baptism in fire, walk in the glory, and be a part of the story of how Jesus Christ came to this world in Jesus' name. May it be so, and everyone said Amen. Well, thank you, Kat, so much for answering all those questions. And I just love being with you today. And you know, a lot of people have been blessed by so many of your, like you talk about your calendars because they give visuals. And I think for all of us, we're visual people. Everything we do, we see everything. So it really helps us. So how can people get that stuff? Is it on revealing heaven? Yeah, revealingheaven.com is the website that we have that you can go to and see the products that the Holy Spirit has given us to create, to reveal heaven to earth, to reveal the things that are in heaven. And also, there's katker.com. If you want to be a monthly giver, it's the only place you can give online is katker.com. So don't give through a personal message. Yeah. And also, we all the katker.com bothers a spiritual platform to say whatever he wants to whenever he wants to. And so we just want you all to know that we love you very much. There's nothing out there to learn and see about heaven, even where or dream from. Like, I love my new coffee cup. Although I think it's got something else in it besides coffee. Here you go. It says I don't do demons right there. Nope, I don't. They're crushed and pushed back. That's what they're supposed to be. We love heaven. That is our assignment from God's to reveal heaven to earth and create heaven and part of heaven on this earth. And we're not going to stop. So be blessed in Jesus name. Get ready for exciting things to happen in your life. And we will be praying for you. Amen. Amen. And I think earlier today, Emily or Julie's reminding me, I said today was 2022. I must my mind, but I'm sorry, pregnancy brain. We are not in 2022. We are in 2023. Sorry about that. A great year. Amen. So tomorrow, we will see all of you guys Thursday will be with Johnny and low unfiltered. You don't want to miss it. We love all you guys. Bless you in Jesus name. See you tomorrow. Amen.

Happy Wednesday, Jen, it's a J, January 25, 2023, welcome to the broadcast, we're sorry we're late but better late than never, you know Kat has moved and she has to move again so that's slowing things down and her husband got rear-ended yesterday so that's not good so that's that also entered into the equation anyway we're sorry we're late but we're here now and we're looking forward to bringing you the best of Kat so here we go I just want to show you one thing real quick we got a brand new spot the the person that's going to be talking it's just so full of joy is on staff at show mercy so you'll say well how come she's dressed so nice and versus the people well they you know that she's on staff in the village called field of they call it field of dreams and out from outside of the village then they they they put these wells and so that will be the contrast that you'll see she's amazingly joyful so without further delay let's watch that spot here we go we are celebrating why because thousands of people cannot access clean water and thousands have given their lives to Jesus because of the clean water was that have been drilled you are truly serving life you have no idea the peace of mind that she have brought to the mothers in these villages now their young daughters don't have to travel alone for miles and miles to collect water instead they can focus on school and family everyone is rejoicing and giving thanks may God bless you all come with me as we go visit one of the mothers that you have impacted I'm here with pexons family pexon is a mother of eight and she lives at some of her grandchildren before the new water wells were drilled in this community they would walk two hours to the old water source to collect water it was very hard for them but now everything has changed because they now have a new water source because of you the water source is just two minutes away from their home stories have changed thank you for being a blessing may God bless you we would like to say thank you that's amazing imagine in my lifetime maybe the water has been off a couple of times in my 67 years can you imagine someone saying well Steve buck up just get some buckets and go there's a you know if you hike two hours that direction I think there's some runoff from the mountain and the animals use it just get some water and carry it two hours back I mean that's what they're dealing with so when we when we drill the wells with your the money that you have sown we're not just giving them a little bit more convenience we're changing their entire life so thank you again for providing for a seriously overdue need that these people have so thank you thank you thank you so all right we're going to bring Kat in here so it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve here we go we found you Kat we found you yes you did you were lost but now you're found so we had when we had first gotten the wrong news yesterday later we had thought we had heard that you were in the accident as well but it's not good that anyone should be in the accident but he was in the house being doing you really quick there he is being doing okay okay we lean in further so we can see the other half of your there you go how are you doing doing fine you're all there yeah you're all here we're so glad you're okay I know they said you were in a larger like a pickup truck was it yeah so that was that makes sense she was in a Ford escort not me okay drove it hit me yeah well and and how are they that hit you they were they've been more shaped than you I don't know nobody called an ambulance for so I think she was just more upset than anything oh wow oh wow well she hit me at a pretty good clip yeah and you probably there were extenuating circumstances on her side that she should not have been in and so she should not have been driving is what I understand yes driving in the condition she yeah wow well I prayed I prayed I prayed when I heard and even that changed our plans for that day which was fine I mean I understand he had to be there he was a witness and everything that happened but we did pray for her for her salvation as well as condition but he's gonna be great good good good good well I'm glad you're both safe so now did we lose them all together or do it there we go we lost you for a second there you almost got lost again you're here you're here back so well listen let's jump right in anything you want to share with the people before we get into questions more than ever now even then since our last week when I spoke the enemy is upping his game people that's because he's afraid and I know people go what do you mean afraid yes they get terrified I mean he's the owner of fears where the greatest weapons he uses and he doesn't mind having it unless it's him that's experiencing it there's so many people stepping into the destiny right now including all of us here my staff friends of ours we know powerful things happening for them when he gets right down to like the last minute the last week or whatever then he's going to try other things the enemy will and then you have to stay not just pray it up you have to say praised up that's good one of the things we love and I praise him trust me my staff know in the midst of everything I will still praise him I will still worship him I'm not giving up on anything he's promised me on and he keeps the money of all the promises he's given me about things that are about to happen in this world in this country so I know you've heard me say it before and you probably will again this is your time to shine for him this is your time to be great these are days of greatness we're coming into not what other people think they are I know I know what God's plans are for us we're here in America for all of you out there and I can tell you what your lives are never going to be the same again and literally you can follow ours and see that God is about to do great things even the mist of all the stuff we all went through this last year we are still stepping into our new home we're still going to go places he said that we would go we still have things not yet completed and we think we have found our new offices all right you have yeah that's wonderful yeah Margot's been really looking because we don't like it we can't talk to the people or have ways to do things and so you know we've had to do that so I think what we've been out of the place we were in for almost 17 years for about a week or so maybe two weeks and so that was very complicated trying to find all of our stuff even though we have eight storages with all of it stored in we make sure everything's organized we just have to run to the different storages to get what we need I'm just saying it may get complicated for you and maybe not be convenient but that means God is about to show his hand on your behalf so more than anything I want to encourage you we're still kind of even doing that now so that's why you know hey this is a hat for the beach we are again at the beach and so I thought what a wonderful way to show that there are things that are different for us today and even probably next week a week after that we will be in a totally different place having having our broadcasts and everything we're really wanting to get that place up and going and actually they were about to just demolish it now it's really he's demolishing but somebody has bought the building that our offices will be in and it's a temporary place we we know we have great things planned and other things but this place is going to be wonderful and perfect it's like God just robbed it right in our lap so that's what we say and so it's a wonderful place got lots of office space creative space studio space and we're going to enjoy being there not too far away from where we actually want it well in the last 17 years if I understand it right your home was your office was your bedroom was your everything you were all in there and for all these years when you've been on the air with us if it was your home it was your office your staff would fill up that long I think maybe we had a couple years of starting out and a wonderful you know wow we have a studio this is exciting and then of course God who trains you in different ways you never expected yeah woke us up each each one of us separately and said your your your bedroom will now become your office wow and he said you will get rid of your bedroom furniture you can have a sofa or something in there but it has to have official an official place I've got pictures all bring back and show when I find them in the store and we literally obey we turned it into the entire home ended up by being our headquarters and you walk to it you thought you were in an executive office and we had shipping and receiving we had our creative zone we had all kinds of areas we had a we had an entrance that was really nice set up that's where our guardian zones was being worked on and yes I know you're still thinking about well what in the world happened to some of the other stuff we were going to do all this stuff God started doing with us we had to put aside so we could be ready to step into the new stuff he has for us well I'm saying you we will have a lot more creative things to put out there and probably a lot more studio time now that we'll actually have a studio so we really just the other day and I couldn't even go view it Jen had to go Margaret had to go my CFO and our Spanish interpreter went with them and so they looked at several places and found one that we actually could lease for just a year which is rare to find anywhere in the area that we'll be in is not like the best area in the world but it is a great a great area for business and so we're excited if we can get a time again we don't have to dig those pictures up we'll probably give you some clips of what our new place will look like at least temporarily and doing movement you're much people don't realize the the the sacrifice they don't think of all the different things that happened when we had my previous company that God had ordained we were reuniting missing people with each other families we were and in that we ended up with 13 people working out of a it was a half garage because the other half was built funny so it was a half garage 30 people and then we took over Christopher's bedroom and then and then so now I don't even remember how he did how he slept but then when it was lunchtime they would come out of the garage into our kitchen and fix their right and you know how that goes your kitchen isn't your kitchen your bedrooms right here bedroom we no longer had a kitchen that was ours and our great room which was so beautiful ended up by being shipping and receiving wow with packing centers with computers creative stuff it was the biggest space in there and it was it was the most at one most active space so yeah and they all came into our dining room with a dining room became the studio we didn't ever and the living room was the guardian zone I mean so many things we just gave up one after the other after and you know the greatest thing you gotta have more than one party yeah yeah so even some of those had to be given up and I think we ended up with very very little private space that we could call personal private space so we are so looking forward to that that was how it happens when you start out it just happens one day at a time yeah it does and I remember when it happened to us then it got to at least there was one sanctuary which is our master bedroom at the end of the hall which isn't that big but it had its own bathroom and and I remember there was a dividing point where we said that's it where staff started coming walking down the hall poking their head into the master bathroom saying drain you have a call and and she that was it we finally went and rented a place but you know it's like people don't know what privacy Kat you have given up even as head of the ministry they don't realize I realize I get it you know we gave it all up and eventually they all did and I was so glad God told each of them separately to do that it's pretty hard to convince hey y'all got to give up your bedrooms now oh man they said this is wild the guy woke me up and said that my bedroom was not my office how much yes wow that's totally him so then we picked out office furniture and they had desks just like real official desk file cabinets in what was their bedroom they each well most of them got like a sofa that could open up that they can sleep on my mom did Jen did being an eye end up but we went through somebody doing kind of a wild weird things to sleep on that you can make into sleeping things and but but literally I had to was executive office of Margaret's desk was in there mine was in there big desk with file cabinets and all kinds of storage stuff was in there it looked like a real office which is what it was in the middle of all of that in the middle of all of that that's when you were saying God said let's eat cake right am I saying that right yes and yes okay so people know that that was the context and still is the context and then the day comes when we have packed everything we own I'm saying all the personal stuff first and then all the office stuff and it took like months to do that but there came a day when it was totally completely empty where we were living and then the work started because we had repainted new floors put in it's going to get a new roof on it gets a whole brand new fence it also has some other work and things added because friends of ours own it and they're going to sell it and we want them to make a good amount of money for the effort being such a blessing to us and so all that work started after that we had to still go back and forth we were in a hotel for a while I think then we were in a like a little villa place that was like a B&B kind of a thing and now we're here in this nicer place nicer place with more space in it and so that's the way it happened and we were very very faithful to what God wanted us to do and when you are faithful he will never forget that so I want to definitely encourage people here in that place I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of you were in places right now in between places but we were happy knowing God was not done with us and he's not done with you either yeah I mean that's so instructive to the to the body to hear the story what you've actually gone through to in order to obey the Lord you know it wasn't like it was sudden all peaches and cream now it's gonna but it never stopped being chocolate cake is you know no I can tell you we never really had personal space after that all the time people had to come by bring deliveries or come to you think and we so it was like you know you don't mean you can wear your bathrobe for a whole day one day but here we are about to take our next leg of our journey where we'll be inside the gate he wants us in and so we're very excited so about a week we'll be moving the mayor to a more temporary place until they actually finish our beautiful place that we will be moving to sometime probably in the next six months now we we're gonna keep these shows to 45 minutes so we've got some questions anything else you want to say before we get going on the question probably that's important to share what our journey is and what God is doing with us so people can relate to it yes I think sometimes you need to hear stuff like that yes you do that's just life you know that's life but life lived for him is still a whole different thing yeah and by the way you know we did that it was we lived two hours away in Vancouver Washington at the time the Elijah list hadn't even been a thought in our head at that time when that was happening we said to ourselves we will never do that again ever well guess what we move south here and we the Elijah list got going and we started filling our house people again and we we did half of that we ended up with probably five or six or seven before we said all right we're not going to 13 this time and we started running an office so yeah never say never as the expression so right about that but I can totally totally relate Kat to everything I asked Margaret when we go to this next place can we just have our studio there said you're never taken the office yeah yeah not ever taken the office to the home again okay so we can have staff work out there that's before we found a new place the staff can come and work you said no we're not doing that you're going to have a place yeah that's going to reward you for all that all right first question a couple of these starting off come for me because I haven't asked you for a while because I have I missed last week but I want to talk about neighborhoods if there is such a thing in heaven are there neighborhoods because like I want to live in the same neighborhood as my wife who won't be my wife in heaven and my kids who won't be married in heaven but how are there such things as neighborhoods and and even if there were Doreen's parents would want to be in that and but she's got a dad on this side and a mom on that side of course everybody has so is there such things as a neighborhood and how does that all work out that's a great question some people never asked that and absolutely yes there is there's some homes that they were the people were so close they actually have the only way I can describe is it looks like a wheel within a wheel really massive central stage picture this is like your neighborhood right where your family lives a lot of your family lives in this place and and you have these beautiful gorgeous arched hallways but all comes together in this huge central place where you have all kind of family fun stuff to do things and exciting things that you can do have company over a really fun exciting thing to do that doesn't mean it's your only place but yes there is a place where the whole family can go and live and be together at different times but you still have your own actual not not a unit it's like an actual home but they're built like that in heaven I think this is the first time somebody ever asked me that so people love it people want to come and visit that specific family they can go to each other's homes that they can all come together in this huge central area with fun things to do like they'd have living waterfalls right there they could have a forest growing in that area and it's still be inside it's really exciting there's transports from the center of that place to wherever you want to go and have it oh wow absolutely yes they do have a place it's like that very cool now now along those same lines I'll just use a woman as an example not even I just won't even make it my own but there's a woman and she's had this is not a real person I'm making this up but she's had two husbands and maybe she's had three but let's just say she's had two and we know in heaven there's no jealousy there's no there's nothing evil there's no bad feelings so she's been married to both she loved them both are they in the same neighborhood or how does that work when there's when there's two husbands that are in heaven in my in my friends by the way okay we all have one you know there's only one bribing us Jesus Christ and so um I do want to make that plane of course they can all be together and sometimes actually in the natural they've all become friends anyway I know a lot of people that were married to old times and they all that whole family the families became friends and so sure they could have one they can have one close by as a part of that the actual neighborhood or maybe the next one over but everybody can visit anybody any time there's there's no no like we're going to have a sleepover whatever and everybody's going to be there it's not like if you were married on the earth no one's going to be jealous because you all visit everybody visited and it isn't like they're all sleeping together just one place there's so many places involved in these neighborhoods they could be right there be close go into the central area everybody's doing stuff together and but invited other people to come so there's no jealousy whatsoever no one is jealous no one is jealous of anybody there's no jealousy greed there's no anger there's no one feeling being made to feel left out maybe they weren't invited to defend or something like that it just doesn't exist in heaven and when you say this central area I I'm picturing a couple of different possibilities one is like a central courtyard or I'm thinking well maybe it's more like a a park with lots of benches and tables that people can gather on so what can you describe the central area you're talking about it depends on the style of the neighborhood they're in it could be very supernatural very futuristic and so it wouldn't be even like something they had on the earth possibly it could be okay but it we're talking about like a mountain range we're not talking about like a little park with a couple benches that's not what I'm talking about I mean amazing places in the core of this whole area that people could go enjoy themselves invite other people to come and enjoy what's there there could be ski lodges in the center one massive ski lodge and then everybody has their own individual ones separately which is their own place and guys who please explain to them that when went they're no longer married when they come home they have a newer god son or daughter and so you come home to son or daughter you don't come home as somebody who at one time had a different husband or wife and so people already their minds that when they see Jesus Christ they are so in love with him he's the most amazing amazing powerful exciting person I have ever met and he comes and visits these places or does stuff with people it could be like one the core center of the whole place could be like a jungle safari and those those animals are out there all the time people really see them and be a part of what they're doing there's all kinds of different things that God could pick or choose to make that core the core of like the whole the neighborhood would be a thousand miles oh really oh say that again now yeah you have to understand that everything is so small and our understanding earth is a very small aspect but things in heaven are almost unlimited so these places you go to stay and live in or even visit of course we know there's christmas town that is a massive place where you go to play in the snow you make snowmen they come alive because all the snow is alive if people like my mind your mind is going you know bonk bonk bonk like how can this be possible because it's happened and that's why it says I has not seen or either heard nor entered the heart or mind of ma'am a god is prepared for you it's just not possible unless you have been there and so uh these places are very huge lots of room lots of extra chalets and cabins everywhere in this place so somebody gets invited they don't have to come to stay in your place and get a whole different place to enjoy and be a part of do you have okay a thousand miles wow uh I can I can grasp that because we talked about the city of Jerusalem was and I calculate I think I said it on the air with you once that when I calculated out the distance the Bible says it is the the the coordinates were like two-thirds across the United States wide deep high so so everything is big big big um are there such things as um because you know I you'll be Kat and I'll be Steve and all that but are there are there last names in the sense of we're going to have a Schultz reunion and and all the Schultz's get together and maybe there's three thousand of them but is there such thing or is it or have you seen anything like that I have not seen very many last names of anybody okay everybody's known on a first name basis unless they have nicknames okay and a lot of people will call you by your nickname if you have one for somebody but um I I suppose somewhere there would be scrolls with that information in it scrolls could be written and you would open it and it would read itself to you in heaven about certain things about certain families that were on the earth and things like that I'm quite sure I know that they keep records like that in Israel itself uh you know the genealogy history and God likes to keep things or create things like that so I'm sure somewhere in there there probably is so I had a friend at least a book or a scroll about it I had a friend who just went home to be with the Lord a few months ago um in this mid 70s or late 70s and he was named as his everybody called him JD I assume those are his first two initials but I don't know that it is JD it was JD is he probably going to be known as JD in heaven then is that what you mean by his name but everyone goes by even their name it could be somebody probably but make may call them by their nickname because that's all everyone ever called him was JD yeah that's probably what they're calling there okay that's cool because I you know that actually makes it to heaven if I could use that term in other words those commonalities those habits those what I'm trying to find a word would still be in heaven if everybody called you JD here they're probably going to call you JD there that's that's interesting to me that's interesting all right so let's talk about for the the mansion because I've been wanting to ask you this I don't know that I have so the mansion you said some I've heard you say some mansions are as big as a city so that that's weird that kind of weirds me out but let's just say I have a normal mansion that's 20 000 square feet that sounds probably small for heaven but let's just say there is there's no bathroom we know that so are there bedrooms is there a we know you don't need sleep so are there no such thing as a bed in a bedroom to I think you have your favorite room designed anyway you want to uncomfortable things to sit on or lounge on and I know that there seems like that there but I've not really seen a bedroom that I can kind of remember they have kitchens because people love to cook yeah so some of them have kitchens I don't think mine does because I don't want to cook see if there were people like me they'd say man there's nothing so relaxing as a good old power nap just a nap I have heard of people drifting on the water and I guess they growls or whatever and then the angels huh I know that there's one beautiful place where they have these rivers that are very soothing and peaceful and I do know that some people I guess they relax and if I'm the angels will wake them up I guess they wake them up or I don't know what else they would be doing but I do know that if you love to do that I'm sure you receive a lot of things in heaven that you would love to do I don't think it's that you wouldn't want you to have a bedroom except most people wouldn't probably use it but as far as lounging and just enjoying yourself relaxing but there's so much to do and see there so interesting powerful powerful visits in the throne room the mountain of spices you know passionate paradise with all about the love of Christ and you learn so much in this place is to learn how to create different things and so but I'm sure at one time or another you probably would want to lounge on the river of peace that's interesting that's good now you said every mansion if I'm again don't let me put words in your mouth but I think you said every mansion everybody has a prayer garden did you call it a prayer garden or what did you call it what did you call a where Jesus would come what did you say about that it's just your personal garden it's a private garden where the Lord comes to visit with you whenever you want you to come okay and He has given you a key to that specific garden to the to the gate and and you don't necessarily put it in the lock you set it in it and then you turn it and when you open it when it opens your favorite flowers are there some of your most favorite music is there and Christ will come to visit with you so Kat is there what once everything is over you know the earth is no more we're not decreeing for the things on the earth of course I know one day we're going to all then live on the new earth but is there a time when people don't need to pray because there's nothing to pray about because everybody's there and the Lord's there is or is your is prayer always does prayer always exist in heaven or is there a time when you really won't need to pray because you'll have the Lord himself I think that probably won't necessarily be a big focus but people as long as there is still earth and people's family members are down here people will pray for them in heaven they do declare over them they pray for them it talks about the souls under the altar which is actually a huge room under the throne where they go under underneath there and they go to pray and to clear and stuff like that so I think it's a different reason that you pray I think a lot of people pray only one night it's okay it's all right when you have needs and you need stuff really and you pray for that reason or you need help or healing or you know people I think your prayers become entirely different because at one point there'll be no evil no sickness no disease there'll be no fear there'll be no attacks and I'm just on this whole list it's it's going to be filled with glory splendor creativity excitement joy and celebration is what your lives will be and under the altar I think that the clearing and decreeing might be something something you would like to do something with the Lord and you have maybe want to question him you can just pray you could probably just to clear it right where you are he'll hear you you probably would come to see you personally though oh I like that you wanted or needed I like that I can't remember how do you answer this I asked you this one other time recently but the scripture says under the altar there's those and I think they were called the martyrs and they said they were under the altar and they would say how long oh lord until you and I can't remember if it says a van jar blood or something like that yeah and that was those probably those yeah whose life was taken wrongly it could have been like not just one person that happened to and so people yeah that that's absolutely true it's ain't that I'm sure that once that takes place they don't stay there forever it's not like they live there forever okay right now there's a focus for them to see that to see justice for all I think justice is a really good word to use that's it come it's the closest thing that I've ever read that sounds like sadness if I can say that they're sad I don't think most people are sad I think they sincerely want to see justice come okay a lot of people right now want to see justice and oh yeah and freedom for whatever reason and I think people have their different reasons for desiring those things and most people come to heaven or just let it all go they just really begin to live and not dwell in the past but for people depending on the life that they live or what was for whatever reason happened to them there is that place it is under like the whole structure under the throne of God and there there is of course an altar up there's several throne rooms just so you know that the commissioning throne room where people receive they receive mantles they receive commissions in heaven and then of course some things are sent down to the earth if they're receiving them on the earth and so but there but this one thing that they're talking about this this altar underneath it I used to try to picture how do they get that many people underneath that all right well right but the throne itself is massive really huge high and lifted up in the throne room and so there's like a whole structure underneath there there's four sets of steps that go up to the throne but there is a door you can go into and when you go into that door you're actually under under the altar of God this before the throne. When when the people are declaring and decreeing for their family still on the earth who have not yet come to be and they declare and I mentioned this before uh Julie heard my father she's a seer and she heard my father saying to the Lord this was a request petitioning to the Lord for me and she heard him say give him more Lord give him more whatever that might have meant so my question is when people pray in heaven their prayers must be perfect and they know I ask you this one at a time but can you clarify is virtually every prayer and decree answered by the Lord in the affirmative you know what I mean they're not people don't decrease absolutely yes if it's blessing that they're praying over people decreeing over people I would say absolutely yes why wouldn't they be now the timing even of that you may not know when the timing would happen for that even though it's a great thing or a good thing God would still probably line that up with what his plans were for certain people or when or when they were supposed to happen but I would think definitely probably almost everything that you would declare in decree in heaven would at one point be answered yeah I want to ask you a question related to now there was a time when I had to speak in code we were on YouTube and we had to use different language so they didn't kick us off but on rumble we can say what we want people are dying by big numbers and it's obviously related to the facts can you tell us anything about how God is working in that or you know how God is bringing good out of that because God clearly didn't make that happen is that showing you anything I know that there is a devil in this world and I know probably until the very end comes well we know even in the the reign of Christ eventually he will show up and so I think those things happen God does not ever ordain for bad things that happen to people I think a lot of that is his wherever he works out with that I don't necessarily get shared with everything I do know this his love for you never changes and I know that sounds crazy even in in and trying to answer that question or even understand that question that I am quite certain one thing most all those people probably had an opportunity to receive Christ if your goal is heaven then of course I'm not I'm not saying any of that stuff that makes it easier to go through or to experience but I have to say that my own life I have to trust God no matter what's going on around me in the world or even in my neighborhood I still have to choose to trust God and believe God even when things happen that we don't understand or we don't want to have happened and that's probably the only way I could answer that I can't see any good much coming out of anything like that yeah we do know one thing it does do is it does expose evil yeah so it exposes there is evil there is devil who hates there's people who work for that devil and don't mind hurting people in the midst of it because they have been so polluted their minds have and so then they become they become involved with his works thinking one day satan will reward them that is a joke nobody gets rewarded by satan trust me they don't you don't get any prizes they don't get any pleasures they don't get any positions given to them he will lie to everybody even people he's using and so I would tell you don't ever give yourself to him thinking somehow you're gonna get something great happening or maybe he'll go a little easy on you that is never gonna happen you need to serve the most high god and him alone do you serve him alone do you worship him alone do you trust because he's the one who really has your ultimate life and eternity in his hand and so my my thing in all of that is no matter what it is or what it involves your goal should be to know him so good I want to ask you one thing we have time for probably this one more question this scriptures is very clear and I accept it and I receive it but it's confusing at the same time where it it says that christ was slain before the foundation of the world has god ever shown you what in the world he meant by that did he see it all and he was effectively slain was there something in the spirit that was decided before he ever said I'm not sure that exactly what it meant is what it said he's been from the beginning to the end in the end from the beginning he already knew in his existence that that would happen before that time actually ever came on the earth and I'm pretty sure that's exactly what that means just means what it means let me just ask this one more since I got another little bit of a time Jesus said no one I think he was talking to pilot he said no one can take my life well he's talking to his disciples and he says no one can take my life from me I lay it down and then he says to pilot you couldn't even do what you're doing except I gave you the it was given to you from heaven I think is the way he said it he was giving you authority so some people would say some people have played while the Jews killed Jesus and then the Jews got persecuted and other people said no it was the Gentiles who put him to death how would you describe what happened what because because on the cross Jesus said don't even lay this to their charge or he said to forgive them they don't even know what they're doing so can you talk about that for a minute yeah they didn't have any clue who they were you know who they were crucifying they didn't know it was the Lord of glory they didn't understand he held all the futures he made everything ever ever made that's I'm quite sure what he was alluding to but there were he's right he had to willingly give up his life it would not have counted if they took it yeah it would not have counted it had to be a sacrifice therefore he did willingly come to the earth he did willingly get crucified he did willingly rise from the grave and those were all his choices no human on this earth could have made that happen unless it was his destiny and that's what he's saying that was always his destiny was to die for us to make a way for us to come back to heaven and have life eternal I kind of ask you this one tweak on this one too but Jesus said I have the authority speaking of himself to lay down my life and I have the authority to take it up again you know that where he said do we and then other places it says the spirit did it so how do you see that did Jesus because he was in paradise was there a moment where he where he took the authority and raised himself up how do you see that I think that happened in the third day in hell because because he was still not on the earth in his body when he was in paradise he was looking at his spiritual body that happened later on the third day in hell when he wasted hell and then he chose to exit hell okay you know the father was involved whole his fear they were they were all involved in this whole thing of what was going to happen and when it would happen that he had the right when he when he was done with that other assignment the first one was to die for us and the second was to take back our authority from Satan and so when that had been accomplished he had every right just to do it and that's what he did I love it I love it I especially love that one because of that he took it he he brought it you know and it is true that the Bible says the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead so it was that and it was himself it was kind of all of the above and I think that's probably how one can explain it they were all involved like you just said yeah so awesome awesome awesome Kat thank you very much hey tell people about revealing heaven calm and KatKerr.com what could they get at those oh revealing heaven dot com is our

Well, welcome to Elijah's Streams. It is Wednesday, February 1, but we are recording this the day before, so I'm recording this in the clock behind us. We'll say Tuesday, January 31, but you will see this in the morrow on Wednesday, so we're very excited to bring you Kat again today. She has a shorter schedule because they're in the middle of a move, so we're going to do 35 minutes and fast and furious and we'll have a good time. I had to hook myself up today and all the things are dragging in. Anyway, hope the dog doesn't bark because I didn't take care of that ahead of time, so we'll see how this goes. So pretty short show, but we'll enjoy every minute of it, so we're not going to run any spots or any other announcements. Tomorrow, by the way, is Robin Bullock, so don't miss that. So you're hearing this on Wednesday, so Thursday will be Robin Bullock. So all right, without further delay, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go. Hi, Kat. So you're in the middle of a move this week, huh? Yes, and we are so excited. I'm really excited. Awesome. Well, it's good to see you. We've got questions. We were going to jump right into questions today. Anything you wanted to say before we do that? I just want to say how much I love everybody and thank you for all the prayers you've given us over the years and even for this move, which sometimes seems almost impossible. Here we are moving tonight and tomorrow night. So we seriously are moving and we are all very excited. You know, it's a beautiful place. We know people there. We're going to meet a lot more people. I know God's going to be there too, of course. And so, yeah, we're trying to use our time as wisely as we can and our staff is actually going to come tomorrow to help. They have been bugging us forever. Please, let us help. Let us help. Yeah, we've got to take that, man. It's more talking than moving, but we're all very excited about how God has blessed us. So, yeah. And I feel that you're paying on the moving too. You know, you can have fun with friends and everything, but man, every time I've ever moved, we moved about something like 17 times in our married life. It's crazy. Wow. One time a year for the first half of the year. And then this place we've been at for 23 years now. Yeah. Yeah, so amazing. Well, listen, Kat, so you're pretty excited about the future still. Are you optimistic about how things are going? I am optimistic about everything God has said or told me and still intend to do. So, absolutely, yes, we all are. We're all very optimistic. By the way, once again, not intentionally, but we wore them. You got your teal on your hat and I got my teal on my tie and you're... Yeah. And that is heaven's color, you said, or heaven's favorite color. So, if I'm saying that right. Okay, so Kat, let me just jump in and ask you one question that I may have asked you a variant of this from time to time, but when people go to heaven, they've died and now they've graduated to heaven and you've said people, when they get to heaven, don't start comparing, don't say, how did you die? No, how did you die? They don't do that. But do... Would someone show up? Let's say they meet their parents and their parents are young like they are. They're everybody's in their 20s and 30s, I guess, looking at them. Does that... When they sit down and have coffee or whatever it is you do in heaven, do the parents say, well, tell me what happened last time we were there, you didn't even know the Lord, what happened? Do they tell that kind of story? And some say... Sometimes they do, if something's really on their heart, sure. And nobody minds at all if they ask some questions like that. I would have thought, you know, in my P-brain, I would have thought that that would be almost a sure thing that everybody would want to hear that story. But you... It sounds a little bit like it's more of an exception to the rule. Well, they actually hold meetings already when they come. Every time somebody comes new from earth, they always have huge events and everybody wants to come so they can hear what's been going on. Oh, okay. It's not gonna be any really good news, anything that's changed or maybe major things have happened that they would want to know about. That's an automatic, that part is automatic. So everybody will attend me somewhere. And then that person will be invited over and over and over again to visit people, speak places. And so, yeah, it's very exciting. Okay, very cool. So let's see, I wanted to go with this one. This one was... I've had this... Somehow I came across my desk I've had since December. It says, okay, I love Kat. I purchased and read her wonderful books. I find them very encouraging. I would like to ask her this question. The Bible says, when you try to approach the throne of God or God himself, you become very, very fearful. I have not heard Kat talking about the reverential fear of the, fear the Bible speaks of when it went in the presence of the great and almighty God. So I guess they're asking once you go to be with the Lord or once you visit heaven. I'm not quite sure where the reverential fear is that she's wanting to address. What would you say about that? I think it would probably depend on what was going on in its own home at the time. Of course, I've always, always had such holy reverence and love for the Father, for the Son, for the Holy Spirit that never changes. You never, ever get familiar with all that and not any of it. It's just overwhelming sometimes, the peace and the love that you experience when you're there. And of course, when I go many times, I'm like eight. Yeah, that's what you said. Not all viewpoint would be entirely different than most people who are already adults. So I think about what kind of fun will I have? Where will we take me? What will we do? I love him so much. I'm so excited to be here. So that would be the way that I would look at things and he wants me to. He wants me to see him that way. And there's other people who feel that way also. Well, yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. But you talked about how you've gone as an eight year old and that you usually go as an eight year old. So God sees you and you interact, I guess, as an eight year old. And you have said many times that heaven is like 50 percent worship, serious worshiping the Lord and 50 percent fun. Am I quoting you right? Is that about right? I would have to say yes. And he even says sometimes it's 50 percent fun. I'd have to make it fun. You come like a child. It makes sense. And so if you tell a story about this, I saw this or I saw that. And it makes the children or you at eight years old, when you go, giggle and laugh to see something funny, that's something that's in the heart of God to provide. Giggles and laughter and even goofiness when you're having fun, right? Yeah, you know, most everyone who comes says you must come like a child, right? And he wants us to feel that, you know, you're really all that innocent and excited and you know, you're going to have a good time. I mean, he is our father. That's who he is. That doesn't take anything away from his sovereignty, you know, his holiness, his power, the life he gives people. It doesn't change that. It's just that from my perspective and the way he's always taught me, he taught me as his daughter, he taught me as a child. So I see from their perspective. Okay, okay, cool. All right, Isaac is age 15. And he's asking this, are the world's wonders in heaven? For example, the hanging guards of Babylon, the Colosseum and so on, because we think of the seven wonders of the world, he's like, no, are those wonders in heaven? There are wonders, it says of course, those wonders in heaven. But I think it is the famous ones that we know, like, no, not those. Okay, not those. It would be like, you know, like the Valley of the Valley of the Falls would be definitely one the throne room, of course, absolutely the streets of gold, his rainbow. I mean, there's so many different things you would want to see the crystal sea, where you can swim under the water and breathe and talk and meet all the creatures there. So of course, they do actually have their list on quite sure of amazing places. Oh, yeah, the city is there. So there's so many things to do, see and learn about people have their favorites once they've been there for a while. So I would say, yes, it is sort of like, maybe more than eight. Yeah, well, you know, all right. And so if someone said, well, I will always hope that I never could go to see the Grand Canyon, I hope that I could see it in heaven. It's not like God needs to give you the Grand Canyon, he's got the grand everything. He absolutely has the grand, the grand of everything, you're right. So it's not like you missed that anymore. Won't you see what he's got there? Yeah, so good. Okay. Pam is asking this, can't you taught us that our level of spiritual authority grows as we mature in Christ? Can you tell us what a brand new Christians authority looks like? I don't, I guess, I have to interpret what she means. What does it look like? What, what would you say a brand new Christians authority like? I think maybe she's asking the moment you're saved and you're brand new. Do you walk out and possess certain authority that you didn't have? Or what does it look like if you're brand new? I think that no one can really maybe even think about that ahead of time. I think you are so undone by the glory that, you know, the glory we create for him, the splendors and the wonders that are there. You're so overwhelmed by his goodness that he gives us. But I'm brand new believer especially. They're overwhelmed really at what has been given to what Christ actually did give you, what you can operate in, how to do that, and what difference it would make here in the earth if everybody did. So yeah, there's a lot of things that there's so many things that we could talk about and discuss, but always those feelings of a new believer realize what has been paid for for them and what it's like to operate. There's like nothing is, you know, I don't think as much as I've been excited in all the years afterwards, I think the cream of the crop was the first week days and weeks after I encountered God and everything. It's hard to find that level of first love very many times. Don't get me wrong. I seek it and I do discover major encounters, but you're overwhelmed by that love. Absolutely yes. Yeah. I mean the Old Testament when I had the encounter with God 81, even the Old Testament screamed grace, grace, grace. I read it and I said, there's grace all over this thing and I had only seen bad news and that's them. All right. So Jan is asking this, when people first get to meet Jesus in heaven, what is the first most common response? Is it a joyful celebration kind of moment or a holy worship kind of moment? So what is that? I mean, yeah, so like, go ahead. Yeah, I think most of the time it's probably more of a holy thing. You are so undone knowing you're meeting actually the risen Savior, the one who gave everything for you. So I have seen most of the people probably would have that holy reverential thing that we talked about. Yeah. Unless you're a kid, then you're going to be like, yeah, besides yourself excited. Yeah. Well, you know, I, when I picture it for myself, I think, I think I'd fall on my knees or I would be, I would feel like falling and I feel like tears would come, but they would be tears of absolute unbelievable joy that we made it and he did this for me. And are there tears of joy? You know, there are tears of joy. I don't people think you never cry again in heaven. At the end of the Bible, it says every tear will be wiped away. You know, the former things, you know, more. That's the end of everything when it says, you don't cry, but crying for joy, excitement, gratefulness. Yeah, that's, it's a wonderful feeling anyway. And you absolutely love it. So yes, people still do that. Cool. Very cool. All right. Reggie's asking this, will teams of people work together or collaborate together to create things in heaven or on the new earth, like in these say, it's like groups work together on earth now to create or will, but we only create individually using our individual gifts and talents. So I guess he's likes doing things together as a group. And will we collaborate and do things together? That's the answer. We do collaborate and do things together. Of course we do. And you do learn how to create, not people, but there's creation lab where you think that's for in heaven. Okay. All kinds of things, places that we can make for each other, not talking about like our mansions or anything like that, but there we all have a creative ability because of who they are and so absolutely people get excited. Yes. And actually people say, well, what do people do? There's nothing to do there. You don't have a job or you create stuff. You hold events everywhere and everybody wants to be a part of your event. So yes, those things do happen a lot. That's good. Good. Okay. I have so many rabbit trails that I want to go to, but I'm going to jump to the next question. Elizabeth asks, how do I know if my child goes to heaven? If my child goes to heaven in her sleep, I asked this because she has a dear friend and recently that recently moved to heaven twice this week. She said she had a dream about them playing together and running. I'm not sure if I understand the question. How do I know if my child goes to heaven in her sleep? I asked this because she has a dear friend. Oh, she's saying when my child is sleeping, did she go to heaven and visit? That's what she's asking. That is a great possibility. Sure. Yeah, he takes people while they're sleeping. Okay. So they may, they say, Mom, I had this dream and I was playing. Yeah, my green kids have actually had that happen to them quite often. Okay. And those five places in heaven, like when they were four years old and they went, they didn't even know those places were there. But I mean, they have been that they ride, they rode, I think I mentioned before, you would ride lava out of a volcano. Yeah. My grandfather, my dad. Yeah, there are some of those giggles, by the way. I love the giggles. Giggles of God. Someone needs to write that book because we serve a happy, joyful, funny. By the way, of all the three, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Who's funniest if you could, if you, who's clever with their wit if you, if you had. I would have to say there's either Holy Spirit, probably or Jesus. I think Jesus definitely has the wit. I think they call Holy, well, I know they call Holy Spirit the drama king. Yeah. Right there. He loves a good joke. He really does. He loves like all kinds of drama and exciting things going on up there. So I would have to say probably more of those. The father is definitely for love. Yeah. Just dad, father, you know, I think Kim Robinson has had multiple trips together. She calls him daddy, God. You've had, I'm not asking you to say the names, your private names for God, but God has given you different names that you call him. Is that right? Yes, he had. That's a real interesting thing. And I've known several others that were like that. They say I've called them such and such and it would be something I'd never heard. But God gave, I don't know, maybe he gives different people the same ones, but that's pretty special. All right. He's just asking, how do you pray when asking God to relocate? How do you pinpoint where God wants you? I guess that means to move. I do not want to move to a place out of his will. So he's saying, she's saying, how do you pray when you're asking God to relocate you? I mean, I guess you, you want to tell him, I guess you want to ask, okay, I don't even know how to interpret that more than the question. So yeah. So what's your thoughts on that? So I think she wants to move, but she doesn't want to move to the wrong place because God didn't tell her to do or something like that. She's, she's going, you know, how do I pray? I would say, you know, you want his will done more than anything else and asked him to please give him permission to let you know. It's a good way to do that. You get, you get him permission to let you know if it's not the place he wants or maybe something different like that. I think most of the time, if it's, if it's about him and you've heard him maybe say things like that in his will towards you, I think people are so centered on pleasing him and making sure they don't step out of what he wants. So they don't mess up their life. I don't think he'd let them mess their life up if maybe they did choose something differently, but, but telling him that certainly is going to help you stay focused. And for the people that, that are not seers and they don't see all the things in the spirit like you do. I mean, can they say, Lord, I think you're telling me to go here, but if I'm wrong, would you close the door before I absolutely ask you to do that. You absolutely could do that. It's a good idea. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. All right. Shonda, Shonda, I must be Shonda. How do you release the anointing when you're on a telephone call? How would you do it if they, if they call you and you want to release the anointing? I'm sure she's meeting on the other person on the other end. So yeah, I would just hold my phone and I would just say it, or I would do it before I call them or he knew that I was going to call their number. I would say I released this, the anointing into this phone call when they pick it up, it'll go right into them. Okay. Okay. All right. Jill, let's see. This is partially cut off. Let me make sure I can read the whole thing. Okay. Jill says, as a seer, when I'm in church, I often see huge angels that stand between the first front, front seats and rows in front of the podium where the pastor preaches. It is always in the same position no matter what church. The angel is so big that his head is outside the roof. I didn't, I didn't notice an angel where we were going to church now until the last couple of weeks. Can you speak of what you know about those angels? I guess she's wanted to know if, if that's identifiable or something you've seen? I've seen angels 2,000 feet high, probably even higher than that in heaven. So just to what every side imagine is there. And I don't know that typically it's certain, you know, a tribe of angels or something like that. I just know that they do have many different sizes of angels. Do you, this is never a question that has never been popped to my head, but if you've seen 2,000 foot angels and you've seen angels that are probably roughly your size. Yes. So are massively tall angels by definition massively more powerful? Is that what the big means or what would you say? Possibly, but maybe possibly not. It's just that God loved making different types of angels or the hosts and he practiced well at doing that. Okay. Cool. All right. Cheryl is asking this question. She goes, I've heard you speak about how our loved ones in heaven can go to a portal on special days for us and sing happy birthday. For example, is the reverse true? My husband went to heaven less than two years ago. Can I sing happy birthday to him on his special day and have him hear me singing it? I'm sure that you could. I know that I have sung different things like to my father, like on Father's Day or something like that. I know that sounds odd, but I do really love my dad and a great relationship with him. And yes, and I know for a fact that Father has said you can sing what you'd like to them and he'll make sure they hear it. Yeah. Now I've said, this is maybe years past, but I've, you know, before I heard that you maybe can speak directly in there. They hear it in the spirit realm or something. However, but I've said, Lord, would you give my dad this message to tell him like, and I've said, like one time I said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I don't even know that if that's appropriate thing because he's in bliss. Why would he need to hear that? But that's, that would be my question. What kind of things can you send as a messenger or ask God to set an angel and tell your dad, you know, can you say something like that? Tell him I forgive him. You mean on earth or in heaven? No, I'm saying, you know, he's in heaven now and you know that when he left, he left a mess like that was the case with my dad. And if I would have said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I mean, that was years past, but what do you think about that? You just say, no, no, don't go there because he's already happy. He doesn't need that. I think that I don't think I would mind you saying that and all of somebody. I think it would be all right to say that. Even though they wouldn't still have to hear it. Yeah, because they already, yeah, I hear you. It's not like his soul needs to be unburdened for what he did. So it's just words of love, I think. Yeah. Okay. Dolores is asking this, do regular common people from different generations mingle with one another? For example, would an auto executive that went to heaven in 2022 mingle with the poor widow from Elijah's days, would they have things of interest to talk to? I think anyone who you would meet there would have, there's almost everybody's going to have something that they would love to talk to about you to you or with you. And you would find it very fascinating. So people still love to have conversations. They like to reason together, talk together. They love to share things. I mean, that never stops happening. Not here on earth or in heaven. Well, and then is there the sense that throughout eternity or as long as you're on heaven, one day, it's everyone's going to be on new earth. But as long as you're in heaven, are people making new friends all the time? Or do they kind of establish their friendship thing and their friends hang? Oh, they make new friendships all the time, no matter where they go. They do. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, Tracy. Oh, this, this does occur to me to ask this question because you've talked because we said a minute ago about the portals in heaven. And you know, your loved ones can look down on special occasions. Can't with that being possible, could someone, this is probably a dorky question, but because someone say, hey, they should do her girlfriend from earth and now they're all both in heaven together. And he says, come on to the portal. I want to, it's my daughter's birthday. I want to say, I want to see them and come and see where my daughter, what my daughter's up to. Could they do something like that? Or is it only for personal family? You know what I mean? I think a lot is for family, but I think you could, there's people who would push doing anything or talking about anything to anybody if they could there. So yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of these questions are questions that you don't, it's not like you walk around knowing the answers to all these deep questions, but yeah. Yeah. Okay. Tracy's asking this, I'm a worship dancer. Can you elaborate a little more on what happens when we minister and dance? And this seems like it's a common question. People want to know when I do this on earth, what's it, what's happening? What is it accomplishing is, I think, is what she's saying. What happens when I dance? I mean, that could go a bunch of directions. What is the Lord doing? What's happening in the spirit realm? I mean, is, would you have any thoughts? Because you're a seer. Do you see people dance and then see things happening because of it? I see a lot of mostly music. Of course, I do see some dance. And sometimes you dance, you're not even on the floor, like in the throne room, they have a lot of dance and pageantry and stuff in there going on. It's absolutely beautiful. And of course, there's ways that you collect things as you dance. And then it's represented in some other way in heaven, like you create artwork or paintings by your dance. Even though it is with dance, not with your paintings, it's just something that's created as something to remember that about. Okay. And back for those that are dancing on earth, when you've seen people with the pageantry that God loves on the earth and they're waving their flags and they're dancing, does it affect the angels around them when they do that? Is something being triggered in a good way when they dance? And I think that's what she's trying to get at. Do angels respond? Does our blessings drop down that we don't see? What is the dance accomplished? Or is it just dance? I know dance is considered a high praise. It even says that it's in the Bible. And so yes, even some of the hosts are absolutely amazed and really love the warfare that takes place as a dancer. When you dance, like in the spirit about things, so that is definitely something that takes place. And all three of my daughters are dancers. They would have to be wore in dance in the spirit for people to be healed, for messages to be sent to be received. And so I would definitely know whether it's dance, whether it's music. A lot of things are created in the spirit. Okay, awesome. Sarah is asking this, are there, you've seen gemstones in heaven, and I think I've heard you talk about the crystal sea and stuff. She says, is there gemstone art in heaven that resembles stained glass? Have you seen? Absolutely, yes. A lot of people have those in their home there. Really? Especially if people were artisans in that. My grandfather made stained glass wonders. Okay. He's got some he's made in heaven. Wow, very cool. And I mean, you know, it makes me wonder, because you said that guy will put favorite pictures of yours that are on earth, or you'll show up at your mansion and there it's hanging. And I'm curious if God would do the same thing. Not that you would know the answer to this, but that if you if someone made stained glass on earth, they show up and God said, this is one that you made. I really, especially loved, I kept it. And here's it. That was that sound like something he might do just because that's who he is. I think he probably would. If people gave him any high gifts, he's going to love him anyway. Yeah. And even he has some favorite things that he likes, anything he may with life with colors, things like that. Whether you're young or not young, he loves people when they give him gifts. Cool. All right. Let me see. We're five minutes out here. We got time for a few more questions here. George is asking, when some people are dying, they reach out or call for their family members who have died before them. They act as though their family members are right there in the room with them. Do you know, do they really see their loved ones and do they come? I guess they're asking, do their loved ones come to help with their transition to heaven? Can you share about that? I mean, I have no idea. I think sometimes they do. I do know for a fact that some people have seen their family members, like maybe within a week of passing or something. I think it's something that God just does to encourage people. And so I just know that it does happen. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Rachel's saying, when we are reunited with our loved ones that are already in heaven, to them, will it feel like it's been a long time since they've seen this? Or will it only feel like seconds or days since they've seen us? I think it's just seconds. Really? Oh, yeah. They don't miss someone being gone 30 years or something like that. All they can think about is can't wait to see them again when they see them. And so for them, you've only been gone for a short time. Okay. Wow. Okay. And Andrew's asking, when and why were the host, Michael's army created, was it after Satan's treason, specifically to deal with him or was it actually before Satan's treason? In other words, you've made it very clear that the only reason there's an army is not to protect heaven. God doesn't need an army to protect heaven. So when do you know when the army was created? Was it after the fall of Satan? I think the army was been around a very long time. They even wondered why they were created one time. Really? To fight. Yeah, they were there for the enemy, for who became an enemy. So maybe they only understood what they were being trained up for when that fall happened. Yeah. They were taught war and they had to run maneuvers and do all kinds of stuff like that. Really? And that one was how loose for a fallen heaven. They knew who their enemy was. Interesting. All right. Here's another question about the Michael, the captain of the warrior angels. Is it Martha's asking, I believe the angel Michael is the captain of the warrior angels and Gabriel is the messenger angels. Are there other types of angels with specific purposes? I'm guessing there'd be lots of them with specific purposes. There are so many, I cannot number them. There's many, many, many, many. There's ones who are couriers, of course, the scribes, the Bible talks about them, helper angels that help all over heaven doing things like that. Of course, there are the hosts of heaven. There's ones who serve in different places and who keep the treasures shined up and all kinds of things like that. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It makes sense that he might even have thousands of different kinds of angels, right? For categories that we've never even thought about. So, yeah. Man, just that's right. Me, A, N, G, S. Does God really cast out your sins into the sea of forgetfulness? If you brought up your past, would he not know of it? I think most of the time he wouldn't because he does cast it there and he's not going to think about it. I tell people, stop reminding him of your sins. He won't know what you're talking about if you've repented. Yeah, boy. I could have used that understanding years ago when I kept repending over and over and over and over to make sure I got it right. He's probably saying, would you stop repending? Okay. Jamelia, lots of interesting names today. Jamelia, have you seen inside of the courtrooms in heaven? What's happening in there? What do they look like? Do they look like a courtroom on earth? The judge sits on the bench up there high and then there's a defense in both sides? I have absolutely been to the courtroom in heaven. Actually, there's more than one. I guess outside, not outside of heaven, but in the atmosphere of heaven, it's invisible. I know this sounds crazy. You can actually see to it. You can see that it's there. Then of course, it's a courtroom that's actually in heaven. Yes, I've seen both. Like anything else, God sits as judge. Jesus is our lawyer and Satan gets hauled up there about different things sometimes. Other things get harder, but justice does take place in those courtrooms. So it does look like a courtroom as we would know it. Well, they have one that looks very supernatural. They do have one that looks like what you would call a courtroom, maybe not exactly like that. So they're both different than I've seen. Okay. All right. Here's the last question here. Natalie is asking, what is your favorite thing about Jesus that you would like to describe? What's your favorite thing about? Of course, you'd have thousands of things, but what stands out to you? I think his eyes. I think his eyes are so amazing. I never get tired of whenever I'm around him. I always want to look at his eyes. They're beautiful, very beautiful. But he also does have a, I almost want to say a cynic sense of humor. I mean, he was very bold about the things he said on the earth to those who were not doing right. Like one of my favorite ones is, are you you're a white and sepulchral school of dead men's bones? Yeah. You thought of the religious hierarchy. I think both of those probably, those two things are probably my very favorite thing about it. And he holds both of those at the same time. He, you know, he's got that serious side and then the clever fun side. Yeah. So good. So good. Well, Kat, that's our time. We need to let you get to your moving and rest in between and all of that. So I appreciate it very much. We'll spend more time the next time talking about revealing heaven.com, but we're going to revealing the heaven.com to see her, to get her books and all that. And there it is. Katcur.com is where you can support her. The only place you can support her is online because she doesn't ask for money in any other way. A lot of people keep trying to pretend to be her. So all right. Thanks so much, Kat. Tomorrow, everybody is Robin Bullock. We're looking very much forward to that. When you see Robin Bullock, he almost, I think he always has that pin that you created. It says, I don't do demons. He wears that on his coat and everywhere he goes. So it's a, so that that'll be him right there after people see this. Yeah. Thank you very much. We love you. Bless you. Have a good time with your staffs. We'll see you again soon. Okay. See you later then. Bye.

Happy, I started to say Tuesday because we're recording this on Tuesday. Happy Wednesday for those of you watching this live for you. It is Wednesday, February 8. We're recording this at 3.20 in the afternoon on February 7 to get the sense we're recording Cat. Sometimes her schedule works better for us to record in the afternoon before. Most of the time these days that helps it work out better for everyone. So all right, well, welcome to the broadcast and a quick reminder that we tomorrow's for you tomorrow Thursday is Mel Kay. We haven't had her on for a while and she's going to give us an update on what's going on out there. So I love her very much. She's a great patriot in the patriot movement. She's that all the reawakened American thing. She's an absolute God of fear and she loves us and we love her. So that is Thursday tomorrow for you. We'll ask you some of the latest updates. So we're going to bring in Cat here in just a moment, but before we do that, here's a quick reminder about the wells we're digging. Thank you. I love that music, I like the beat to it too, and plus the whole Irish feeling of it, it's a great, here's a big word juxtaposition with the music and you're seeing the, I don't know whether it's called the bush or whatever you call it in the villages of Uganda, very primitive, poverty-stricken by any standard that we have, and they may not consider themselves poverty-stricken at all, I don't know how that is, and I'll have to learn more about that one day, but they sure need the water, they surely need the water, so we thank you for your help on that. Alright, time to watch for Kat and Steve on Wednesday, so here we go with Kat. Well good afternoon, I guess it is afternoon, it's actually like, we're taping this, so it's like 6.20 in the evening, your time isn't it? I think so. Yeah, you'll have to ask Jen that, I never know what time it is. You went to bed, you went to bed at, usually you go to bed at 6, right, because you're up all night, are you still up all night? I haven't been up since 4am. Oh, you've been up since 4, that's really unlike you, you don't get up that early. Not really, I'm really involved in doing something, you know, than I am. Well good to see you, well we've got some questions, oh I forgot to check with you before the program, if there's anything you had to share before we got into questions. I think Robin shared so much the other day, probably not except that we are still busy moving and we're very excited about it, but I really wanted to give the time since I didn't have a whole hour today to let people ask questions. Okay, alright, the first one is going to come from me, in fact we were talking about that. I won't bless the people though, let me go ahead and blow it up. Okay, are we on? Okay, yeah, so this is from me and so our staff was talking about prayer in one of them, so why don't you ask Kat what it's like for you. I think we asked you one time, in this big recollection we said, what's prayer like for you and I think you said, in the recesses of my memory here, something about yours was more about decrees, but don't let me put words in it, what is prayer like for you? Yeah, well there's many different types of things you can call prayer or that is called prayer even in heaven. Ruling is something, ruling is what's in the spirit realm, it's you taking authority and dominion and by the things that you either say that God is doing because He's told you or things that you have wanted yourself to release into the spirit realm to make a difference in people's lives. The other thing is called declaring and decreeing which a lot of people I've heard, you know what you dare to declare and decree shall be established unto you, that is my number one way I pray because I'm trying to establish usually something very specific, something God had asked me to take authority over, something He's asked me to make decrees about and so that is my favorite way to pray. And I still, another thing is talking to God, just having a language with Him is also partly prayer and I know God had said, you know, you pray all the time because you talk to me all the time, that's what He says to me, that's what the Bible says to me. Oh really? Yeah. He said, you pray all the time because you talk to me all the time, that's really instructive right there. Yes, it is and we should all have that much time and attention to give to Him but absolutely declaring and decreeing is the number one way I pray. Taking authority, taking great authority, having spent time with the Father or the Son, discussing things that they have going on on the earth right now, what is about to happen on the earth, things like that and then He'll say go make decrees over that and so that's what they do, I do a lot of that. Also for family members, I'll declare and decree over their lives things that they need either from heaven or that they're involved in working on this earth, you know, for the Father. I wanted to ask you a question about, you know, there's a scripture that says resist the devil, it's right in there, agree with God and there was that phrase, agree with God, there's so many things we could agree with God and I had something happen to me the other day and I'll give you an example, it's like I'm praying for this person that's in need so I said Lord, and this is not the exact one but it's kind of close to Lord and I know He's like your beloved Son, this one I'm praying that I have in my heart and I know you and Him are friends and I agree with you that you would never, ever cause harm to Him and I know you and I agree on this and I know that if anyone feels empathy for what he's going through, it would be you and I just want you to know I agree with you and that was kind of like a non-prayer prayer because I was explaining the need, He knew the need I was talking about but I was explaining it in agreement, what are your thoughts about something like that? I think for sure that would be a conversation, you know, God does take the time to even meet even myself about things that people are going through and things to let them know that I care about, He cares about, things like that so there are other types of conversation that you wouldn't necessarily specifically call prayer and I think that's because we show that we love people, we really care about people and our empathy goes along with them and whatever they're going through and the Father absolutely adores and loves people who, you know, it's not His plan to put us through things no matter what it looks like sometimes especially these last couple years that He is delighted to see the heart of people that care and I think it's so important for us to have kindness and care about people, you know, sometimes we get so caught up in our own world or our own life, we forget sometimes there are others out there who do need a kind word, an encouraging word, maybe a letter written to them or something letting them know someone is here with you, we've got your back, you know, we care about you so certainly there's all different kinds of conversation you could have in any way that some people may say well I didn't even think of that as prayer but anytime we love people it's going to touch the heart of the Father. Wow, yeah, you know our old school thinking for lack of a better description our old school thinking would be they would say and there's nothing wrong with this but they'd say what did you do in your quiet time or did you have your quiet time because if you don't put in time and I understand that very much but it kind of came off as a legalistic thing from time to time if someone would say did you have your quiet time it's a little bit freeing to me to have you say even if you're showing kindness even if you're talking to the Lord I was trying to figure out who, remind, be reminded who was this famous person of prayer that said I have hardly ever prayed for more than five minutes maybe he said fifteen minutes I don't know it's fine it was like either five or fifteen so I'll say five I've never prayed longer than five minutes but I've never gotten more than five minutes without praying it was something like that it was probably fifteen can let me ask you so some people have been taught now there's the scripture this is you know we're supposed to give him our our petitions with thanksgiving let your let your petitions or prayers be known to God in the in the prayer of thanksgiving all that so are there people who do who you would say get too much into petition and not enough in other things what would you say how would you exhort someone to pray I like do some people say Lord I need this and Lord help me with that or help my family is it too much is too much petition I think it depends on the person himself I guess most people would would would some people just gonna ask for I guess whatever they're having issues with or whatever they're thinking about or wondering if something will work some people can't kind of not sure about making up their minds I think and so sometimes they may ask more than other people would but I just I love people who declare declare and decree us that you really are serious about getting something done for God and making sure that petitions petitions are being heard maybe not even just your petitions it might be others petitions you know they're going to something like we were kind of just talking about a minute ago I don't think God ever gets tired of hearing anybody's petitions at all if you ask me personally I don't think you know I totally was asking that so I so yeah I totally was so if that if that if too much is you're not worried about too many petitions then oh no I don't think so no no no sometimes you wish people would ask more well that's true too doesn't he says you have not because you ask not your life be that side of that okay so all right well I'm gonna ask you a question from Benny age 12 so he says are the skill levels of all people the same in heaven like are they all the same strong they're just as strong they're just as fast speed he seems to be asking about athletic by the question he mentioned strength and speed is everybody the same or some stronger and some faster I don't think everybody is the same at all I think everybody is still at different levels you know if you pursue something of course you're gonna know more than someone who never had before you do have the ability to learn new skills all the time in heaven or improve the skills that you have in heaven but no I don't think everybody is at the same level that's good to hear yeah in fact that the way you answer boring to say why bother to go to something if everybody is the same right well that's true oh I lost I was gonna ask a follow-up but I lost it okay Jack age nine okay he he wants to know can I transform into things in heaven like an animal or a character he wants to know if he can transform it I assume this is like when they're playing around or something there are places in heaven they can go that is for a play area that yes you can actually change you can be smaller can be larger I think that you can become a cartoon in certain areas and then you play out cartoons with your friends you actually are in the cartoon so he's absolutely right and I you said in certain places are there because it sounds like a what would be a term it sounds like a fun zone or a fun village or or something there are places that usually in the amusement park there's a lot of things going on similar to that they have all kinds of things that you can do you can travel different ways like in bubbles you can go up to different places where is it the play places in the sky I know it sounds crazy but it's heaven yeah yeah it's very different and when you go there you expect some of those things to happen well I gotta ask you when a lady wrote to me I didn't respond to her today because I didn't know how to respond because I don't have an answer for everybody's question but she wrote she's very nice about it but she says but I'm quite certain there's no cotton candy in heaven so apparently she heard that you had said there was cotton candy in heaven and I might my thing would have been if I'd written there what what would prevent God from giving a delicious cotton candy that would be nothing yeah so I'm talking to people about the funness the giddiness the laughter the hilarity of God because we got the holy thing we've been taught I don't know we don't have it down but we've been taught the holy side we have not been taught the fun side I mean what would you like to tell people to say there for the first time I would say the same thing that the father said to me if he didn't make fun places in heaven he'd be in trouble with all those kids coming home I mean that's a perfect like a little child the Bible is clear about that you come with the heart of a child because you're going to have adventures you're going to have fun and the father wants you to have that why wouldn't he he is your father so of course he planned different things to do even adventures for you to do things to learn different places to go to learn them you can visit rodeos you already know about the amusement park there's so many places in heaven you go even beautiful places out outside parks all kinds of things dinosaur park you know people get up get off on that but you know you're not God and I can tell you when he is a father a loving father he's going to give everything he can do bless his children and that's why he's he wants you to expect it yes why what do you think if you do with all these millions of children coming home to heaven that's really really good and you know the the the thing about it is not only millions maybe there's even billions because from the beginning of time billions well because from the beginning of time children have been have lost their lives when they were little you know I have never asked you this question but I want to ask you this question there were people that perished in the flood and some among those cats surely there would have been children throughout whatever the earth was in those days when when those children perish in the flood and they were almost babies or very very young children do you expect to see those children in heaven one day of course I do absolutely I would they were innocent children why would they not go to heaven the father's been adamant about that from the from the very beginning he would talk to me about that I expected all children to go to heaven yeah they didn't do anything wrong right they do have an opportunity to receive Christ in heaven if they want to and they'll actually come to his throne and bring him flowers and say they receive him they don't necessarily have to do that to be in heaven but they want to do it well it wouldn't that almost by default if they went to heaven wouldn't they I can't imagine someone saying as a child no I don't want to receive Christ right anybody they love him they so fall in love yeah so I think it's such a blessing for the father to allow them to do that so they do have they have a big event where they're invited to sit on usually on the throne of the father and then Jesus will come and he will present himself there and Jesus and he will ask Jesus to be received as his savior okay good good good good okay say that we've got three children's questions today say love my granddaughter my granddaughter's name is say that but that's what he said they may say pronounce a seal that but say that or see the age eight is asking cat are there singing squirrels and talking flowers in heaven that she's eight years old she wants another singing squirrels and talking flowers I have seen both while I was in heaven so I can adamantly tell you absolutely yes the flowers have faces yes they sing home meadows sing sometimes and yes squirrels do not just squirrels most of the creatures are most of the what you would call an animal especially all your pets they all talk they talk and then there is some there's a whole group of squirrels that I know and I don't know why and I haven't laughed out for the so many times I don't care people love it there are a group of squirrels that actually are called greeters GR TERS and when someone comes home to heaven they will actually go in this group and they will actually sing and dance for the people welcoming them to heaven I can imagine some maybe some older type stuffy person and here they are opening the door and here's this group of squirrels ready to sing and dance they have to stop having pain I'm not kidding the Holy Spirit does does make sure it all happens and so if there's something you don't like you'll change when you get there that's you know that's actually the mouthful right there and he said because I know but you know what because when I if you had the further okay I'm 67 for the first 50 years of my life I could never have received most of that that you're saying because I would have I don't know what I would have thought would be wrong with that I was just taught that heaven is holy and we're going to worship him and no I would have said no we're probably not going to just sit on the cloud but I didn't have a replacement for that activity I just didn't believe it I had someone wrote I saw it written and someone said there won't be the reason we know that there won't be this is a kind of a quote the reason we know there won't be amusement parks and heaven that there are none is because the elements it's because that's on earth and the elements on the earth will be burned up with fervent heat so therefore we know amusement parks won't be in heaven they were there first before the earth was even made about time or what's going on earth are you kidding it's on the earth because it is in heaven see I want you to say that because I knew that was your answer because I've come to learn that and it makes sense it's logical you know everything about the river of life well we're on the earth so why did they burn I mean the thing about is when I saw that I thought well that would mean if you followed that logic then that would mean since we have mansions on the earth and that earth is going to burn up there can be no mansions in heaven and since we have roads on the earth to drive vehicles there can be no roads or vehicles of any kind in heaven and you pretty soon you you have God with his hands up say what can I do you you've made all these things illegal for me to have in heaven it's kind of crazy all right well that's good news cat I'm glad you're here to bring the good news all right I like this question K I don't know how old but she says does God have any particular reason reason when he sends twins triplets or whatever to be born does he have a reason I'm not quite sure what she means I don't know that he has a reason other than he just he loves seeing all three of them I guess or both of them or whatever but I don't know of any certain reason that he would send since he sends those from heaven and he tells them this is your assignment which we you know we don't know now but he he gives an assignment if he's gonna send triplets he would probably does this make sense he would probably get these three children together and say you're gonna be triplets in about a minute from now what does he he tells them about their life is going to be and then he sends them or what I think there's a whole lot of stuff that goes on with all that there are times sometimes he'll actually mention it to people before they before they're born you know while they're still living in him in him he'll let them know the their purpose even he'll let them know sometimes who he's chosen for them all kinds of things go on so they'll be really hard to say but he does share with them most of the time not necessarily whenever when they'll be born but that they will be born together as a family sometimes he does do that okay all right now Matt is asking this this is it sounds like my kind of questions I would be asking you says do people look back on their earthly life fondly from heaven so they've gone to heaven do they look back and think of you know I you could say not like the good old days because they're in the good old days now in heaven but do they look back and say remember when we did this to their friend remember when we went to the creek and we all went so visit that kind of fond memories from heaven I think sometimes that they can kind of remember being with certain people maybe not younger maybe a little older they do I think depending on how close also that you got to the Lord he himself may actually show you oh really oh yeah yeah he'll show you he's shown me different people he's shown me different people that I knew before I came to the earth and I've seen myself sitting in his hand quite a few times explaining to me some of the things I would be doing of course I didn't remember them until much later on so sometimes he does do that but it really depends on the relationship you pursue with him especially the Lord that he will share things with you from your past past meaning before time yeah okay BT BT before time BT BT alright here is okay I don't know how specifically the answer you'd answer this but I'll throw you the question Sarah is asking in light of all the exposures coming from those caught up in sex trafficking how do we pray for all the victims being delivered in this horrendous experience so I don't know how would you tell them to pray for the victims that are being delivered is that that's what their question is well there is something they can do if they knew about it and that was the losing of their soul oh you can you can because God has not disordained it that way but he created that way and it was a soul checkup it's all about your soul the keys to the kingdom which you bind others will be bound in heaven which you loose and it will be loose in heaven meaning if let's say it was a horrible encounter like we're talking about something like that and then someone they met who was adapted being a soul doctor they could share with them if they lose those things and named him by name and then they lose them out of their soul and Jesus name Jesus will come and take them like they were never there and I teach that actually haven't done it well but I actually would teach that to different leaders of different groups that want to do that especially for young people who are rescued from drugs and those things like that and they cried it they were so rejoiced because they said it would take them a year to work with a group or a person and in this way in three minutes they have loose everything in their soul that ever was there that the devil put there and I you know let's camp there for a minute we've got about ten minutes left here but let's see we're going to keep it to 40 minutes or so today so someone is rescued and if you could see their soul and I don't know as a seer if you can see that cap but but let's say that you just know okay so you see their soul and let's say it's full what do you see because that was one of the questions what do you see first of all it depends on which person or type of person you're talking about I see all kinds of things I can see people who have gone to suffering I can see people who have been abused if someone is abused they'll have like you know you've heard people say we're gonna tie the knot these are all about relationships this is not like the twisted rope hanging out of you somewhere I'm not saying that this sort of right you knew that they had some kind of negative relationship in their life somewhere because that's what I see therefore I know they need healing for that and in the past I would just pray and declare over them now I actually will go up to them and talk to them and I'll teach them how they can be free from that in Jesus name the God never intended you to go through those things that was not his purpose there's a devil in this world I hate everybody and whatever you can steal from your destiny the point of the devil to mess with people in that is he wants to steal their destiny and that's one of the ways that he does it is by the abuse no matter what kind of abuse that is that they have to go through but I remember the the time that the father showed up and showed up in my room he said I'm going to show you and he said I will show you he said after I show you this people will know how in minutes to lose everything out of their soul and they'll never suffer from it again wow this will help every single believer accelerate their life into victory because I don't have someone you have three months three years ten years trying to get healed from stuff that was done to them wrongfully he said if they follow these instructions it's simply the keys to the kingdom which everybody doesn't always understand none of those different ways people can use those keys to the kingdom he said but I'm talking about what you lose on earth you lose from heaven you lose from heaven so what you lose from your soul that was done to you on earth that was wrong heaven will come and lose it from your soul completely and it will be like it never existed if you want to bind the things of god and then we were growing up we were always hot to bind the devil yeah are you uh there's something much better than binding that it's binding the love of god the life of god the plans of god the will of god his joy his celebration his expectation you can choose with your will to bind those things to your soul and no one can ever take them away from you and you will feel completely different so these are things taught to me by the father and I remember it was out it was ours earth time because I remember glancing at my clock and then he took me and he would be taking me back and forth showing me things on the earth and showing me how people got healed it was really uh quite a drawn-up process and I have helped so many people and we actually help people become soul doctors that's what god calls me a soul doctor I heard you use that a minute ago I hadn't heard that term before but in other words it it would be like you don't have to become a licensed uh professional counselor you can become a soul doctor you're right practice what god says took me into the future and I saw down the hallways of businesses athletic places um it didn't matter where it was churches churches and I would see a doorway that said soul doctrine it had a little sign up outside and people would go in the air to get like sort of like counseling or healing or being made whole when they're sold it was quite fascinating so yes there are things that you can do to help one another how to be free from all that garbage and I mean the list was like so long and it didn't matter what it was that the people had wanted to lose from their soul if they were involved in it if their family was involved in it if situations that happened to them every one of those could be lose from your soul drugs you know all kinds of all kinds of things you would choose to lose them from your soul can use uh I felt to ask you this while you were talking because you were talking about a person could lose it from their own soul by by doing what you've taught them to do so this is what this is kind of the yucky question so there's women watching right now who have been raped and they never got delivered from the trauma of that rape or the or the horrible memories of it men too because a man can be raped because he has a child okay how would you walk a woman right through what would she say right now in her prayer time how would she use her words to to be her own soul doctor if I could put that right I would just say to her that God actually I think even better than that is I should tell you a real situation that happened okay okay um one of the first times I ever got to use that I had just been with a father maybe weeks later I was in New Jersey I was invited by a pastor and his wife and her two sons and he went in the grocery store to get some things from my room your snacks and stuff and she said I've got it you were sent here for me this is a real story you were sent here for me and I know in the next couple minutes you can help me be free because I knew that the Lord would help me get free she said I have been been through some of the worst torments of um violence violent torments night and day before I was married three times and and to the wrong same person not the same person same kind of person and she said I can't stand it anymore I thought God I've got to be free of this I don't want the nightmares I don't want the torments my kids were present with some of these happened and so they've gone through these same things what can we do to be free right now and in three minutes I told her do you know what the word says about binding and losing she said well binding and losing you know you mean yes I said yes that what you choose to lose from your soul that was done to you will be loosed from heaven itself heaven will come down pull it out of your soul completely and it will be like you never experienced it before she said show me right now my husband's still in there show me now right now and so I let her through it you know um and she she gave her name she said uh father in Jesus name I'm choosing to lose from my soul all the violent activities the violent things I've been that I was hurt with that I had to stand and see that my kids had to stand and see I'm fed up with it I'm tired of the devil abusing me and I'm not going through this life anymore so I choose with my own will to lose it in Jesus name right now forever and ever amen and then this light came on her face really I have never ever seen and this light came I mean I was overwhelmed I mean I knew it would work she sat there and she started crying a laugh and she goes she said some minute she goes it's gone I mean it's gone I mean in three minutes it's gone it's literally gone it's like I never had it before I I can't even remember some of the actions she goes I I've got to do this with my two boys before you even go back can you please do the same thing with them they were like the like 10 and uh 15 something like that or 17 something like that I said of course of course she said all I can do is laugh now before I couldn't even stand to think about going to bed at night her husband knows that was sort of goes what's wrong she goes I'm the happiest person in the world wow she worked and so yeah the third night she brought them and I led them to the same thing and I saw her 10 years later she said do you know what that stuff has never come back you're still filled with joy because after that I taught her how to bind the joy the Lord God's love his his his presence you know his purposes for your life his celebration and she said we're still filled with that stuff she said I am so grateful and you should I've helped so many people through that out of their life it is really really that's and they have lose they have people have lose some drug addiction alcohol all kinds of things some things they're like even witchcraft they have lose that from their soul and and because they were repentant first and then they lose it from the soul so I have to say one of the great and the father said this may be one of the greatest things I ever show you and he was right so he calls me soul doctor all the time I love that term too I this first time I heard you use it but wow that's so powerful yeah I mean his body can people can be sick in their body and still be happy if you're sick in your soul you have no life at all wow this may be the most this is the most important thing we did today and we've even like kids we've let kids do that too that have been abused but the teenager place in Orlando that camp that they have to go to for a year they have me come down and I taught every single one of the leaders and the teachers how to do that and he said they'd never been the same again and now instead of having all those weeks and months to trust the person who used to be with that person it takes a few minutes and they're free wow wow cat that is simply amazing and I've heard you talk on this a lot this was especially poignant if I guess you know uh because people you know I've heard it and I I've done lots and lots and lots of self you know losing yeah I feel like I got it at a new level today of understanding even though I heard these words before I feel like it went even deeper this time so personally I think I've received benefit from this but I know that people watching this is very important I'm sure there will be many many many people Steve they will never be the same again after this broadcast we are going to print mini booklets we actually are going to print mini booklets m-i-n-i mini booklets that people can order in bunches and stuff like that they can even hand out to people and then eventually we'll probably print a book and give the whole story about how the father came how he taught me all the places he took me and my daughter finally came to the door I think it had been almost four hours I had locked myself in my room my older daughter and she goes mom can I please come in I went I've just been with the father she goes can I please come in come down my bed and I showed she was the first one I told her all about that and she she now of course she's married she's got kids and she helps people by being a soul doctor wow amazing cat wow cat thank you so much very very very important broadcast today so good so good okay uh while you have it here uh let's point out revealing heaven.com is on the screen uh people can buy your books there and other materials right yes but I want to share one more thing the Holy Spirit oh please oh go for it yes one more story okay that my one sister who has had a wildlife I'm telling you she was um my one sister not Jen one of my other sisters you know I have like seven and one of them had gone through a lot of stuff in her life and she was younger she was kidnapped she was found back she went through all kinds of things and then God God got so ahold of her and uh she's a smart person she tells me if you know anything or think of anything or God wants me to have something you call me grow up and make sure I get it and so uh she called me one time and I think this is one of the times when she was going through stuff she goes I've I've had someone call me on the phone wanting to commit suicide because the rotten boyfriend that's what she called him broke up with her and ditched her and she said she was so heartbroken she couldn't stand to live and her her friend was right her friend was not a Christian this is a while uh and I and I said so what is she goes I've heard you talk about a soul doctor before would you mind if I call my friend to get her on the phone and you lead her through that because I don't want to see her take her life and I said you know I well so she did I told her about Jesus Christ and she said she knew that she had knew who the Lord was I said did you know he can make you completely whole so you don't need your boyfriend you don't really need that person if somebody loved you they wouldn't have dumped you ditched you and used you like that and she said I'm willing because if I don't do something I'm I'm not gonna live and so I told her about the love of God his sacrifice you know the full story of it and so she received crisis or savior and then she lose that guy out of her soul by name never to run after him again never to be heartbroken again and the Lord came and took that whole grief suicidal thoughts out of out of her mind and she never committed suicide wow amazing wow wow I didn't know it's gonna be this good and this important okay I was starting to mention revealing heaven.com so please go to there to see what materials in the books that cat has talk without folks about what's that KatKerr.com but KatKerr.com is what I think the father calls a spiritual platform whatever he wants to say no matter when it is he gives it to me to say I will put it on there there's all kinds of videos self-help videos learning videos training videos that's what a lot of it is some of them are interviews I've had with known people which I really enjoyed having those interviews we are in the midst of updating both of our websites but KatKerr.com will always be the one that we we put a lot of emphasis on training that the father has given or things that you can do yourself by helping people you don't have to be a brilliant you know you don't have to know everything there is to know it's your heart for love for want of caring with people and it is also the only place in the in the cosmos that you can give online there is no other place there's no other no other website that where you can go to do that we did that on purpose because people would try to use you if you're known you know and they would send things to people

(Times are under actual times by a few minutes) All right, time to bring in Kat Kerr. So here's Wednesdays with Kat and Steve, here we go. Kat, we missed you. We missed you, we missed you. Hey, hey, y'all. I hope you're doing well, I know you have one kind of big announcement. Maybe people would consider it a very big announcement, there's a change in the wind. So tell people about what we're changing up right now. I wanted you to put it in your words and then I'll fill in the blanks if there's anything else to fill in. The change up for Israel or the change up for the scheduling? Either way, both announcements, Kat. Okay, all right, well, yeah, we're going to do a slight scheduling change. As you all know, I finally got to move, which took almost a year. Just their offices packed up, they were put in storage, because if you didn't know, we were living in our home and that was our offices, which was a major, major thing. It was for several years, I don't know, six, seven, eight years that we didn't actually have a home, we lived in our offices. And then all the equipment, you know, all of the staff, I mean, all of the scheduling, all of the things going on, besides my studio being there, we actually had our real offices there until finally we got everything separated. I think we had been there for 17 years, it's a long time to be in a place. It was a wonderful place, God's presence was so powerful, there's open portals in that place, you know, where God would come visit me, Jesus would come and visit me, they would catch me up, take me on trips to heaven in that place. And I loved it, I loved being there. And then it was turned to the offices, and it became more and more difficult to try to manage our personal lives, you know, we didn't have a private life anymore, we kind of was okay, when you're one of 15 people, you kind of get used to that. It was hard, we really didn't have any place in the entire place, we couldn't call, that was our own. And I want you to know, that was God's plan. One morning, he woke us up, each of us, my mom was with us, Jen does, we have a friend who's going to be doing music for us, he's there, and my husband and myself are there. And we woke up and separately he told us, God the Father said, you will now turn your bedroom, not your bedroom. Your office into, no, I was right the first time I was here, you will turn your bedrooms into your offices, so you will have proper office space. And he didn't hesitate to just tell me that, he told Jen that separately, my mom separately, and we all came out of our bedrooms and they said, did the Father tell you to turn this into your offices? And they were awesome offices, we just didn't have a bedroom, we had like sofas to sleep on and stuff like that, my professional office was there, Margaret's professional office was there, she's my CFO, and so it changed everything in our lives. And even the kitchen became the staff, that was the break room, the formal dining room became my studio, the wings behind it, which are in storage right now, and you saw those amazing broadcast take place, that was our formal dining room. And so we really, our formal living room was for the guardian zone and other stuff going on, where the staff was there, and so we really didn't have, oh, the biggest part, the biggest change was shipping and receiving, which we actually had there, we shipped stuff online, a lot of stuff shipped online. So our beautiful, what was that called, ten? Formal living room, the other one, the big room, the big, big room in your home, it has a fireplace. So it was a great room, we call it the great room, yeah, yeah, it was great, all right. It was a great room, and we even had to have construction being done on some of those rooms just to adjust, that we could do the activities we needed to do in there. So our great room, which we really love, became a wonderful shipping and receiving, so many products were stored there, they were created there, that was also our place where we did a lot of the creativity for four things that we wanted to offer, and people go, why do you sell stuff? I'm a company, I'm a corporation, a Florida corporation, and the father said, I'm going to send you as a Florida corporation, if you remember, he sent his son as a carpenter, do you remember that? And that's not the only one he sent to be a part of business, he wanted me to be a part of business, he said, your job is to reveal heaven and earth and create heaven and earth, and we did a really good job of that. And so all of that stuff took place in the years following that, until finally God informed us that he was going to put us inside of a gate and move us into a gated community because of the activities that would be going on there, he needed us there. And that started our search, we finally found the place we wanted, and so we had to pack the office up, we think we have found our office, which are really excited about that, we can't publicly officially, I'll say publicly, I'm doing a public, I love live broadcasts by the way, sort of publicly, not publicly, we have found our office space, it's a two storey building, it's going to be so amazing, so much room for everything, and we will have a home that is nothing but our home. So good. So good. And we're looking happy about it, so all that finally took place, it took months and months and months, the staff, you know, finally came the day when they had to pack all of the business stuff, all the office stuff, had to be shipped over to the storages. And they've been waiting this time, this amount of time, I don't know how long it's been you know, how many, yeah, two months, we've had it all emptied out, and they can't wait to get back to work, so I can tell you, they love us, they love all the activity going on, and so that finally is being settled. But now that we have the offices, we have so many new programs, plans, products, and I'm going to have to give a little bit more time than I normally have, at least to set it up. Yeah. So what takes us to the other part of the release, the release, is that we're going to start in March doing two, just two, I think, two a month, and I'm not saying that's forever, it's not going to be forever. Two shows on Elijah's streams a month instead of four is what you're saying. Instead of four, instead of four, we're going to be doing two, because I'm going to have to commit a lot of time to the office area, but we're also, we've moved into a rental place inside the gates of this amazing place, because our place isn't done, so that means I still have to re-adapt and remove all the stuff, and most of the stuff, into this other place we have that's going to be opening here. It's just a lot of work for me, a lot of drawing, sketching, I do design stuff, and we design a lot of stuff. So until further notice, we'll be doing the first and the third, I believe that is right, that's the broadcast for Elijah's stream. And then once we get close to having all that done, I will re-announce when we're going to start back up again, because it's not going to be forever, but it will bless my heart and our staff to get things set up in order. We feel like we're going to be probably in just a couple of weeks, be able to go in and start doing all this stuff to repair the office. And you know, I did that, we actually did that twice with the previous business that started in our garage. And I especially, when you said the kitchen was the break room, so when everyone was ready for lunch, they would adjourn to our kitchen and have their break. And then I think the coup de gras, the one that hit me the hardest was, or hit Doreen the hardest is, her one place of privacy was the master bedroom, which is down the hall. And someone, someone went walking down the hall said, Doreen, Doreen, you have a call and it was like that. From that point on, we started looking for an office because there was no place in the house that you could, and then we did it again when we moved here 23 years ago and started the Elijah list, it started all over again. So anyway, well, there's another change that you're ready to announce. So let's talk about that regarding Israel. Yeah. One good thing though is in between this change that we're talking about scheduling, Jen and I will start doing podcasts. We're going to do podcasts again, they're very simple, they're very easy. You don't have to have anything set up, you know, that's only audio. And now that we actually, this, this place that I mean right now, this is the studio now is actually in our new temporary place. So we will be doing podcasts from here. So it's not like you won't hear anymore from us at all. And randomly, probably whenever I feel like it, I'll tell Jen, you know, crank it up, we're going to do something. So but because we have to plan the Elijah, you have to plan those, they've got such a great team, powerful team. The other change is going to take place is, I hope you're ready for this, you know, God never, never stops surprising even me is the Elijah streams is real trip, which by the way, I hope you get to go, it'll be life changing. It was powerful to feel the presence of God, to see the places that Jesus lived in, walked in, you know, delivered messages then it was so powerful and I loved it. And I will not be going on that trip and just letting you know, okay, about eight or nine months ago, I actually overextended. That's just something my daughters who are all in dance, we all have like double jointed everything. I had overextended myself. That was my fault. And therefore I injured myself, nobody injured me. And I'm recovering greatly from that. It's not like anything I have to have surgery or anything from, but I'm just thinking it might be a little bit much. I decided. Okay. God did not tell me not to go, no, y'all are going to say, he's probably going to say something. Well, he didn't say something to me because I think he really wants the one to go who's actually going to be going. That will be Robin and Lady Bullock. They are dear friends of mine, powerful men and women of God. I, in a way, I want to go because they will be going. Well, and you know what, Kat? What people don't know is that about three months ago-ish, Robin Bullock contacted me and said, I'd like to go with Lady Robin to Israel on the cat culture. I said, really? And then we didn't announce it publicly because we were full, so he was already booked. And when you announced to me that you, that you weren't going to be able to go or choose nothing, however we say that, I thought, well, Robin would be a good replacement and I kind of hinted it to him and then you came up separately and said, I'd like Robin to take my place and it was a perfect match made in heaven. So we're not, not only is Robin going to do all the things that you did, but we'll have a couple of concert nights too where he will play in worship. So people won't miss out on anything. People love Robin like they love you and it, I can see now in the, how God orchestrated it one step at a time that we didn't know so. I can see that and I'm telling you people, it'll be one of the most unusual trips you ever have, a powerful trip you probably ever take. And I told Steve, if I am, I mean, I'm strong enough to do a lot of this stuff, but I, because I have to do this other stuff, I have to get this other stuff done. I told him, I said, I might show up anyway, but if I show up in Israel, it will be to enjoy everything else you'll be enjoying. And the concerts, the things that Robin has to say in the spirit about Israel will be very powerful. So I really want to encourage you all to take advantage of this. And this was definitely something that God had designed. I know that I'll be going back to Israel myself, I love that country. I am Jewish. That's what I tell people. And so it gave me a great connection to there. So I don't want you to think, oh, well, I'm just not gonna go now. I think you'll miss so much if you don't. I think your vice, I think doors just open right now that would have never been open to you because that trip was totally closed. Yeah. The doors that are open now for those who would like to join. Like I said, I'll probably surprise everybody if I do decide to come, I won't tell you, I will just come. That'd be great. I mean, you might have to join myself and I wouldn't want to miss that. That would be so great. Now, we prepared, there's like four screens of directions, there's not that many words on each screen. But Emily, I'm gonna have you put in screen one and tell people how do they register. There's like 28 official openings right now to join it with Robin. There's 300 that can come. There's 28 official openings. Some may say, well, I don't want to go because Kat isn't going to be there, which is fine. Hopefully you won't do that. But if that happens, there'll be more openings for those who want to go win Robins there. Because people have their favorites. But let me just read this. We have a few openings of our upcoming Elijah Streams Israel tour on April 27 to May 7. There are approximately 24 main tour spots. That's the tour I'm going to be on because I'm not hiking up the backside of Masada. Sorry. There's 24 main tour spots available in four spots on the adventure tour. That's the people that hike up the backside of Masada. These three spots will be sold out first come first serve and we'll sell out quickly. So don't wait. Next screen is to get your spot on this amazing tour, send an email. Don't try and call because it won't get you in front of the line. Quickly send an email to events at elidistreams.com Dennis will get that and you'll be sent via email a registration form to fill out return via email or fax to our tour agent. The two are itineraries. One for the standard tour and one for the unique adventure tour will also be included in the email. Okay. Two more screens. Please do not call us at Elijah Streams. Use the email addresses above for your questions. I think they'll probably be paying attention if you say, well, I'm going to call. I'm going to get in front. That's probably not going to get you in front. So please try and honor this. Do it by email though. They'll time and date the time the emails come in so you'll be there in that order. The tour price is now this is where the tour only not the air flight. It's 29.95 for the tour and then you pay you can either pay for your own flight or the tour can book you a flight. It says there'll be a non refundable $300 deposit required per person with the entire remaining balance due within seven days. So it's a tight schedule because how many people will will be trying to get in for those last spot. So last screen and it says the price does not include the round trip airfare from your nearest airport to Tel Aviv. The tour agency is able to arrange all airfare you need at the lowest possible price or you can say well I've got whatever mileage or whatever and I'll arrange it myself. That's also possible. So events at ElijahStreams.com Dennis is taking charge of that. So there you have it. We won't show that again because that will fill up for that. But Kat we're really, really, really going to miss you. But it was fascinating to me that you selected Robin and we selected Robin at the same time. So we know it's God and they have become very, very close friends of mine and beings. And they really do know the father's heart. And if you've not ever been to one of his meetings or heard one of his concerts, you really are in for a delightful surprise, a powerful surprise. So we would like to encourage you. Father I just pray right now. I'll fill up an ordering man or God, those who really had a heart to go and couldn't that those doors will be there if they ask quickly, that they will get to be a part of this God, a life changing experience to go to the Holy Land, to see the tomb of Christ, you know, to be on the sea of Galilee, you know, where Peter, where they fished God and all the other places, the upper room, by the way, still has a firing portal. And the Holy Spirit came through. It's still there. That's why I went. I want they, they let me see all the spiritual places that were still open or that were open because of the things that happened. I even know where in the garden, you know, we're in the garden where Christ knelt. Really? You know, where, you know, where in the garden? Yeah. Did you say? Wow. Yeah. Yeah. And so you don't want to miss these places. I, I love being there. I love seeing the things that were there left marked for God or marked by God. And so I just want to encourage you all to believe to go, to believe to go. And like I said, I may show up, but if I do, it will be to enjoy the concert and all the other things that they're going to have for you. The only thing I can let you know is I was a picky eater. I don't know. Let's just change that Holy Spirit. I am a picky eater. And so there wasn't a whole lot, you know, because if you're, you are in the Middle East. Yeah. You know, if you like, if you like Middle Eastern food, you're going to love it all. I found one thing that I would eat on our tour, you would get up to get on the buses. The buses take you everywhere, wonderful places to visit, wonderful vendors. You get to go to the quarter where the Order of the Rocks Jews live. It's just a beautiful thing to do. I found out that I liked the schnitzel. I did too. Yeah. I did too. It's like a cooked chicken patty. Is that right? That's what it is. And sometimes they put it on the stick, but they put a, made it into a big sandwich. And I probably was a little bit hard on the drivers who had to go prepare all that because I didn't want any of the special stuff they had. Just give me the chicken, you know, give me the chicken and maybe put it in the order. That's that way too. Totally that way. The thing is, her tastes are more encompassing. She likes to try a little of this and a little of that, you know, they serve us the fish at that one restaurant and the fish is laying, the fish is laying there with his eyes looking at me. I don't want to eat that fish when it's looking at me, but other people would just gobble that right up. So it's very, very individual, but so, so, so good. So, well, we'd better get into the content today or we'll run out of time. Kat, you had some things to share before we get into questions. So let me just turn that over to you. I did. I want to really encourage everybody out there. If you're still looking around what the world was saying about things or you want our own country is what is happening. I want you to know that this is not the new norm. The norm will be the glory of God, the baptism in fire, the ministry of sons and daughters of God. That's what this time is for. It's called, you know, this is where an acceleration time for God, which should make you really happy. But I just want to let you know there is no power that the enemy has that is greater than the life of God in you. Jesus Christ who lives in you, you have power over all the power of the enemy. I don't want you to think that you are defeated, that you are the doormat, hell is the doormat. And I want to let you know with all the fierceness in me that God wins. You win. That's the miracle of a win because it belongs to God. This world is about to change forever. And these people who think they want evil and darkness will end up with nothing. So this is my encouragement to you. Never give up on God, the son of God, Holy Spirit. They know everything is going on, everything is here. Who's doing it? How it's been gone? Who's paying for it? And just death is coming in Jesus name. I hope you think that is a great encouragement for yourself because if you belong to Jesus Christ, he loved you. He died for you. He paid a price. I was taken back to him and I saw when Christ wasted health, on the third day, melted the faces of the hierarchy of health, the preachers and powers looked like melted rocks. Do you know who did that? The Son. The Son of God. That's who walks around with that power on the inside of them. They are terrified of his name, his word, his presence, his very being. Think trying to think out of your mouth is what God says, what the Word says. Say those words. They're filled with his power, his life, his presence, his will, his way. That's who you call you. You do not belong to hell. And I can assure you they are very terrified right now, very terrified about what is about to happen in this country and around this world. And we will live for a very long time in the presence of the living God. And that is what will be known. That is what will be seen. God's presence. God's will. He's about to crush darkness and push it back. So run after him. So good. Jesus Christ holds you in his hand. You know, Kat, the very first, I mean that have been the first but almost the first time I saw the anointing fall on you like you just did and you went to where you just went. We were on the Sea of Galilee in the boat. Do you remember that? And you and the anointing fell on you and you did that. And I thought, wow. And then later you came back and I was asking you about it because I like to learn. And you said to me at that time I thought, well, okay, that's good for people. But I wasn't cynical, but I didn't have that much confidence in myself. And you told me honestly of Galilee that the enemy is very, very afraid of you, Steve. Do you remember that? Yes. Yes, I did. That was profound. And I'm thinking, wow, this is where Jesus walked, where Jesus literally sailed or boated or whatever you call it on the very waters and we kicked the fog out. Yeah. We did. Didn't we? It was the foggy. They couldn't go anywhere. They were just sitting there. So I stood up and I evicted all the fog out of the whole place and it left. Wow. Wow. And thank goodness it did because Michael who works for me, he's on the pre-show. He's watching right now. He was flying a drone to get some drone pictures of the boats. There's actually two boats tied together because there's so many people. And thank goodness he didn't lose his drone because he got some great shots of it with no fog. But anyway, so, well, anyway, Kat, we better jump into some questions. Thank you for obeying the spirit and going to that place. So you did say, you have said in the past, let's ask the questions for the kids first because Jesus said, let them come to me. Oh, it says, if you have questions for Kat, I'm going to be right here. Go to questionsforkat.com and fill out the form. So that will probably be for next week unless we run out or something. Okay, so Elijah, great name, age 11 says, wants to know, Kat, are there lightsabers in heaven? I'm sure there's, I do know that there's many things there that may be similar to what we have here. I don't think necessarily they're there. You know, it's not about being in Star Wars. I know the movie Star Wars, they had the lightsabers. That was something that they fought where they fought with light. Well, you know that the hosts of heaven actually do use light to fight with when they fight against the enemy. Oh, they do. Okay. Yeah, they do that. They fight with the lightning power of God, they fight with light. They have all different kinds of things. Some of them are made as weapons against the enemy. And so I wouldn't be surprised if there was something very similar to that in heaven. Very, very cool. Very, very cool. Hey, while I'm at it on that question, Disney has been, who bought the whole rights to the Star Wars, they've been adequately accused of being woke and grooming children and all kinds of bad things. So my question to you is, and this is not on my list, because Disney went woke, you know, that term, and because they've done some of this, is the Lord saying, don't you go to Disneyland now because they did this? Now you don't know that question's coming. So that's my question to you right now. Well, I was actually sent there by God on divine assignment. I was sent there to post the host really about a million hosts posted right now at Disney all over Disney, yeah, to carry out assignments that will be sent for whatever is going on. I can't say I know personally stuff that's going on. I just know that was an assignment and I was actually sent during the storm. One of the last storms we had, that's where I was sent. I went anyway. We went there and posted the host who came with us and left them for assignments to be carried up to remove darkness from all over Orlando. And so that was a divine assignment. So that's about the only thing I can tell you, because if you didn't know a lot of that darkness was going on in many different places, and so I can't say I personally know people from there, but whatever God sends me to do, I'm going to do it so the host haven't posted there. You know, we know a non-public inters... prophetic intercessor. She's both a prophet and intercessor. We've known her for 30 years. And God sent her on an assignment. She gave her a vial of water. She filled it up, blessed it, and God said, you are to take this water and go to this location at Disneyland at this, I don't know if they gave her a time and date or whatever. You are to go there and pour out this water at a specific spot at Disneyland. I thought, really, that was before I ever met you, Kat, and I thought, wow, who would have thought, you know, that God would give such an assignment to a prophet to go and pour this anointed water out. No one would ever know until this moment that I'm telling you this, but isn't that interesting to me? I would say, make sure no matter where you go and you're taking your children, you do know something about that place, you know something. Don't just randomly take kids, because you think it might be a good place. Stay first, see what God says to you, and hear what the Spirit of God is saying, and always take the Spirit of God with you and send the host ahead of time, because you know there are things going on. We send the host everywhere we go to hold on strongholds of the enemy, even if we did know certain things about that. So I would say, it doesn't matter where is even someplace locally where you live, make sure you're not just sending your kids to places because you think it's a good place to go. Can I ask you to repeat something you said months ago, many months ago? I think it was a hotel, I'm not sure, but you knew there was a problem in there and it's not like you were staying there, but maybe you were, and do you remember what I'm talking about? And God told you to go and yell something? I don't want to pre, I don't want to do a, do you know what I'm talking about? Okay, the one I'm talking about was you open the door and you shouted, have you got it? Yeah. Cause I know you do this a lot. You shouted at the top of your lungs, get out. Do you remember that? Yeah. I don't know if that's a hotel or what. You know, I do that almost every hotel I go to. You do. Oh, so no wonder you couldn't pull up the same. I do. I do. I do. I mean, people go there. They stay there. They watch things. They open doors for things. You know, I'm not going to have anything to do with the enemy. I don't want the enemy around me. And so I make sure I evict any part of the enemy that might be present no matter why they're there. I want to make sure they get cleaned out and then, and then it will come in. The host will have to go in that place and leave the presence and the life of God all over in that hotel. And I encourage people do that all the time. Do it all the time. Yeah. I encourage people to get cleaned out, cleared out, but don't belong there. And I tell people, if they go with me, they don't know what to think about anything about what I do. But I will let you know it's up to you, you, it's your life. Do you want stuff there that doesn't belong there around you? Then he biffed it in Jesus' name and do the same thing in your own home. I tell people, open your own door if you've had people over, you don't know what they've watched. You don't know what even what's taking place. Open the door of your home and say, I take power over you in the name of Jesus Christ and I biffed you, get out in Jesus' name. And they will race out of those places, which is exactly what happened at that hotel. They raced out as fast as they could get out before the army of heaven could come and beat them to nothing. I'm not talking about humans, people. I'm talking about things of darkness. Yeah. What did I want to add? Here's what I want to ask you, because people know, Kat, that you got injured with your back. And they also know that you send the host out and you tell him to get out and you do it daily. You do it in the middle of the night. Can you talk for a few minutes for people that say or ask, I don't understand if Kat is sending the host in that, in those massive numbers, how in the world does God allow her to get injured? What would you say to that? I would say that was my thing. I forgot to send them. And now people are looking at me like, what? Yes, I do. Sometimes if I rush and I hurry, that's why I always take your time to make sure if you're going to do something like that, you do it every single day. And usually when I open my eyes in the morning, that's when I would do it. Oh, really? That's all right. When I was in heaven, it was my own fault that I got injured, that I have it injured. You know, I talked to... Young's raising her hand going, she's telling the truth. What happened to me? A couple weeks ago. Oh, just a couple weeks ago. I forgot to send them somewhere. Oh, wow. It's not on purpose, but when you start something in your life that you're going to follow through with to make sure that your steps are ordered, not that God doesn't care, he doesn't attack you. Sure. It's not on purpose or allowed that to happen to you on purpose, but if you've already set that in place to happen, make sure you get it done. That's all I can say. You know, that's why people who are serious, none of them are really something that's going to hurt or injure me from doing anything, but the first time actually was my fault when I was overextending the reach that I have when I was in the shower and that I actually kind of popped up my hip. There was a woman a few years ago, three, four years ago, probably at least, and we were talking about you and we were talking about how you have these incredible encounters with God. You literally go to heaven and you see the Lord, however you see him high and lifted up or on a stump or in a prayer garden or whatever you see him, and we were talking to her and she said to us, and I'm paraphrasing from memory, she goes, I can do that too. I see him all the time. I can go any time I want to heaven and puzzlement came over my face and I said, you can do it all the time, but she had inferred that she doesn't go all the time, but she can. And I said, well, what do you mean you can go any time you want and yet you don't? Why would you not do that? If you could do that, she said and her paraphrase response was something like this. I don't know. I just get busy or I get lazy or I don't do that and I'm thinking, oh man, that's very instructive to me because it means that no matter how profound of an experience you can have, you can get lazy and not go for it with God. What would you say about that? I can't answer the question, Steve, because that's not me. I can't answer what she said because that's not how I feel about it and there is no reason why I wouldn't. If I was invited or he was wanting to take me to him, there's no way I would not go. Not go with him. Well, it sounds like she had a choice where as you go, when you go, when you go, you just go and it sounds like she had a choice to go and just sometimes decides, decided it really, she wasn't up for it right now or something. Yeah, well, that I definitely cannot answer. I can use the questions and things that happen to me personally. Sure. I can't give answers about other people's lives. Well, let me ask it this way then. Let me drill down a bit. Does it make sense to you that some people could be in that place where they have the ability and anointing but they choose not to? I would say it doesn't make sense to me at all. I think anytime you can have encounters like that or be with him, it's worth everything to get to do that. Because I feel like someone's listening right now and they're going, you know, that's me. I can go. I've gone many, many times, but sometimes I'm just not in a mood to press in. I just feel like there's people like that. I'm not criticizing that. I just think people exist like that. They just think, I don't know if I'm up for pressing in like that. I don't know. I press in for almost everything I get. Yeah. Okay. Having known and been trained and know his heart and know what he has for all of us. One of my assignments is from Jesus Christ, and that is to help reveal the Father. So the Father asked me to reveal heaven, Jesus asked me to reveal the Father. So those are my two main things I do and I love both of them. So again, it does exude from you if I only say so. Okay. Aiden, age nine is asking this, can I pick my house, what it looks like in heaven? And he wants to know if he can pick it. Can he also remodel it? Which is an odd question because I think why would you want to remodel it? I don't know. That would have to be his decision, I guess. And I know I would not want to remodel mine, although I've never meant to mine. I would want it to be exactly the way the Father made it for me, but you never know what his kids, you don't know what kids are going to be thinking. And I'm sure if there's some way it can be done, then he might be able to work it out with the Father. And can he, so his question is, can he pick what it looks like? I think it's already done before you get there. Okay. They start working on your home long before you arrive there. I know I've seen people's homes and process that were alive on the earth, and it was years and years and years before they arrived and made it to heaven. So I don't know, that would have to be between them. So that one I probably can't answer fully. Okay. Okay. Melissa is asking this. She says, I've heard you say that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit can step in and out of each other at will. Does this mean that there are times that I have the Trinity in me, and if so, is of course special occasion? So I understand the question, she's asking, are they really, can they really all be in me at the same time? And is there a special reason why they would do that on a special occasion? I don't know why they probably couldn't be. I know normally when I've seen them do that, it was before the throne, I was caught up before the throne and haven't even shown what it meant to be the three in one, that's what he was showing me, what is the three in one, because a lot of people don't understand that terminology. And that's when I was shown that there was the Father on one, the Father was there sitting on the throne, there was Christ, there was Holy Spirit. And that's when they got up one at a time and stepped inside, inside the Father. And the Father actually said, we are the three in one. Wow. And that's what that means. Yes, they have the ability to step inside of each other, if that is what they desire. That's what Jesus talks about when he says, Father, me and you and you and me, so there it is again, even in the word, that they have the ability to step inside of each other like that. And it's not like, I know people have an issue or maybe trouble picturing that. How do they stand inside each other? A spiritual being has no limit to their size on the inside. And we're talking about people who don't have, like, the Father is all spirit, he's all spiritual being, but he has a real body, a natural body. And we all lived in him before we were on this earth, that's where we were. And that's where we learned about the stones of fire, that's where we learned that, that's where we learned, he was our Father when we, when we lived inside the Father, and we played in the streams of the river that rained in him, and we would jump on the stones of fire around him. And we lived, this is what we did, when you were moving, you lived inside the Father before you had your earthland body, you would ride out in and out of him on the rays of the rainbow that came before him. Crazy. And so that was what you did, that's who you lived with, you were there all the time in the Father. I met a guy in Australia, and I think he wrote a book and it's called, I believe it's called Quantum Glory, he was really exploring the quantum physics of God, and he was totally sold out to the Lord. And I was asking him, I said, well, how could it be that we are filled with the spirit, we have the spirit, our bodies, the temple of the spirit, and yet we are seated with Christ? How could that be? And he said, again, paraphrase from memory, because it's like seven years ago, he said, we do not know the size or the dimensions or the boundaries of the spirit that's in us. In other words, he was inferring that if I'm filled with the spirit, that doesn't mean that my spirit that I'm filled with wouldn't go all the way up to heaven or something. That was what I did. What is your thoughts about that? I think a lot of people have issues trying to even imagine what some of those things look like, how that would operate with them, what would that mean for them? I think that's why it's important to have revelation that comes from the heart of the Father. I think that is a one-shore way to begin at least to understand. And that is the Father's heart as far as to know where we came from, what kind of life we have before he sent us to this earth to have a body. And probably, like I say, some people's stuff I can answer, some people I'm not in their mind or I don't even understand what their own mind means, so that's why he has me answer stuff that whatever he's shown me, and I've had a part of, I've been there, he's told me in person, I understand him fully, those are the things that I can answer. It makes sense, makes sense. All right, Rosemary's asking this, I know that we need to test angels when they show up, but what if it's Jesus that shows up? Interesting question. I mean, or someone that says they're Jesus, I guess. I would say you should test him anyway. It says test every spirit, that means anything that's a spiritual being, you need to test them to make sure that they're not trying to pretend to be something they're not. And I do sometimes, just because I want to, I'll say, I will just say, are you of the spirit of the Most High God who sent his Son to die for the sins of this world? That's actually the question you were supposed to ask. And if it is one of them, they will say, yes, it is I, that's what they, the Father of the Son will say that to me, and if they say nothing at all, then they will usually disappear because it isn't. You know, Kat, I had, this was years ago, I had, I was actually bedridden, semi-bedridden at the time, but I was up, okay. And we had an invasion of skunks under the house, and you can't go under a house and get a skunk because obviously you can't go under. And so, and he said, in the state of Oregon, I can't even kill them because there's a law against killing, blah, blah, blah, and I thought, why would there be a law against that? But anyway, the bottom line is he was up there and we began to talk about spiritual things. We were outside and we were talking about the Lord and I don't know how he got into it and about Father, Son, Holy Spirit. And he said to me, listen to this, he goes, he goes, well, let me ask your question, Steve. If the Holy Spirit were standing right here talking to you, would you recognize him? He literally said that, and I don't even know what to do with that. And all I knew to say is, well, I don't know, you know, so I don't know what your thoughts about that. Well, it depends on if you have seen some of the parts of his image, there's fire that swirls around him, even some of the colors of the rainbow will flow in and out of Holy Spirit. He comes in and out of fiery portals all the time. He has an oil that he brings with him sometimes, the oil of the Holy Spirit. So I think it would depend on if you had encounters with him. And yes, he is mostly invisible, but you will see a manifestation of his presence being there many times. And if you've seen that, then you could probably give some sort of description. I know people who also have seen the Holy Spirit many times and his whole outline was done in fire. I've seen that image before. So I think depending on what you had seen, that could give you a way to answer that. Well, all right, let's see, IVETE, it says in heaven, people understand the thoughts of each other of others without speaking. Do our loved ones understand our thoughts when they look down at us from the portal? Or do they only hear what we speak? Interesting question. I've never heard that one. Of course, again, I can only answer what I have, if I've been there, if I've been and I've looked down from the portal, I usually would hear what people were saying. If I was there visiting, if I was caught up in this to visit, then I would hear what they were saying. So I don't know that in having a lot of people speak by their thoughts, by the way, they do also use their tongue and they do speak like in person, they do that also. And so I know there is a way in heaven to understand the thoughts of people down here on the earth. Only if the Father would allow me to hear or understand people's thoughts. Did I hear on the earth understand those thoughts? Well, that leads me to what you just kind of said it, but I want to drill down a bit. You're a seer and a seer often is a feeler and a sensor and a hearer. You've got all of the gifts, are there times then that when it's the Lord's will, you're walking around and you hear, let's say someone has evil intentions and you hear their thoughts of their evil intentions and what they plan to do when no one's looking. Does that happen with you, Kat? Do you sometimes hear people's intentions? It does sometimes. It depends if the Father wants me to know what they're thinking. And then I can take authority over it. What do you do and how do you take authority? Because I know there's people watching who have that same anointing and gift, they can hear other people's thoughts from time to time when God wants them to. How do they take authority? What do they do? I'll just take authority over all the power of the enemy operating in them to do some harm to people or to do things that weren't right or weren't just and I would just take authority over and command the host to come and go down the strongholds. You just end it right there. You just whatever they were planning, you end it. If he allowed me to hear it, there was a reason why he wanted me to hear it. That's really good. Right there. I have to deal with it. That's really, really good because you said if he allowed me to hear it, he wants me to do something about it. That's right. You're walking through the mall sometimes that has happened several times and I always took authority over it when that happened. That's really, really good. Well, I saw a movie once where it wasn't a Christian movie, but where the guy was hearing the evil intent of all these people and I thought, boy, in a Christian environment, what would that be like if a believer could walk around and hear all of these evil intents? He would stop these things from happening. They should absolutely take authority over it. Okay. All right. Richard and Amy asked this question. How many, as if you would know this, I'm sorry, I don't mean to pre-answer this. How many archangels are there in heaven? We've only heard of Gabriel and Michael, so I mean, I don't know how you would know how many, but what would you answer with that? I know of the normal ones that people do. Because people who say they know other ones, I probably don't know necessarily of them. There's so many of the army of heaven. There's so many of Gabriel's group, the Gabriel's group is which I call the helper angels. Most of Gabriel's, by the way, look like humans, but they're not. They're still angels. Most of Michael's look like warring creatures because that's what most of those are. They're very, very powerful beings, and they have different reasons why they're assigned to Michael or to Gabriel, and I've seen quite a few different ones, but as far as how many archangels, I can't answer that question. Kat, do you happen to know if Gabriel's that look like humans, do you happen to know, do they look like humans because that's their task to go mingle with humans and give them messages? I have to say absolutely yes. That is probably exactly why. Okay. Cool. All right. This is a different Amy. I said Amy a minute ago. Amy asked, what does Kat see in the spirit during healings? This is a very common thing. People always want to know when something's happening, what do you see? So this is one of those, Kat. What does Kat see in the spirit during healing? Do you see a person already healed or do you see demons causing sickness or infirmity? What do you see if God shows you? It's in the midst of a healing service like in a church where I normally see is a staircase coming down from heaven. Really? Yeah. And they're carrying gift boxes, the angels carrying gift boxes and they'll walk through the people and leave the body part they needed on the inside and when they walk out, it's no longer in the hand of the angel, I've seen that. So that begs the question that I've had many, many times and that is, can I pray in the name of Jesus for the Lord to send angels with body parts that I need from the body parts whereas, could I pray that? I think you can pray just about anything you want to pray, Steve. I can't answer or I couldn't answer what would happen. Yeah. Certainly we all have the right healing, the Bible says that. That's why Christ died. That's why his stripes, because his stripes were healed, because of his blood were healed and I would tell people, never let anything stop you to ask for healing especially. But they had had a worship service going probably for hours and hours and all of a sudden our pastor said, begin, stop, stand up, begin to shout out, if you need healing, what body parts you need, he actually was given instruction and after doing that for a while, there was this loud crack and that's when the aircase came out from heaven and they were carrying these boxes. I do know that when body parts were sent, they are put in a gift box and sent from heaven that way. Really? Yeah. And there was somebody who was yelling out, I can hear what they were yelling out and wanted and somebody got a new heart, somebody got a new, I saw this angel come down and he had a human beating heart in a box and this man cried out, I need a heart and he walked to that man and a couple of nights later they had testimony night and that man said, I have a brand new heart. Wow. You know, there's a scripture cat and I may not have this exact but I think it's pretty close, my earpiece is about to fall out here, Trina is normally here to hook this on and she's not here today, so I'm on my own. There's a scripture that says, if we know he hears us and I know God hears us, then we know we have the petitions, do you know what I'm talking about, do you know what that passage is? Can you clarify that? If we know he hears us, then we know we have the petitions, I mean that sounds like to me that if you ask God and you know he hears us, then his answer is yes, but it's not always yes, so what would you say about that? I would say I don't know, because I don't know all of that stuff of course, I do know that scripture is a powerful scripture and I think that's one of the reasons why you should not stop asking for it, I'm not saying he has to ask over and over again, I'm not saying that, I'm just saying if we know he hears us, why would we not believe that we have what we have asked him for, that is his heart to give it to us, I can't say it would be immediately for sure, I know that myself, I know that doesn't mean it might not be immediately but that does mean that eventually whenever that is and I can't answer that question, that means that his purpose is, that's why it was provided, is for you to have the answers of the things you have asked for. Can I ask you, now this is personal, but you've just said you did it to yourself, you didn't take care of your back, and then you overextended and then it's hurt and it's been a few weeks at it, can you tell people how do you pray during that time when it's not manifesting, when the healing is not yet manifested, what are your prayers sound like, Kat? I think mine are beginning to manifest, I've never had any problem bending over, picking stuff up, walking up, none of that stuff was interfered with, I was maybe a little bit slower doing it, but I immediately started praying for full recovery, that's what I wanted, I wanted a full recovery, there would be nothing in me, a temporary, in any way whatsoever that would hinder me or hinder what God had for me, I immediately started praying, first of all I said, sorry for not sending those that day, I'm really happy about me, because that's what I do, that's what I had decided to do with my life, but I started praying immediately to have results, so I've had amazing results, even the doctors saying I'm having amazing results, so I have a couple that I go and see, I have a chiropractor every now and then I get to go and see, and then my family doctor would not be taking medication for anything right now, I don't have to have medication to help me, I don't, so I have been seeing some amazing results, I just didn't think my energy level would be up to par for going to Israel, I shouldn't want to slow down and I can tell people, make sure you're in good shape, make sure you have a lot of activity, like most of your transportation is like, it's just riding buses from different places and going into the different things to see stuff, so I even was not in the best of shape when I went the first time, and it was, that was a challenge for me, so that was my reason for saying I think I would rather have Robin and Lady Robin go. Oh sure, oh sure, all right, one more question, I know we've gone over an hour and we were going to keep it a little short for you, but Lisa is asking this, she says, I would like to know more about prophetic smells, is there such a thing, I smell smoke at times when there's no reason for it. I don't really do smells. Okay, well let me answer this one then, okay, because I do, from time to time, I was by, and this is a story, this is a true story a few years ago, I went back by the back door and I smelled like sulfur, like a sulfur burning smell, and I thought what is that, and I called my friend Paul Cox who gets that, and he gets it over the phone, so I said Paul, Paul, I'm going to walk to the house, and I'm not going to tell you where I'm walking, and I want you to tell me what's going on, and I walked around and then I walked by the back door without telling him, and he said stop, and I go okay, he goes where are you, I said I'm by the back door where I smelled sulfur, he says well tell that thing to get out of there, his instruction was always the same thing, tell it to leave, so he tells, if he smells something that's bad, tell it to leave, is that an okay instruction? I would say absolutely yes. So good, that was a, that was a Steve answer to a cat question, so can I tell people what they can get at RevealingHeaven.com as we close out here? RevealingHeaven.com is one of our major websites, and it is where you find out about who we are and what we do, and it's also where our store is, which is about to be upgraded majorly with all kinds of stuff, and also it's, I think you can hear testimonies there and see other things there, we're about to, like I said, we're doing major changes to both websites, and the other one, which is catcurr.com, is that right Jen? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, catcurr.com. That is what I call a spiritual platform for God to say, whatever He wants to say, whatever He wants to say it, it's also the only place that you can give to us online, we don't have a lot of places, we have purpose to that, to protect people from their information being taken or used, or if you want that to happen, and we still have a lot of plans to do things with and for a guardian zone, those are the people who give on a continual basis, I think if we go there, you can find out about that too, if you go to catcurr.com and click on the treasury, which is what we call a place where we can give, we so greatly appreciate all the people have done, and those who have prayed, your prayers are powerful. I love your prayers, I love your prayers, I love your cards, I love all the stuff that you've sent to me, there are treasures to me, I saved every one of them, I know it sounds wild and crazy, but I did, but it doesn't give us the heart of those who do give, not just me, but give to Steve, and give to those who are speaking the truth, the prophets who are making the stand, and not stepping back on, in these days we need to hear your voice, we need to know what your prayers are, and so I thank you Father, right now I just released the healing power, into everyone who has a need for healing, especially since I'm receiving it, I can't be part of this Father, I'm not just in part of it, the healing power of Jesus Christ into your body, fully recovering in Jesus' name, nothing lacking, the life of the living Savior flowing through your body right now, I thank you for that Father, I thank you for the evidence of it happening, I thank you for the joint celebration of people who are receiving it right now, and I say amen, and amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, thank you so much, give our love to, you know, we know Jen and Margaret, I don't know all the other staff, but we know Jen and Margaret, give our love to them, and being, Captain Bing, you know, we love him as well, and his dad jokes, they're horrible, but they're so funny, you know, so we miss being, you know, Captain Bing, so anyway, it was snowing a minute ago, so that was a good sign, so anyway, So much snow in storage, we have something like, I don't know, 14 storages, I mean, we really have that money to store all the stuff we need for all the offices, the stuff that we need, and that's where he spends most of his life, and they're going to look for something to bring to us, and they're about to go in there and measure furniture and stuff that will need for our new offices, and so that man has never been kept so busy in his whole life, poor guy, poor Captain Bing, you know, he's an amazing guy, you know, and he's actually, he's quite the leader, I saw one day we did, we taped in the studio with you, and he had a call that was waiting, and you can get to talking, like all of us, and he walked into that studio, he grabbed you by the arm, and he pulled you out of the room, and took you to that call, you know, I don't know if he does that all the time, but I thought when Captain Bing needs to get kept somewhere, she gets there. And then he is a task man, I can tell you what, we are so opposite, it's hilarious. Well, he loves fishing, he loves fishing, you hate the smell of it, if I recall, right? I do not like fish, and he loves fish. Isn't that, that's God's humor, so, okay, thank you so much, God bless you, it's very, very anointed today, we appreciate you, and love you, and I adore you, and love all that God is doing with you, so, give our love to your staff, and Captain Bing, and we will see you all again, let's see, tomorrow is Doné Clement Patrusca, so do not miss Doné, she has a lot of revelation from Kim Clement, so, we will see you all again tomorrow, have a great day, bye-bye. Love you.

Well, hello, it happens to be Tuesday, February 28, when we are recording this. You will see this in the morning, March 1, and so it is Tuesday today, 3.03 p.m. You will see this on Wednesday, 11 a.m. if you are watching live from the Pacific Northwest Coast, or whenever time you watch on the replay, or whenever part of the nation you are in, or any of that. Anyway, welcome to the broadcast. We are going to bring Cat here. What we are here to say as far as the show for tomorrow, which will be your Thursday, is that it is between two guests, and so we don't know which one it is, so we will just tune in on Thursday and be surprised, and it is always good, but we are kind of between these two guests, depending on people's schedules, so that is what is going on for Thursday. All right, I think that is it. We are going to run a quick reminder of a spot for the wells that we are digging, so we appreciate you guys thinking about us and those that need this fresh clean water, so here we go. And thank you for your generous donations on that. We are going to show you in a few days, or up to a week or two. It is when they are back in town, Mike and Lori. It could be before they leave, but we have a video of the medical clinic that you have built over there in the village area, which they call Field of Dreams in Uganda there, but I think it is like six, eight, nine months it has been in process. Things are going to move very slowly in Uganda, but the money goes a lot further, so we sent about $150,000 over there, but they are building a beautiful place that we could not build here for anywhere close to $150,000, but it really goes far in Uganda, and they do quality work. Mike and Lori do, they get the job done, so we will show you that video. I looked at a preview of it yesterday. We are going to shorten it up a little bit, because it is a little bit long. But I am thanking you in advance for that, or I am thanking you after you gave them, because many of you gave months and months ago, and now you are going to see the results of that. Amazing, amazing stuff. All right, time to bring in Cat Curse. Here is Wednesdays with Cat and Steve. Here we go. Greetings, Cat. How are you? How are you? I got my pink tie on in honor of your pink hair. Yes. I don't know if you have seen that. There are some pale parts in it. It is a little pale compared to your right pink, that is for sure. Good to see you again. In March, we are going into March, and starting in March, we are going to twice a month. Is that right? Yes. If I am saying it wrong, I think that is what you had said. Whatever it is that you want to do, we will definitely do that. Cat, before we get into questions, you said you had some things to share, so I will turn that over to you. Yes, I did. Of course, you all know that we have been talking about our new place here, that we finally get to live in, which is amazing, that we no longer have to live in our offices. We have our offices, and we are very excited. I think the move-in date was today, not for the staff, but everything is in there getting set up. Thank you all for your prayers and your excitement, that we finally get to have a separate place. Anyone out there working on something like that, I just bless you in the name of the Lord. Make sure that you get plenty of grace for those kind of things that start in your life. This is a powerful season right now with God. As you know, I have been saying for quite a while now, this is acceleration time. That is exactly what time it is, according to heaven. It is time to be accelerated into the things God has for you. He intended for you what He has shared with you already. I know people, this looks around, this looks kind of crazy, but you know God is God, and He does what He wants to when He needs to. You always look at Him in that way, then you will always be excited about the unexpected things that He is going to do with you. Thank you Father for grace for everybody out there, for your will, your way this day. I know that there are a lot of people who have been waiting for a lot of things to start to change. We have seen some change already, and I am excited about that. Of course, I can't keep track of every bit of that with being involved with everything else that I am doing right now, but I can share with you what God has to say about it. Go ahead. I was going to ask you about, we are talking about the change, and all of us, and I think probably you too, although I don't want to put words in your mouth, but when we saw what we saw about Trump coming back and the good things that are in store for us, I mean some of them are straight ahead of us, at the same time, I don't know what you saw, that's why I said I don't want to put words in your mouth, I don't know if you saw some of the trials and tribulations that would happen, kind of all mixed in there at the same time, so I mean that's sort of an open-ended question. Did you see some of that, or did the Lord just show you how it was going to end in the good way? I know that He showed me how it would end in a very powerful, powerful good way, and He did that from the very beginning, back in 2020, I think that was, the 2020 sort of showing me that, how this all would end, how justice, liberty and freedom would come, celebration would be happening in the streets, that I can powerfully assure you is going to happen, and I just know every day it gets closer, every day things are changing for all of us, and so I can just encourage you with those things, the things that He has shown me and told me is the things I'm allowed to say, and so I do know of course the enemy is going to try his best to do what he can in the short time he has left, and I can say that awesome, so most assuredly that even part of hell those things are failing already, they know it, but of course they're not going to tell what they know either, but I can assure you that this season that you're entering into is one of those powerful times planet Earth will ever experience. The Manifests of Sons and Daughters walking on this earth, speaking to the land, the sea and the air, and seeing things happen immediately, we know that that is actually one of the things that's going to happen, the transfer of the wealth, and more and more talking about that, more prophets are talking about that, the transfer of wealth is absolutely going to be happening, and so I'm excited about that, we were told about that many, many, many years ago, I'm probably saying many, probably more than 40 years ago, we were shown by God about the transfer of wealth, so we know that that would happen, so we've been expecting it that long, and so we just know for sure that that will happen, and it will begin to change the earth. We know there's going to be another great move of God, with the people who are tired of the stuff that's been happening in their lives, and some of them I'm talking about who aren't even saved yet, that will become saved, and that's definitely going to happen, great revival, and other things are going to happen around the world, and that's going to increase, increase, increase, so you will see and hear that, whether anybody wants to or not, because the ones involved in that aren't going to let that just go by the wayside, they're just not going to, and so there are many things that are about to happen, that are preparing to happen right now in this planet earth, and I can tell you, the young people are not going to be left out by God, he's going to include them in many of these moves of God, happening, a lot of them will become creatures, even at a young age, revivalists, even prophets, even the young prophets will begin to speak soon, and it's going to be amazing, so I know from my other prophet friends that yes, these things are really totally about to begin to happen, that they have seen God say and share with him, and share with him also, and so those are the things that are in my heart, the things that people can actually really celebrate and realize, yes, God really does have plans for this day, for our lives, and things that can't be changed, things that can't be stopped, no matter who tries to do that, and again, as I said, justice, liberty and freedom is about to come in many places, some people are never expected to see it in, some countries are actually going to be changing even what they believe, and a lot of them are going to begin to run after God, so these things are all part of his plan, his will, his way, and so I'm excited to be here today, in the time that we're supposed to be here. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Well, Cat, I've got a couple of kids' questions about heaven, and then we'll get into some more substantive ones, but you said you like to start with the kids' ones first when we have those, so Tucker is age nine, he's writing and asking this, if I write Jesus a letter, will he receive it? I am quite certain he absolutely will receive it. Jesus loves to get letters or even pictures from children, and I do know that they make it, I don't know if the angels come and take it, or sometimes I don't really know how it gets there, but I do know this, I've seen some actual letters written by children. Really? They could be supernatural copies that arrived in heaven or something like that, so yes, I'm sure his letters could arrive in heaven. Good, good, good, good. Okay, now Isaac is 15 and he's wanting to know this. I used to have this question with you too, and not as much, but he's saying, can you sleep in heaven if you want to, and if you want to, can you make the room dark where you sleep? I'm a guy that loves a good nap, so to me I'm thinking, ever without a good nap would seem like it's missing something, but I don't think you probably think in terms of naps. I don't think in terms of naps, but whatever you want, I'm sure that he's not going to be against you having a nap if you really want to. It just sounds so relaxing. They have rooms, they recline in that they do, and they have friends to come by and just share and talk with them, and so they have places to let that, in their mansions, and even outside, like on the streams that flow by, I see people just resting on the streams. Really, because you don't have to be, you can float is what you're saying. Everybody can float in heaven, so let me make sure I say that perfectly clear, in heaven, yes, you can. And you go to the friendly forest where you can recline, sit on the big rocks, and then they'll turn around and talk to you, which you probably don't expect. Yeah, I love that. Now, I think you must have mentioned this before, but it's been a long time, so if a person, they're reclining down the stream, and maybe they're the kids too, and they say, I want to go swimming, so they go underwater, do they breathe underwater in heaven? That is probably something we will share another time. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, there's many things you need to do in heaven, you can't, of course, do down here on the earth. I mean, you know, we all know how you get there, and that's God's plan to make all these wonderful, beautiful places for you to have in heaven and enjoy in heaven. There's places where it snows all the time, there's an Amazon forest, but it's not Amazon, but they have also the jungle kind of forest like that, and I know all the creatures, like the animals and stuff, they all talk to you, so it's a very different living there. It's just a whole different lifestyle. Yeah, I mean, the whole thing about all the animals talk to you, because I mean, right now you go out and the animals are quiet, or I don't have sheep, but when we used to have a couple pet donkeys, and they were fun to hear them bray, you know, all that, but in heaven they're sitting there conversing with you, they talk about what's going on. Yeah, that's absolutely right. That's amazing, that's just amazing. All right, you've heard me talk on this program about my mom, now my mom is very, very close to going home to be with the Lord. She's 88, 89, and her memories are about gone, so it made me think that my mom, I believe, is saved, and of course I'm standing for her, so she will be, but she's had a rough go her life, and she didn't have a good understanding of the love of Christ, so I think she's afraid to die, and one of the prophets I was talking to, discerned that she was very fearful of dying, so I've been praying for the Lord to break the fear, because they're the other people that close their eyes, and then they pass away, maybe they don't realize they're about to, and then when they open their eyes they're shocked that they made it to heaven, or does it work like that, or does it...? I think they're so joyful, I don't know that they're really shocked, I think they're so overwhelmed and blessed beyond measure, that that's probably what they're experiencing. The rest of the posting you probably think about, the wonder, the splendor that what they never expected having to be, probably. Well, and this, you know, and this now, let me pull this away from my mom a little bit, because I was thinking of this question first before I was thinking about my mom, and it's thinking, I wonder if there are people who died, maybe it's in a war, maybe it was, maybe they were fighting and, and maybe they weren't, they didn't say all the right words the day they died and, and blah, blah, blah. And then they are some shot that they made it to heaven, because they forgot. Some get out of their transport and kiss the ground and heaven, so I would have to say yes. Wow, you have. Okay, that does answer that, Kat. Yeah, that was a good answer. That was the truth. Yeah, yeah, because I would think some people made a commitment to the Lord, and they met it, and then they wandered a little bit, but God remembered their commitment. Is that fair to say? I would say that there is a space of time from the time they're passing from the physical realm into the spirit realm that I know that Jesus does meet with people, or he makes himself known that he's there in the room. And it's sometimes is actually before they actually really fully do that. And if they wanted to say something, that would be the first thing on their mind, or he will just ask them or let them know who's been praying for him and ask them what they think about that. So there's all kinds of questions that we find out the answers to when we get to heaven, but I'm sure that there are people that probably feel that way. And they think that they don't say exactly every single word. I think the most important word is that I repent in my sins and we see Jesus. The most important things you can say are those words right there. That's really, really good. Yeah. And I was praying last night, and there's like six of us that were praying for our mom. And I think it's okay to pray this, but I'm going to ask it because other people will have some parents that are passing soon. Is it okay for people to pray? Like for our parents, Lord, my mom is tired. She doesn't feel good. She's depressed. Could you just take her home quickly and just let her die peacefully in her sleep and go home? Is that okay to pray? I know people pray that. I know there are people who do pray that. And of course, if they're in a situation where they're probably not doing well, I think that it would be like mercy. If you said to God, thank you for showing mercy in the situation. That's good. Thank you for the mercy that you can give her. And we know that you love her. And that it's not like she totally ignored Jesus her whole entire life. No, no, no, that's correct. Yeah, that's correct. And so it's like she did know, I'm sure, who he was and everything. So I think asking for mercy is not a wrong thing at all. Okay. Well, I wondered about that because I think it was one of the writers, we've had her on before, but years ago, but she wrote about the Celtics and many of them back in the day, 1800s, 1700s, when they knew it was their time, they would go sit under a tree and give up their spirit voluntarily and just go home to be with the Lord. I know some of that's been recorded in church history. So that's why I mean, I thought, well, if they could do that, why couldn't we ask the Lord, you know, I think there's nothing wrong with asking for mercy if that if he's because of the mercy. Yeah. Okay. I want to ask this question that I'd written out earlier. Years ago, I knew a woman, I mean, we're out of touch with her. She's probably not too far away from here, but she she was writing and she's a seer like self, but then not only would she see real things in the spirit, but she would see real things and then she would hear them talk. So for instance, she's taken a boat trip to sightseeing. I don't know if that was to see whales or what, but they went to the back of the boat and this whale jumped out of in the air and as whales do, and she heard it say she heard it proclaim the king is coming. Have you heard of anything like that? I'm thinking that there's absolutely nothing impossible when it's related to God and and his creatures. We know already things. We know some of them did talk in the Bible and I would think that I think more and more in these days coming on the earth that actually will happen more. I can't say that it won't happen more. I think it will happen more. Yeah. It's something that will begin to happen. And you know, in the Garden of Eden, they all talked. We know that. Yeah. So it's not that unusual. It shouldn't be. And now that we know that it's less unusual to believe that God would start doing that, at least to the seer could see it or hear it. You know. Oh yeah. Well, I've seen all kinds of things. I've heard. Yeah, I've heard them talk and see them talk. Yeah. Of course I do. Yeah. All right. So Lori's asking this. I don't know if you would know this or not, but she said, do the angels, did the angels cry when Jesus was crucified and did they rejoice because he gave his life for all to be saved? Did they, did the angels look and weep or do you know? I don't know if they did look or weep, but I know that they were not very happy. Of course, they knew that it was necessary. I know the angels in the garden stayed with him that whole time he was in the garden in Pryde. And they were there to comfort him. They also comforted him when he came out of the wilderness. Remember that tempted by the enemy. And they did come to comfort him also. So comfort is definitely part of something that they do. And I'm sure they did a lot with him during that time on the earth. And of course they had a huge celebration. They rejoiced. They were so excited. Of course, when he was resurrected, when he, when he came back from the dead, I'm sure that they all celebrate on that. Awesome. Awesome. All right. Angie's asking this. Can you talk about the spirit of wisdom? I heard you say, Kat, once that the spirit of wisdom was, was a female gender or I don't, I'm sure that's how you said it. Talk about that, if you will. It says wisdom. She says that in the Bible. Yeah. So that means she probably looked, she had a feminine appearance, I'm quite sure. And it's, they're not the only ones. There's other ones who do different things for God in heaven, while they're sent to the earth for things. And so not every single angel has a masculine appearance. Yeah. And some of them are creatures. So they don't look like either. Yeah. There's a lot of the, a lot of the army of God and even others that don't look like feminine or masculine. They are creatures. Okay. We like more animal like in, in, in the speaking of a Gabriel in that order of angels. I don't, I'm looking for words. Are all the, are the angels in the order of Gabriel? Are they more like human human? And it would be the word attractive humans. We know that they're made by God. Yeah. I mean, human life, right? I mean, they have a face. Because they're sent on assignment so many times to be with us on the earth. And sometimes they don't know, of course I usually know that they are. And not just them, but sometimes people who look or appear to be homeless could be angels. And God is just testing someone to see if they will help them or love them or give to them, especially people who don't necessarily do that. So there's many reasons why he would want them to appear human. Most of them, you don't see their wings. That does not mean they don't have wings. Sometimes their wings can be invisible, sometimes not invisible, but you're right. Most of those in the service of Gabriel, who is their leader, the archangel Gabriel, most of them do appear as humans. Yeah. You know what you said that I mean, I may have said this one time on the program that is either 89 or 90. So a lot of years ago, I worked in Dallas, Texas, and a public company. And I was out for lunch. It was my car. I can't remember if anyone else was in there. But what they call a bag lady, you know, they had their shopping car, all of their worldly possessions were in there. And she was going across the intersection as my car was at the light. So I was stuck there. And she came up and tried to get my attention or something. And so I wanted to know if I had any money. And I only had $2. I mean, I believe me, I could have afforded a lot more, but I literally only had $2. And I said, I said, this is all I have. I'm so sorry, but here's $2. And then she looked at me and she did like this with her hands. She said, God bless you. And I went, whoa. I mean, I am convinced that was an angel. It was like it was a very powerful whole thing later on that afternoon. When I was almost joking, some guy had a migraine and I said, well, he healed the name of Jesus. I wasn't even operating in faith. That was kind of being lighthearted. But because it was a secular environment. So I was being careful how to be not too, I said, be healed in Jesus name. And I started to go on. He said, Steve, stop. The moment you said that, that thing shot out of my head. I felt that thing leave my head. Well, that was minutes after this encounter with this lady. So I knew I had received something pretty profound. So all right. Here is Hannah is asking, what kind of prayer can you pray for your spouse who is still afflicted by childhood trauma? So I guess she's asking how to intercede. I would say if you can get them to lose all that trauma from their soul, that would be the best thing you could do. It says, you know, Jesus is the watcher of our soul, watch over our soul. And I do know that the prayers that we pray according to the scripture, it says what you lose on earth will be lost in heaven. The violence will be bound in heaven. So many people are learning now to, to, you don't have to become a soul doctor, but you need to be aware of how important your soul is. And those things that you lose in Jesus name will be taken. The Lord will come and take them from you from your memory, and they'll never bother you again. And I think that's so important for people to understand that. And so you lose to things that the enemy would put upon them, things you experienced yourself, saw yourself or heard that you shouldn't have. If you lose them from your soul, they'll be taken from you. But then you should always bind to your soul the love of God, the life of God, his presence, his will, his way. And then that will remain and never be taken from you. Well, that's good. I've never heard you say it quite like that before. You probably have said it, but it's sticking this time that I never heard you say, once you bind it to you, it won't be taken away from you. So that's, like you said, you probably said, now, she did say, how can I pray for my husband? So if he's not, if he goes, I don't know if I believe in that, honey, if he says, if he says, you can pray, but I don't know because he is her husband. Okay. Over your children, the same prayer, where you have authority or relationship, you have authority. Absolutely. Because the relationship, because they are choose as an act of my will to lose from my husband's soul. And then say those things that she wants to see lose from his soul. And then also say the same thing to bind the love of God, the life of God. And it's really good thing too, when she binds them to put them in his pillow, lay her hands on his pillow, or he sleeps at night, other things that he wears in his closet, that you can bind the love and the life of God to those things also. Good. Good. All right. Wendy's asking this, does every angel have a different name? Could there be like two Michaels or two angels with the same name? So that's your question. It could be, but everybody knows who they are. And, but most angels have all different names. So it'd be more common that every name would be different. Yes. Oh, wow. I know all have different names, or that I've been introduced to, or that I met in heaven or met on the earth, they all have different names. Okay. Good. All right. Nanette is asking this. Since we will not need protection from the elements in heaven, are some mansions without roofs at all? They have no roof? Absolutely. They don't have any roofs. Why would you have a roof on your home? If you have some homes, some engines have living waterfalls inside your home, the cascade down through your home, and it doesn't spoil or do anything to it. People want that. And so, and yeah, there's homes that don't have roofs on them. So they're both ways. They have a with roof and without roof, depending on what the person wanted. Interesting. Oh, I love the cascading water thing. It always is very relaxing to me. All right. Kim is asking this. I've never had children, but a wanted one with my husband, could I have one in heaven? And I think she must be saying, she must know that you can't have, give birth to children. So she must know that they're children. There are many there that can be adopted that for whatever reason, or for whatever reason, they never had what sounds weird that they didn't have parents. But there's a lot of people who give up their children, you know, for adoption and didn't raise them. And for whatever reason, those are kept in heaven. Yes, you can go with that one. Good. That's good. That's gonna make a lot of people happy. Lynette is asking this when we're unable to pray in tongues out loud, and she doesn't describe why they're unable. I don't, I assume that means she's in a public place or something. Yeah. But she says, can we still pray in tongues in our head? And is there still benefit to it? I don't know why you're praying in your head when you could be at home or go for a walk somewhere or anywhere and just pray or maybe pray quieter. It's very powerful to pray in tongues. It's a language that hell does not understand. So you're praying a prayer with between you and Jesus, you and God, that they hear, they understand and they, they will answer that prayer, that prayer will be answered. But there's such power in the words of the Holy Spirit. I mean, that's why he was sent to the earth. It was to help us become stronger and greater in all that we believe and all that we know. He also will train us and teach us things, Holy Spirit will. So it's more than just praying in tongues. It's actually a lifestyle and all the stuff that comes with it. Well, and it's interesting because I've had that question many times in my life too, because I've been places that I didn't want to speak out loud because they were people that didn't understand, but, but it is called tongues and tongues requires a tongue. Yes, it does people. It does. And it's very important to do that. But there's all kinds of places you go to go just to be alone. That's what you wanted to sit in your car. If you have a car, you know, it's not like you have to shout it, but most people want to shout it very loud. But that doesn't mean you have to do it, but it's very powerful to say it, to say it. That's why you have a tongue. You still talk in heaven. You talk in heaven, you sing in heaven, you still use your voice. It doesn't get taken away from you, especially it talks a lot about the power of the speaking in tongues. It's just powerful. I have a question that just popped in my head. I don't I've never asked this, but you know, people often say, will you pray for me? And you commit to praying and we always mean it, but there are times when we've forgotten to pray. When we said we were going to pray. And then the time pass. If a time pass and you said, oh Lord, I told him I'd pray, could they pray now and the prayer be effective retroactively? Have you ever? I think that that prayer would be answered, whether it was then or when they remembered it, but always pray as soon as you remember it. Oh God, just keep a journal. It's the most important thing you can do in your life is to have a journal. Even the father has a book she writes in. So I would say if you're going to do something like that, even just say pray for so and so and their name is in there. Maybe put a date to help you remember or get it or get a diary that's dated. Yeah, all the time. But yeah, I would think yes, absolutely. If you're sincerely meant to pray, and that was already in your heart to pray, I think that God would not be upset if you didn't pray, but always pray as soon as you remember. And I know that prayer will be answered. Good. Thank you. Alison's asking this, what was it like in heaven when Jesus was not in heaven, but on the earth? Could they, she's asking, could they feel him missing? I guess she's wanting to know was the atmosphere less than or they missed the Lord or anything? I don't think that it was less than because that was his home. That's where he that was where he came from. That's where he's going back from. I don't think that that happened. I think they were just really happy when he did come back. Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, that's been three for eternity. Father said Holy Spirit. Yeah. Okay. Brittany is asking this, have you ever seen Deborah in heaven? And if so, what did she look like? I don't know how you describe something, but maybe have you seen Deborah, the judge Deborah? I'm not sure that I saw, unless I just didn't know that was her, because I see a lot of people in passing and heaven and when they take me places, I see them. If I'm showing them and told this is who they are, then I absolutely can describe them. Okay. Okay. And I almost didn't ask this, but you used different words to describe, you tried to explain how big heaven is. The question is, Trisha is asking, how big is heaven? So I mean, what words would you use to describe the side? It's almost unlimited. I don't think there's any height or depth that you could even name or say. I mean, when it talks about the city of God in the Bible, all that, when it comes down from heaven, how huge that is on the newer, I don't know how you could give it. And they don't really operate with time and space in heaven anyways, almost unlimited. Yeah. When one of the times when you were on, I had done this research and found out that the city of God, the new Jerusalem was, of course, it's the same height. It's the same width, length, width and height. And so one direction is like from the west coast of the United States to like two thirds across the United States. That's the, that's one direction. And it was square. So square, square, and it's 1500 stages, something like that. So it's like, that's just the new Jerusalem. I know it is massive. Yeah. So, and it's like, you could put, you could put many populations of the earth in that thing, in that cube, you know. You're right. There's just one, there's just one space. Well, space is one place there. Yeah. That big. How much would all the rest of it take up if you could measure it? I don't know that there's a few places in heaven to talk about that you can measure like similar like that. Most places, it's just some limited. Amazing. Amazing. All right. Then Crystal is asking this, can people in, when they're in heaven, see the stars and the planets from heaven or? There's a place you go to in heaven on purpose to see them. Really? It's an open doorway. And when you walk through there, you're out in space. You mean you're like floating? You mean you're like you can fly out there. It's like there's nebulas, the other, the other planets, planets that aren't even seen from this earth are up there. Yeah. But there is, it's an amazing doorway. It's, it looks like an ancient, to me, it looks ancient. But when you step through, you don't see it before then. But once you step through that doorway, you see all of this space, all lit up, trails with stars that you can ride on, all kinds of things are out there. It's just, I don't know what people ever can really ever stop thinking about the splendor and the wonder. But that is a place that is filled with splendor and wonder. And it is a gate, it's like a gate, a gateway, but it is a doorway. And all you do, you walk up floating steps because I've seen it. Very cool. You enter into the place where that, that is, there's floating steps. You walk up these floating steps and you step through and you're in this place that looks like even more greater than just what, what enormous space this is. Is this what, when you described one time that space was more pink than darker, you're only remembering, right, what, what tenth is that when you go see space? Some of the sky heaven is like that, like a peachy pink. On the original earth, before the sun was made, the moon is made, the sky was a peachy pink. Wow. It had the water vehicle shield around it, which is how they had like rain come down. It didn't rain way back in that time when the angels walked on the earth and they found their footprints and thought they were like, you know, co-magnum man or something like that. Yeah. That was the angels. That was the angels. They used to walk with the dinosaurs when they were on the earth and other things, you know, the flowers were 200 feet high at that time, but the sky, because there was not sun. It was lit with the glory of God from the, from the earth itself. He put the glory in the earth. Wow. That's amazing. You know, I've never heard that thought even that some of the footprints they found could be, are you saying we may have been watch your angels have flesh on them, but they're not humans. Okay. Like, yeah. Yeah. Wow. Now, because it didn't have a father or mother, but he had flesh. He had flesh and he was sent to the earth on many assignments, like with Abraham and stuff like that. But he's part of a tribe. He's over a tribe of angels that are called watch your angels. And they were sent to the earth on the original earth to care for the creatures and the flowers and the water vapor shield, which was broken at one point on the earth. One of the times when the earth was flooded and the land masses shifted and that's when the dinosaurs got covered up and stuff like that. There's, there's sometimes questions you ask could go so long. Oh, I'm sure. Fascinating answers that people will hear. Now, this is fascinating. I mean, yeah, one time we may have to pick one top one area and just see on that. But yeah. All right. Here we go. Judy's asking, I've heard you talked about the breaker anointing. Could you explain more about what that is? If you know the breaker anointing, the breaker anointing is something to do with the the anointing that we all carry. We're all given a measure that when we're born again, even says that in the Bible. I think it's first John 227. I think that's where it is. That it says that when you receive Jesus Christ, you receive a deposit of the anointing that breaks off the anything, anything that would cause harm to you. It's people used to say that, you know, the anointing will bring glory and stuff like that. But it actually is a weapon. It's a weapon we can use really can speak that over people. Yeah, release the anointing that breaks all the strongholds of the enemy. That's what you're talking about. That's what that is. But it is like a weapon that we're given when we're born again. Is that a little bit different than laying on hands in place of the anointing? Another kind is speaking the same anointing or what? You can really can impart and send the anointing that you carry as a believer and you get a deposit because the more you use it in Jesus name, the more you use it, the stronger it grows, the greater area that you can affect with it. So it's really important. I used to teach people everywhere I went. Those were the first things I taught them how to impart or release the anointing that breaks the yoke of darkness or destroys the yoke of darkness people say above. You know, during my wife is very, very good at remembering. I will sometimes forget we go into a hotel room and I know you're supposed to pray and get stuff out of there. And sometimes I just forget and I'll see her walking around releasing the anointing in the pillows and the things that I don't know if she's she's being faithful. She's not forgetting that. And then you add to that the teaching that you had that you clarified recently. At least I heard it for the first time recently is that once you place the anointing on anything, it stays. It doesn't wash up. It remains. You go in the restaurant, at least in the table, the glass you're drinking out of, that anointing will remain and never leave that. That's incredible. That's a huge a family's home when you visit them, refrigerator handle, the front door handle. If you have a doormat, release it in there and yet it will affect people, affect things. That's very, very cool. Okay, probably have time for two more real quick here than our 45 minutes will be done. Jessica's asking, do birthmarks mean anything spiritually? And I've not heard that question. So what do birthmarks that someone has? Is there some sort of spiritual meaning to them? That's what she's asking. I don't know about that one. Yeah. Okay. And then Christine is saying, could you leave an unsafe person through a prayer of binding and losing things from their soul? Again, if they're unsaved, could they lead them through a prayer? Almost everybody gets saved when they do that because they're so overwhelmed that they're different. You feel so different when you do that. And you do have to use Jesus' name. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, you have to use his name. And many people get born again after having that happen. Their heart was broken. They had traumas in their life. And I explained them and said, this is given by Jesus Christ. So you're going to have to basically receive him because you have to use his name and only operates in his name and won't operate in any other name. So if you're willing to do that, and they always say, yes, I'm willing. That's really good. That's really good, Kat. Well, that's our time today. I appreciate it very much. Kat, tell people about your two websites, revealingheaven.com and catcurve.com. I will. I wanted to tell people that we've really been finding ways to celebrate all kinds of things that God has been doing for us and the things that have been happening with us, with our team and everything. So today I actually brought a piece of chocolate cake just like you have on the video. Oh, look at that. Oh, my mouth is watering right now. That's massive, Kat. That's so good. That's so good. There's six layers. Six layers. Six layers, did you say? Yeah, six layers. Fresh market, which makes awesome cake. So yeah, that's nice. And so I want to remind people, don't give up on your life. Don't give up on your family. Don't give up on your future. Don't give up on your destiny. Don't give up on the things that God has shared with you that you would do for him. You will do those things. You're chosen, you're anointed, you're appointed. That's what God does with you. He chooses you before you even leave heaven. He'll actually choose sometimes the person who you will marry before you ever leave heaven. And so there's many things he has. He's written in a book, a book that he's got for you when you get there. He needs to read all the things that he wrote in that for you. He writes about you continually all the time, the love he has for you, the plans he has for you. And you know, you can go before him and say, Father, I'm coming for your zone. I thank you for all the things you share with me. I'm so excited. I'm going to do those things. I want you to know that I trust you. I believe you. And I cannot wait for these things that happen in my life. You make him so happy. He loves it when you remember the things that he has shared with you. And when you say you trust him and you believe him, it is so important. You're about to get many subtleties in your life. I would encourage you to make sure that you do that quite often. And every morning when you wake up, thank him for the day. Bless him for the day. And then say, I choose to bind to my soul, your love, your life, your presence, your power, your will, your way, your celebration, your expectation of my life. I want you to know that I love you for that. And your son, Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit, my best friend, and the host of heaven, who are sent to watch over us and guard our deptas, all of our deptas. Amen. Amen. Amen. Very annoying. My goodness, that was really good. You can pray that morning and night, couldn't you? Yes. Yes. That's really good. Okay. Well, Kat, before we leave, tell people where they can go to find different things for you. Revealingheaven.com is one of them. Yeah. Revealingheaven.com is our main website. I went on there trying to find stuff the other night. I'm not so good about finding anything online, though. I don't know that I actually found all of it anyway, but we are still in a process of changing the website and laying out our new podcast schedule that we're going to be doing. And so you will get a podcast at least once a week. One of our people who live in Texas will be doing that, handling all that for us. We finally got someone who knows how to do that. And we're excited about that. So expect many new things. From God for you, from us, we reveal heaven to this earth, and that is what our main job is, is to do that for God. And so you can go to revealingheaven.com, you can find products there, all kinds of other information. Then you go to katcurve.com. Is that right, Jen? Yes. Katcurve.com is our other one that gives us also revelation. It's a spiritual platform. We're about to post a lot of new things on that platform. We do have a gallery with some new things that are being put on it. And just to let you know, here's our recorder right here that we do all the podcasts on. So here's our recorder. Oh, look at that. We can use it now, and we'll probably be doing them. Now, these are only audio, but it doesn't matter. We're very funny. You've learned a lot of stuff. Sometimes you hear new things you've never heard before. Jen is always online and recording with me. And so we have a lot of time together, sit and talk. Sometimes my mom is on. That's real exciting. Every now and then, we let Bing on there if we want some more jokes. More dad jokes. This is something that we will be doing so that you won't lose track of us. We promise that. And we want to thank Steve for all of the time, not that we're going to leave him in the rain at all. But for this time, trying to get everything set up is a blessing that we get like an extra time during the week. We actually have a lot more time than that we're spending. But we have many things that we're going to get ready for y'all. And there's going to be a lot more heaven released into this earth and into the atmosphere. So thank you so much. And that is, of course, catcurve.com is also the only place you can give online to us. And we give it to you all. So we're never going to send you some kind of a text or a message or whatever else you call those other things. What do you call them, Jen? Facebook message. Yeah, we won't send you a Facebook message telling you to go to this site and give money to somebody. We're not going to do that because we know a lot of people have money taken from them or it's misused. We won't do that. So catcurve.com, click on the treasury. And if you want to become a regular giver, we want to thank you from our heart truly. And guess what? Now that we have our new offices, one of the first things we'll be working on is getting all the stuff together for the guardian's own to give out and send to our guardians. We so appreciate you. Make sure you give to Steve and Doreen. They work so hard and have suffered so hard. We do really appreciate them. And so we bless you in the name of the Lord. May his presence overwhelm you. May his life flow into you. May his presence walk and be in your halls, in your walls, in your homes, in Jesus name. May you hear him clearly. May you have clarity in your life so you know what he has for you to do right now. In Jesus' name I release in the heart the anointing that destroys every yoke of hell or darkness in Jesus' name. And I also wish you the love of God, the life of God. Right now, God, I thank you for watching over them. I thank you Jesus Christ for being our Lord and our Savior and our friend also. We love you all. Blessings in the name of the Lord and healing power in Jesus' name for all. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. All right, Cat. God bless you. We love you. Love all of you. Give our love to Bing and Jen and anyone else that's around here. Your mom and Margaret and anyone else. All right. Have an amazing day, Cat. The rest of the day. And we will see everybody tomorrow, Thursday morning, 11 o'clock Pacific. Have a great day. Bye-bye.
