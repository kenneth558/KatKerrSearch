This is the end of this video. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. Happy Wednesday, August 17, 2022. Welcome to the broadcast. It's going to be a great show today. We have Kat Kerr as always. It's going to be right an hour show starting now. She's got some other things she needs to do. This is the day before Eric Trump comes. So Eric Trump will be here tomorrow. Do not miss this. Be sure and text your friends. Call your friends and let them know. We've got some great questions for Eric. It's going to be great. Oh, by the way, yes. Thank you, Julie. It is 8 a.m. tomorrow. I would have forgotten that. It's 8 a.m. Pacific time. If you're on the East Coast, it will be 11. It's 8 a.m. in the morning. That's when we could get him. We're happy to do that. We did that one other time with General Flynn. It is 8 o'clock in the morning Pacific time. So there you have it. I'm just making sure I'm not missing any notes here. Before we bring Kat on, let's bring Mike and Lori Sally on. Let's talk about the wells. They are spearheading the whole thing, the whole project. I can't wait to hear all about it. So Mike and Lori Sally, take it away. Yeah, go ahead, Lori. We are so excited to update you specifically about the water wells in Uganda. I think one of your shows you shared about that we had had 300 salvations. Well, now it's up to over 800 people who have given their lives to Jesus because of these water wells. I was just in shock. Who knew that Jesus, we know he can turn water into wine, but who knew he was going to make these water wells and share the gospel in such an impactful way. People just be... I had always hoped that maybe a person or two would come to Jesus because of this, but I had no idea that this would be an evangelism tool where hundreds and hundreds, and we just think we're just getting started. We're just getting started. We're now doing a well a week. Every week, one well. So, wow. So we're up to 47 new wells that Elijah Streams has provided. 47. I was looking at the big organization that does work in Uganda and all of last year and then all they do is water. All they do. And they did 42 water projects, not even wells in the entire year. Really? Yeah. It's incredible the pace and the excitement of the people and I was surprised as well as how many people are coming to know Jesus because of this. It's crazy. It's not normal, actually. It's something God's doing. The anointing is all over this project and just the investment that people are making. It's incredible. I wanted to share one of the stories. So I was asking my team, like, tell me what does it look like? I mean, how is this happening? How are they sharing the gospel? Because, normally, I mean, pastors are out there sharing all the time and in this one particular area, so Elijah Streams, we are drilling wells in different parts of Uganda, not all in the same exact spot. So it's in different areas. One area that is really, really dry, it's a drought area and so it's kind of like the forgotten people. It's drought. They don't have a lot of government assistance. They don't have many organizations that are coming there to help and so what they've been doing is as the water company is coming out with their equipment, they're renting a speaker and hooking it up to a car and they're driving through the village and they're kind of announcing, hey, we want you to know what Jesus is doing. There's people that love Jesus, that are responding to him and they care about you and he cares about you and they want you to know about him and so then they start sharing the gospel and then right behind them, not very far, there's these huge, massive trucks that have these huge drilling implements and things and my team is telling me that not only are the water wells an amazing thing, but the fact that we're using this equipment, the technology that we're using to drill these wells is abnormal for them because normally when people come and drill a well, they do it by hand and we're thankful for those that are able to do that, but it's not as efficient because you can't go as deep, it's actually dangerous to do it like that, but people are in awe and imagine if it's not every day you see massive trucks coming in, you know, whenever they're in these villages, when strangers come, everybody stops what they're doing and they run and they want to know what's going on so they're using that first introduction of here's why we're doing this and then they're watching the process the entire time and then when they hit water, then when they hit water, they do a big commissioning and they gather everybody together and that's when their hearts are touched and they were telling me this story about this one woman, she's 71 years old and to me when I hear 71, that doesn't seem that old because I'm, you know, I'm in my 50s so 70 doesn't seem like it's that old but in Uganda that is old the life expectancy isn't that long, we know Jesus can do it 120 years more than that, but 71 she's considered an elder in her community and my team is telling me that she has zero faith, normally in Uganda you find people that are either, they adopt something, whether they're really born again or not and they say born again, we say Christians in the states but they always say born again and that means you're really born again she didn't believe in anything or she didn't really ascribe to any particular thing, she must have believed in a higher being because she testified that she used to say to whatever higher being she was talking to if somebody would come and solve this water crisis because I've been suffering, my parents were suffering my children are suffering, now my grandchildren are suffering and then whenever we came in and drilled this water and she saw the water coming she just started yelling God is alive, God is alive God is alive that's amazing she was so excited she truly was like the woman at the well because she then gave her life to Jesus people followed suit, they followed her, they thought if she believes in Jesus, I want the same Jesus and it was remarkable so Steve, over 800 people I can't I mean I do but it's like I mean I thought maybe a person or two would come to the Lord because of these wells, I had, I never saw this coming, not even close and we're just getting started one well a week it'll probably increase unless you run out of land to drill wells I don't think we'll run out of land there's a lot of people who contact us all the time really? oh yeah, all the time tell me about that for a minute do other people call and say bring a well here or what? I get emails every week from people that hear about what's going on with Elijah's streams and how we're providing this water can you do one for me here's somebody I know in this village that needs help here's a school that needs help I don't think we've gotten close to tapping out the potential yet and so it's pretty exciting just let those that are watching know it's not as easy as just people contacting and saying hey I need a water well here because we're trying to work with reputable well drillers that we can make sure that we're going to go deep enough and the water is going to be sustainable because you hear stories of water wells that were drilled by different organizations and maybe they're drilling it and go deep enough and then it ends up running dry and that's what we don't want that to happen so we're trying to do it through relations I know you brought a video your daughter Caitlin made this video so let's watch that video about it's kind of the latest I laughed because he said we're emptying hell and we're populating hell but you can populate but we understand what he means he said we're doing damage big time to hell I mean we are literally coming against hell so let's watch that video this year 2022 the recharge plants have been started so your denerasty is not only providing clean water but is emptying hell and populating heaven by souls coming to the kingdom and we talk about your Elijah's things so everyone prays for you and God bless you so very much Mike and Lorde Salle this is amazing before the launch of this power hall Moscow has been preached and about 15 people have accepted in Christ as Lord and Savior and even land has been donated to start a church in this place this is a testimony this is amazing these are 15 souls they have come to the kingdom of God today because of the donation of the power hall thank you very much it's so exciting he's like a kid isn't he well I'm like a kid you know I'm sitting here you guys are the same thing look what's going on I mean I can't believe it I do believe it but we are above and beyond anything I think any of us expected to happen wait to see what God is doing for sure well thank you both for coming I see Kat is now here so blessings to you both I appreciate it Mike and Lorde you're working with us very strongly to look into water situations that we will be talking about very very soon here in the states you are here and we're looking at a lot of different things related to the water so we'll be reporting that and a lot of people don't know we're helping a lot of other people even not related to the water but everyone who sows into this ministry receives a reward from him I mean without you know he says even if you give so much as a cup of cold water to one of these you will not lose your reward can you imagine the rewards God's passing out in heaven and on earth thank you to all of our viewers we appreciate it very much so thank you Mike and Lorde we'll see you soon and we'll bring on Kat bless you guys okay so without further ado let's do Wednesdays with Kat and Steve music and there she is hey Kat how are you I'm great thank you so good to have you back I got my Disneyland tie on and tell people why it's okay to still love Disneyland even though we hear some of these bad things you know I always look at the roots of something or the foundation of something and well we can even look at the throne of God Satan has taken many things that are actually some of the father's images the way he operates and he is on the earth polluted them and made them not good but that doesn't mean it's okay to partake of Satan stuff I'm just making an example Walt Disney was put on the earth by God at the time he was put on here and he was put here to create fun in family entertainment that's why people think well he doesn't care about entertainment well they have it in heaven people movies in heaven is all kinds of roller coasters because God knows we need fun and heaven I say is a good bit fun it is holy is pure there's nothing defiling there's no profanity there's no wickedness anywhere in heaven not in anything to create or make there but Walt had this passion in his heart to make a place that families could come and bring their children because even in those days there was a lot of craziness going on in the 60s and things weren't turning in the best direction in that time and so many things were going on that were not good he was determined and he really fought hard well in Orlando especially to get the land for Disney World but the reason he created that in those characters was so we could have something to laugh at and have fun and he is not happy himself right now with stuff that's going on but it is going to change and the father has adamantly told me it's going to change so a lot of maybe people might end up being removed and have this replaced there because I know when Walt was on the earth he was adamant about keeping it at a level that what was produced and the content that was produced not just at that time but for years to come could be enjoyed by family, by children and know that they were going to see something safe and when Disney World was open I actually went to the park here in Florida the first year they were open it was so many masses of people were coming to enjoy and talking about Disney I always appreciated was he always showed in his movies or any of the other things he created you knew the difference between good and evil and every time good would be the victor in the movies and any of the sets he made and he made sure that you knew that this was evil and it was dark and it was not good and yet this was filled with life and light and so I loved it the heroes always saved the day and it overcame every evil obstacle or thing that was in any of the movies or things he produced and so I always appreciated that with Walt and if he was here today that's exactly what would still be happening instead of compromise and darkness invading parts of that there are going to be some covert activities going on in there and no one's going to know anything about it except God himself but things are about to start changing in Disneyland and in Disney World and I don't know if that means something might close for a while or things are being changed or things there's going to be so many things accelerated in these days where darkness is going to be pushed back and that doesn't mean it might close completely but what it'll mean is darkness will be pushed out of places and out of entertainment especially and those who make wicked movies will bomb and they'll lose their shirt if they keep doing it when this whole thing shifts so I do appreciate Walt and all that he created for families if you ever go to either one of those places you can see his own personal comments on the walls in the place and he was so appreciated the people who helped to build the place and the ones who work there now his own comments about how he feels about them he appreciates all of their efforts to help everyone have the time to make it safe and he called them a team he never took direct credit for everything he always gave credit to everyone who was a part of what he did which I also admired in him that he considered everybody involved and he wasn't just the only one that was doing anything and then of course we know there's other people involved in that place now that is not Walt's plans or his ideas some of them that are being put out there now and even in the new things that are being made there's a whole entire different content in it that most believers or even good moral people would not appreciate but just wait and see that will also change I'm glad you see your Donald Duck it's such a special place they opened the doors the year I was born 1955 I met my wife across the street from Disneyland at the convention center on our honeymoon it's just a real special place and yeah there'll be some bad apples that'll get gone and it's interesting to hear what you just said but some people think well then this must be an evil place don't think that Walt Disney's DNA is still in that thing I remember hearing a story that that he and his brother Roy eventually ran the place after he passed but Roy didn't want to spend the money he didn't want to put gold on the top of the castle there's a point or something and so Walt waited until he was got a vacation or something and he went up there and had the people put gold up there I mean I assume it was gold paint but anyway he spent the money he wanted top notch anyway so fun listen I know we have to stop at the top of the hour because of things that people have to do but anything else you want to share before we get into questions I was thinking of something just a minute ago I did want to say one more thing about Disney World I think when you're prayed up when you go there you may have opportunities to minister to people I'm not saying everybody there is bad or wicked some stuff going on or being controlled by certain people who are not very good people and I'm not going to name names or anything I'm just saying keep it in your prayers I know Walt is declaring from heaven over it absolutely and that is something God gave him to create and he was very pleased with it he's not so pleased now but it's going to change I just want to encourage people to make sure and no matter where you go this is just for parents of young children make sure you always keep your kids with you make sure you see them and know who they're with please don't just drop them off at some friends house that you don't even know the friends or the family I would do that anyway I always was like that anyway I was always very careful with my children who babysat them but if we went to a big place we made sure we made rules to go in there to make sure we all knew where everybody was if a child was always with an adult that went with us and these days right now with all the stuff going on that would be a good tip for everybody really really really good alright well I have questions for you a whole list of questions here so let me just start with the first one Nathaniel asks and I hadn't heard of this before but here he goes he says I've heard that there are angels that stand at the four corners of our home is this true or are the angels all over our home in and out so that's his question I think it depends on where you put them where you post them you are allowed to say to the angels who are sent to protect you all the time you and your family they're sentries and they're posted here by your home and they pretty much stay around your home you have others that leave and go with you when you go places and I just tell them I'm going to post a sentry at each corner of my home I'm going to post so many over the home and even down the road and they actually go there and that's what they do they watch for anything of darkness coming they pull down strongholds they shred platforms trying to control us spirits of wickedness or whatever of darkness that want to control us or take things from us so they do both they will even march around on your property and watch it all the time or you can post them as sentries in certain places and if you have a second place you can also post sentries there and that is their number one job which will protect that area that they're assigned to that's really good you know I live on acreage that's not all my acreage there's actually a few hundred acres it belongs to the neighbors but in order to keep the dare out I'm involved inside the fence so they put a fence around it I didn't realize this about sentries this is the first time I've heard you say that that I can recall but I felt I was supposed to post sentries and I used that word at every post on the fence around all the property my neighbors as well I said if anyone gets anywhere near us to try to do harm I want them to see these sentries as and I said let them think they're police officers let them whatever if they try to do harm so I don't know what you think about that well you can actually also tell them to expose anyone who's coming, why they're coming and they actually can stop them from coming they'll actually stop them they'll actually interfere with someone trying to come in on the property and that might be appearing them that might be them saying something and even if they can't see them they would hear that so that's what sentries do is keep things away from you and to make sure that your life and your property is safe so you did the right thing by posting sentries that's really good I got really serious one day because there had been evidence of an invasion and I thought I'm not having this I went to town I took off after that alright Star is asking this question she says some of us write letters to God just simply write things down to Him, to God does the Father receive those letters and if He does how does He receive them there's several different ways that can happen I would encourage you if you wrote one read it out loud to Him you can do that when you're just by yourself in your prayer time or just in the time when you're walking or just doing something you can actually read it to Him say Father I have written this letter to you and read it to Him and it's going to hear you read that letter and they probably record it it's probably recorded in heaven they do a lot of recording there's angels that's what they do and they're sent for that they actually record things there's couriers, there's scribes who write things down or else they write things down and you say or they bring messages from heaven that are written I've had both of those happen to me before but absolutely I'm just standing in a spot and just say to your family member I love you, I just want you to know I haven't forgotten you I'm excited about one day being there with you then He'll make sure they hear that people think everything's so far away but especially the Father, the Son of the Holy Spirit if you wanted to really say something to them He loves, by the way writing that thing down is an MO it's a motive operations of the Father He does have we know He has the lamest book of life we know that He has a book of remembrance He actually has many and they're real books they're huge books and He does actually write in them, He likes to write things out Christ would rather say it but the Father writes things down you know He wrote a book about your life before you were even born so I would say you writing things down maybe a good thing would be to get a journal and if you think of something each day to say something to Him then you write down the date and what you wanted to say to Him and make sure He hears that and the other thing you can do with that journal is when He begins to answer you it may be that still small voice inside but you know it's Him answering because He's answering what you just said to Him so that way you can have a two-way conversation and you can record it in a journal and then you can enjoy looking at it later on or maybe leave that for your children one day and they might be surprised if that's said to you or what you said to Him so authorship is a really big thing in heaven everyone has written a book that represents God or heaven or just something really fun but decent they're already on library shelves and your books are already in heaven do you mean everyone's written a book whether they've written it here or not what do you mean by that you said everyone some people still write books in heaven do you but are you saying people that don't write here are actually in effect authoring a book there I'm not quite sure what you're saying what I'm saying is those who have authored a book here those books I saw my own books in a library in heaven so I do know and I was told those who become authors is so important because even when you're gone that book remains here and those words will still be read by people and it may be something spiritual or it could be something just a help book or just something funny that's really decent and people love to read and there's still people who read books at all so you can go get them out of the library or you can just request to have one yourself there in heaven and you have a place for a library in your own mansion so people still still love to read well I thought it was cool when Bill Johnson had my book in his library if my book is in heaven that's way cooler yeah that's very very cool okay let me come back for a moment to this just popped into my head I think I'm supposed to share it like so it's almost 15 years ago I didn't know you yet I hadn't heard about either sentries or hosts but I was a praying man and my oldest daughter got in trouble she gave her phone number to a guy in the market and I was furious not at her but that this would happen that he would have it and he started calling and I ripped into the spirit realm and I prayed every prayer every kind of emotion about I wanted God to take it take notice and take action and protect her does God pay attention to the the amount to me there was faith behind that emotion because I knew God would act does God pay attention to our how do I say this angry faith if I can put it that way angry against the devil is what I mean I would say that's called passionate you're fierce against what the enemy is doing of course the fathers can hear you I'm absolutely sure many times he's going to answer that prayer and it may not be the way you think it will happen but it will happen and I've also seen that but you know passionate people God those people who have a passion and you're expressing what you're feeling and what you're thinking especially if it's something that lines up with what God wants and he speaks in this word about protecting and guarding your words and keeping certain people away from you because he doesn't want your family life infiltrated by the enemy or a thing that the enemy could use against you so absolutely especially the words of a parent for the child he's absolutely going to pay attention to that that's kind of like you hear about mama bear I became papa bear I can't remember any time in all of my life I prayed that intensely for my daughter but I felt there was an urgency so I let it rip alright Margaret asked is God the father and or heaven going through time with us on the earth even though the father can move back and forth in and out of time is there a sense of past present and future to Jesus Holy Spirit and the people in heaven so I think I understand where they're coming from do they get a sense of time because we're in time I'm quite sure heaven is very much aware of what's going on in any time actually the father's omnipresent he knows exactly what's going on where's going on and everything so he he has to be aware of what's going on so he can send help or send words or scribes or couriers for whatever purpose so yes he is very much aware even though he's not held by time or bound by time and doesn't operate like the way we operate here in time we have hours we're awake and hours we're sleep they don't sleep in heaven they don't have to but he's still very much aware of what's going on and all over the earth at different times on the earth so yes he's like he's present all the time no matter where we are what's going on and of course he can still go into the past and see things he can go into the future and see things the Bible says he's been from the beginning there would be time from the beginning to the end there is a beginning of time that was right when he first made the earth the end of time is when he wraps it all up and then he makes the new earth and then we're just in eternity we'll be in eternity but during this time I said time during this seasons of our life where time is very much involved with us with heaven then they are seeing things all the time as it's going by but he also knows the end of things at the same time so it's like if we're agonizing in prayer for something to happen that we want or think we need or we do need and there is a sense where God will say it's not time yet for that he'll know that it's three months in the future so he does operate within that framework he knows that this is for three months from now that kind of thing he already knows that he already knows when things are going to happen and even what's going to happen even though people have wills of their own he's already actually been through all of time he's seen all of time already but right now as we're speaking he is watching and he's listening so he can be anywhere at the same time that's one of the great things about him so he's very much involved in our lives at the same time and even does know what that end looks like and I've already told people that he actually did show me when the end of time would be and it's not really a date it's an event and I've learned that about him most of the things he plans and things for on the earth he goes by those events that he has planned and those are things that will happen in the earth that he has planned are going to happen but he did tell me one time he said there will be a day that will come when time will be no more because I won't need time and you won't need time on the earth on the new earth we won't have a clock we won't have things like that going on we will be living forever and we will also plan things by events at that time on the new earth but when everything ends is when time will be no more because he doesn't need time on this earth the reason he needs time now is because he's sending those little spirits from him, that's where everybody came from you lived in him but this is what he said time will be no more when I have sent the last one from myself I won't need time that's good I have a question about time now that we're on the subject Manuel Johnson talks about he's been transported in the future and the past so have you well God took him in the past he transported him in the past he showed him what happened he was there and it brought healing to his soul because God showed him this and that I don't know the whole story because I'm probably not doing it justice but great healing came to him by God taking him back in time does God do that sometimes does he see a need to bring someone back in time I think that he probably does because I know several other people who have encounters like that and I have been taken back in time quite a few times it was all related to things that happened in the Word of God or the way he made heaven the way he made the earth it was always related to revelation when he takes me back in time like he showed me his son on the cross and what happened when he had his spirit leave he took me back and I saw paradise or Abraham's bosom while he was there with the thief I saw him also when he was in hell approached the gates of hell and they were taking him and I saw what happened on the third day I was taken back back in the book of Acts when the Holy Spirit came and invaded in the upper room I mean there's many times he's taken me back I was taken back to the tomb the very day that he came out of that tomb I was taken that day back in time and I actually felt myself traveling it was the one time I felt myself traveling through time and I told people it was like on Star Trek or Star Wars when you go warp speed and those like shoot past you it is exactly like that I know they probably got that idea from the idea zone in heaven about how it looks like when you travel but it actually did and I actually could feel myself moving whenever we got to the part of time God wanted me to see we stopped and my feet just touched the ground crazy and it's like a portal open and I was there I was literally there in that time and I saw Mary go into the tomb looking for him and she saw the person in the garden and she came out and she thought he was the gardener because Christ was actually standing in the flowerbed smelling the flowers when these things happen both that and all the other back in time to be very very clear you went in that time this wasn't a vision a 3D experience you actually were there during the time it actually I was actually there I was wide awake I don't sleep long enough to dream I almost never dream and I have sometimes visions but this is called an encounter an encounter is you are actually there he's not showing me a film my feet touched the ground outside the tomb I saw the stone had been rolled away it was actually quite a ways down thing I also saw Christ standing he has a back turn to where the tomb was and he was literally looking at the flowers because he loves flowers and he had just been through 3 days of you know what and so when he came out of there after thanking his father for all that he had done for him he wanted to be in the midst of the flowers and I actually say Mary surmised or thought he was the gardener and she spoke to him she said her name she knew instantly when she heard him speak that it was him and then he turned around and of course she saw him then and I saw that in person, in that time that's how it happens people and instead of bashing people saying why not ask God to give you an encounter and show you something powerful I've been taking it up many many times for me and I didn't take myself I have to make it clear I didn't take myself that God had purpose for me and he'd already told me we're going to take you back in time, forward in time we're going to give you revelation on the word revelation on the times you're in and show you things to come and if you remember in Revelation 4 he actually said that to John I will show you things to come and so that's one of the things that God does with his prophets and so I was literally there in person remember the feeling of the ground the smell of the flowers everything about that place amazing Bobby Connor tells a story about going to the crucifixion not a vision not a 3D idea he was actually there and he said the smells the sights, the sounds you know have you been to the crucifixion as well? I saw a part of the crucifixion it was more what I heard him saying and they were of course very upset that he had died but we know that he actually the thing about Christ was he was such a powerful being he had to lose his soul from his body he actually had to tell it to leave he knew he had to die and so they probably were wondering why in the world hasn't that guy died they even put the sword inside and everything but he finally knew that it was time so he just lost his soul from his body and his spirit man left his body and then of course he was there his body remained on the cross until they took it down they were wrapping it the women were crying John was but John remembered also the words Christ said that he would rise again and so it was a very powerful thing people in the city people I could hear crying in the whole area there that he had died because they loved him so much he had helped so many people and did so many miracles they said you couldn't even put him in a book there were so many people count the miracles it says if the books were written of all the things he did the books would go around the world like the planet people so he was non-stop all the time doing his work that God gave him to do and so it was an emotional time but of course I already knew that he was going to raise from the dead but I had visited that place and then of course I was taken back when he came out of the tomb and then I was taken back when he was down in hell and then I was taken back I was taken back in time when he actually was sent into heaven and one of the angels had this urn with his blood because he had to pour that out on the mercy seat in heaven and so he showed me these things and he showed me the reality of the word of God it was so powerful but yes I have encounters he clearly comes and takes me just takes me like in a second and it doesn't matter where I am really and I gave him permission so it might be better if you say I give you permission to take me whenever you want to or speak to me whenever you want to that encourages him to do it actually and I don't even say that to him when he told me this is what we're going to have you do commission on the earth as a revelator this is what you're going to do and I said I'd give you permission whenever you want to and I guess while we're talking about time okay now you got me I have heard you and others talk about okay he said to the thief that was saved that became saved he said I'm telling you this day today you will be with me in paradise he didn't say in hell he said in paradise I have not heard anyone say during those three days what did he do in paradise no one's ever really related that to me at least well the first thing he did was preach the gospel to all of them it said he it said that he took captivity captive the captivity that was it was called Abraham's wisdom and paradise it is the same place where the dead we died if you were faithful and knew God and believed in God himself this is before the Messiah came God counted that your faith as being you know you were just and you were faithful so he didn't send them to hell they couldn't ascend to heaven though because Christ hadn't gone back to heaven pour out the blood except of course we know Elijah and Enoch literally were taken to heaven in their bodies and they're still there in the physical bodies I believe that they were glorified when he took them up to heaven already because they didn't have to die and that was the Father's choice to do that but but it is quite a thing for God to trust you to do things and share things for him but yes but that's his choice to take me I don't take myself but he actually entered into paradise because he had to keep his word to the thief thank you Holy Spirit said the XT he had to keep his word and he didn't say I'll see you tomorrow he said this day that day that day and so when he died they actually I think he died before the thieves didn't they have to come break their legs so they would die I think so because they had to break the legs and all that with the thieves so Christ descended into paradise paradise was not a place with rocks and you think well it's in the earth there's a bunch of rocks sitting around it was a city it was a beautiful city God made faithful and that's where his friends he called Abraham you know that was his friend many others of back in the Old Testament were friends of God because they chose to be friends of God and he didn't send them to hell they still had to they had to descend though when you believe in Christ now and you die you don't descend at all you ascend into heaven that's where he does the big difference because Christ has been there he made the way back he cleansed it he put the blood on the altar showing that he had died for everyone's sins and so that changed everything about for those who died that believed in Christ it changed some things happen that change everything and so yes he did go down there he was talking to Abraham he was talking to Joseph who raised him he was talking to all those people the faith of David all of those were in paradise and at one point they all exited and left paradise is empty now there's nothing there it's still there people actually asked me would Satan take it over he doesn't have the ability to take paradise over that's like a holy place that God made for those who loved him and believed in him and no hell can't take paradise and use it people he's never going to get paradise so he would have taken Joseph the one who was sold in Egypt he would have taken David Solomon and he would have preached the gospel and said this is what it means to be saved this is what I had to do that kind of thing he would have told the whole story he literally changed the gospel as if you tell people that Jesus Christ gave his life that he gave his life so that we might have a way to go back to heaven where we all came from there had to be a prize paid there had to be a sacrifice made and he actually told all of them they had like a gathering and he just preached the gospel to everybody there and everyone there received him as their Messiah they had to receive him as their Messiah because that's what makes it possible for you to go you know to go into heaven and so he did he preached the gospel he said he preached the gospel and so then he took captivity he captivated them with his love and his sacrifice for all for all those who choose him and so they then eventually they did exit Abraham's bosom or paradise and they are all now in heaven they don't use that anymore it's not used but it is still there it had golden buildings it actually had a river now these are spiritual places because you're there in your spiritual body I will explain to people the difference of being in the flesh and being in the spirit you have a spiritual body and it looks like you but it looks a lot better you look young you're full of energy and life and so when you died you entered into this spiritual round place that was paradise or if you were wicked there's a great gulf that separates those places I think the people in paradise can see the gates of hell and they know hell if they come up to the gates can see like it's like I can't think of what you call it a balcony they see like this big balcony that they can see in a far distance because remember the dream that the wicked man had and he wanted the beggar to bring a drop of water and put it on his tongue burning in hell that dream was real that was real and that's a good way to explain you read that dream and see what happened there was a hell he was burning in hell and he was telling God please send someone to earth to tell them about this place it's horrible I don't want my family to come here and of course God's answer to him was it wouldn't matter who came they're wicked in their heart and they don't want it and he said so that but he would not send Lazarus who was a beggar who was a beggar on the earth and he was they could see that he's eating he knew they were eating there's like a king's table a feast set there you still eat in your spiritual body people in heaven and these people in paradise were eating they had buildings that they stayed in they had a beautiful river they even had a sky because it was a spiritual place oh wow okay of the year he wouldn't take his friends who actually believed in him and lived right he wouldn't send them to place it was a dark money place here you are in the middle of the earth sitting next to the lava that wasn't going to happen God made this place beautiful and it and it was beautiful let me ask this one last question because I know we have to stop at the top of the hour there was a great earthquake when Jesus was crucified and graves were open what have you seen if anything as far as that have you seen that event graves open the earthquake I know it didn't happen I know that the earthquake was shook and graves open and people saw I'm trying to remember I don't know if they gave a number or something but it was quite a few it was quite a few hundred I believe they were actually noted it was noted and written somewhere I don't know maybe Josephus or somebody wrote that down but it does mention in the Bible that they had an earthquake and the graves were opened and they saw people walk it was just another testimony that that was the son of God I mean a lot of people began to believe that was the son of God cross that was the son of God because he knows that couldn't have happened any other way so that really did happen people came up out of the graves and they walked around it was fascinating it was fascinating but you know it's interesting because you know it shows integrity on your part because you're not making it up if God didn't show you you're not saying God showed me you're saying I didn't see people walking out of the grave people walking out of the graves when there was an earthquake so that to me that adds credibility to you because you could make something out of it I wasn't taking and showing those people walking but I do know that did happen I do know that did happen they still talk about it in heaven sometimes wow I'd love to see a video of that and I guess in heaven we get to see replays that we want right if we want to see what that looks like absolutely can see replays awesome I like those are the kind of re-runs I want to see that if you will pray for the people before we go and just bless them if you will Father I thank you for this beautiful day I thank you for your holy son our king of kings I thank you for Holy Spirit who can be our best friend but is still God he was sent to come alongside us and then when we choose to invite him to indwell us he actually moves on the inside of us and then he'll never stop talking to us but I thank you for that that you are very much involved in our lives and you do care for everyone and I pray Father that people have to understand they need to understand that when they have someone who belongs to Jesus Christ and they receive Jesus Christ when they move to heaven it is a good thing it is a good thing for them that's why they celebrate in heaven they don't weep and cry when someone comes home they celebrate because God loves it when one of his children come home one of his sons or his daughters they come home to heaven they actually have a huge celebration rewards are given from the throne at that time and then all their family and friends go to see this person's mansion and then they get undone by how beautiful and amazing or adventurous even these mansions are so powerful thank you Father for thinking of us in the past now in this time and in the future you know where we are you know that we love you I thank you in these days set a table and the presence of everyone's enemies that would be the left that would be the liberals all those evil people colluding and flaming together to take over this world which makes me laugh ha ha ha because this earth was made by you and your son and it says the earth and the focus now belongs to Jesus Christ the earth is your footstool because you're ever watching us thank you for intervening in lives people have lost things like their property or their money is running low I thank you right now you take out of your own stock and you give to those people Father because they're trusting you they're believing you and they're staying excited I thank you for showing yourself strong on their path in these days right now in Jesus name so be it and everyone said amen and amen I just want to encourage people to go to revealingheaven.com cats two books are there and other products go to catcur.com that's the only place

You Welcome to Elijah streams. It happens to be Tuesday, August 16, but we're recording this for a week from Wednesday So whatever that date is someone can put that on the screen for me. I forgot to look that up, but August this is for August 24 Even though we're recording it on August 16. So we're on with cat. It's going to be good. So if anything she says happens to be Historically incorrect because more things have happened. You'll understand why so it's going to be a great show There's no I have no other announcement. So let's If you all are ready, I'm ready. So let's watch Wednesdays with cat and Steve. Here we go Well, hello, I don't know which to say happy Wednesday. I can't say that because it's not How are you doing cat you just I'm doing great. That's always gonna be my answer You got your you were just telling me got a brand new scarf and shirt. Is that we were saying I have everything new. Okay, the jacket which is really cool You can't see. There you go. You can see powers really beautifully engraved. I just got that yesterday in the shirt which I would have worn on the platform And my scarf and yeah I was going to the salon today and the Holy Spirit said you were in that brand new black shirt looks really nice and you wear the new jacket and I'm thinking I think it could get wet. You never know when you're going to go to salon was going to happen. He said no, go ahead and wear it. Not telling me why and I'm sitting in there in the chair at the salon and she's almost done with me When I get it when I get a call and say did you remember that you had to record something with Steve Schultz? No, I didn't but now I know why he told me to wear this. I walked in the door literally walked in the door and just sat in the chair so Holy Spirit needs to be your best friend. Let me tell you he'll let you know all kinds of things you wouldn't expect that he would And so here I am today and that's very cool. You know lately Darin and I have been practicing that every not I was I was about to say every once in a while very often now all of a sudden I'll remember something We went to bed and it gets cold in a certain part of our house even though it's summer and she went to bed and she and she said I think I might have left the heater on that little portable heater so she went out there and she said the Holy Spirit keeps telling me stuff but it's not like a voice necessarily she just all of a sudden she thinks about inside that's what yeah exactly so I keep saying thank you thank you Holy Spirit thank you, you know, I think him today. That's awesome. So, so it's I would encourage people when you suddenly remember something and it was important, say thank you Holy Spirit right. Yes, absolutely say thank you. You're so so good and he likes gratitude I found that out so. Yes, he does that that that will intensify the actual friendship one if you're thanking him all the time. Oh yeah, I do thank him all the time I think him the father of something I think I think I think them I think the Trinity. Sometimes it's the father of the Lord, most of the time the Holy Spirit is when he talks to me about every day stuff, or even reminds me of things and like I can't lose anything no matter what I can't find. He either shows me where it's at literally a picture of where it's at, or it just comes back. It just comes back. What do you mean it comes back what do you mean. If I found if I've misplaced something really important and I really need it. And I've looked a little bit for it. Well there's something I always say you all need to just learn this. If I can't find something I always say these words, and they always work. It's not the word is what you're saying. And I say Holy Spirit you know where everything is it was ever made that is made right now and never will be made. Please show me where and I say what it is where it is now. And in that moment he literally shows me like a vision of where it's sitting laying or even underneath something. He does it immediately and I say thank you so much for showing me where that is. Because I give him an opportunity to do something for me by saying that. So that's asking you have not because you asked not so I'm literally asking him. But first I'm telling them who I tell him who he is. And what he does know he knows everything that was ever made. No matter where it is in time he knows he knows what's made right now and he knows what's going to be made in the whole. The best person to ask first before you run around an hour looking say that first and just say I ask you to show to me right now. And he'll either show me or someone will yell I found whatever. Oh wow. But it's like it's something that's very quickly done immediately when I when I honor him for who he is and then I ask. I think that's that's one of the meanings where it says in the scriptures before you call I will answer. It's like he knows you're about to call he knows your words are forming and he already starts forming this picture. Lord show me that years ago and I and so when I ask him something I don't try to wait for a long time I try to listen to what the very first thought because before I call him he's going to answer so that's very very cool so awesome. Well you've got some thought maybe a few thoughts on your heart for when people will watch this so share that before we get into questions if you want to. I do actually. My husband was driving me to the salon and you know the traffic's backed up like crazy everywhere around here. They're building a few new things so the streets are backed up. And also if it's the time like when school lets out there's always going to be traffic somewhere in this city. And so we had a lot of time in line we were sitting in line in the traffic but I never complain when that happened. And so the father starts speaking to me immediately and then he took me from. I wasn't in the truck. I was taken to this place and shown something he wants me to share so I'm going to share it with everybody first time ever like just happened to me maybe an hour ago or so. He took me he caught me up and put me on this long winding road I didn't even know where I was at and in front of me was where I had been he said I want you to see where you've come from he said I'm going to show you a journey. And so I saw this long road in front of me and then all the way up where these red streaks he said that's the blood of Christ that never leaves you all the way up to my feet they came and then he said now you may turn and see where you're headed. And when I turned I saw still some more road because this is my journey remember I saw more road in front of me but it got more and more transparent and then I could see shortly in the distance the city of God which would be the throne room or all the beauty and splendor is in heaven I saw that and he said everyone who belongs to me needs to know that this is your destination he was saying not just mine everyone is a believer that is your destination this is what he said to me. Everyone should love one another now because I actually say the world will know you by your love for each other stop fighting. Stop arguing stop picking on each other stop saying things aren't even true about each other. He said you spend your time loving. So when you reach that destination, there will be an even greater celebration that you chose to love on another and be a testimony to who I am. And I was so undone because the splendor that looked just like the city of God that's what I call heaven city in heaven. It was like the city of God I saw all the time I could see streets of gold I could see the glorious buildings that were in the air they're not even on the ground I clearly knew where that was but that's what he was saying. Anyone who's a believer that's our destination we're all going to the same place. Okay this is what else he said your body may die but that's not you. That's part of your covering. He said your spirit man and your soul never dies so all those if you recently had someone passed to heaven I've had three really good friends recently like even in the last week somebody met passed on to heaven. And you know she was like in her fifties and yet she was not just ready her mansion was done and she went and I was celebrating I always celebrate when somebody goes to heaven so I have that I understand that is our home we will go there until he makes the way we were but this is our destination we're on a journey together that's what he's trying to say to me he was very adamant this is a journey you're doing together where you've been and then where you're going your destiny where you're going your destination is all the same destination. But what you do now matters it doesn't matter and having a matters how we treat each other matters if you if you know accomplish the mission he has given you but honestly part of our mission is to care about each other the Bible says to. You know to consider those are the household of faith or God first that means we should consider our fellow Christian members first we need to help them we need to honor them bless them and that is our goal that and let the world know us by our love how big of a deal that because right now I don't think they think the body of Christ or Christians are known because of our love for each other but it's going to happen and I will say this Jesus won't come back several years many years away actually before that happens but he's not coming back until we are loving one another because the Bible says the world will know us by our love for each other is one of the signs that that you know that we're getting close to him coming so we have some work left to do so people just forgive people just let it go loose out of your soul somebody wrong you and just love them anyway and the other thing you're doing is you're piercing Satan he does not want you to forgive people and love one he doesn't want us to love one another if we keep fighting whenever they even know who we are how can you operate in the power of God and speak for him on his behalf if you're trashing people who are the household of faith so this is a good time for you to just say I'm sorry father from this day forward I'm going to I'm going to do the very best I can and ask for more grace and get filled with your love and let this world see me love other believers and so that was the encounter I just have literally speaking to me I was gone in the second I was right back in the seat of the truck well of course I told my husband what just happened and he goes oh that's awesome he's not a man of many words but he was thought he thought it was a great thing and I said I'm supposed to share that I'm supposed to share that the next time not remembering even at that moment that it would be just a couple hours from them when I would do that so that is a word from the father if we are supposed to love one another care about each other help one another don't pick people's you know even if you don't have maybe you don't have a vision for what you're doing right now you don't pick other people's visions apart that's okay somebody happy and can I ask you a question so almost everyone has people that are I guess we would say they're in the body of Christ but they are so different than what we are there even some of them are off base but we know they accepted Christ but and then some are detractors and some are almost enemies and yet and yet they serve the Lord and what happens when we decide to just in our heart I guess it happens in our heart first just decide you know what I'm going to love them whether they ever know this or not I'm going to choose to love them what does something happen in the spirit when we do that. Yes, but I have to have to make clear what what what you're saying I understand what you're saying you make a decision with your soul, because your natural emotions aren't going to do it. You can even say, I make a choice with my will, no matter how you're feeling about it, you can actually do that that's actually something that is possible. You don't have to feel it for you don't have to feel it then you don't have to feel you don't have to feel you do not have to feel it. You're making what you declare and decree shall be established unto you and it is going to happen. I've had to do that several times actually, depending on what people had said have done done done to me or said to me. I say I choose as an act of my will to forgive them and my emotions certainly in that moment of time probably don't want that but you overrode your emotions. That's not like you're not being you that's using a part of you maybe you didn't use very often. Your will is the most powerful part of you. It's what it's what you display. I mean, know your will is what you choose to do your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you actually choose. And my husband has always said what you choose to do you will do. That's his famous quote. And he's very right about that so why not choose with your will the way the father decided to make it and say I choose as an act of my will not my emotions to forgive and say their name. And guess what the father he will write that down and he will immediately start working on the heart of the other person because you have forgiven them. That actually gives the father and Holy Spirit freedom to pursue that person for them to change no matter they're probably you're probably not the only one they're doing things to. If people are in fear or if they're in pain or if they're angry it makes them lash out I'm not giving an excuse for them I'm just telling you that's how it operates in your soul. As a man think it then his soul. So are you that's the heart of your being your soul. I had I had a situation. I don't know if I ever brought this up but there was a guy who went home to be with the Lord years and years ago. Okay so this is nothing current years and years ago but before he did that he tried really hard to destroy this ministry that I mean so it was a long time ago but it was this ministry. And I think or I feel like or I think I, I tried to forgive him okay I don't know which words to put, and I went to, you know, I had been really really sick many people know I was bed ridden my pastor. At that time thought maybe I was, I was depressed while I wasn't, but he said I want you to go to counseling so in deference to him I went to counseling for a few times. And I told this counselor a woman counselor and I told her about this guy that tried to destroy us because she was digging deep for anything that might be bothering me. And I said this happened this happened this happened and the guy's book was on her shelf so I knew she knew who he was. And so she said I want you to go up these stairs see yourself going up these stairs and open the door and it's the Lord, and you and him are going up there together, you're walking side by side up these areas. And I want you to tell the Lord what you think about him. You can imagine that was kind of, and all of a sudden now these emotions are coming up and all of a sudden I'm balling. And I said, it was like the Lord said what do you think about and he named the name and all of a sudden tears are just flowing. And I said he did the best he knew how to do he served you with, and that was sort of a combination cat of soul and emotion all mixed in there because I choose. I chose to do that talk about forgiving someone after they're gone, after it's too late to say it to them. You can. Well, number one, I do want to say the person who passed on. Yeah, they're immediately sorry for everything ever said or did you it just is a part of what happens. So when you die and step out of this body and your spirit man steps out, you know immediately what you did that, even if we're seeing, let's say I'm not saying murder or stuff like that. Maybe you were rude, maybe you were harsh to people, maybe you did something wrong against them. You know, immediately at that moment you're flooded with the life of God and you go, wow, I should have said I was sorry, you know, I should have said I was sorry for them what I did was wrong. I should have told them one day they feel still in need to tell you that. So they're basically at that moment saying they were sorry or repenting for doing it, even though you never heard it. Yeah, there is absolute forgiveness or actually a recompense for when at the moment someone dies and he's in heaven right now can't wait to see you and hug you when you get to heaven and say man, I should have been better to you. And you're probably saying these words, it doesn't matter anymore. But it would feel I can imagine it feeling good, really, really good to hear it. And also at the same time saying it doesn't matter anymore, you know, all at the same time all mixed in the same time you're really you're kind of happy. Yeah, they did it. They did understand. No, you can't you can't try to hide from truth when you're in the presence when you're in the presence there's no there's no hiding from what is true, you know what is true. And especially leaders in the body of Christ have a double accountability might as well bring this in your double accountability is leaders in the body of Christ and I'm sure the Lord may have something to say to you when you get in heaven he won't keep you from heaven. But I'm sure he may have something to say to you because the word does say that you'll be held calm for every wasteful word. It actually says that in the Bible. Can you clarify that you said that the other day in heaven, huh? You said that last time we were on the program about someone else you said he'll have something to say. Yeah. Can you postulate or even relate what type of thing he might say to someone like that? What do you mean he'll have something to say? I think that is done at a special appearance. I'm not saying that is necessarily done when you first arrive in heaven. Okay. Unless it was a special case, as was the case I saw the other day. Most of the time you'll be in heaven and you're rejoicing you're celebrating you're so happy the presence so powerful, but the more the presence begins to just invade your soul. You kind of know I probably should have handled this better. You don't feel guilty. There's no guilt. There is no guilt in heaven. Even when you come before the judgment seat of Christ and he will say things to you like, you know, I did ask you to do this. Like he asked, let's say he asked you to be a preacher. You decided to be a rodeo. Whatever. I'm just making a crazy. Yeah. And he did great at being in the rodeo, but you didn't ever pick up the call that he's dad. He will mention that to you. You'll have a conversation that doesn't mean he's going to kick you out or anything. But because in the Bible it says you'll be held accountable. So don't use waste wasteful words would be like bashing people being unkind to people saying rude remarks. And you're you're a believer, but you're still doing this stuff up into the day you go. You will realize, yeah, man, I should have not done that because truth begins to invade you. And when you kind of hear from that truth or you ignore that truth, that doesn't mean you won't go to heaven. That just means you are going to have a time to be talked to. Well, you know, I'll just end with this because I know you have the first question about something else or anything else to say. But I've talked about my father many times and he was in fact, he's with the Lord. He was in fact a major serial child abuser. He was OK. Then he got his heart right. And I know he's with the Lord. You said he's felt really good when I talked about he's with the Lord. You said that makes him happy when he hears that. So that was a major, major, major, major sin or set of sins or years of sin. So talk about the talking to that he might receive one day. I mean, how does that work? What would he say to my dad? Because he already knew he was wrong. I'm not even talking about actual sin. I'm not even talking about sin. Oh, that was sin. No, that was sin. His repentance of all that wiped it away. Oh, OK. So he's not talking about that. And he's not up there thinking about that anymore. He's thinking about how much he loves you and he's excited for you. And he knows that you're doing great things for God. Now, what I'm talking about are people who are like, even though they're believers, it's not really a sin to be rude. It's not nice. But those are wasteful words you're speaking. They are not necessary and you shouldn't be speaking on those things. He will talk to you. He will. He will talk to you about that, those kind of things. Sin is forgotten into the sea. No, there's no more remembrance of that. Like, no matter who's out there, if you sin and you're repented, don't bring that up to the Father again. If you're repented, he won't remember it. He won't remember it. But after you've been born again and repented, maybe you sin later, repent again, please. The God is not into freely sin at all. He is not in agreement with you to freely sin when you're a believer. That's not any kind of testimony or witness for him. And you just don't want to do it because people can see you acting like that and they'll think, why should I get saved? You act just like me. If you're sinning, if you have a lifestyle of sin, that's not a good thing at all. But what I'm talking about is just people's attitudes and the way they treat people. Those things, he will probably say something to them about because it does say, you will be held accountable for every wasteful word, words that shouldn't have been spoken, that were not necessary, that maybe hurt people or, you know, interfere with things in their life. Those kind of things. Because he said that in the word, he will talk to you about those things. But you're sin. I always thought, I guess I'm wrong on my thinking. I always thought those wasteful words and things you're speaking against people were, in fact, sins. Really? Wasteful is not sinful. There's a clear definition here. No, sins, the sins, the sins that you did in the earth, you have to repent, even if it's at the moment you die and Christ comes to you and says something. At that moment, you would have to say, I do truly repent because of the keys of hell, death and the grave. But the wasteful words have nothing to do with you getting into heaven or not. It's the attitude you have. It's maybe the witness that you're being. It won't keep you from being in heaven, but you could have probably had a lot more or done more for him because if you had treated somebody different. He's clearly saying that even when you're born again, watch how you treat people, how you handle people. He doesn't want people getting crushed or falsely or wrongfully accused. He wants that to not happen from a believer because you're actually messing with the testimony of what a believer is. Let's say sinners know you and they see you acting or mistreating people. They're like, why should I bother? You're almost interfering in more than just that. So those wasteful words that you shredded people with your mouth, that's not a sin. That's just a wasteful words that should not have been done. It's a waste of time to speak them. In other words, those he will hold you accountable. That doesn't mean you're going to be kicked out of heaven and he will let you know what that means when you get there. So no, he's not talking about sins. That doesn't mean sin. That's amazing. Well, what else do you have before we get into questions? Any other thing about current events or anything like that? I'm just excited about all the fraud exposure that's coming forth, which I'm sure everybody else is also. The legitimate many has meant other people coming forward to testify against the left who were a part of that. And I'm telling people to be the biggest, probably the biggest exposure ever in the history of the earth. Because of the exposure will be so deep and so wide and so complete. That everyone is doing anything to try to take over the world to stop our lives, steal what we have, or just stop the word of God from going forth. Anything that has an evil agenda on the left or the liberals, whatever they're doing, they are all going to be exposed and justice is going to be brought against them. And that's why I keep telling them that are doing that you better go. You better go be a witness and testify against what they're doing, because the day is going to come when the window will close and they won't need people's witness. They'll have so many witnesses that have been proven to be right that will legally cause legal action to take forth, come forth, whether it's from heaven or from the earth, but they're going to be exposed. And so that's just happened again. There are eyewitnesses that have come forth from all places. I may as well tell you because it's all over the place. It's FBI agents. I'm not saying to them to went into Mar-Lago or I can't even say the name. Trump's home to steal things or mess up things, which was what their agenda was. I don't know about them. I'm talking about ones who were a part of that and are no longer a part of that. They have got some of them who've come forward and are testifying, literally testifying, which God said on November the 4th, 2020, it would happen. So those things are beginning to happen and more and more people, you're not going to hear about it until it all breaks loose. And they have to say those famous words that the 2020 election was stolen. And it will be said on regular news and they won't want to say it because of the testimony and the witness and the evidence. They are going to have to say that people. And I can tell you those things are starting to come in. They're compiling up against the left and the liberals. I'm not doing it. It's happening because God said it would happen. And we just, they just had some more come forward and do that. So I'm always excited when truth is being told because it helps people. The truth makes you free. Are there people cat-like news anchors that we would recognize? Many of them who were told, you will not report. You will not say this because you will not say it was stolen that, that are going to come forward and say, they told me I couldn't talk about it. And commentators who wanted to tell the truth and they'll say they were, they told me I was not allowed to, well, that kind of thing all over the place. Definitely. Well, we're going to have all kinds of from every area from the business arena and the medical arena. I mean, everywhere from the financial arena, the media arena, there are going to be some from every one of those different areas because that's how far reaching the lie is and the deception is. And therefore people will come from each one of those arenas and they will testify because probably most likely they're not working. I mean, I didn't be working at those places right now because they were threatened with death. Most likely that that seems to be like, well, if we can't badger them or force them, then we'll just tell them we'll kill them. And I mean, again, this is truth. What I'm speaking is the truth that has already happened. And if they can't get these people who are in these positions to go along with them, they just take them, they just take them out. They threaten them. Truly they do. And some people won't talk about it because they're afraid for their own life. But there's going to come a time when they realize if they don't come forward and say something, this thing is going to come to an end where the people believe it or is or not. And you can't, no one can stop it from happening. It is coming to an end. And that whole foundation has already started crumbling under those people of the left and the liberals. It's already crumbling and they know it's crumbling. That's why they're being desperate, like, you know, raiding Trump's home and other things and saying, what else can we find or make up or lie about that will keep this thing going because it's failing. And it's failing big. So I just spoke the truth again. There are all these people from all those arenas and some people who are very high up in them, which is the testimony they really need. They need them to come forward and say that there's going to be a big witness protection program somewhere. But I can tell you right now it is going to happen. And so some of that just happened the other day and it's already being spread everywhere and it's true. They have had some come forward to that want to testify on behalf of what is right. So good. So good. I love it. I love it. Okay. Anything else before questions? I don't think anything else right now. I do have a question here that we can kind of start with. Yeah, start with that one. That'd be good. This is I love getting I love getting and let me tell you, I get so much mail. It's wonderfully outrageous. It takes me weeks and sometimes even months to go. If it's sent to me for me personally, I do go through it and look at it. And I do pray for a lot of people at that time. If it's something that's urgent, I will pray for them. But this little child who's nine years old, I'm just going to say her name is Andrea. And I'm not saying anything else about where it came from or what. Since God is making a new heaven and a new earth. And if you didn't know that, guess what he's going to. And the word does say that he is. So she is correct. Do you know what he's going to do with the moon? And I just love these children's questions. You know, they don't they don't hold anything back when they want to know something. They just ask what people think about what they say. Well, I'll tell you, Andrea, you can probably have it in your own yard on the new earth. I am quite sure the father can make you one. And so you will not miss the moon. And you know, he did make the sun and the moon. He made them himself. It says so in the Bible. Now, when he originally in the beginning, Genesis one, one in the beginning, when he made the earth, he lit it with his glory. There was no sun or moon lighting this earth when he made it the first time. And then in verse two, something has happened because he made it the first time and it was finished. It was done. He was done with the first time he made it. In verse two, it says that darkness is on the face of the deep and the water is covering the whole earth. Well, he didn't make it that way. He would have never made it that way. He made it the way it should have been. But then Saint was kicked out of heaven, fell to earth. He began to make the earth a wilderness. It says that in Jeremiah. And so God turned the light out. It also says that. He turned out the light. He took his glory off the earth and he broke the water vapor shield around the earth, which brought mist on it because it never rained in the very beginning. You need to know that too. Even scientists know that. And so it flooded the whole earth and then he made it darkness come upon it because he took the light out. So here's the earth sitting in verse two, right? It says he made it in verse one in the beginning. He made that means made means done, made the heavens and the earth. And then in the second verse, it's a mess. There's, there's, there's water covering the sky. That's the firmament. And it says in the Bible that he took the water off the firmament. He took it off of the land and began to redo the earth. It says that clear in the Bible. So then when he began to redo it in verse two, he starts that and he even says what he does. Okay. He replenishes the plans and brings them back. He puts the sun in the sky to light the day and the moon at night to light the night. It didn't say that in one one. And people go, well, how could this be millions of years people between verse one one, right? And Genesis one, two, there are millions of years. Oh, that's the first time I've heard you put it. No, there really is because it, there was no kind of time on the earth, right? The sun and the moon counted the days and the nights. When he started redoing the earth, replenishing is the correct word. The Holy Spirit just told me, we began to replenish the earth. Well, you can't read something. If you didn't do it before modeling your home unless you built it before. So you need to look at the words that are spoken unless people have written a new Bible and wiped them out and then just forget about it. Find one that isn't. It has not been changed. But so he made the earth in the beginning and it was done. It was finished. Beautiful. And it had a water vapor shield. He put around the whole earth that brought mist onto the trees, the flowers, but the light of God came from everyone who goes to heaven gets to see this. They go to this place and he lets you see him making the heavens and the earth light of God came from the ground and it would hit this water vapor mist. And part of that was part of what the rainbow. But the sky back then in Genesis one, one was a peachy pink. It wasn't blue because the sun wasn't present. They created that needed that to make the sky blue. So in verse two, it all changes when he takes the water off of the firmament. That's the sky. It takes the water off the land and starts to be replenished the earth replenish that the creatures, the plant life. I probably didn't say it in the right order, but he did. Then we know eventually on day 16, he made man. But that's this was a whole different sky. Same earth foundation. Everything sound glow was there, but he was replenishing it so man could live on the earth. Okay, so they could live there. And then he put the sun in the sky and it brought life by the day and then the moon at night. And it even says that so you could see at night. And so now we have the sun and the moon. The sky is beautiful blue normally in the daytime. And then the sky at night is dark and except the light from the stars and the sun. I mean, the moon, you can see it clearly. But my answer to Andrea's, I'm quite sure that he would be happy to make you a moon to be over your mansion or in your mansion. That's how cool God is. I could clearly see him doing that for you, Andrea. Very cool. Hey, on and creation, I've been asked this before. I don't, don't recall if I've asked you people have asked many times on the seven days of creation, were they 24 hour days? Yes. That's what I thought, but I wanted to double check. Because the Bible says it was today in the night. And then it was another day. It actually says that it says evening in morning, right? Evening in morning. 24 hour day. Yeah. Six. Because he's God. That's why he spoke it. The word stepped out and made all of it. They could do it. They could do that as fast as they wanted to do it. That's why if you send an angel on assignment, like, like the, the heavens army, you send an assignment, they're back in five minutes. They've already dealt with what it was that you prayed about. And because, because there is no time. There's no day, no night. There is no time. There's no calendars. So when you send them or you pray for something, they go do it instantly. And then they come back for another appointment. I've seen that happen in heaven because I've been to Michael's headquarters. This is a free, free stuff now. I've been there and Michael's headquarters when they were sent on the mission. And it seemed like, you know, they were back. They went and dealt with it in the spirit realm. And then they came back for the next set of orders. That's amazing. Now you said it's in the scriptures that God turned the lights out. Can you tell which one that is? I'm not familiar. People read the whole book and find it. You're not going to. He won't let me. Okay. People to find them themselves. Steve, church and they listen to their pastor say stuff, but they don't. Most of them don't even go check it out. I admire people that search out the word to find things and see what it says about truth. Well, I do have some. He lets me quote, like he lets me cope. The first John 227 to let you know that you have a weapon in you. You never use most of them. And that's called, you know, the anointing. Yeah. It says in the Bible in first John 227, when you receive Jesus Christ and become a Christian, you get a deposit of the anointing. What is that? The anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness. You get a deposit of it and it says, it lives in you. I carry the anointing. I release the anointing. The anointing grows so much that it's like a big cloud outside of me. And if I walk into a place that begins to affect people, that's what Peter did. That's what Paul did. They said Peter's shadow healed people. It was the cloud of anointing coming from him because he did get a deposit when he got Christ. Christ puts a deposit of the anointing in you and it never leaves you. But the more you give it out, the more you get back. It's almost like a bank account. It's like an investment account. When you release the anointing, it grows. So that's what you're supposed to do. You've never done that. Make sure you start releasing it into what? Go in the restaurant. You drink out of a cup. You say, I release the anointing. It'll never leave that cup. The next person, it never leaves that cup. No, never. Not through the dishwasher. No, it's not because it's a spiritual thing. It comes from you, release the anointing. It goes in that cup. Every restaurant I ever eat at, I release it in the table. I release it in the seats. And so there's John. We've seen some people sit down in places and they jump back up. They're like, I don't know what that was because it would be God. Maybe they're not, maybe they're not, maybe they don't know the Lord. Maybe they're doing wicked things. They sit in that chair full of anointing. They all have to jump up and go find another place to sit down. So if you anoint the seat, let's say the seat in the table. For the rest of the time that that table exists, people will sit down in the anointing. And that's not just cat curd. That's anyone. Any believer that when you got born again, go read 1st John. I'll say it slow. 1st John 2 27. You have it because you got born again. Jesus Christ literally takes a deposit of the anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness and he says, he puts it in you and it lives there to buy there. That means it's there. It's up to you to release it wherever you go, whatever you touch. I have my phone up here before I send the text. I type in, I put my hand on this, they're releasing anointing. When they touch that and read that text, it comes out and you get. Wow. Oh, we actually released it in the tires of our car and I see fire tracks because the anointing looks like fire. It looks like that. In the spirit. It looks like fire. And so when we drive our car, you see fire tracks and everybody who passes over those tracks, the anointing will begin to penetrate their car. You don't know how supernatural you are. There are so many things we don't know as believers unless we are told that. And the Bible says, I have not seen or you're hearing or entered in the heart or mind of man, but God has prepared for those that love him. Well, one of the things he's already prepared is the anointing you're carrying. We have testimonies from people that their brother couldn't stand them. He lost his job and they wanted to help him. And the one guy, the brother had the good, the brother that was living right had these cowboy boots that this other brother wanted all the time. And they went to my meeting and heard me say these words. And when they went home, they anointed the cowboy boots, released the anointing in them, both of them. And they called the brother said, why don't you come have dinner? And they said, we really want to pray with you. He lost his big landscape business and now he was really needing. He said, well, I guess I'll come. And he asked, can I mow your lawn to get some money? And they said, yeah, sure. So when he went to leave, they said, you've always liked these boots. Would you like them? And he goes, yes, I want those boots. Well, these are anointed boots people from them. They carried the brother and his sister while that they carried they put in those boots. A couple of days later, he called and goes, I don't know why I've been mad at you. Wow. Why am I mad? I care about you. I just thank you for these boots. And by the way, I just got a brand new contract. I got a whole new contract to do all these condos now. And now I've got money again. I want to thank you so much for blessing me. It didn't happen until it gave him the boots. He put them on and the anointing began to penetrate now. And do you have to be in person to lay your hands on for that to work? Can you send the anointing from a distance? That would be rare. That'd be rare. Okay. You can send them something. You can send them a card in the mail. Okay. I released the anointing and you mail it. And when they open it or touch it, they don't even go. So Kat, if I put the anointing on an envelope, really prayed for it, the anointing to be released on an envelope. It goes to the person and the person says, writes on it, refused, returned to center, but they held it. They touched it. That's all it takes, Steve. That's clever. I will leave places go. We'll say it's too late, everybody. And this is the best part. Any of those people have been watching me bashing me. It's too late. You already have the anointing in you because I put it in everything as we're doing these things. We annoy all of our stuff and put it in it. And you can anoint your computer before you send emails. And the email, when they look at that email, they open it, it goes in them. Even, even if you, even if they look at it for a second and said, I don't want to read this, but they see it. That's it. Wow. Okay. Let's ask one question about sending the host. Sometimes I think, well, I've really done my job. I've spent 20, 30 minutes sending the host all over the place. I'm still in bed. I'm doing it while I'm still in bed. And I've sent them everywhere and I've given them assignment. I think, well, I'm done for the day, but you're saying five minutes later, they're back. I always give them one more before I go to sleep because you know, that's seven a.m. I'm up 20 hours a day. So they've been getting instruction out at three a.m. I, I like to go outside. I just like to go outside. I don't have to, but I want to be near where they're at. So I go outside with my staff and every time I, I give them an order to command to go somewhere, which I'm allowed to do because Christ was, you know, we know he was the Lord of hosts. He commanded the army to things he did. We can do too. I'm not going to go through all that, but I do. And I'll take my staff and I hit it on the ground and I'll just say, I'm not going to be it. Go host, make toast. That means they're going after the dark, the spiritual darkness to pull it down, to shred platforms and they will do it. And you may not find out to get to heaven one day, but when you do that, you are having an impact somewhere. But back to the anointing thing for just a minute. When I used to speak, we had a whole meetings that were nothing but to teach people to, they knew now that according to the word, the anointing was in them. And I was like, right here in the core of your being, I'd had people stand up and say, okay, now you know you have it. Lay your hand on there and ask Holy Spirit to stir it up. And we would actually have them do that. And then I always had, I always did something so they could see that it actually did something. And then I would say lay hands on the person next to you and say, I released the anointing in Jesus name and people were falling out. They started laughing. The room was getting so full. I could feel the waves of anointing coming from everybody. And I finally would say, stop, stop, stop, stop. I can't stand up anymore. So I didn't have them. I actually trained them how to use it. And people used to go while they would, they would go and anoint the reservoir of the city, like stick their hand as close as they could to it in it. And they did things like they would go to the pizza restaurant. They worked in, they would touch every pan in the restaurant, the ovens in the restaurant, the pizza place. And we see anointing, which everybody who got a pizza made on that pan got the anointing. My goodness. Forever because it doesn't leave. It doesn't ever leave because it's a spiritual thing. It's a spiritual thing. Unbelievable. You can be doing all kinds of things. Yeah. I'm re-fired up. Okay. It's like our secret weapon. It totally is. Understand the word that clearly says it lives in you. What do you think? What did you ever think you were going to do with it? Yeah. What people, what did you think? It says the anointing breaks or destroys the yoke of darkness. That's the anointing you carry. And no matter where you walk, you can release it through your feet. I walk through the store, release it everywhere in the store. Every garment I ever look at on the rack, I will touch and go, I'll release the anointing, the anointing, the anointing. Everyone who buys those clothes will have that anointing on them. Goodness, goodness, goodness. You can be busy all the time, people, just for the anointing. I'm going to get busier all the time. I see myself getting very busy. Okay. I, I told this lady, no, well, I would ask this, but it's way too long to read. So I'm going to summarize what she's saying. She's totally into everything you're teaching even today. I'm sure. But her husband began to be. A detractor. Then he went from a detractor to. He didn't like it. Then he went from that to. To being biased against it. Then he went, then he became a cynic. Then he became a mocker. Now he is a hardcore mocker of everything she's doing. And it's hurting her marriage. And she's supposed, she feels like she's supposed to submit to him. What does she do? That depends on how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. God, God, God, God, God, God, God. And then how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. God never said, he never said, we had to submit to the abuse of our husband. It's just physical abuse. It hasn't been physical. I think she would have told me, but it's really verbal wickedness. I can tell you what she can start doing. You need to start laying your hands on everything he's got. Let me see. Go to his closet. Release the anointing and all of his clothes. Make sure all of his shoes gets the anointing. You will probably see a change because that anointing destroys the yoke of darkness. He literally has a yoke on him right now. And when you keep going and you get darker and darker, it's because you know what he's doing. He's feeding his own soul with what he doesn't like. And if he keeps feeding his soul, that's all that's going to be in the layers of his soul. And as a man think it's in his soul or his heart, that's how he's going to be. That's the biggest issue. He's saying all that. It's like people watching the fake news. They would start out great. They wouldn't like it. Then they'd be listening and they'd be like, well, you know that sounds plausible. Well, you know what? I don't like the other side. And now they hate him and they don't even know why they hate what's right because their soul is filled with the lies and deception, the hate that those people who are spewing it out, it's going in whoever's watching it. The anointing can pass into people listening, but the bad stuff can pass into you. Also, if you keep listening, it says to guard your heart. That is your soul. For out of that soul will flow the way you live your life. That's what the issues of life is. Your whole life will change by what you're listening to. And it can even be your own words trashing something all the time, which is what he's doing. So he's speaking against what God has put on the earth and even in you. So you need to come against that stuff. You need to maybe send the host against those spirits of wickedness and lies and deception to pull that stronghold off of him, number one. But make sure you're releasing the anointing. It's the best thing you can use. It's the number one thing we're given. Even at the day we got born again, you got that anointing. That's one of the powerful things he gave you. It's there. He said it's there. It destroys the yoke. So that should destroy the yoke that's now on him. And you say, I'm praying and declaring that that yoke of darkness will be destroyed off of my husband. It can be free to love and free to live and free to hear God. And that's releasing anointing in the food he eats, like in the whole refrigerator and everything. Anointing in his closet, everything he's clothing he wears will have the anointing. You are so getting him consumed with that anointing. And eventually there is going to have, something's going to happen. And you will see it when it happens. That's a good thing. I don't think it was this woman, but there was another woman who said, my husband has finally forbidden me to watch Kat on the air. What am I supposed to do? Any? The same thing I'm telling the other woman to do. Same thing. Same thing. The anointing destroys any yoke of darkness. It doesn't matter what it is. It destroys it. I know we say that the anointing breaks the yoke, but actually the real word, that real word that says breaks, it actually means destroys. So it destroys all those yokes of darkness, whether it's hate, if it's deception, if it's lies, if it's an anger or unbelief, those are yokes. And that anointing was given to us so that it would break it, especially in our own family. It has a great impact on that. And I even tell people, if you're still hugging family members, you can say quietly when you hug them, I release the anointing so they don't hear it said, but say it. But I'm telling you what, if they live in your home, you have every opportunity to lay on their bed, put it on their pillow, put it in their bed, put it in their clothes, put it in the food. There is going to be a major reaction to the anointing that's breaking and beginning to destroy that yoke that's on that person. We have seen it over and over the testimonies we have, and just because I used to train people to do that, it was the first thing he had me teach. Besides the fact, I talked about heaven all the time. Everything he said is you will teach him how to use the anointing. It is a weapon, and they get it the day they're born again. So when we hug our loved ones, anyone that's running from the Lord, I'll use those words with me, hug them. We just say, under our breath, I release the anointing. Yeah. And then make sure if they're going to eat dinner at your house, make sure you release it in the food they're eating, and the plates, you know, go lay your hands on all the plates in your cabinets and the cups and everything. It sounds wild, but it really does work. It works. Amazing. Amazing. I'm excited. All right. All right. This sounds like Malachi, Milachi, whatever. Can you explain what the kingdom of God is? For example, Matthew 633 says, seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. That's her question. The kingdom is the same thing Christ talked about. He talked about a spiritual kingdom. That's he, when he talked about the gospel of the kingdom, that is a spiritual kingdom. That is a real kingdom that operates in the spirit realm. You're not going to walk up to a castle here that says, it's not a flesh and blood thing. It is the spiritual thing. And the kingdom of heaven, of course, is part of that spiritual kingdom. But on the years you operate in it, by doing one of the things I just told you, that is a weapon. Clearly it is a spiritual weapon. And yet it says what it does. It clearly says in the Bible, it destroys the oath. You have that weapon. You can't see it or touch it, but it's in you. And when you begin to release it, it actually impacts that spirit realm. And you're operating in the kingdom. When you do that, because you're using a spiritual weapon it gave you, when you speak truth to people to break off deception to them, you're operating in the kingdom. Every time you pray, you're operating in the kingdom. When you declare you're operating in the kingdom, when you help people, you're operating in that kingdom that Christ talked about, that it was so valuable that you give up whatever you can to get that kingdom. It is a spiritual kingdom. When you get to heaven, you have the full understanding of that. But the weapons he gives us now here, it says our weapons of warfare people. Remember what warfare is? It's when you come against something. You fight against the darkness and the evil. And you think, I can't do anything. I'm just a little human being. Oh yes, you can if you're born again, because you will now, a new creation means you now have supernatural abilities in you. You have supernatural weapons to use in the spirit realm, that you will really mess up the devil's plans. You're going to mess them up. So that kingdom he talks about is, he said, you cannot see it with your human eyes. But it's there because you're here. You have a spirit man. You can operate through your spirit using these weapons. And you can do wonderful, powerful things against the enemy, which is one of our, one of the things that we're called to do as a believer. That's what we're called to do. We rule and reign with Christ when we use those weapons. There are spiritual weapons against the spiritual darkness. Spiritual darkness is always against every evil, wicked, human flesh person. They're wicked because they're listening to the evil spiritual realm, the evil spiritual beings, which you have power over all the power of the enemy. Our enemy is Satan. So any demons disembodied spirits, I can go through this whole long list about that for three years. I did nothing but preach about the darkness out there and how to come against it. I did that for a long time. And so it's in me. I do it automatically. But you as a believer are powerfully and wonderfully made. That's what the scripture says. He didn't leave you without help. Number one, the Holy Spirit is here to help you all the time. Christ will never leave you. When you invited him in, he actually does step in. He's in there. He's there to help you, to help guide you with the Holy Spirit. But he gave you weapons, people. The word of God, not the one with half the verses scripted out. Okay. I'm not talking about the one that wiped out the truth and they want to put their interpretation in there. I'm not talking about that. And let me tell you that's happening a lot everywhere. And make sure you get a Bible that has all the verses in it. Yeah. And not things. Some are removing chapters because they don't like what it says. They want to make everything okay for everybody, no matter how wicked or evil we are. Hey, that's the agenda of the left. Doesn't it sound like that? Totally is. They want everyone to accept evil and wickedness. That's why they're spreading it. That's why they will never make anything good because there's no good in them. They can't even think that way. All they can think is destroy, take, steal, crush. That's what they're all thinking. That's what that whole agenda is for them. And yet Christ came to bring you life and life more abundantly. So we're supposed to have abundant life with Christ. Regardless of what else is going on around us. And maybe if you start using the anointing for what it is, it is a weapon to come against the spirit of the darkness. You will begin to see things shift even for you. So good. He didn't owe us without his blood, the most powerful thing ever in all time. The only thing that wipe away your sins and give you entrance into heaven. Satan hates it. The word of God, the word spoken, the word written is so powerful in the spirit. Satan hates that too. He doesn't like the light of God in you, but he can't stop it from coming. The greater relationship you create with Christ, the more light you have in you. It says one time at one time, even the night will be light round about you. That's you going outside at night and seeing a light coming from yourself. It is going to happen in the manifest of sons and daughters. I won't just read the word. I actually believe it and I live it. I live that word. People who don't understand that have never lived or understood even what it was. Why is it written in there? It's not just a nice story. A bad thing that happened. It is an agenda of God to let you see yourself as a new creation. You get part of his DNA in you. You get a stone of fire that gives light to your spirit man in you. And you get born again. You get a deposit of the anointing. You are so full of God right now as a believer, but you have no understanding. Right. That. Yeah. Let me ask this. Okay. We just read seek first the kingdom of God. And then with that or. Okay. Put that aside for a moment, not aside, but let's change the subject where. God came to you and said in 20, I think it was 2012. You said the kingdom age has begun. What's the difference between seeking first the kingdom of God. And now suddenly living in the kingdom age. There's a very big difference because the word talk is about when things will actually happen. Things that will come that will bring change. It changed a lot. Okay. When John the Baptist started saying, okay, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Yeah. He understood. He probably was one of the few people that actually understood. He knew heaven was about 10 days. He knew the Messiah was coming. He knew that he would die for the sins. He knew these things. And that change started when Christ was born, when he was sent from heaven to earth and planted in the womb of Mary by Holy spirit. That did happen. That happened. Things begin to change when she began to achieve. He was being birthed, not birthed, but he was being, you know, growing inside of her. Angels would come and tell her things. She knew things were going to change. She knew they would be different. When Christ born, things really began to change even rapidly, more rapidly. And at that time, Satan knew somebody had come. That's why he tried to find out from the, you know, from the wise kings. He questioned the wicked king and questioned them. But Christ was hidden and hidden and hidden, even sent to Egypt for a while because he was bringing change to this world by who he was. And then when he began to minister, then openly people began to see how things changed when he was around. And it was so powerful that he gave his life for us. When he gave his life for us, he made a way back to the place we came from. We all came from heaven. We lived in the Father. He is our Father. We are His offspring. The Bible says that the real change to happen once Christ was on this earth, it began to demonstrate and manifest the power of God. He stopped the storms. He walked on water. He increased time or he slowed time down. He created food. He made regular water into heaven's wine. You saw one miracle after another. One miracle after another began to happen. They haven't stopped happening. As the days grow closer, where the kingdom, the kingdom age would be brought to this earth, we would know more and more about it. That's part of my job is to let people know what is this kingdom? What is this kingdom? Why is the kingdom age here? So you can operate in it fully, understanding who you are, what the weapons he gave you, that would bring hope for people's lives, help for people's lives, that they would see people walking the earth that didn't sin on purpose, that could hear the word of God and demonstrate his power throughout the earth. That was the purpose of the kingdom age and it did start in 2012. All the way up to that, being a seer and understanding the prophetic, I felt something stronger and stronger coming and a lot of people announced what came in 2010 or 2010. I think that's the right way to say it. They could feel it coming closer and closer, but until the day came, and we literally in time, in time, if you were a seer, we stepped from a threshold of time into a time we've never had before. And that is when the manifested sons and daughters would be seen in the earth. That's why the earth was interveiled for us to stand up and start demonstrating who he is. The miraculous, like that people would be raised when the dead that were created. I mean, miraculous things will happen in this kingdom age, because God is going to demonstrate that he really exists. He's going to erase the great area that says there is no God. Many things are happening in this kingdom age. And the kingdom will remain up until the time when Christ is seated on the throne in Jerusalem, even after the tribulation, which is a few years, people, a few years, and then Satan will be sitting on the bottom of the pit. Christ will sit on a throne in Jerusalem as king of this world. And some people won't even put that in the Bible. That's what I said. Make sure you're looking at the right Bible. They say that these things have already happened. None of these things have happened except the kingdom ages come. People begin to speak to the weather like Christ did, and it will obey. Things that we say will begin to happen because we serve Christ and we live here for him. If you had been... Well, I was going to say, Kat, if you had been the only person and the first person who ever said that, I thought, well, Kat's going to be off here because that's not like anything I've ever heard. But years before I met you, my spiritual father, Wade Taylor, said in 2012, when it was 2012, he told me the kingdom ages come. He was 88 years old when he passed a couple of years after that. And I thought, what is he talking about? And then I later found out that Arthur Burke had said the same thing. Also, he's gotten to be with the Lord. So when you said it, that's the voice of two or three witnesses have absolutely agreed that 2012 this thing happened. I don't know why he picked out that year. I mean, Obama was in office. I mean, what did he pick that year? But I don't know what you... He loves to pick years when adversity is there. And I'll tell you why. People will actually listen because they need help and hope. Yeah. And he knew all this stuff was going to happen. He knew it, but he has got to fully expose the evil. It's not just about the devil having a heyday taken over. God is letting them on purpose expose how evil and wickedness operates. Well, socialism really does to you, but communism really does so people can see for themselves. It's not good. That doesn't mean he's doing it to hurt anybody. He's not doing that on purpose, but he has to have a time when the evil is exposed. It will be crushed and it will be pushed back because in these glorious years coming on the earth, it will be like a whole new earth, not a whole new earth, but a whole new thing happening on the earth. And favor will be given to believers. And there's people out there that wouldn't even believe me. Well, that doesn't matter. Maybe you'll be in heaven. Don't have to be concerned with it. I didn't mean that. Anyway, you cannot stop the plans of God. They couldn't stop Christ from coming. They couldn't stop the Holy Spirit from coming. They couldn't stop it from raising from the dead people. They could not stop Jesus from going in hell and wasting it. No one can stop what's going to happen this time. God's timeline. He has a timeline and the events. They're not dates. I walked up there. I didn't see one day to solve events. I saw these events happening on the earth. He didn't let me see to the end. I saw things that weren't happened. Hasn't happened yet. In heaven, you talked about, excuse me, and described that God has an event calendar. Not a date calendar, this event. But on earth, there's actually dates connected to it. We just don't know what those dates are going to be. We never know it. And when we think we've guessed it, we're almost always wrong from what I've seen. Yeah, that's what I don't ever guess. Yeah. Guessing is like wasted energy. So. You have to believe that God, you have to trust him. You have to trust him. You know, trust is very important. If you, if you, you begin to believe something, you go from believing to trusting, you actually put forth actions where you're trusting God for something. So you believe and then you begin to trust him, but there comes a day. And when you step from trust and you step into faith, you are never the same again. Never. And I had believed in God for so many years and trusted him probably for several decades. And then at one point I felt a shift in me and I said, what has happened? And a prophet literally truth called me on the phone who lives in South Carolina and said, the father had me call you to say these words. This day you have stepped into faith. Wow. Can you try to put into words. What that feels like to go from trust into faith? Cause we thought, I always thought trust was one of the ultimate things, but you're describing faith as like the next step up. If you will, what, what, what does that feel like? And if you can even think of an example, so people could go, oh, that's what I'm striving for or contending for or believing for. You want to, you want to step into faith because faith, it makes it feel the most amazing feeling you're everything. I felt such freedom, like freedom came. Freedom because I had been obeying God and I've been obeying him and everything. You asked me, I obeyed it. No matter how silly it was or why would you ask, I don't even ask him why he does anything. I, that's called trusting. When you get to trust and God says, do this and you know it's him and you do it and how amazing your life will be for that moment. But when you step into faith, everything he says after that, you were already living it on the inside. It's like there's not even one ounce of doubt. It leaves you, doubt leaves you. Doubt can't even get in you. None of the stuff that left the saying, it can't penetrate me because I'm a living in faith. I've stepped into faith. So no matter what anyone says to try to stop me from saying anything, it's not going to work. When you get to the place where you're there and God says you're there, then no matter what he says, you know that you know that you know it's happening. It is happening because you have stepped from trusting. You stepped into faith. It's an actual place that you step into. And from that moment, your faith gets so huge. It's like it's unstoppable. Not that I must have a month, but whatever God says to me or shows me, I know that I know that I know this is happening. So when you know that, you know that, you know, is living in me, it's not somewhere up here. I'm trying to find it as an example. When you know that, you know that, you know that, you know, Trump is coming back. There's no, you've moved beyond trust to faith. It's so real that no one could talk you out of it. No, they can't talk me out of it because I know it's going to happen. It is absolutely going to happen people. It's going to happen. And the great thing is you, you're standing in that faith. You know it's going to happen. Nobody can try to take it is something they can't take away from you. It isn't just something you hurt when you're in faith. You already know it's going to happen. You know it, but I'm not out there blasting people wrongfully using people. I'm not using, you know, nasty words or hurt people. I'm just not doing it. I'm going to stay right where God has me. So my words have power. They have power for hope, for blessing, for greatness. They have power in them. Part of that power is the faith that I'm in now. But anyone who is a believer can go after that. This is nothing I'm doing as hell from you. It depends on what you want. What do you want from him? Do you want to know him more? You want more of him? You want more of his presence? More of his words? You have to pursue them. Yeah. Do you want to get blessed? Well, then bless other people because you probably won't get anything without blessing. Blessing is like a seed where there's money, where there's actual health. Do you help people with things or help give revelation to them? Or maybe you're just helping them do something they really need to do. That always does something to the heart of God. So if you want to be blessed, you will have to bless first because then you're trusting God. You're not doing it to get something. Right. You truly want to bless. Yeah. I love to bless people. I love to help people. It's like, it's a part of me now. And when that faith becomes a part of you and he says it, and I know people who have already gotten there, they know that he's saying what he's saying is going to happen. That's why Hank won't change what he's saying. He knows, he knows, he knows he's already in faith for that. God said it. He showed us that he knows it's going to happen. Yeah, when you go, when you went from trust to faith, now that you're in faith, it sounds very, very powerful. Will that faith grow? Will it get more? Or is it? It does. It does. It grows and grows and like the kingdom always, always, always grows. Right. It'll never stop growing. It increases. You're going to increase in every way because it says he desires above all things. Right. That you be in health. By the way, that's living in health. Right. He wants you to prosper. Number one, above all things, he wants you to prosper. Prosper doesn't just mean money. It means the way you're living, the things you're saying, the impact you're having on people, that that's prospering in all your ways. You're prospering. That means with your relationships, with what you're doing, if you own a business, what you're doing in the church or what you're doing to help other people, there's always going to be increased. That's prospering. That's an action of life itself. That's not just here's some money. He wants you to be in that place. And then even as you will prosper, even as your soul prospers, right? Right. He also wants you to prosper and live in health. BE means a way of life. Christ became poor that we might be rich. That's his plan. Poverty is not the father's plan. Okay. So it says even as your soul prospers, you will then live in health and you will prosper. Your soul has to prosper. So if you're feeling your soul with bad news or bad words that you're speaking, or you don't even like yourself, your soul can't prosper. We can't do those other two things. Your soul has to prosper in order for you to prosper and live in health. It has to prosper. It prospers by reading the word, speaking the word, saying God's promises, saying what God is wanting to do right now, not the left, not what your friend is saying, if it's not aligning with God, the more your soul prospers, the more life it puts out, not just gets in. The more you will prosper in all your ways and you will begin to live in health. That is called divine health. Let's use this as the last question since I've done two shows today. So I'm going to cut it a bit shorter, but I'm in health, but I'm tired. So a person, and I can put myself in this, but I don't really suffer a lot from this, but I suffer some from this, where people will say, well, I don't like myself. I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I, how much I weigh. I don't like the way, you can just list and listen to this, but you just said, if you don't like yourself, I don't consider myself a person that doesn't like myself. But I don't like certain things about myself. Talk to people and myself. How do you move that needle from, I don't really like what I see in the mirror. I don't really like what God did to make me, how he made me, to, to, to liking yourself so that you can prosper. Talk about that. I'll tell you right now, that's why you can't prosper because what is the whole thing goes back to as a man thinker in his heart. When he says that word heart, he's not talking about your human flesh beating heart. He's talking about your soul. Here's your soul. Right? This is your soul. Here's your soul right here. It's like this. There's a beautiful column with etchings and writings on it. That is your will. And on top of that is your spiritual mind, your mind, your will, and your emotions are all the layers of you, that's how you're made, and those emotions, and whatever you put in those layers, words you said about yourself, the more you feel what was the things you don't like, it's not going to change. It can't change because what are you feeding your soul? You're feeding negative things that you don't like about yourself. You don't like how you live. You don't like the way you look. You don't like what's happening to you. That's why that can't be changed. If you don't like who you are, stop saying the things about you you don't like and say, this may not be perfect when I look in the mirror, but God is going to perfect it. And I'm going to love the way I look, however way he wants me to look. I'm going to love what he does with me. I'm going to love what he says to me. My souls begin to prosper this day because I'm no longer beating it up. And I won't listen to people that beat it up because the other reason why you can't prosper is everyone around you saying negative things to you. You were just made that way. That's just the way. That's your destiny. You can't change that. You lose those words out of you. You cannot keep them in your soul. Not even words you said. You cannot keep them in your soul because that's what you will become. You will become what you were saying you think you are. And I have done this with so many people. It's almost not ridiculous, but it happens the same way every time. You have to say, I repeat for saying all those negative words about me. I lose everywhere those words from my soul, from my mind, my will, my emotions. I will not allow them to remain in Jesus' name. And then you say, I choose my will to like myself. I choose with my will to be blessed and to bless God for making me this way. I choose my will to be excited for whatever he has for me. You are then feeding power to your soul to change, causing your own soul. You don't need a whole world out there to do it. You don't even need a profit to do it. You watch over your own soul. You are the keeper and watcher of your own soul. You are. And the way you talk and the way you think, the things you choose to go watch. What are you watching? You watching murders? Are you watching things that are horrible? Are you watching profanity? Are you watching witchcraft? Because guess what? You're feeding your soul. You're feeding your soul profanity, witchcraft, and violence. Do you think that your soul is going to prosper? You need to take a whole, you need to look at a soul checkup, you need a soul checkup people. You need to see, what am I watching on a regular basis? What words are coming out of my mouth, okay? What have I looked at? What have I read? Is it negative? Is it bad? Is it wicked? Get rid of it, people. Because if you want your soul to prosper, and then you will prosper and live in health, you better be. That's what it says to guard it. You're guarding it. You don't let garbage in, and you don't put garbage out. Garbage comes out of your mouth, it goes in your own soul. Every time you blast someone, that goes in your own soul. You can't stop it. It's just the way we remain. Your soul, and what you put in it is what you will become, and no one on this earth is going to change that. You can change who you are. If you don't like the way you look, if you don't like the way of what's happening, if you're upset about everything else, you're feeding your soul those words. If you want that soul to begin to prosper and the light of God to grow in it, and you actually get happy, then start saying positive things. I'm not talking about positive, I'm thinking, you really be positive about things. Maybe you had a friend that you liked, but they always end up by saying something nasty to you. I lost all those words that were spoken against me, that were nasty, that were harmful, that were bashing. I lost everyone, no matter where they came from. If I listened to it or somebody said it, I lost everyone in the mind of your soul, Jesus comes and goes, and it's like they were never there. Yes, they're going to start to feel different. Then you begin to thank God. I thank you, God, for my life. I thank you for letting me be born this time. Thank you for letting me be great for you. Thank you for bringing happiness to me. Show me, Holy Spirit, what to say, and when to say it. I give you permission to remind me to say things that are positive. Then you are on the road for your soul to actually prosper. God can give you more, do more with you, and use you more, because He wants you to go up to a person, they go, oh, this is horrible, what's going on today. Now, these are not my own words. It's bad. Do you think that we're all going to go down a hole somewhere? Do you think I'd walk away in the store if someone said that to me? There is no way that's happening, because I'm not keeping their words in my soul. I say, well, let me explain to you something. There is a God, and He's alive, and I know Him. He's got great plans for this service, and this wicked stuff you see going on is all being exposed. He's going to move His hand, things are going to be going to happen, and you're going to be so happy with your life. So stop saying the words you just said. If I were right in front of Him, I choose to lose all the negative words, I plant positive words. I believe in the life of God, the presence of God. I know He's got great plans for us. I know these are powerful days coming on the earth, and they're watching you in the grocery store. That's good. Man, that felt good. That was so strong. Do you really believe that I said yes, and why don't you? I don't just listen to this negative garbage. It comes from hell, and sometimes I'll go, the words you just spoke, hell told you those words. If you're feeling bad, you don't like yourself, you're believing those words, and if you get stronger, you're actually repeating those words. So stop marketing hell. Why not market heaven? And that is my... Oh, God. Well, you know, this is one of those episodes that people, including myself, need to listen to more than once, two or three times. There's so much meat. You can bring hope in your day-to-day life, no matter where you go or who you see. You can bring hope by saying what is truth, and God does care, and He is doing something. You may not see enough, but you're going to see this happen, and I'll even tell people, you remember this day, when I told you things would be changed and they would be great, and you will be celebrating in the street when God brings in what He's doing this time, because He has judged the evil, and then I'll walk away, say something, people, say something that brings hope in life to people. They hear enough death and garbage everywhere. It's so good, so good, so, so, so, so good. Well, can't talk about revealing heaven.com and your other website before we close. Yeah, I do have two websites. I really didn't name either one of them, but you know, the father tells me what to say, and I always obey. He named my book, Revealing Heaven, so we made our first website, revealingheaven.com, and we have a lot of products there. We actually got some new things in already that will be taken with us to Nebraska. I'm excited about it. We have some new things that represent heaven, and that's another part of my job to reveal and create heaven on this earth, so that's what you find, revealingheaven.com, and catcur.com. That is a spiritual platform that doesn't listen to any negative or evil or wickedness. It gives you all kinds of revelation in there. We have videos you can watch. You can see interviews done by people who ask me certain questions that are really great. We have a gallery of things what they look like in the spirit realm, like I think you can see what an aquamanchen looks like that I saw in heaven. You can see how even in the transportation looks like in the spirit realm. You ride on beams of light, travel on paths of light. That's what Christ did when he stepped into the spirit realm and walked through the bodies of the people. When they were going to throw him off that cliff, he said he passed through the people. He didn't say he passed around. He took one little sidestep into the spirit realm, spirit realm supersedes this physical realm, and he passed right through the people and they never saw him. You see kinds of things like that in there. There's also all kinds of decorations and things that can train you to let you know things in a greater way. There's testimonies on catcur.com, and it's the only way to give to me online. No other person's Facebook or whatever is out there. I don't ask people to give me money in any of the videos, not on YouTube or Facebook. I'm not going to do that, but people will take my stuff. They say, well, you need to give money to this missionary camp. That's not going to be great to the pocketbook people. Other people asking me to get your money, and I'm not doing it. You have to ask to go to catcur.com, click on the treasury if you want to be a part of helping to support Heaven's plan to bring Heaven to Earth. So good. Cat, we love you. Love you. Love you. Thank you so much. Would you go ahead and pray for the people as we close out? I know you've got great declarations, so go for it. Yeah, Father, I thank you for this day, this glorious, beautiful day that you have made. A day for things to be great for us on the earth. A day for us to know you more, to hear you clear, Father. This is a wonderful day, and you have purposed this day. Satan doesn't own this day. His people don't own this day, even the person sitting in the highest seat of the land. That's stolen. But Father, we know what's going to happen to those people, and I thank you for your plan for all of that to happen. But right now, Father, I just impart the life of God, the presence of God, His will, His way. I evict all evil, every evil spirit. Get out of everyone listening to this broadcast right now in Jesus' name. I thank you for showing us how to rule and reign with Christ's Son, who actually the entire earth belongs to. If I serve, I will not serve another. There's nothing darkness in me. There's no evil in me. There's light, there's love, there's the power of the living God. Thank you, Father, for showing them and giving them a taste of you so they will run after you. Your Son died on that cross because you asked Him to pay a price, and He did. Our lives for all eternity will be great. They will be excited. There will be so many amazing things to do with you, and I'm looking forward to eternity. Right now, I'm on this earth, and I'm not going anywhere until you say I go. Father, I hope they know you that well, and can think of you that powerfully, that they know who they are in Christ. Christ in you is the hope of glory, and God is powerful. He's represented with the light of God, and the power of God, and it will cover this earth like the waters cover the sea one day. I hope you're carrying it. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much, Cat. You are a dear friend, and you and I just become better friends all the time.

happy Wednesday everyone August 31 2022 our apologies were much later than normal but we will recover it'll be so good it'll be worth worth the way pardon I still have a cough I got one cough drop left right here well we may do that I don't know how this cough comes and goes but it does but anyway I wanted to say to the group to the to our viewers as you many of you know we're off of YouTube right now we got notified either this morning or last night whenever whatever that happened so they decided one of our guests said something and that's strike two and and the notice I looked at today said one more strike and you're removed from the channel so we're trying not to do that but anyway we're not on YouTube today and I think I heard that it will be two weeks someone can mention that in my chat if it if it's two weeks but anyway we're off right now we're going to and yes it's two weeks at least it says so we will be emailing you daily to let you know that we're reminding you that we're not on YouTube so please please forward or text or email as many of your friends as you can and say they're here but they're on rumble only because of all of this junk that's going on you say it in those words or any other words but we are continuing to be flexible and flow with what happens so that if this goes down we have that right now we are on rumble we are on Facebook and we're on Elijah list calm so we try to be careful we're talking code today we don't have to be careful at all because we're not on YouTube so they're gonna probably in my personal opinion people will never forget all the times they were kicked off I doubt that YouTube will last but I'm not saying that as a prophetic voice but you know we're all looking for alternatives you know maybe when this gets over and they got new leadership maybe it won't matter anymore so all right let's show I want to to keep before you new ads that we're developing that shows the the wells the freshwater wells we're digging in Uganda we're over 50 freshwater wells we're digging a new freshwater well every five days there's been 300 salvations at last report which means there's more now and there've been eight church plants so this is because of your generous generous generous donations and as I've said before a significant portion of what you donate to this ministry not only keeps us going but we feel called by the Lord to to tide if you will that money into many freshwater wells it's a lot more than a tithe but God has blessed us for doing that so we've got a quick promo on that so without further delay let's go ahead and play that Emily you Thank you again so much for your donations to support this, these wells. The Lord thanks you. I can say by the Spirit, the Lord is thanking you. Great rewards, he says in the scriptures, even if you give so much as a simple cup of cold water to one of these, you will surely not lose your reward. So that's what the Lord said, not us. So thank you for doing that. I truly believe that the Lord has shown me that when you get to heaven one day, when it's your time to go, there will be little children, maybe hundreds of them will come up to you and say, thank you because of you. We had fresh water and because of fresh water, I received the Lord. So thank you. So that's an amazing thing. We really, really, really appreciate your giving. So thank you so much. We are in an intense time. We have about eight weeks, nine weeks maybe for the election. There are, this is not prophetic, but there are some people that say, are we even going to have an election because things are getting intense? I believe, I hope there will be an election if there is and when there is, be sure that you overwhelm the system by voting, but many of you, more of you voting than they expect to vote. You need to overwhelm the system because they can't recover from that. Greg Phillips was, of 2000 mules was on and last week or the week before and said, that's the way to do it. You got to overwhelm the system. So anyway, between now and then make sure the deep state is going to try and prevent this election. We know that that's what they want to do because they know they're going to lose if we get, if the election goes through, be sure your gas is full, keep your tank topped off, keep your groceries of non perishables. Don't just fill up your refrigerator because what if the power goes out? So make sure you have non perishable, we even have powdered milk sitting in there and canned goods and cereal non perishable things that you can open the can and make sure you have a can opener too. Because a lot of people have those electric can openers, which may or may not work if they do something serious. I'm not prophesying that I'm just saying make sure your pantry is as full as you're able to do it and extra for others if you're able to do that. So I just wanted to tell you that we are, these are not going to be a normal eight weeks between now and then the deep state does not like you and me and believers and conservatives. In fact, they, you've heard several of our guests say they basically want something like nine out of 10 or they want to bring the population down to 500 million, which is, which is the population is what that's what the population. I looked up what was the population at the time of Christ coincidentally it was 500 million. That's what they want to bring 7.5 billion down to is 500 million, which is, which means that it's their desire and we've said this on the air. This is not some shocking new thing. It's their desire to depopulate the earth now they're not going to succeed. We're going to bring Patricia Katker sorry on in just a moment and she has seen into the future. They are not going to succeed at that. And so we want you to know that, but we do know that they're going to want to try. So make sure your gas is full and you're in your pantries just full as you're able to do it. You have extra water, anything that you think you might need. If you can't go to the store for two weeks or three weeks, have it have a good supply there. All right. I think that's all for today. Thank you again for your support and let's bring in Katker. So it's Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Well good morning Kat or I guess you should say it for you. It's good afternoon in it back into Florida, right? Yes I am in Florida and I guess it's afternoon. One said that your clock was off today or something. It was all three of the clocks and it's not my job to replace batteries. Okay. I do sweep and clean the floors and clean up stuff and I mean, I do do that kind of thing a lot, but I don't put batteries in the clock. So none of them were right and they were one was an hour and a half off home was an hour off and one was like two hours late. And so none of them helped me and I have something to say and so yeah, go for it. Go for it Kat. The father wants you to know that you should fear never, not ever, never in this day. He didn't give anyone a spirit of fear in case you wonder if you have fear that's not from him. So there's number one point number one if you're in fear, I'm not saying maybe you're a little concerned about things, I'm thinking if you're in real fear, that is not God. God's not putting fear in you. He's not going to say fearful things to you. He made you powerful. Right. He gave us a spirit of a sound mind. Remember that right power, love and a second gave it to us. That's what he put in you when he made you. So therefore he told me to take authority over. So right now father take authority over all fear, no matter who's experiencing it, no matter where it is in this world. I cancel you, I evict you from everybody's home, from their soul in Jesus name and I impart the life of God, the love of God, the power of God, the will, his way in Jesus name, celebration, expectation of what you're going to do father, not what the devil has planned, who's the Lord of the Flies by the way, just remember that Jesus Lord of hosts, Saint Lord of Flies says about all the wills that he has, so we thank you this day father that fear is evicted, joy and celebration, which is what you talk about, it's okay to be practical, but don't ever let fear interfere in your life in Jesus name, amen, amen, amen, and don't take all the toilet paper, don't take all the toilet paper, I've been, I've been collecting it. We've been collecting it for a few months on, I mean, we have that much, but you know, we collect it while they had plenty, because I don't want to run on the TP. Yeah, it was a good plan, collect it while there's plenty. Isn't it amazing, what did we do in this world on the earth before we had toilet paper? You know, it wasn't that many years ago they invented that, they actually invented toilet paper. I don't want to think about it. Paul Harvey had a story where there was this train full of certain, it wasn't cut up, it was rolls or something, and it didn't make its destination, something went wrong, or the guy went bankrupt or something, and someone had the idea to cut these up into smaller rolls or something like that, and it became toilet paper, he said, let's make it toilet, yeah, it was something like that. I've tried to find that article or that audio by Paul Harvey, because you know, no one told the story like Paul Harvey, you know, and he goes, and now you know the rest of the story, you know, yes, and putting it into everybody will know the rest of the story. Yeah. Yeah. Now you don't see Kat, we know that the deep state hates us. We know that they don't, that they would like to depopulate, but what has God showed you is going to actually happen? There will be no gross massacres, there will be no mass killings or dying, nodded on this time. God sent, if you think about from the Father's point of view, he sent people to the earth that he needs here right now, he needs this many people, all the ones who are here now, he sent here specifically, he timed your birth on the earth, he needs you, and in these days coming months and years coming, there will be so much activity for the body of Christ to do, even good moral people to do, new inventions, he's still sending them people, so if it wouldn't be half wiped out, that wouldn't be possible, which is why, by the way, I want to say something, it isn't that they hate us people, it's that they're very afraid of us. Oh, wow. Quite a small correction in there, the Father says, Satan doesn't hate you, he is afraid of you. Wow. Wow. Satan is the doormat, we are not a doormat, we were given power and authority, he was not given power and authority. We have legions of angels, more of the hosts ever than there is a demonic, they fire out number them, they're bigger than them, and they're ready to do things in this time on our behalf, so more than ever before the activity, what you will see is activity of the host of heaven in this world, individually doing things for people, even in groups of people, you'll see a risk is being done that would not have happened in any other way, God is about to show off his power, Satan will not get his chance, now you need to understand God has a timeline, I've seen the timeline, we're not near the end, we're near the end of the way we will be operating because we'll be in authority, in power, we'll have the great positions, we'll have the inventions, that's what is planned for our lives by the one who made you, not the one who would like to wipe you out, the reason why he wants to kill, steal all of your stories, he's afraid, he knows this is not his time people, he knows he's trying to make a rush to take it early, and guess what, do you think the God of all creation is going to let the Lord of the Flies take over right now? I think he's about to get a lot of insect bites himself, let me tell you right now, what is going to happen is God's plan, not even man's plan, not wicked man's plan, not hell's plan, okay, I don't care what their plan is, it always fails, so don't let fear be the one thing that controls you, because Satan's really good at that, he knows how to use fear, if he can get you to think about all the negative all the time, then you probably will dwell on that, you're not supposed to, he's supposed to walk in power and authority, he's supposed to rule with Jesus Christ, I haven't seen that openly happening in many places, but it's going to be, to the point the Father said, that the world will want you as a friend or to know you because you're a believer, that is how different it's going to be if you want to see your future, that's your future, not running around afraid you'll starve to death, Satan's wicked armies will come to get you and drag you away, that is not, this is not the end, this is not the time of the perilous times, this is not the tribulation people, it's hundreds of years away, and I don't mind saying that because guess what, I'll still be here saying that and you'll be enjoying heaven, so you need to understand, you say God's will, God's way, God's will not mine, but his, because when you live his will his way, you'll have celebration, anticipation, expectation of greatness in you, you were sent here to be great, not to watch the parade go by, we're supposed to be leaders, we're supposed to be the ones people look up to for answers from heaven, and man's mindset and man's head knowledge cannot come up or equal revelation from the one who made us, he knows every thought of everybody, he knows where every wicked person is, every evil camp, every hidden thing, there's nothing hidden from him, but he's going to expose all of it, and then justice is coming, he is not changing what he's saying, if you're tired of listening, don't listen, go sit with the Lord of the Flies and get a big fly swatter. Cap, do you still believe that while the deep state, especially these last few weeks before the election, I'm probably going to try a lot of things, do you still believe we need to get our popcorn out and our cake out and enjoy the show, is this a time to enjoy the show? You know I'm still enjoying the show, I will live the way the Father talks to me about, you have a choice, I'm not going to make you take what he says, but it's so easy and simple to take what you see with your human eyes, when you don't have just human eyes and you see the spirit realm, you understand, they are scrambling, to hang on to anything they can hang on to, and that would be the spiritual wickedness and the physical wickedness. They know, some of them already know, this whole thing is going to fail, they know it's going to fail. They're not saying that to their own groups, but they're very afraid, because it hasn't turned out the way they planned, because this is, this earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof, it's His. He gets to say what happens, we need to agree with Him. I'm not ignoring evil, I just don't participate in it, and when you continually repeat all of the stuff going on, I'm saying all day long, someone says what do you think about what's going on, you should say I think God has a plan, I think He's in charge and I'm on His side, because when you keep repeating what the devil wants you to repeat, you're marketing health plans, make you afraid, make you weak, strip the hope away from you, the joy away from you, you don't want to lose your joy, that's why the celebrate thing comes in. I can tell you I'm sure that Noah, it's a good thing none of you are Noah, you wouldn't have never lasted 120 years and this thing won't take 120 years, but who won in the end? I can tell you this, the Father has a plan for you, not just your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great great great grandchildren, He has a plan for you if you're alive and breathing, He has a plan for you, and that is to market what heaven is, be a testimony of what heaven is, demonstrate the power of the living God in this earth, not waiting for months to go by, you have authority right now, open your front door, kick out the devil, kick out every word, sound, image, thought, frequency of hell, if you've been watching the fake news, there's no wonder you're having issues, why not make news for God and say what He's doing in this world, setting it up for the greatest days this world will ever see until Christ sits on the throne and Jerusalem and yes, He is going to do that one day. There are people whose families and friends, close family and friends are really on their case, I have a few of those myself. Mine gave up. They gave up. Okay, I was going to ask you about that, so how do I ask this question? Is God going to in a sense vindicate, you know, vengeance is mine and all that, we don't want vengeance on our loved ones and family, but justice comes and redemption comes, is God going to redeem, vindicate whatever word we might choose, those who have held strong towards. I will say what is word, it's in power. Okay. He's going to empower those with authority and dominion who have stood and not stepped back. They will be some of the greatest leaders in this world, people will look up to them because they'll know all the time, don't stop saying what God has said, you don't stop saying it, because He is looking to see who's saying and what they're saying. Okay, He doesn't have to convince me to do it. I've seen Him in person and heard Him in person and I've seen the future. I know what the future is going to be, regardless of what the devil's trying to do, he's trying to do his great big takeover right now. He already knows it's going to fail, but he's going to take as many as he can get and he does that by crushing your dreams, by stealing your destiny. Your destiny is still waiting for you. You have to say yes to that, no to the devil, open your front door and he did anything of hell out or wicked man evicted out of your home, make a habitation for heaven and heaven in the presence of God will flood your home all the time. You have a choice, you have a choice, you can follow the Lord of Hosts or Lord of the Flies. By the way, you really mean that, of course the devil can be evicted through your walls, but you really mean open your door and let him out. If you mean that. That way if people come in and told you all the bad stuff going on or they have predicted, I won't even call it, I won't even say that they prophesied it. A true prophecy comes from God, not man's mind, by the way. It's words God spoke. He spoke them. He spoke them to somebody and said, you say this, you will say this. He's not going to tell somebody to say something that's against what he's been saying. Something that's fear getting in, they let control get in, like you said, have talked about Steve, people trying to pressure you. No one does that to me now because they know what they're going to get. Hands laid out on them. That's what they're going to get. Maybe not in the way they want to. But I will tell you this, I'm not backing up. I'm not backing up one single word that the Father has told me to say. One single thing I have been shown, guess what's going to happen? What God wants. What His plan is and what people don't see because they don't really know Him like they should know Him. They can know Him. Let's change it. They can know Him. The more you know Him, you understand how He works. He is mysterious. He's never going to do it man's way. He doesn't necessarily have to make you understand. He just says, this is going to happen and then He does it. That's good. That's good. The gospel of the Prophet is different than just the prophetic. I love the prophetic that people can see and hear and say things. It's an office, it's a place you sit in and you have authority in. So I cannot say what man is saying. I cannot agree with what they're saying. I'm not going to agree if it's against what God has said because in the end, Steve, who do you think will be celebrating the most? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I think you know John- Well, I guess what everyone else will be celebrating right along with them and they will enjoy the victory that's about to happen for us. I have no problem keeping some extra graham crackers in your closet if you want it. That's perfectly fine to do that and this day and age, it might not be a bad idea to have a few extra things around, but I do know God's not going to let anybody starve or die from starvation. He's not going to allow that. Okay. Johnny Enlo says a thing. He said it many, many times, so it's not one off thing, but he said it for a couple years now. He said, God had told him we are about to be safe from things we don't even know we need to be saved from. Is that a perspective you have? In other words, there's things that if we knew how horrific it was that God was about to save us from, maybe we'd even look at things differently. What are your thoughts about that? I know some of those things. Okay. Things it's hard to even say. But the key word is this, saved from them. Yeah, exactly. So God's plan is not to wipe us all out when he has built generations on purpose, generations like I'm seventh generation of really God doing things the way he wants to. He's been building generations with people who believe and will believe what he says. He's been building them. He's not going to, why wouldn't he let them be wiped out Steve, that doesn't even, that doesn't make sense. Okay. Right. Exactly. He's not going to do it. He's not going to get wiped out, this will not be a communist country, no matter what they say. They don't rule this country. No one sitting in the left or the hidden or the evil or the wicked or the White House or the Pentagon, anywhere else, they don't rule this country. We the people are in charge of this country and we will have what we say will happen. We will have it. I'm not talking about the darkness. What we say, justice, liberty and freedom, that is who we are, right in this moment that you're breathing, you're still free. God's not going to let that all be taken away from us, no matter how many lies they put out, no matter how many pictures they show people and they've not created one good thing. Don't expect them to do it. Don't expect them not to try to steal, cheat and lie again, but it won't help them at all because God is going to do what he's going to do and they will be brought to justice. I will not stop saying that. I will not stop saying that because that is what is going to happen. I trust him. If you know how important it was to trust God, when you begin to trust him, you begin to actually believe him. When you begin to believe him this season, you will step into a level of faith you never thought you could have. Wow. And after that, you are given a spirit of faith, a high level of faith and no one will be able to convince you that what God has said won't happen. They won't be able to. There's no way they can because you're living and walking in the spirit and not in your flesh head thinking and assuming and expecting what man has said will happen. They're wrong. If someone is afraid and they're struggling and they're having a hard time believing that and you said, if you will believe God, does that, in order to get there, does someone say, I don't feel it. It's hard to see it, but as an act of my will, I choose to believe. Is that how they do that? Absolutely. Because you know what you put in your soul is what you are. As a man thinking in his heart, your soul is at the heart or core of your being. It is a position. When he talks about the heart, he's not talking about this human beating heart, which side is that? I don't know. Whatever side is tongue beating. He isn't talking about your flesh heart when he says, as a man think it in his heart. He's talking about a position, very core heart of your being is your soul. Your soul is in the center of your being. Your mind, your will and your emotions, you know, that's what the devil is going after. Because even if he doesn't really have to do anything except control that, control what you believe, control what you say, control what you watch, control where you go. That's what he wants to do. We let him do it. Well, I stopped doing that a long time ago. Okay. I'm letting the spirit of God share with me and show me and encourage me. It says encourage one another. So if you keep sharing what the left is doing or planning or their absolute stupidity of who they think they are, they can't run at McDonald's, let alone this country. They don't know anything. They only know what Satan is putting in their soul, what wicked, evil people above them who are there controlling and some of them are about to die. So just get ready for that. Yeah. Wait a minute. Some are about to die. Yeah. Okay. So you did repeat it. So who are the some that are about to die? Just to be clear. Because you said it. Okay. This is like an Ananias and Sapphira time is what you're saying some is and I think a lot of order crossed over the line of living or dying. It's too late for them. What about what, because we, you know, when we think of Ananias and Sapphira, because I'm the one that use that, we think of people in the body of Christ. Are there people in the body of Christ who are about to leave this earth because they have chosen to not walk with them? I do know some are leaving the earth because their time is over. Okay. So don't confuse that. Yeah. You know, a great leader of God who died, I was not talking about, I said the wicked, evil people. Okay. The wicked evil who are trying to control all this stuff. Some of them. Okay. You may not even know who they are, but you will find out. You may not know who they are. Some of them are about to die. Yeah. I saw on the news. By the way, I could recommend this, there's a site called Citizen Free Press. It's kind of like a new dredge. It's conservative. And on that same day, I think it was yesterday, it could have been the day before, but I think it was yesterday, two different celebrities at the age of 32 suddenly died. Now, someone could say, well, that was the Vax, I don't know, but God is in control of life and death. And it was weird on the exact same day. And we don't know by looking at that, was it the Vax? Did they, uh, did they cross the red line with God? You know, you know, I don't know what to think about that kind of thing. I also don't want people, I don't want like believers and other people thinking maybe they crossed the line. You didn't cross the line people. He's talking about the wicked evil and some of them are hidden with evil who are actually the ones controlling. Cause I can tell you the ones in the White House aren't really running things. Not the real stuff. They're not really running it. They're being told what to say and told what to do by very wicked evil people. Some of those people, and that will affect them because then they won't have them telling them what to do. So you'll see a major thing happening in the White House, uh, probably confusion, probably a lot of confusion, more than normal confusion and other things began to like, it may even be quiet for a while because they, some of them won't know what to do now that the, the ones who thought they were going to take over everything, some of them are going to die. It's just going to happen. Like I said, I won't let them out. I won't allow them to remain on the earth. That is, those are his words. Some will die. I will not allow them to remain on the earth. So those are the ones that I'm talking about. I'm not talking about people in the body of Christ who maybe are messing around or something like that. I'm not talking about them. These are wicked evil people, more wicked than the ones in the White House. Are you in, I wanted to ask you about that. Cause that was interesting what you just said, cause we know that there's people in the basement as it were, or on the, on the earpiece as it were, or in literal, are you saying that the people that are giving the orders to the fake people in the White House, are you saying the people that are carrying out the orders are in a sense less wicked than the people that are giving them orders? I have to say that they are because they are, I know you will think that they, I'm not, I'm not cutting any of them slack and I'm not going to minimize any of the evil wickedness they did, but there are sort of what you were talking about earlier. There are more wicked people who may not even be in this country, but they're about to die. Some are going to die and it won't be expected and it will bring confusion. That's what happens in the enemy's camp when, and guess what? Satan doesn't even care if they die, he probably killed them and then he'll take them to hell and torture them more than anyone else is what he does. So you don't get anything. You gain no prize in hell when you're wicked and evil people, you get no prize, none. There's no prize in hell for anybody. And so if you, if that's who you're planning to be a part of or you are a part of it, you better get out of that really quick because it's telling you justice has already been sent, it's already been sent here. A gavel has already been stopped and no one's going to stop what God is about to do at all. And some of that, starting of it will be some, a couple, I'm not saying a lot, I don't expect 50 people to die, but there will be a couple that will die that will shock people. Wow. And maybe that shock factor that it's like who would have ever thought that might be a clue that that's one of those that were removed. It probably may not be anybody you even have heard about, not generally like living here and doing stuff here because most of those people who are in this country are the ones who are allowing to be used, paid to be used, or do it because they love evil. There's people who are over this, I'm sure Robin knows about that, that are, that are even more wicked and evil than the ones who are in the White House. The ones in the White House don't have a lot of brain. I'm just being honest, okay. And their normal brain thinking of a normal human being who's been through the 12th grade wouldn't be trying to do the stuff that they're doing because you're not going to run anything. You're going to run the end of the ground, which by the way is what they want to happen. They want to run the country into the ground, people. If you voted for them, repent for voting for them, God's going to do anything against you. You thought you were doing the right thing because of the whichever side you thought you were on. I'm on God's side, people. That's the right amount of righteousness, righteousness, justice, liberty, and freedom. That's the side I'm on. And at this moment, it happens to be the right. Yeah. Yeah. It's not that the right is so righteous. It's not that the Republicans are that much more righteous than the Democrats as a whole, but there was a more correct stance against abortion to name the big one, to name the one. Well, I think also a lot of those people did want our country to succeed. Yeah. I mean, they may have attitudes and they may not always be thinking the right thing, but generally most of that side is not going to go ahead and go along with the evil at all. They don't like it. They don't want nothing to do with it. And even major businesses, not talking about, you know, the media and all that, major well-known businesses don't like what's happening because they don't want to lose their business. Right. They don't want to. And even some of those who've remained silent, are you there? The thing you're going to start saying, some who remain silent are about to start speaking up. And are there, have you seen is what got showing you people that were, how do I just ask the question that were, let's say just two years ago, hard core left and they believed everything that was being told to them about the Democratic and the liberal establishment, whatever, who God has been slowly but surely softening. Have you seen some of that? I think it's bringing clarity to their mind about their own life and future is probably what he's been doing. The Holy Spirit can speak to anybody, even if he can speak to people who aren't believers, it doesn't mean he'll live in them, but he certainly can say things to them. Good. And their own angels can say things to them, you know, in their mind, stuff like this, you need to get out of this. This is not going to end well. This is wrong. I think he probably says something. This all is wrong. I'm sure he says that a lot to them, but you're right, Steve. There are people who are secular people and they have decided to change what they're thinking because just themselves looking at their own situation, not really participating in anything, are going to start speaking against what's going on because it's horrible government. It's no government at all. Okay. It's just control. And that's what they want to do is control. They're not even thinking they're happy and they're on the wicked, the wicked in the White House. Let's just say that you're thinking how much money they've gotten, how much control they have, and they're really excited that this whole thing's paying off for them. What they don't know is they're sinking themselves deeper in a pit than they ever knew would happen because those who are controlling don't care about them. And when, if they ever went the way they wanted it to, they would be taken out too. So evil doesn't love anybody. They hate, they kill, steal and destroy. That's what their plan is. That's why that's what looks like it's happening in the White House is because their mind is so seared right now. They can't see what's right, but they themselves can't figure out why isn't this getting better? I mean, literally, as stupid as the things are that they put out there, they can't figure out why, why they're making that happen. They don't think it's them. And it is them because this wasn't happening until that happened. Yeah. Can't live on this. And some people keep saying what God said, he is at his limit, he's at his limit. God does have a limit, people, you remember he did things in the past when he reached, when he was done with the evil and the day thereof, it was dealt with severely. And so I would say, you know, you yourself though, what you can do is give hope to people anywhere in the store, what people talking about, what's going on, it's all going to end wrong. We're all going to hell in a handbasket. It was going to hell in a handbasket, be a big handbasket will be the wicked and evil. Yeah. And I know, I can see it, that there are people that are on that side that will call the wrong side, for lack of a better word, they, they hated Christians, they hated conservative values, they hated anti-abortion, they were pro-choice, and I see some of them watching right now, and they're now waking up, they're going, what have I done? But now look what I've done, how do I get out of this now that I've made my bed, you know, the expression, you've made your bed, now you've got to lie on it. What would you say to some of those people who are waking up and then going, what have I done? What would you say to them? I would say you need to repent to God. Okay. I mean, you repent to Jesus Christ, you know, if you ever belong to Him, the things that are going on now, they are not Him, this is not His plan, He comes to bring a life and life more abundantly, where do you see abundant life? Have you produced abundant life, are they talking about having abundant life? I'm talking about the government, the illegitimate government, okay? No, because they don't care what happens to anybody, they're going to use and control, use and control, until there's no more use and control, and if you have voted for them, or you're still siding with them, or you're helping to promote them, I would really seriously ask you to just repent for all the stuff you've been involved with, to lose all the evil wickedness out of your soul, repent to God, and tell Him you want to be with Him on His side, you want Jesus Christ as your savior, and joy will flood your soul, and guess what, your eyes will be fully open to the darkness trying to take over not just this country, but the whole world, and that won't happen until the perilous times come, and the perilous times, this is not the perilous times, I know people think it is, but it's not. I've seen some of the perilous times, I've seen some of the tribulation, I've seen some of Christ sitting on the throne in Jerusalem, I've seen part of the millennial, whether you like that word or not, the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ, which by the way the Father said, you're not going to stop that from happening either, so stop taking it out of the Bible. Let me, let me, you know, Kat, you know me, I don't ever interrupt in the middle of the show to, to pray, or almost never, because I've got, you know, we're, we're getting through it, but I feel led right now, there's people watching, and they're going, what have I done, I voted the wrong, I'm looking around, it's all falling apart, I voted for this, I wish I knew how to repent, could you pray for those people right now, because there's a bunch of them, and they're going, all I just, just need is someone pray and tell me how to get out of this. Yeah, like I said, the first thing that I would do is lead you in a prayer of repentance, because when you've done wrong, and when you side with absolute evil, and I tell you, even probably 13-year-olds, 10-year-olds know that what's being said is wrong, I mean, children know it's wrong, and when you have the heart of a child, there's no evil in them, there's nothing that, that you know that, that they've had, been taken care of, they've been loved their whole life, but they can look around, they listen to anything on the news, they know that there's a mess going on, and they know that darkness, they know what evil is, my grandkids know what evil is, okay, they're young, but they know what it is, and so if you're finally gonna wake up, because I know God is shaking some people right now to wake you up, okay, he doesn't want you to lose what he's got planned for you, he doesn't want you to miss your destiny, Satan wants to steal and crush your destiny, so right now we say, I say, we would just say this together, Father, I choose with my will, to repent of all evil, to repent of being involved in voting for evil, to repent in being involved in voting for evil, I change my heart this day, I change my heart to say, and choose with my will, and choose with my will, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, I receive his will, I receive his will, his way, his way, I want his plans for this country, I want his plans for this country, and for my life, and for my life, I evict all evil and wickedness, all wicked and evil and deceiving words, they were spoken over the fake news, they were spoken over the fake news, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White House, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White House, I will lose all of them for my soul, I will live according to the Word of God, I invite Christ to abide in me i want to hear his voice i want to hear His voice i want to walk in the Spirit not to walk in the Spirit and not the flesh and not the flesh I choose to bind to my soul I choose to bind to my soul the love of God the presence of God the presence of God the life of God the life of God His will his will, his way, his expectation, his expectation of greatness, of greatness, and righteousness, and righteousness to be in this earth, to be in this earth, in Jesus name, in Jesus name, this day, this day, I step into a new place, I step into a new place, and I step out of the darkness, I step out of the darkness, I now serve the Most High God, I now serve the Most High God, I will not serve another, I will not serve another, amen, amen, very, very powerful, a lot of people got touched, a lot of people, wow, so yeah, hey, you know what, some of you watching, be sure you send this program to friends of yours, because there's some people that they're like right on the edge, and they just, you know, that you've seen them beginning to waffle about what they have believed, send this broadcast to them, forward it to them, or give them the link either way to do that, so that'd be awesome, awesome, well, you know, we have time for a few questions, anything else you want to say before we do that? Well, I do have a question to answer that someone has given me some time ago, I didn't get to answer it, they asked me, what role does Melchizedek play in our lives? Okay. Well, Melchizedek is a real being, he's not a human who died and moved to heaven, and the Bible says Melchizedek has no father, no mother, no beginning or end, which means he has always been with the father, and actually, Melchizedek is the father's personal high priest, Jesus Christ is our personal high priest, but the father is, he has Melchizedek who is sent to the earth on different assignments, at one point he was the king of Salem, he's one who received tithes, you know, when the tithes were being paid for the first time, he was on the earth, he received the tithes, Melchizedek has flesh, he's always had flesh, there's a whole tribe of angels made after the order of Melchizedek, which means they had flesh put on them, probably before we were born, I love the way the father says though, about any of the angelic tribes or the host army, he said, yes, they were made before we came, but we existed before they were made, because we lived in him, and so that's who Melchizedek is, and I know, is that a storm warning, Jen? Okay, I take power over all the part of the enemy trying to control this storm overhead of us right now, and I command the host to have them get up there and shred that storm, I refuse and review all strong winds, there'll be no tornadoes in this area, no flooding in this area, I'm over the weather, now under the weather, and I say, get out of this city in Jesus name, you will bring rain and nourishing rain, no lightning strikes, keep it in the sky, and get out of here in Jesus name, amen. Praise God, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, so again, I don't know if I did, did you have a little, I can't remember if we interrupted your flow with that, did you, did we get it? Melchizedek, yeah, a lot of people, they assumed that he was like one of Adam's sons, or they say that he was someone else who died that lived on the earth, but clearly the word doesn't say that, they can't figure out who he is, there are some of the living creatures have always, always been with the father, he didn't make them one day because he thought about it was a good thing, they've just always been with him, there's no way really to get people to understand the father has always existed, he carries time inside of him, and so that's why he's the only one that knows when Christ will return, nobody knows with the father, because he carries time, he didn't appear somewhere in time, so he's always assisted the living creatures have, the 24 elders have always existed, they're spiritual beings that serve him in heaven and all around heaven, they're not people, they're not the 12 tribes of Israel, they're not the 12 apostles, I've seen Peter Paul, I've seen John in heaven, they're not sitting there with a crown around the throne of God, so those are spiritual beings, of course Melchizedek would also be there, and people just picture nothing ever existed, there was a time when nothing existed, that's not true, before time was, the father was, the word was, which is Jesus Christ, holy spirit has always existed, but along with them would be Melchizedek, the 24 elders, the seven spirits of God, which are also seven personal spirits that serve the father, so that's a little bit of understanding and revelation for you for this question about Melchizedek, so he's always been, he was sent to the earth on assignment, and so anyway, I think that was the most important one, so if you have some questions you can go ahead. Yeah, okay, so yeah, we're going into questions about heaven or important truth, so Daniel is a six-year-old, he wants to know do we pray in heaven, I think he means either if we died and went now, or later on when it all goes, when we're all in heaven, do people pray or do we pray in heaven when we, when we go? I know one place that they, that they do make decorations and pray, it talks about the, this talks about in the Bible the souls under the altar of God, who pray and declare before the throne, and I always pictured like an altar, like you know, if you were to do into a traditional charismatic church or probably even other churches, they always had an altar down front that was maybe six inches off the floor, and people go down there to repent and do other things, they serve communion there, but that's not the way it is in the throne, the throne is a whole structure, you can actually walk underneath the throne of God, and really massive altar, many people go under there and they declare over their families, they also say things to God, not that they can't go up to a stone and say it, but sometimes they just want to do it personally or whatever, so that that's one example that yes, there are people who declare and who do pray in heaven for things going on on the earth, you know, and usually though, it's in the throne room and there's this huge room underneath the throne of God, the throne is high and lifted up, so nobody's mushed down or flattened down, so yeah, there's places in heaven, they'll go to the portal, which has been made, they're all over heaven, people go there to watch their family's lives, they can celebrate with them and different things in their life, they go there every year on your birthday and sing happy birthday to you, they don't miss you getting born again, they don't miss anything important like your weddings, your babies being born, people go to these places and they will declare blessings over you, they'll declare things over your life from heaven, so they don't ever stop thinking about us here on the earth. And when you say they declare that, that's kind of the same thing as prayer, right? It is prayer, except they know what's going to happen. They know it's going to happen. What about that, you know, you talked about under the throne, there is that scripture that says they were under the throne, it almost seems like it uses the word martyr in it, and they say to the Lord, how long till you, and I think they say, Kat, you know this better than 90, how long till you avenge our blood, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, what's the deal with that, since there's no time in heaven, why are they in heaven saying how long till you get this I think you're not talking about like a date or a time, I'm talking, they're talking about like a season. There is going to be a season where a lot of that will happen, things that were done to certain groups of people and stuff like that, there will be a retribution brought for those people, because he wouldn't have made that place for them to go and declare that. So there are several different rooms underneath his throne, it's just, it's huge, I can't even explain or give it a measurement, but there are different people down there or groups of people down there, and there are, there are some of the martyrs, I'm not saying every martyr, there are some of the martyrs who really want for the father to redeem their life on the earth by bringing justice for what happened to them, and I'm sure that he will bring justice whenever he is, whenever he does that, it will happen, and it may be more towards the end than now, but he's not having them down there just saying that for no reason, is it hard to say it, he's going to let them say it, so I'm glad that he's going in the throne and that you see visibly when you go in there, but then there's some underneath the throne of God, where people are declaring, it says if you declare and decree a thing, it shall be established, doesn't it? A decree and a declaration is that you have a face to believe it's going to happen, it's something I will do. I was in Paris years ago and we stood underneath the Eiffel Tower, and the Eiffel Tower goes forever and ever, but you can walk underneath it because there's the post, so is that kind of what you mean? In other words, the Lord is high and lifted up, sort of like you might say the Eiffel Tower is way up there, but you can still stand underneath it and see its legs or its foundations, is it kind of like that when you say it's under the throne? Well, let's just say the throne is 80 feet high, I'm not saying it is, it is very high and lifted up because if there's not just steps, there's like there's steps, then there's columns, then there's a platform, then there's steps, that they can go up to the throne, but these are actually more private places, I don't think people see it underneath the steps and you can actually see the people, there's places where they go just to talk to God and pray and declare things, but there's people sitting on the steps sometimes, usually gifts on the steps, like people will leave flowers, Christ loves flowers, I didn't know that, sometimes you'll see desserts, because Christ loves green that's good, you know that's helpful because you know you think of the throne is high and lifted up and there's you know there's training fields of temple and all these different things, but you're saying, oh there's thunder and lightning in the throne room, trust me, people run to get struck by that lightning, it's like a myth, there's a lot of love, so there is all of that that talks about in the Bible, the living creatures are as high as the throne, I mean they're really really big and they have eyes in the front of their bodies and their heads everywhere, and they're always declaring over the over those, over those Father, Son, Holy Spirit, you know in heaven, obviously you're perfectly healthy, emotionally, spiritually, physically, no pain and all that, and yet, because I've thought about this many many times, if there's something that God gives you to drink from the throne, from the rivers of life, from the throne, the water that comes from under, however that goes, it seems like it would be hard to be edified more because you're perfectly edified, how, what would you describe as, have you been there and felt the feeling as it goes into war, how is it that that feeling is better than when you're already perfect? Well, it depends on, there's so much activity in the throne, depending on when you, when you're there, I mean you could be caught up maybe five times in your lifetime and see the throne will be there, but there's so much other activity, sometimes the river of life flows from him sitting on the throne, it comes all the way down the steps, people actually will lay on the steps and drink that, and then sometimes he'll open throughout the whole throne room and be like it runs through the whole throne room, then out into the city streets, depending on whatever he, whatever his purpose is for that, but I've been there seeing people actually drinking it as it's life, it's just, it's just, it's, it's, I can't explain it, it's like the greatest love you ever felt in your life and you just can't ever get enough of him, that's why Christ said, Christ loved his father so much, he was so happy when he got to leave hell and you know, came up and he was glorified and appeared back before his father, he was so happy when he was joined back to his father, but, but people who go there are undone, there's just so many things going on, but his presence is everywhere, but when you're there with him, is that you either watch a concert or you're in it, it's the same thing in the throne room, it's greater, the greater or the even the experience of it is greater when you're there in person, then just maybe seeing it from where your mansion is or being around heaven, but you're never away from his presence, but when you're there, a lot of people do, I keep watching the angels, I got to stop them. Well, you know, I was going to ask you that, Kat, because I thought you're watching, so I was about to ask you, what are you watching, because I've never seen you look up while you're describing it and you just can't watch it. There's an over top of me right now. Wow, because it was very clear to anyone watching that you were watching something, and so, what else can you say about what you're watching? I'm just watching, I'm watching part of the activity at the throne right now, and people are laying on the steps and the river pours over them, in them, through them, a lot of people just want to drink it, and it just makes you fall in love even more with the Father, and people love to be in the throne, and then the celebration, and you hear the voice of the living creatures in the whole stone room shakes, it shakes, and the seraphim dipping down out of the glory cloud, there actually is a real glory cloud that stays permanently around the throne, a little bit above the throne, and the seraphim live there, they live in that glory cloud, and they've been with him so long that their hair, long hair looks like blue fire, and just watching them dipping down over the throne, declaring over the Father and over the Son, it's amazing, I don't feel sorry for anyone who goes to heaven, I'm rejoicing with them, I'm celebrating with them, and don't ever feel like you've lost your family members if you belong to Christ, you will never lose them, they moved to heaven for a while, and then you will all be back together again one day, and all the things that happened to them in heaven, they'll be sharing them with you, they'll take you places to see in heaven, I just had someone just say to me, I know that my sister's up there, and I know that she's making a list of places to take me, and they had not even been to heaven, I said you're absolutely right, that's exactly what they're doing, they're not up there enjoying their life while everyone's suffering down here either, they know, all of heaven knows what is about to happen down here on this earth, they know the glory is going to engulf this earth, that people will actually carry it and release it everywhere around the world, they know the baptism in fire is going to be happening, they know that this earth for quite a while will be so filled with God, that's why there will be such a mass, the mass harvest at the end will be so huge, because of the glory, the love, the life of God, we will as manifested sons and daughters actually demonstrate the power of the living God to the people of this earth, either by rescuing things or changing things or commanding things that he tells us to say, you'll see it with your eyes, you'll literally see heaven activity with your eyes on this earth, and that's what's being set up, he's going to remove a lot of the evil on purpose, so justice is going to happen, there's no man greater than God, no devil more powerful than God that can stop any of that from happening, so I'm just celebrating my life all the time, I know I have expectancy in my heart, I don't have fear in my heart at all, I know who holds me in his hand, I know what his plans are and you can know too, because these are great days you're ending into, your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great grandchildren know they're probably adding up those years, don't try to, I don't ever try to add up the years, okay, I know God's going to do what's on his timeline, I know the greatness that's being sent to the earth, the babies being born right now are some of the greatest, the greatest prophets on the earth, some of the greatest apostles on the earth, the healings are going to be so miraculous that begin to happen, that's something else that's going to start happening, miraculous healings, regardless of what's going on around, the Bible says God sets a table that's his presence, his power, his joy, and his supply, even in the presence of darkness he's going to do that on purpose, I think that also is about to start happening. I need, I want to ask you, you said something a minute ago, I do not want that to pass because I think people would want to want you to say, this is what I meant by what I just said, you said a minute ago that they aren't, I may not quote this exactly, you said they're not out there enjoying their life while you're suffering on earth, what are you trying to communicate? I shouldn't explain to some people who don't really know God, they don't know Christ, they think he doesn't care, they don't care, and they don't see what's happening, that they want to happen, they want things to happen right now, I understand that's how you feel, but when God has a plan, if he's going to expose evil it's going to be done in this time, this would be the greatest exposure of evil on the years until the perilous times start happening and they're probably close, I can't even say a year, I know I've been taking 150 years in the future and guess what, there have been no perilous times of tribulation at that time. But our loved ones are in heaven enjoying their life, they're enjoying their life, and they're decreeing and everything, even while we are suffering. They're decreeing and declaring for God to intervene on your behalf, that you will not miss your destiny, a lot of them are after saying God, I declare they will not miss your destiny, they'll fulfill what you sent them for, that my heart is for them, that I'm up here declaring over them, I have expectancy for what you're about to do in the earth, this is them speaking to the Father about their loved ones on earth. Okay, good, good, good, I want to make sure we clear that. All right, Audrey asked, has Kat Siener interacted with John the Baptist, what is his appearance now on earth, he wore clothes made of camels here, also any idea what John the Baptist does in heaven? John the Baptist is sharing things that happened when he was on the earth, but with revelation of what happened in the spirit realm, everyone who goes to heaven, you will go and see what was going on around your life that God was doing, the things he was doing behind the scenes, the things that he did that you didn't know about, and even the apostles and the disciples all got to see that about their life, some every now and then would see angels or something like that, but their whole life lived out on this earth, when they tell their stories now, they can include, but God did this, God was doing this, and it just makes it even greater, more personal for them to share, so all those people are sharing the experiences and things that happen on the earth, but with revelation about them, that's what they're doing. And John the Baptist, his, as far as- Not wearing camels here, people. He's not wearing camels, and as far as we know, as far as we're told, his only gift was teaching and declaring, but does he, I mean, would John, even someone like John the Baptist have a hobby, a fun thing that he would do, would even he have a gift that would be different than declaring? I'm sure he probably would, it probably was something to do with the nature, maybe, because, you know, he was kept in the wilderness, isn't always being just desert, I'm sure there was maybe forest or something around him, and he loved that kind of thing, I know he didn't have a lot of time, he actually didn't hear God a lot, he had him on the back side of the desert, he would share with him things that would happen, and I can tell you this, those who told or shared, if they shared a lot in their life on the earth, they're going to share more things that they found out when they got to heaven, like I was just saying, but John is not wearing camel hair, okay, you don't wish he'd taken a bath five times, but when he was down on the earth, he was not the neatest person, I'm sure he was clean in all the other ways, but the camel hair he wore, because he had such revelation given to him, there was ways God would humble prophets, he was a prophet, Jesus called him a prophet, he also is Christ, he says, you know, he's his cousin, they hang out a lot, I see John the Baptist a lot with Christ, they were cousins on the earth, and I think he also liked sweets, I know that sounds wild, but he ate locust and honey, he loved honey, Christ loved honey, he ate it all the time, and it says in the Bible that he did like it, so I just see them a lot together in heaven, because they were related on the earth, and I can tell you this, John is not wearing camel hair, and the camel hair he wore was inside out, if you have never pet a camel, if you go to Israel, if there's a hand over there, ask him, can you touch the camel, and run your hand across that hair, man, I'm telling you, it's like little mini spikes, he wore that against his skin, it was to keep him humble, that's why he did it, it was to remind him who he was, and who God was, and you know, there was things God did to the prophets, so they wouldn't think of themselves above measure, mine is pink hair, I'll just tell you right now, I was not a pink hair person, I forget it's pink, I right now can't see my hair, and that was to separate me and make me, God wants people to notice me, okay, he wanted people to notice John Baptist, when it was his time to speak, he wanted him to look different, be different, and sound different, and I had to experience the same thing, although today it's pink hair instead of camel hair, I'm very grateful. So good, so good, I'm trying to decide which of these, because we're running out of time, so this person's saying, what do the evangelists do in heaven since their duty on earth was so winning, obviously there's no soul winning, do evangelists just have their own individual gifts, is that the point? I think some of them did, and well we know, we know that Paul did, Paul had great gifts, he worked with fabrics, he made beautiful things out of fabrics, it was a gift, and it was how he supported his ministries, how he supported himself, and people came from everywhere to buy those things, I'm sure he made robes, and scarves, and all kinds of things, beautiful things with fabrics, it does mention that in the Bible, and I'm sure when when he gets time, he probably still does, still does that, but I think that was Paul. Yeah, there you go, the best of the best. The Holy Spirit's like, excuse me, but we all know that God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest he had to put hair on, so yeah, I just love Holy Spirit though, he has no problem, you know, correcting me in the middle of everything, Paul worked with fabrics, and he did that, and he was very good at that, Paul, I'll tell you what, I see Paul quite often, he's always in the gardens, outside the throne room, there's beautiful gardens, and people come there to see him, they want to know what did you feel like when this happened, what did you think when this happened, see, is people asking questions more than anything else, and people, and of course they're going to share, so they share, they still share a lot, but they have things they like to do, some of them like to work with, some some of them like to cook or bake, some of them like to make things with their hands, I know that there were other of the disciples like Peter is still fishing, that was his gift, he fished, he fished before he became a disciple, and he fishes now in heaven, people can go fishing with him, my husband said he's going to be his new best friend just in case you wondered, and this has to be catch and release, right, this has to be catch and release because unless you get caught, unless you get, because you said they play tag or something, I don't know how you worded that, yeah, they do, and well you know I already said the creatures all talk to you, and that is no different with the fish you're trying to catch or the bull you're trying to ride in the rodeos, and someone will probably slam me for that, get over it when you get there, you want to ride one, and I'll forgive you for it, but but the creatures all talk, they have a voice, they talk to your pets, they'll talk to you a lot, I love that, it will be nice, and we just sent our mama cat went home to heaven the other day, oh wow, yeah, and this is just not strange, but just like God, my mom has a pet dog out in Arizona where she would visit her mom to her mom went home to heaven, her brother went home to heaven, but she has a pet dog out there, the same day that the mama cat went to heaven, her dog in Arizona went to heaven, oh my goodness, yeah that's not a coincidence is it, it's not a coincidence, it's not, it's not, and for anyone that's new, of course I think our poor family, we had lots and lots and lots of pets, a horse, two miniature donkeys, four dogs at one point, but a zillion's a cat, so those animals will be dispersed among family members I'm thinking, but every single pet is in heaven, and we all, there are pets right, yes, you have a big enough place for them to be in though, it's good that we're going to need acreage for that, so you'll need, you do get acreage, trust me you can have acreage, but by this time they've already made, by this time Steve they've already made friends, so they'll probably bring their friends over too, oh that'd be good, grandkids and pets, people go, you know what, they think of just nuts the way I top it, you know what, God is holy and powerful and so captivating, to be in front of the power that he carries and see him demonstrate it, but the love he has, he is love, I know Christ is love, I know that, but so is the father, you have to see that he is number one, a father with lots of children, when you come home to heaven, you come home, let's say you're married, you don't go home as husband and wife, you go home as god's son and god's daughter, you get your own mansion, it can be right next to each other, there's no problem with visiting or anything, but he, he is a father, is going to provide a place for you, and he made fun places on purpose because if you picture yourself as a dad, and let's say you have four kids, if you didn't have some way for them to have fun, you would really be. Now cat just froze on my screen folks, is it frozen on anyone else's screen? I'm listening to my staff, it's frozen on my screen, yes it's frozen, do you want to try and boot her out and have her come back? Well that was a new, we don't, that doesn't usually happen with cat, so could be the storm there, yeah they could be having a storm, so we'll see if we get her back, it's kind of at the end, if you guys are willing, want to just dismiss her, that's okay too because we're kind of at the time, if you say go ahead and, and Steve will say goodbye, just kind of let me know what to do, if anyone wants to tell me what to do. Texting chins, yeah you know I was talked about my own, my daughter had a cat, Ebony, he's a black cat, he was a black cat and he got sicker and sicker, and I was dying at the time, I was under 100 pounds, some of you have heard me tell that story, it was very near death and she was dying, and I didn't, it's not that I sat there thinking I'm dying, I knew I was very very sick and they hadn't figured out what's wrong with me, now, it'd be nice to have closer to that, under 100 pounds, but I, I remember talking to Ebony and I'd say someday, because I knew she was not going to be here really, so I was laying on the couch, sick sick, everyone's gone, Ebony's on the chair and I said someday in heaven, you and I, we're going to talk, oh their internet went out, he says they will try one more time, but I said someday you and I are going to have a conversation about all of all this, and I felt like honestly that I was communicating with Ebony a boy cat, he was a beautiful cat, but you know, because as he got sick and sicker, he couldn't clean himself, so he then became a beautiful dirty cat, but you know, it'll be fun to see what happened to Ebony and try and talk with him and say, do you remember that? That's what I think I see myself saying is to the pets, I'll say, do you remember when, if God gives me that memory, so, but we had so many cats, we were cat people and so now we've had a lot of dogs, so, well, you know what guys, it's 10 44, it went long and if they're still trying, I think probably this is a good time to dismiss it, it was a great, great show, we got good, good answers, so I'm going to go ahead and say to the people, thank you so much for the show, tomorrow we have Patel Patriot, who talked a lot about devolution, not evolution, but devolution, which has to do with the president redistributing authority to those people beneath him, so that the continuity of government can continue, he will talk about devolution and anything else God's put on his heart, he was great, this will be our second time, he's very, very popular on the internet, especially among patriots, so we remember that, so Patel Patriot will be tomorrow, it will be very, very, very good, so be sure and tell your friends, we will be, until further notice, we'll be on rumble only and when I say rumble only, I mean rumble and Facebook and theeligialist.com, just not YouTube, so with that, have a great day everyone, God bless you and we will see you again tomorrow, same time, bye bye. you

Well, happy Wednesday, September 7. We're recording this on Tuesday, September 6. So not to confuse you with the date is off behind us. I'm just changing a couple of things so this doesn't blink on us. Anyway, welcome to the broadcast. This is our second show today because we're recording this on Tuesday for Wednesday. So it's gonna be a great show with Kat. We just had a good one with Johnny, which you will have seen by the time you see this. But anyway, I just had a really neat time talking with Kat's mom. We need to have her. I can't remember her first name, but we're gonna have her on with Kat one of these times and get some of that wisdom from her. But anyway, without further delay, let's go ahead and watch Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. There she is. There's our lady. Your mom said the pink lady has arrived. So I just had a really nice chat with your mom sitting in your chair. So that was a delight. I haven't seen her since the cruise. We were on, I think so. Well, it's been a while. Yeah, it's been a while. So tell us about the clothes you're wearing. Cause you said there's something special about what you're wearing. Well, this shirt right here, we have our own women. We have a women's group and a men's group. The women's group is called Wonder Women, Doing Signs and Wonders. Awesome. And this is actually, this is the logo we made for it. It looks crooked on the camera, I don't know why, but it's not crooked. Anyway, it's a W and it's got purple and silver in it. But that's what it says. It says right here, Wonder Women, Doing Signs and Wonders. And there's some of the most powerful meetings we have. We probably have close to 800 women, maybe a thousand women come from all over the world. I think 30 countries came the last time. And I'm telling you what, they had no problem ruling, sending the host or anything. It's a really powerful event when we have it. The men is called the Dread Champions because hell will dread them. I love that. Hey, can women order that shirt? Is that for sale on your site? I would say it will be very soon. I'm just kind of showing you, this is the one that we had the last time that we, you know, we didn't have a Wonder Women meeting. It's been two years, but we're going to have a Heaven's invitation, which is our premier annual event we have. And we are going to have Wonder Women, a separate meeting. I don't have dates for those yet, but we'll get them as soon as we can. But yes, this is the symbol. We have a different color, some of the different colors and everything in it. But the women have a powerful time when they do come. And then the men, we actually bring a prophet over from England, who speaks with my husband. And they said, I still speak. I still speak, people still want me to speak. So I still speak to all the men, but my husband and Nick, they have powerful, I forgot what they call it. Respiratory or what? Workshops. Okay. Two, two-hour workshops during that event. And then my son-in-law opens for me, that would be Ben, the megamarked canvas that God calls a couple very fierce against the darkness. He opens my meeting every time I speak at the men's meeting, but then I finish it off. So you're going to get a lot, man, when we, you should be getting an email soon, because we're finally, now that we're moving though, we'll probably wait until the office moves to do that. So we're really going to get all of our emails started. We've already designed one for Wonder Women, one for Dread Champions, one for the host. We're going to have the Guardian Zone, and we're going to have a spirit force. I think spirit force, we may already have that one. So we are going to really go into high gear. Once we get into our offices, probably this year, or maybe the first part of next year, everyone else would say this year, please. Yeah. Wonder Women logo. And usually what we do, because when the daughters of God meet, he wants them to enjoy themselves too. We have powerful, a powerful event. We have activation, we have training, but we also do something fun. We actually, we actually get one of these, a lot, like a human size, big camera things, and we go, I'll take pictures together. And I know that may not mean much to some of you, but it's really a memory of the power of God and the life of God that you experienced at our meetings. And so we do that, and everybody has one to take home with them. It's really an awesome time. We have a luncheon too, so I can't wait to have that again. But right now, I'm heading to Colorado. You know, tomorrow, I'll be in Colorado. And then after that, I'll be, of course, in Nebraska. Are those venues full, or can people still come to the one in Colorado? I think the one in Colorado is totally full, except Saturday and Sunday. It's a women's event. It's their women's meeting. It's activation, not activation. Jen, what is the name of the event? Gateway on Mount Zion. What, again? Gateway. Gateway on Mount Zion. I'm so focused on even going. Gateway on Mount Zion is in Golden, Colorado, mile high in the sky. The women's thing is full. That's at Copper Mountain. But Saturday night, this Saturday night, and this Sunday, this Sunday morning, they're having, I will be speaking, both meetings in Colorado at that place in Golden, Colorado. There's a sanctuary where they got burnt. Oh, my goodness. But they have a huge tent outside. So it'll be outside. It's probably going to be in the 50s at night, so that might be enjoyable for everybody. This Saturday night, I'll be speaking there and this Sunday, and that is still open to people to come. Nebraska, I think they still have some seats left. It holds 9,000 people. I'm sure that they opened the heavenlies with Hank Kooniman. Wow. The event. I think they definitely still have some seats there. And I don't think it costs anything to come, but you have to register. So definitely go on Lord of Host and register for that event. That would be the 15th, I think, right, Jen? Is it 15? Yes. His mission is called Lord of Host Church, right? And he's in the- Lord of Host Church, yes. And he is in Omaha. Omaha, Nebraska. A couple miles down the street is the Mid-America Center, which is where they're holding it, it's being held there. And it's going to be huge. It's the 15th. 15, 16, 17, 18. Is that it? Well, the conference is the 15th, 16th, and 17th. And they're going to have Flashpoint Live there. They'll have Flashpoint Live on Thursday, I think, right? And then even Rod Parsley's coming to be one of the keynote speakers. Wow. He definitely does not believe us. The end right now, he's a powerful, live integrity man of God. And guess what? Well, King Christmas, I think, will speak that day also. And Phil Driscoll is coming to play his trumpet. Oh, man, I love that trumpet. He is amazing. I listened to him play live one time. Yes. And it's the only time, listen to this, it's the only time that I've ever listened to music when only the music, without words, obviously, all of a sudden, tears are streaming down. And it was like, it just completely overcame me. Heaven shows up. I know, I know he has family here. And I know them really well. And I'm telling you that man has never stopped for years. He's so powerful in the spirit. But he'll be playing, I know, for Rod Parsley's meeting, and maybe the one before that, he'll be playing, I think, that's Friday, Friday night. Saturday will be Brenda Kahneman. And then me, I'm speaking, Robin Bullock is speaking. And then Hank Kahneman speaking. Oh, my goodness. It's going to be a powerful time. That's amazing. And people can still get into that, you think. Yes, I'm pretty sure they can. And then Sunday is just their church, but I think they're holding their church there, I think. I'm not sure. But I think Sammy Rodriguez is going to be doing Sunday service. And man, he's going to knock it out of the bar, I can tell you. So it's going to be a very God, very, very prophet-oriented things from God with those powerful prophets all being together. And as far as you know, Kat, is he streaming that live as well, do you know? Will people be able to watch it online? I think you can sign up for the streaming, but you can check that out on Lord of Host in Omaha, Nebraska, that's his website, I think. But as of today, they have some seats left in the auditorium. Like I said, it holds 9,000 people. We're bringing 17 members just so we can have our products table. Geez, wow. There'll be so many people coming. And so I'm excited about what God's going to say. It is going to be life-changing. Well, I hope I know you guys will have it on tape. If there's something that ends up being recorded, maybe we can play a clip or something next time around there. I think that same weekend, I'm going to be reawaken America with Clay Clark and all of those. A lot of people, it's like a combination of they're all conservative, they're all patriots, but some are saved, some are not saved. And so there's a lot of evangelism that goes where Robin Bullock was there last time he didn't speak, but Amanda Grace goes every single time virtually. So this will be my second time at the reawaken. It's quite a patriot event. So that'll be fun. That's up in the Spokane area. I think it's very inspiring. I'm telling you, people, there are things that are going to be happening in this country. And I'm sure that you're going to find out some of that at that meeting, the men that Steve will be at. I know you'll hear a lot of that, too, where we're going to be, because I know the heart of Hank Kahneman and Robin Bullock has told me on what God is doing right now. And I know that's what their event with the Patriots is going to be just like that. But from the patriot point of view, this country wouldn't be anything without the Patriots. The Patriots stood in the beginning for this country, the freedom, and they're still standing for the freedom of this country. So awesome. It was an exciting time to be alive, and it really, really is exciting. Well, listen, while we're talking about jump off and share anything else you want to share, we'll have questions about heaven and things, but anything you want to share before we do that. We only have an hour today, because this is my second show. My in-laws are going to walk through the door, or my in-laws, so they'll be fun. The two boys are very rambunctious, so they'll come in. And so at that point, we may not be able to hear each other, so anyway, anything else that's on your heart about what's going on? I just know last night in the nighttime, I kept hearing the father saying to me that something was going to happen very soon. And normally, he doesn't speak to me like at night when I'm already in my bed, but I was still awake. And so I guess he decided to take advantage of that. I just saw him moving his hand over this country. Really? He didn't let me see what he was doing, but he was doing something. I'll tell you, I know that he said on purpose when I hit the gavel that last week, the gavel when it was hit, he said, justice was released then, and certain things are going to start happening very powerfully around this nation, and even overseas, that regards this country. And yes, he does love this world, and he has a lot of plans for this world, and his plans count, not the devil's plans. And we are going to see so much exposure. I know that's going to start happening. Like I already had said, there's going to be a couple of people die that are doing wicked evil stuff. I don't know who those people are. I do know that they will actually drop dead. And when that happens, you're going to know something significant is about to happen. How about that for a sign? That I want them to die, but these are God's plans. This is his world. He has plans for it. He's not allowing evil to take over, in case you wondered. He's not allowing it to happen. So all the things that have been said, this is what it's going to be. This is a new norm. No, it's not. Hell's trying to make it their new norm. They don't get a voice. They don't have a voice. They don't have authority. They don't have permission. They have nothing. They don't have anything to stand on. And even their foundation is crumbling. They've already been building. It's done cheaply. It's done with no intelligence whatsoever involved in it. You should know that by the reports coming up from Washington DC. I can just say, our lives are in God's hands. Our lives are going to be great, powerful, and amazing. That's what God has plans for all of us. So any of these events you can make it to, just make sure you stay tuned into Holy Spirit, if you can hear him. And if you don't have him, you should invite him inside of you, because let me tell you, he'll talk to you out here, or he'll talk to you in here. And then he never stops talking to me. So he's like coming into, I don't call them days of horror, or terror, or loss of everything. That's not going to happen. This is not the tribulation, people. The devil gets a couple of years for that, and it's not right now. And he knows it. And I tell you, I got a text saying that the left is threatening, saying that we should all be scared. I think they are the ones who should be scared, because the God of heaven and earth knows exactly what's going on, and he's going to do what he wants to in this time. So start thanking him for that. Yeah, I heard a major ministry got kicked off completely off of YouTube, and they keep trying to take more of us out. We have two strikes against us, but I don't have a lot of fear. We're on rumble. We may or may not be on YouTube for long. I think they're gunning for most of us, but their time is coming. Whoever's doing this stuff. They're afraid. Yeah, they're freaking out. They think if they don't get rid of us, the plan will fail. But God's not going anywhere, people. And he's the one in charge. And we all know he holds the air we breathe. Yeah, he does. And he should not have fear anywhere in you. I almost wore a shirt that said, don't let fear interfere, which is something Holy Spirit is always having me tell people. Do not let fear interfere in your life. Don't forget that. These are days of wonder and splendor and God's power in this earth. Well, and I think you were the first one that I heard. It was 2012, I believe, when God said, talk with you about let the show begin, was it 2012? It was pretty close to 2012. I think it may have been a little bit before that, because it's when the first elections were starting. The first elections that was won, actually won, and he got his seat. But I do know, let the show begin, was God knowing all this was going to happen. It was said before these days were in, it was before 2019, 2018, 17, God actually had me say, let the show begin, and guess what? He was talking about his show, not the evil show. Yeah, and back then we knew nothing. I remember you were, when you first said that, none of this stuff had happened yet. The selection hadn't been stolen, nothing had happened. It was just like, I just thought onward and upward. Well, it is onward and upward with God, it always is, but we didn't know what we would have to endure, if for lack of a better word for it. We didn't know this whole COVID thing. So God knew what they were up to. He did, he knew before they ever did it. Nothing is hidden, it says in the Bible, nothing is hidden from him. Yeah. And even those who believe he is not, will find out he is. Yeah, these are amazing times. So my wife just walked in and said, hi. She's got a haircut, so she's- Hi. Hi, Noreen. She can't hear you, but she's smiling, so anyway, she just came back because she's got her hair done. She probably didn't like that I had her come on the camera. Yeah, but she's just sweetie. We like to see her though. Yeah, we do like to see her. So, well, let's see, where do we go? Anything else you wanna say before we get into questions? I've got a whole couple of pages of that. I just, I have one, a little boy sent me some time ago. Oh, okay, all right. And I know it's something you have. So, but something very important, a lot of parents don't understand operations of the spirit realm and what certain images mean or even certain movies have things in them. I wanna encourage people to never have your child watch something that has witchcraft in it. Okay, wow, yeah. We know some things are fantasies and some are not fantasies, witches are not fantasies. It's something that's real. They spoke against it in the Bible, said have nothing to do with the necromancer. That is a witchcraft. And they have different levels in that whole area of, there's warlocks, there's wizards. These are dark images. These are dark beings that represent hell. And they've been around since the angels tried to, you know, take over earth when the watcher angels fell and they introduced human sacrifice during that time. This is a long before you were here. And so the dark arts have been around a long time, but there is no good witches. Just so you know, no good witches, no wizards, no warlocks that are good. They're all very evil and wicked. And they do all kinds of horrible things. And so this little boy was serious. He's 10. And he said, he says, I worked for his grandfather. He's the first little boy ties to me. I thought that was awesome. So we get the question, do you think the Habba is good to watch? And Jack, I won't answer that quite clearly. It has, is it wizardry? It has wizardry in it. Now they're showing good wizardry, bad wizardry. There is no such thing. There is no good witchcraft, no good wizard. There isn't, not even the Wizard of Oz. That was a fake, okay? But there's no good witchcraft, no good wizard, no good warlock. They are all evil beings. And I happen to know in that movie, The Hobbit, they have one. So I would say no. I told my grandchildren, no, don't watch that. I told my own children, every younger do not watch that. Why? Because it plants images in your soul as a child to accept the fact that they are good. Yeah. They need to be doing good acts, but they are not good. That's not a good title, or it's not a good position to have. No witchcraft, no wizardry, no warlock, should be on your list to read about or watch. So that's my answer, Jack. Be wise in the spirit. And make sure that you understand what God is against. He knows what is evil and what is not. And like a superhero, that doesn't mean they're evil, okay? But if they have a witch involved, a wizard involved, even though they're doing good things, which is not the truth, do not watch them. So there you go, Jack. Well, yeah, and you know, as a kid, we all watched The Wizard of Oz. I don't know if you did, but we watched it. And there was the white witch, and she was the good witch. And then there was the wicked witch of the East or something. And we always knew that witches weren't good, but at least for the movie's sake, we thought, well, she's nice, she's sweet. The Wizard of Oz, that character was not a real one. He was a carnival man who got caught up and taken to the Land of Oz. That's not like a bad place. But showing people even way back then that there were good witches and bad witches, that part was not real because the witches are always bad. And they know it, they do know it. And so for that reason, I won't even watch that again, not because of the guy who is the carnival guy who gets caught away in the balloon, the air balloon, but because it has as good witch, bad witch. And I'm telling you, that's gonna come to the earth. There'll be a whole group of them saying, look, we're good. You know why? Because the truth is that there is a guy who will be known and nobody will believe the lie, there is no God. That's what's happening right now. God's gonna expose all the darkness and the gray area. There's a gray area that says there is no God. That's gonna be erased. And he told me that himself. People on this earth will know there is a God and they don't want him or there is a God and they're gonna worship him. And he's gonna erase that lie. So they're gonna have to come up with something new to deceive people. And one of the things they will use is that there's good witches and they will on purpose show themselves healing people. All Satan has to do is remove the sickness off of those people because this is his plan to believe the lie that they are good and they are not good. Yeah, so good, it reminds me of anything occultic. I had what I would consider a divine appointment. I was 30 years old at the time because, or 35 because I remember where I lived in Texas. I met a Toys R Us shopping for our kids. They were pretty young back then. And I'm just looking at the aisle and some light. He's like a 10 year old boy, eight to 10. And I clearly didn't work there. I wasn't, didn't have a uniform on. And he says, excuse me, sir. And I said, yeah, what can I do for you? And he goes, I'm looking at this Ouija board. Is this okay? Is this okay? And I said, I said, no, that is not a good thing. I don't even remember what I said, but I said him straight that this was of the dark side and the devil. And he goes, thank you for telling. I mean, can you imagine where that boy might've been heading had God not set that, that divine appointment? When that came out, everybody was pushing it more so you can contact the dead. I mean, this is what they were saying. You can contact the spiritual realm. They didn't mean to make it sound evil. And yeah, I happen to know when people would use those back in the day, when I was growing up, that demons would appear to people and then it would, and I'm not gonna say anything that would make kids want to go get one because you're welcoming and opening yourself up to the darkness. That represents evil all the way. There's nothing good about it. It's something you need to get rid of. If it was in your house, clean your house, open the door and kick out all those evil spirits. Because that is one of the main things that they use to fool children or young people to see something exciting happen. But you don't want to be involved or participate with the darkness. It is not a good thing. Yeah, that was amazing. Follow that one. I'll never forget that. I think, because you pray for divine appointments and this and that, but you're just walking in the toy store and this boy knew something was off about that game and he must've had money in his pocket and he wanted that. He thought to ask, you know, I'd love to know meet that boy in heaven one day and say, what happened after that? You know, you know, when we walked away, he said. All right, well, speaking of kids, I've got a four year old that wants to know, her name is Reagan, his or her. I think it says Reagan. I can't tell if that's a boy or a girl. It says, are there parks with swings in heaven? That's what he or she wants to know. Are there parks with swings? Yes, and when Jen gets her book published, I'm going to have her up her answering questions too, because God has shown her heaven in cartoon form. She's writing books about all the encounters I hadn't had in heaven, but on a child's level. And Jen knows that there's parks in heaven there are. There's all kinds of fun things for children to do and be a part of, but yes, there's parks, like parks you never saw before. They have huge slides coming down out of the sky, like little slides that kids slide on. I think that's probably where the carousel, there's a carousel that has living animals on it. I'm getting ahead of now, Jensen, you're telling me about my book. These animals are like, I'm not kidding. Sharks, unicorns, bears, baby dinosaurs. This carousel is huge, but there's not a pole going up through them. They're just standing on this carousel that's going around and you have the most fun on this carousel in heaven. And so that is part of this park that I saw there. And so it's real exciting. So you're going to love the parks in heaven. They're all over heaven, all different types of them. And so you ask a good question. Is there parks in heaven? Absolutely, yes. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Now this one says, Shannon Ray, I can't tell the age, but she wants to know, is there dancing in heaven and where they use, where they have the use of flags in worship, so flaggers and dancing, I guess, in worship. I have to say, absolutely, yes, I've been to the throne room many times and God loves pageantry, started in heaven. Pageantry started in heaven. They have these huge flags and yes, people actually make them in heaven. That's one of the gifts they have. They make them and they put like lions on them, eagles on them. There's some of the angelic embellished on these flags. And when people run with them in the throne room, they come to life. Like the lions roar off of the flags, okay? I'm talking about like that a lot. Wait, say that again, the lions roar off the flag? Did you just say that? Yeah, the low head will move like this and begin to roar out into the throne room. They can't help it with, you know, there's a father on the throne, there's his son on the throne and they get undone. But yes, that's the difference between heaven and everything is alive in heaven. So this flags and all this beautiful pageantry they have in heaven is something wonderful to see. You can even participate in heaven. And of course they have dancers, they have dancers here on the earth because I'm trying to remember the scripture that I know it's in Psalms. It says that one of the highest levels of worship is dance. It says so. And it says, when they dance and worship, it binds the enemy and fetters of iron. And that is the very scripture that all my daughters lived by. They all are parts of dance come to cushion dance companies. They still do dance, all of them. And it's a very powerful in the spirit and it even does, it does say that scripture so that when you dance and worship, you are binding the enemy that would be Satan and fetters of iron. So good, now you, you're talking about the arts for a minute and I'm trying to remember what you said because you had contrasted this. He said, now and on earth, there's worship other than people do art to the worship. Didn't you contrast that was saying, but in heaven, there's something different about the way that goes down. Do you know what I'm asking? Yes, yes, although totally is, and I was shown this, I was visiting Reading, California, Bethel. I wasn't invited to speak, but I was invited by their intercessors to come and see the healing room they have there. And they had artists, of course, their artists were over on the side and they were playing in worship on the stage. Normally, even at our own meetings, we will do this. We have a powerful worship, but we always invite artists to come, our own artists are there, and they're painting what they're seeing in the spirit during the worship. I've known they've done that several other places too when I've been present at meetings to speak and they'd have artists up there painting in the spirit, what they saw while the people were worshiping. Well, in heaven, it's a little bit different. In heaven, the one who's holding the baton to lead the worshipers is an artist. And they will worship to what the artist is painting. So as the artist is painting, they're painting so that the people like, now if they were on the platform painting now, you and the audience would see the art. That's not in heaven. And heaven is the opposite. The artist is standing with a worship team behind them so they can see what the artist is painting and what they paint. They worship to that. They worship and that's what the music, they're hearing music as the artist is painting, they're hearing sounds and frequencies and instruments. And I told the people at Bethel because I was there and I was watching the artist paint and I saw that going on in the spirit. And I actually told them, they said, if you can tell us something that we haven't heard before that we would be interested in, we'll let you in the room. That's what they said to me. And what I told them was that I said, do you know that when you have artists on the platform painting, the worship team will paint what they're hearing from the art so they let me in right away. And I saw what happening. I said, wow, do you all realize, cause I could see what the artist was painting and went around that side of the stage. When you realize that what they're worshiping and what they're singing is what's on this art coming off this canvas and they got, and then the artist fell out in spirit when I said that. So yeah, so that's one of the ways that things are done differently. They are the ones who lead the worship, the artist with their art creates words, sounds, frequencies and music as they're painting. And that is what they play and sing in heaven. Now you've talked about while we're on the subject, you've talked about, I think there's a scripture that says it'll give you garments of praise for heaviness or something like that. I don't have that memorized. Talk about, cause you've spent a long time since you've mentioned this, what are garments of praise actually in heaven? They really do exist. And we all know that it does talk about them. It talks about them in the Bible. He'll give you garments of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness, I think is what the scripture says. And it's one of the gifts the father gives out himself when you come home to heaven. And people know that I did see Whitney Houston go home to heaven the night before. She's saying in a lounge type area, she's saying with all her soul, yes, Jesus loves me. And when she did, she was receiving Christ the next day she passed away. And I was in another state. I think I was out west on the Western tour. And I was sitting there waiting to speak and I was instantly caught up to heaven. I did not know that she had passed away even. I was caught up to heaven and I was standing near the throne and I saw Whitney Houston up there. And the father was telling her how much you loved her and he thanked her for using her gift on the earth. And he was so pleased that Jesus Christ had her what had walked her up the steps and said, here father, your daughter has come home. I got to see all that. And I don't know what was going on. I know they were worshiping in this meeting that I was gonna be speaking at but I was up in heaven watching this. And the father said to Whitney because you were willing to use the gift I put in you I'm gonna give you one of my own things. One of his own gifts that he had. And he took out this little treasure box. It was the embellishment on it was alive. The colors were moving all over this little treasure box. When he opened it, the color garnet, it was a color. When I saw it come out, it came out like a color and it started squirreling and it became a garnet fabric. And it went all the way around Whitney and became this gown, a beautiful garnet gown. And he said, because daughter, you've been willing to use the gift I put in you. I'm giving you one of my own songs that only I have sung. And Whitney was so undone. She was young, she was beautiful. She's so filled with the light of God. Cause you remember she got saved the night before. And so she had light, the light of God in her and all she did was move her hand and when she moved her hand, the father's song came off of the garment and you heard him singing. Really? His voice? So let me tell you that there's no way you can understand the scope and the beauty and the power of the gifts, the rewards he gives you in heaven. You're going to get rewarded. Okay. If you did things for him, you wouldn't want to stop him. Some people go, well, I don't want any recognition. You don't get a choice because it's him recognizing and honoring what you did on this earth. So everywhere Whitney would go wearing that gown when she chose to wear it. And when she chose to change in her own chambers, it would come off, go back in, I know this later. I found this out later. It went back in the treasure box. Whenever she wanted to wear it, she'd open it and it came out the same way. It would come out with this color, become a fabric weight or she'd walked down the streets of gold. Never she went. People could hear the father singing off of her gown. And the father looked at her and said, this is a garment of praise. Kat, I can hardly contain this. When you said he's thanked because you're willing to use, you were willing to use this gift, was he referring to only the night before that she did that or was he referring to her using her gift during her lifetime? If you even know the answer to that. He meant her using her gift willingly during her lifetime. During her lifetime. Okay, so even when she wasn't saved, she was still, okay. She was using the gift that he put in you. Let me tell you. A lot of people are using the gift God put in them and hopefully they're gonna find that out one day. But he did let her know. She knew God gave her that gift. She knew it. She knew it. And I didn't say she always lived right, but she did create gospel albums with that gift and they're so powerfully, they're anointed that she was anointed to sing and worship. And when God sent her as that little spirit of light and knit her together in her mother's womb at the time of conception, that gift was already in her. When he says, the Bible says, God said, I knit you together in your mother's womb. He's not talking about putting your arms and legs on. We can't make a human spirit people, okay. Our side is creating the flesh side, but there's real no real life in anything until that spirit is attached. Like when God made Adam, when God spoke and the word made Adam and his body was laying there, lifeless, the father leans over because that's where we all came from. We live in him and him, we live, we move, we have our very existence. That's talking about the father and he leans over and breathes from inside himself, Adam's spirit. And he said, he received the spirit of life when he breathed into Adam's nostrils and then Adam became a living soul. That's what the Bible says. He became a living soul because that came from the father. The spirit and the soul came from him. And so that's what he means at the time of conception, that early, when conception takes place, the father sends that little soul, that little spirit and soul and he actually attaches the edit that daughter flesh. And that is when life begins. You know, when you're talking about God gave her that gift, it was a beautiful gift of, you know, she had the gift of music. So God gave her more of the same. There are people that are not singers and they may not even yet be gifted as musicians. And they were usually, let's say, a builder who loves to build, they can't wait to build, they've always built cause they were like the carpenter. Does their gift in heaven relate to that kind of thing? Did they use that kind of gift as well, like building? I think he could still give somebody a garment of praise. It doesn't mean he can't give them one, but for her. For her, that's what he chose for her. And you get more than one gift anyway, but I'm quite sure. I know that the father and the son build our mansion, just so you understand, it says not made by hand. You get a mansion not made by human hands. But there's places all over heaven that people who have a gift to build and design get to be a part of that. They work with Jesus when they get to heaven and build these other places, not mansions, but places to go and enjoy, places to have excitement in, places where people are going to worship in or be together in. And what he would give them probably as an awesome gift would be heavenly blueprints to build something up there in heaven. That makes sense to me. And it sounds like really good news for someone. I mean, I'm not a builder, but I mean, there are people who get up in the morning and can't wait to make something else out of wood, you know? So, all right, well, here's a woman named, well, she goes by the handle cupcake. She says, Kat, if I'm just a mom, wait, the spirits all over me today. I keep, I'm this close to weeping out everything I read. Kat, if I'm just a mom living in New York City, how much authority do I have over strongholds? My street, my neighborhood, my whole city? So that's her question. I will tell you what the word says. When Jesus Christ was talking to his disciples and not just to them, but any believer and Jesus said, I give you power over all the power of the enemy. That should answer your question right there. We are over the darkness, not under the darkness. Satan is the doormat, we are not the doormat. We get the crowns from Christ to rule and reign. He says, you are ruling reign with me now. Now that's in the spirit realm over the darkness. We rule over that. That's Jesus' choice as a believer. If you've been born again, okay? You have deposits of things in your soul that you use to operate in this earth. Most people don't find out about them, although the word clearly talks about them. But Jesus did say, I give you power over all the power of the enemy, you know? And we can assess, they're in there, what you can do, things that you can do. So there's no enemy, there's no spiritual darkness that should have more power than us as a body of Christ, us as a believer in Jesus Christ, who lives in us, Christ lives in us. And the plan of God and of Christ always was for us to take authority and power and authority in this world and change things. By the way, we live our life, the choices we make, the words we speak. It says, what you dare to declare and decree, it will be established under you. So you can declare and decree that the gangs are not taken over your city where you're at, you're not tolerating them anymore. You don't partner with hell in any way whatsoever and begin to evict them from your city, stand in your yard, stand in your house and say that. You're taking the realm you live in and you have every right to do that and it doesn't matter what it is. If it's murders going on, if it's gangs going on, if it's drugs going on, it doesn't matter. You need to take authority all over all the evil and the wicked spirits of darkness that is promoting that and powering these people to do it, you learn to say something against it. Doesn't mean you have to show up at their place, you have authority in the spirit, you can speak from where you are right now against all the evil darkness even going on now. You do not have to receive the words of those who are wicked and evil trying to control you and that means that any time in your life, you don't have to put up with it because Jesus Christ lives in you, he waits for your words. The army of heaven waits for your words. So what are you saying? Are you complaining? Are you, all you're talking about is a darkness. If all you're talking about is the evil and darkness, you're gonna have that all around you. If you don't like it, then evict it from your life, evict it from your home and start declaring what God says, okay? Jesus is the restorer of our souls. He died on the cross, you're washed clean by his blood, you're the power of his blood, his name, his word, his authority that he has given us, that's who you are. You are not weak, you are not forgotten, you were called by God and your birth was timed on the earth for right now to say things and rule against things going on in this world because God is setting things up for the manifest ascends and daughters to rule and reign against the evil in this earth, in the spirit realm where your authority is. So yes, you absolutely have power and authority over all the darkness trying to ruin your life, ruin your family, say something against it and use the word of God if you want to, repeat what Christ has said if you want to, it doesn't change the fact that he said, you will rule in this life with him, he's talking about now and in the time is to come. So yes, people are going to know in this world who knows God, who believes in God and who's operating and walking in the spirit and not the flesh, they're going to know who you are by what's going on in your own life for God is about to do in your life that he's going to demonstrate to this world that you belong to him and you believe him. You know, Kat, it's not lost in me that you declare and decree all the time for your own state, the state of Florida, one of the states that's doing the best in the nation. I mean, that's not lost in me, you know, and you have Ivana Tia lives there, Donna lives there. I was born in Oregon and I'm in Oregon now, but I met Doreen in California, two of our kids, we were married in California, two of our kids were born in California and I love that state and it's so hard to see it going. And I'm thinking to myself, surely there's enough saints in California that are decreeing and yet it seems to be going backwards. Has God shown you anything about California? Well, Steve, you're only going to hear what's happening in the fake news. I mean, all you're going to hear is what the, you're going to only hear what the left is saying people. All right, that's true. He knows another whole side to this world that is not being heard, but they're there. And I promise you, they are taking authority. They are demonstrating, they are demanding things to be changed. They are speaking against the darkness and the evil thereof. They're taking authority over it. Why do you think everything they've tried has failed? Because we are light in this world and they can't take the light out of us. They can't stop God from talking to us. They can't stop it. And I think that's why they are very concerned. And it's all going to be showing up really soon that you do have authority and you do, you can do something about it. You can stop anything going on this wicked. I've not stopped talking against human trafficking, okay? That is horrible. It is a crime against humanity. It's even a crime against God himself because he didn't send people. He didn't send anyone to have that happen to them. There's a real devil in this world. But if you advertise more for him and talk about him more than God, are you going to do anything great for God? Stop advertising and participating with the wrong one and start declaring and declaring what God has said. And tell God, you believe him, you know he knows what's going on. You're on his side. You want to speak his words against the darkness. And let me tell you what, things are going to start changing so quickly. But what's happening right now and what is about to happen is the body of Christ is about to get major accelerated in authority, in dominion, and people are going to know they have it. So good, good, good news. And we can declare over other states, right? You declare over DC. We don't have to just declare our own state. I send a host all over this world. Good, that's good. I know you do. I send way more than- I send them for 24 hours a day for two weeks. That's really good. And they'll shred platforms of evil beings. They'll pull down strongholds. They will literally expose the flesh. Those in the flesh who are evil and wicked are getting exposed every day, but it's going to start majorly happening. That this stuff is going to be shown, that you can't get away with this. This is not God's plan. The earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof. You know the Bible says that. You know you're part of that fullness. You have a light in you that he put in you. You have authority in you. You have the anointing that Christ operated in. First John 2, 27, when you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior, you receive a deposit of the anointing and lives in you. What is the anointing? It destroys the yoke of darkness forever, you send it. That's good news to hear. Have an ice cream after you do it, people. And some chocolate cake. Deborah is asking, are there any distinctions between Jews and Gentiles in heaven? That's an interesting question. I think of course people know your ethnicity. You don't really lose your ethnicity. I mean, if you were born Scottish or Scottish there, you still look Scottish. You know, if you were born Nigerian, you still look Nigerian. You belong to God. If you receive Christ, you're going to go to heaven. So people do know that. They know that about you. They know what you did on the earth for God. That's shown many places all over heaven. So you don't stop being you. You're just a greater you. Do the accents still exist? Like Australians still sound like Australians. Jamaicans sound like Jamaicans and so forth. Yes. And yeah, all the Irish and Scottish accents, they all are still there for eternity. They're all there. The accents are there. There's different languages, but you understand every language spoken in heaven, except one in language. The one language of angels that is their own. They do speak other ones, but there is one that's just their language. And I don't think that we speak that one, but any other ethnicity that's been on the earth, was on the earth. You understand when they speak to you in Scottish or they speak to you in Nigerian, they speak to you in Spanish and you're not Spanish. You know every word they're saying in heaven. Yeah, it wouldn't be hard to hear. So, okay, in this one, Olivia and John just died. This says, please ask Kat, if she knows, if Olivia and John made it to heaven. I haven't been shown that yet, but that doesn't mean she didn't, people. I can tell, if it's okay with you, I'll just tell you that one of our writers, I can't think of her name right now, she's written for Breaking Christian News for years. She's the niece to Olivia and John. Olivia and John was saved. So, my personal testimony, we know Olivia and John is having, even though you haven't seen her, so I'm able to say that. All right, let's see, I haven't pre-read this, so here we go. Don asked, I recently had to put down my 17-year-old dog in the morning of his departure. I was praying for God to give me strength and peace. Trying to get through this stuff today. As I was praying, I saw a group of our pets that had already gone to heaven sitting and waiting and they all had little party hats on. Has Kat ever seen a pets coming home party? Yes, I have. I saw my own pets. I had a Yorkie named Molly and I got to see, she was hanging on with one breath practically, and I think that's when I was on the Western tour, I was going like a six-weeks tour and she was not doing well. She was like 16, 17 years old and I kept thanking God for letting her last until I could come home and say goodbye to her. And he did, he was very faithful, he did keep her and she was not doing really well and I actually dressed her in a little gown, people. It's okay, I loved her. I dressed her in a little hung-going gown and I gave her this beautiful thing when she passed that I would put her in and I had it all prepared and I got to hold her, I got to bathe her and she was on her, she was breathing, but she recognized me, her eyes, she could smell, she could smell, but she knew it was me and she loved me very much and I loved her very much. And finally, I just said to the father, okay, I've said goodbye, please take her so she can go home and it was like she was gone. Like her breath left her, she left her body and I actually have seen her several times in the sky since then, usually when we're sending another pet home, she will actually come for some reason and be here when that pet passes and she goes, they go up to heaven with her. It's amazing the relationship that even pets can create between each other and I did see them preparing for her hung-going party when she got there and her favorite thing to do was chase the mailman to try to get the letters away from him and so at her thing, I know, I know what was happening. I saw her running down the streets to go chasing an angel. I know people think God would not do that. Well, you don't know what you get there, okay? And there was an angel dressed like a postman with his big old wings running and he had this mail. It looked like mail and he was sewn out of his backpack and watching to see if the dog would chase him and boy, she was running down the streets to go after him like, oh, she could get. And she was having the best time and I thought, what better thing to give her? She actually got outside one time, she was an inside dog. She'd bark at the mail slot every day and pull the mail out of the mailman's hand and he would tease her with the mail but she got up one time when we weren't there. I don't know how that happened but she was chasing him all over our yard when we got home and he was throwing her the, you know, the mail, like all the ads and stuff. He was throwing it at her trying to stop her from chasing him. It was funny but to see that the father loved even her enough to plan something special for her. Totally. I've also seen when we all had a dox and it was my daughter's doxen and I did see him being also welcome home into heaven and the dogs and other pets we had where they were waiting for him. So yes, that does happen. And so if you had a pet past recently, number one, they never went by their self. Normally your own personal guardian angel will take your pet's spiritual body to heaven. And they've seen that angel a lot because dogs can see in the spirit. They saw that angel with you. So it wasn't somebody strange. They just gather up your spirit and take them up to heaven. But Molly seems from our side, Molly seems to be the greeter who gets to go with them also. So yes, the pets can do things together in heaven. It's beautiful. And is it your testimony for lack of a better word that dogs and cats can or might see your angels or they simply do? What do they do? They do. And that's why dogs are a part of the things you can't see. It makes sense. I think cats see them too, but dogs respond differently than cats do. Yeah, they do. I think they're really busy with cats since they got nine lives to try to save and not just one maybe. But I do know that pets can definitely acknowledge when angels come in and out of here, when we had our dogs that were here, they would always follow them when they walked. I could see them following them in babies. All babies can see the angels, not just the angels. You're not saying some, you're saying all babies. All babies fresh from heaven can see in the spirit. They can see, and even when my own daughters would have a baby and my daughter would be holding them and the baby would be like looking at me, like this is me here and the baby's looking at me. That baby would go like this. That's hilarious. Every single time they will look at my angels. So I know they're seeing the angels. So yes, your baby can see angels. Now you're describing some hilarious things in heaven. Talk about for a minute, because this is a, in the natural, if someone only listens to the news, this is a painful crisis, horribly yucky time on this face of the earth, and someone would say, well, God would never be up in heaven performing all these hilarious things because there's more important things on the earth that demand his attention. How would you respond to that? I would say God is already responding to the stuff on the earth people. He is setting up and recording every single evil act indeed that's being done, because the gavel's already fallen for justice to come to this nation and this world, but the evil trying to take over. No one's going to escape seeing this. So God is doing stuff on this earth right now. Important things right now for what is coming, which is the days of glory and fire are coming on earth. Those are powerful, amazing things. The manifest of sons and daughters, she's done preparation for hundreds of years already on the earth for this to happen. He knew what was gonna happen. He knew people would be coming home to heaven. He doesn't create evil, but there is right now an evil devil who hates everybody. He even hates his own demons. He hates anybody involved with him, even doing things for him. He loves nobody, but God loves us for the love that you hardly can't understand that he sent his son to make a way back to him. He's not ignoring us on the earth right now, but he's also not going to ignore what's going on in heaven. He's not gonna make somebody have to experience suffering or agony or things that are on the earth right now. This is his ballpark. This is his, he's dealing with this. We're praying who are alive here. We're taking authority right here. That's what our thing is to do right now is to take authority. For those who run their race and run it well are not going home to heaven. He is not going to ignore the fact that he wants to welcome them. He wants them to feel special. He wants them to know how much he loves them. He does both at the same time, deal with it on the earth and loves people in heaven. I was gonna ask you about that because we teach, we've always taught as believers that God is omnipresent, which means he's everywhere at once. So when he says weep with those who weep, rejoice with those who rejoice laugh, he literally does all of those things simultaneously, right? All at the same time. Yes, he does. Someone lost a baby today. He's weeping with them right now. Someone, little kid did something funny in heaven. He's laughing with that. All at the same time. He definitely can be everywhere all at the same time. And by the way, the devil can't. The devil does not have the power. He's not omnipresent. He's not omnipresent. He's not. He is a created being who became very evil and wicked, who wants to use and take away destiny, steal things, kill, steal and destroy is the MO of Satan. The mode of operation for Satan is kill, steal and destroy. God is to bring life and bring it more abundantly. So there's definitely a difference between light and darkness and good and evil. And let me tell you more than ever before, you're seeing that a lot of people have never even witnessed this before in their life, but they're seeing a lot of it right now. And you're definitely me. You will understand what God is doing because it's going to start showing up unexpectedly and suddenly. When God does this suddenly, almost no one's prepared for it, not those believing and hoping for it and not the ones trying to stop it from happening. He is fully aware of everything and knows where everybody is. It's hiding, who's cheating, who's stealing, who's lying, he knows every bit of that. He also knows who is ready to be blessed. Those who are about to reap a harvest for their giving and they're helping and they're praying. Both sides are going to have what they've been. It's seed time and harvest right now, people. The harvest is coming is not the great end time harvest. The harvest is about to come is seed time and harvest, which you've been seeding over these last five, six years on either side, good or evil. You're about to get a harvest of either recompense and justice or blessings and suddenly an empowerment. And both are going to be judged. Both are going to receive the harvest that they've been planting all these years. So the wicked cannot stop or stop from happening what God is going to judge and give justice for. But you also can't stop the blessings and the acceleration in the power of God. That's being given to those who stood firm, who helped, who prayed, who did what was right. Both sides are going to be dealt with, blessed or dealt with with justice. It is going to happen. Oh, good, such good news. You know, we have to stop shorter today just because those little grandsons are going to bust through the door at any moment now. Would you pray for the people or whatever God gives you to pray as we close this out? Yeah, Father, I just speak your life into people right now. I impart life, the love of God, the wisdom of God, His acceleration, His expectation, His celebration for all that is about to happen, that is full of light, love, inventions, all kinds of wonderful things that are coming to this earth right now. He timed you to be here for that. And God, I will speak to the wicked. You are going to receive justice. And you may not like what is about to happen to you, so you better change your mind and get on the right side. If you don't want to experience the judgment, probably imprisonment, maybe even the firing squad, I'm just going to tell you right now, and this is everywhere, anywhere right now. God is getting ready to fulfill both of those things in the earth simultaneously. And He is going to take this earth and turn it into a place He needs it to be. The greater glory of God can be seen and known in the earth. It says, the knowledge, knowing, understanding of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea. Did you know that this earth is covered with two-thirds sea? That means two-thirds of the entire earth is going to experience the glory of God, the fire of God, baptism and fire coming. There's no one out there, no human, no demon that can stop that from falling on this earth. Let me tell you what it is to do. It burns all fear out of you. It burns all anything that you've been substituting something for God for. It's going to burn fear out. It's going to burn confusion out. It's going to burn hate out, anger out. It's going to burn out of you when it touches you. So no one can stop these. These are the things and days of God. It's the day of His power. It is not the day of His wrath. But some people are about the experience wrath because of sea, time and harvest. And there's no one on this earth that can stop that from happening. These are the days that God has decided on. These are His times on the earth. And no one can stop Him from doing so. Father, I thank you for helping those. God, to know how to take authority, to do that, to stand up for what is right, to declare and decree the goodness that's coming of God, His plans, His will, His way, in Jesus' name, and stop advertising the enemy who is a loser, loser, loser. I thank you. I'm on the winning side. God, help them to be on the winning side. Send your presence to flood their lives right now. The presence of God to flood you right now in Jesus' name. And power you, inspire you, encourage you. That, Father, is what they need right now. I thank you for giving it to them in Jesus' name. And we all said amen. Amen. Cat, tell people real quick. You've got two websites, RevealingHeaven.com. What can they get there? And then you've got catcur.com. Talk about those real quick. The comments where our store is. The Father gave me a corporation for one reason, to reveal and create heaven on earth. We reveal it through words, through meanings. We also reveal it through products. Like, I love this cup. The Holy Spirit showed me how to create this cup. And it says, I don't do demons. See that? That little lightning bolt right there is what Satan was cast out of heaven on. And the Holy Spirit said, please, add it to your cup so people can enjoy it. Every time they know, he was put down. He lost his position, his authority, and his power. And I can tell you, a lot of that's going to start happening again. So you can go there for RevealingHeaven.com. Our events are on that page also. Catcur.com is a place I call the spiritual platform for God, the Father, Holy Spirit, and Jesus to say whatever they want to say on that place. And I'm just going to remind everybody, I will never, ever message you, number one. I don't know how to message people on Facebook or any other form of media. I don't do that. I'm not going to message you and say, please give money to this missionary. Please give to this cause. That is someone trying to steal your money. You will never, ever get a message from me saying that, an email saying that, a text saying that. I'm not going to do it. So you know if that comes. That's a fraud and that's a fake trying to take your money. Don't send it. Don't give them any answer to what they're sending. Don't answer their email or their messaging. That is not true. And also, oh, she said she gave me something. What is your public Facebook page called? My public Facebook page is called the Catcur. The reason for that was when I went to make my public Facebook page. Catcur was taken. And the Holy Spirit said, just put the Catcur. And then they'll know what you. Well, guess what? It was available. The Catcur is my public Facebook page. It's also what my YouTube channel is called. And that will keep you clear. If anybody else texts you or uses my picture and says they're a different Facebook, tell them they're lying. And that is not me and pray for those people to delete them. All right, Cat, good. A quick message that tomorrow, well, Thursday. This is Tuesday, we're recording Thursday. Tomorrow for those watching, Hank Kuhneman will be our guest. So we haven't had him on for a long time. So we're really, really looking forward to having Hank on. We miss him a lot. So thank you, Cat. God bless you and your team. It was so nice to see your mom. We're going to have your mom on soon with you. And have her give us some pearls of wisdom. I miss you a lot. So listen, we enjoyed it today. It was very great. And I am really close to the spirit today. I'll tell you what, even reading about pets, I'm ready to weep. So anyway, thanks again for the day. We bless you and have a great day. And we will see you all tomorrow. God bless you. Bye. You

music You Well, happy Wednesday September 14 2022 welcome to Elijah's dreams. I'm Steve Schultz host along with my wife We founded together both the Elijah list right there like this calm and Elijah streams Beginning 25 years ago. We are in the beginning of year 26 I think if I'm saying that right bringing you the voice of the prophets and never has it been more important than in this specific time Frame when so much is going on many of you have heard I'm gonna say repeat it for a couple of days in a row We are off of YouTube until December First it's pretty much fine with me Because they're as soon as we get back on they're gonna be gunning force again They are trying to remove Christians that are conservative that are speaking anything on behalf of Trump And I will not relent because YouTube wants me to I'll get all the more stubborn and you know So we're trying to be wise so that we're not Abandoning the channel outright. We're gonna they're gonna have to force us off And but neither am I gonna overly try not to offend them because they're trying to be offended They don't want to not be offended They're trying to be offended so that they have a legitimate excuse We wait till December 31 all of our strikes disappear But that doesn't keep them from the next day giving us more strikes so they can take us off So just so you all know we will be off through and including the elections there But we we're gonna be on rumble The whole time rumble is getting just as large of views or almost as large of views as our best days on YouTube Maybe we're not quite there, but almost as large and we're usually on Facebook as well So be sure and tell your friends and family anyone that wants to know when we're gonna be on where Rubble and Facebook now and we will be back on YouTube December One I think is the date or whichever the Monday is close to that probably or whatever date is close to December 1 Okay, so now cat will be on here in just a few minutes But you all have heard me talk about Mike and Laurie Sally Who have are helping us in two areas the wells being dug in Uganda and then the water projects We're working on right now. So without further delay, let's bring in Mike and Laurie Sally to kind of give us a report. Hey guys Hey, how you doing? Good. How's Mississippi this time of year? It's actually beautiful today. It's really starting to be fall weather So we're excited about that. Awesome. Now. Do you get snow? Probably not in the south. Do you do occasionally? Yeah, do you a couple years or so? Yeah, I lived in Dallas for a while And then I lived in Florida on the other side for a while. So we didn't see a lot of snow But yeah, we could get the you get the big thunderstorms and all that out there always that's our big thing. Yeah Well, listen, I know you guys have got a different things to share with us. I'm trying to decide Laurie should we start with how the Mississippi Water project came into being by meeting the mayor or where would you like to start? Sure, we can talk about that I don't know if everybody watching knows the devastation that's happening in Jackson, Mississippi, which is the capital of our state The water has the people have been on a boiled notice, which I don't know if that's common everywhere I didn't really I've never heard of it. Yeah, it's common here in Mississippi And I didn't really realize that till we moved back to the south in Mississippi several years ago It happens all the time in different areas. The water gets contaminated and so this has been something going on in Jackson for a really long time and So since you brought us on the team Steve to help begin investigating water issues here in the states Mike and I never realized right in our own backyard. Jack's struggling So we've been looking, you know knocking on doors and meeting different people about the water crisis is going on in the United States Which I didn't even realize it was so challenging here, but we were flying back from Vacation, I think it was in early June and I had actually been kind of sick the night before and had an upset stomach. So I didn't really sleep good So I didn't really look I don't know like travel worthy I actually felt like I was traveling back from Uganda like I've been on a long missions trip or something But I'm even that long so we are in the Atlanta airport and Mike looks across the way and he's he says I think that's the mayor of Jackson We've only seen him on TV and so I looked and I was like, yeah That that kind of looks like him and everybody was you know around him talking to him and stuff And I don't know why I did this but just in my mind just in my heart I said to the Lord Lord if you want to give him an encouraging word I I'd be willing to do it You're just gonna have to sit me next to him and that's just random I do that sometimes just to challenge myself because you know when you're talking about We're always talking about the prophetic and wanting to use it But if you don't put yourself out there, I don't know if you're not aware then then God really you know We didn't have an opportunity so I'm always you know since I've been walking in the prophetic I've been challenging myself in that so I think I said it so we get on we go to get on the plane you know you scan your boarding pass and Mike has all of the miles and he always gets upgraded any time we fly together man first-class Mike sally Back in the back, you know, and and he's a gentleman and always offers to give it to me But he has long legs so I let him sit in the front So I scan my boarding pass before Mike and it spits out a different seat number And I'm thinking oh well surely you know Mike's gonna get the same thing and he scans his and nothing happens And I'm like that's crazy. Well, I was gonna be sitting in a middle seat next to Mike And I actually love the window so this seat was the window so I said it was our last leg I said let me just take this seat. I'm tired. I'll sit there So I go and sit in on an 11 a and Mike's back in 29 So I'm sitting down and you know just sitting there waiting the next thing I know the mayor comes walking down and he stops and he sits in the seat right next to wow And I start speeding like oh gosh did I really just say that to the Lord like I'll give him a word of encouragement So I just start thinking like what do you want to say God? What do you want to say? So we're sitting there and you know everybody's passing by and they're all talking to him then I just I don't know what to say I don't have any profound words. So I just turned to him and I just tell him exactly what just what I just told you Again, okay, I think I'm a crazy Christian. I don't know and he says to me He says, you know, there's no coincidences in the Bible That does not happen in the Bible and really he started to give me words of encouragement and I tell me You know, I want to pray for you how can we pray for you and he starts just kind of sharing his journey and how he got into being the mayor and He he just starts pulling out scriptures and he tells me what the meaning of Jackson means It means God is gracious and he just starts kind of prophesying the destiny over his city And I'm just blown away and I said well, I think maybe I sat next to you for me Not the other way Okay, you know, well, I just know there's more and I'll just keep praying So he put you know, they they take off and he puts on his mask and puts on his earplugs and he goes to sleep He's been on a business trip. I'm sure he's tired the whole time sitting there like Lord. What is it? Why do you have me sitting next to him? Then I remember there's a water issue in Jackson, Mississippi and their husband and I thought is that why? So as we're getting ready to land I take the last minute I have before he gets off the plane and I just mentioned to him Hey, we're working with an amazing group of people that really have a passion to bring clean water And I don't know if maybe that's why God put us together Do you think when we get off the plane, you know You can exchange numbers with my husband and we can maybe see see what God has and he says sure get off the plane Mike exchange numbers and he actually texted us later and set up a meeting Go to Jackson to his office meet with his cabinet and just share what Elijah streams is doing well He set up a meeting with his cabinet. Yes. Yes. It really shocked us. It was actually kind of a little overwhelming like to walk in there with all these and he's introducing us into the CFO and this person and this person and And we just start talking about the crisis and the issue and the challenges that they're having and and it really was an amazing Time and got to give it. We gave him some words of encouragement and in from that point on You know, we were gonna do some more meetings and figure out how we can help bring water clean water Kind of a staff stopgap measure because honestly the water system in Jackson is going to take millions of dollars to repair and so our our heart was like, okay, what can we do in the meantime to help people just like we're doing in Uganda and We shared with him about the water box Yeah, and so right after that this water crisis hit and it wasn't just a matter of we had some flooding issues But it wasn't just a matter of being on a boiled water alert It was a matter of no pressure in the lines And really many people that had no water not just dirty water, but no water to flush their toilets no water today And this is Yeah And it's this is a major city and you start thinking like wow This is actually happening here in the United States and so, you know, we were actually because of the live streams We were able to be in position here We were able to jump in and begin to help some other organizations that are that are situated in downtown Jackson and there's there's there's a couple of organizations that we worked with That were out delivering water because a lot of people couldn't even get out There was some elderly and some people that were just homebound for different reasons They couldn't even get out and get the water that was being given away. And so we got these jugs I think we have a video we can show you in a second here about that But one of the pastors that we worked with went out delivered these jugs of water to people all over the city that he knew We're lock-ins and so it was really ministered to him that a lot of streams came in and was being was willing to help Financially and also providing these water jugs. And so you want to show that video? Let's go ahead and play that video Emily go for it. Hey guys, my name is brother JJ Thompson I am the pastor here at Alternative Ministry and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to Let you know how much I appreciate the work and the things that you guys may do for us I want to think Elijah's stream you're donating these gallons of water cause we in Jackson, Mississippi You know, we have a water crisis But what we're doing we are being the middleman to help those that can't get out But I've been pastoring for 10 years been in minister 20 But God is way too. I've got 60 years old to get me to do what I'm doing and I'm gonna say this I'm gonna be finished. I love what Paul said about pure religion It is happening to follow through this And I thank God for the passion. So again, thank you from Jackson, Mississippi. I'm brother JJ So that was so good, you know, he mentioned that that scripture I don't have it fully memorized, but it says pure religion undefiled as visiting the orphans and taking care of it I don't know if you guys have any more memories than I did, but that's what he was referring to He said, I don't know if y'all know what God said about here pure religion It's really in their distress You know, so think about they're in distress right now and we were able to go out and help people Deliver clean water to the elderly to the widows that were in distress because they couldn't even flush their toilets great now Talk about the water stations. Where are we on that? Yeah, so that's we're really excited about that We just got break through on that a couple of days ago and I actually have a meeting with them today after we get finished with this show There's these water boxes or filtration systems and we're actually partnering We're gonna provide three of them at this time possibly more in the future in Mississippi two of them will be with the Jackson Fire Department So we actually have partnered with the Jackson Fire Department. They just had the They're meeting with the city council that approved getting these boxes put into the fire department because that's one of the stations where people can come And get clean water and they've given out, you know, probably there's been six million Bottles of water or more given out in the past probably more than that actually by now And you think about these plastic bottles too, where are they going? They're going to the landfills and what how do we don't have a good recycling system in Mississippi? So this system allows people to have containers and there's a picture of Lee that we sent you guys of it But they can come and actually yeah, there it is right there come and fill up their containers and Get filtered water and then bring them back to their house and just keep coming back So they'll be regularly scheduled hours that they can go to the Jackson Fire Department And there's also a small town called Mount Bayou, Mississippi. That's a very poor area in Mississippi That we're gonna be providing a water box that had to have a lot of problems with their work These are kind of expensive. We don't normally do too much. We're telling people but I don't we isn't a cut aren't we investing a hundred thousand Dollars in three boxes. Okay. Okay, so that's huge investment and That includes now not only does that include the water box But the place that's hosting it like the the city or the fire department The water bills are covered any increase in their water bills are going to be covered for an entire year All the containers are covered all the training all the filtration systems. Everything is water testing the water testing regularly testing So it's something that we could do as a stopgap measure until they do, you know, it's Lori Dollars that I've actually heard a billion dollars to fix the water system here Really? Yeah a billion with a B. And so it's it's a big deal But you know, I was I was shocked you know, by the way, Elijah streams has done fifty three Wells in Uganda. So wow Over a thousand salvation. Yeah over a thousand now That is church is being planned and lands being given to to churches to plan because of this water It's it's absolutely unbelievable. I didn't realize, you know, I knew there was a problem in Uganda I didn't realize there was a problem here. No, I mean, yeah, we don't think of that. Well when we've been Examining you and us you guys and us guys We've been you know by trying to get some because the Lord spoke to us about Native Americans and and their needs are huge But they tend to be spread out So it's hard to put a central well in one spot because they're mild the summer will live miles away in a massive reservation Plus they you if you don't drill really deep which is really expensive You're gonna get what arsenic and things like that in the water, right? Yeah, there's some of the wells there that we've gotten quotes for over a million dollars for one water well And then you're not even completely sure it's gonna be clean water So it's a there's a lot more to that than just going into a reservation drilling It also takes about five years from what I understand for the entire permit process to get approved So it's very challenging. We are working on a few projects. We could talk about later But we do have a few projects with Native Americans that we're working on Um, that we believe we'll be able to to be doing pretty soon And on the uh, there's words. I'm looking at the note. We're waiting for cat to arrive So we've got a couple of minutes. They'll tell me when she arrives But uh on those water boxes. Did you say how many those will serve or to do or tend to serve? Well, we don't know for sure about a lot of people. I mean, there's still lines of cars everywhere that there's water distribution centers Even still today, there's lines of people waiting and that's just with the government's the government assigned spots There's also many churches and nonprofits that are also doing and so even the other day We were driving to town and we looked over and there was a church or some organization that was providing clean water And it was lines of cars Waiting waiting two and three hours in line to get to water. Well, and that's scripture that I quoted a lot I don't can't remember the exact quote. I've got it on a piece of paper, but I can't reach it But this is where Jesus says Jesus said if you even give so much as a cup of cold water one cup to one of these you'll not Um Lose your reward. Does that apply to the water boxes and the water bottles? Absolutely. Why I mean you're providing clean water, you know And so it's definitely there's a lot of rewards that will not be lost And there's a lot of people that you'll meet in heaven one day that'll be like, thank you for contributing to my clean water And you may be like, what did I do? Well, you sewed into Elijah's streams ministries and they provided a water box in Jackson, Mississippi And I was able to provide clean water for my kids and for my family and I was able to flush my toilets and Just the basic stuff and so yeah, it's it's definitely making a huge impact on people and just the heart behind it That's the other thing. It's like there's the practical aspect of the water but People are constantly asking me why would an organization all the way to organ care about us Right, and that's even more powerful sometimes and I think the physical water just to know that there's people out there that cares, you know And so it was great that we were positioned here in this in this state to be able to help quickly Yeah, and one of the things we've all learned is that you know When we when you agreed to come because you're you're still doing the you've gone to project That's your project with show mercy, but then you're working with us full time as well as As those how those work out you can work at two places full time believe it or not, but We didn't I think my simplistic thinking was we'll come here We'll start identifying the projects and we'll start drilling wells immediately and that was a that was uh an amazing um Learning process for me because I thought well as long as we're willing to pay the project will present themselves And we won't have to work for it, but that wasn't true. So Um, by the way, they're telling me that cat is here now So we're going to go in a second, but I want to thank you guys and honor you guys if we you know We go way back our our daughter used to babysit your daughters and now one's married and one's about to be married. So That's amazing. We you guys we've been at this for what? I said 20 years. We've known you or About 20 years. Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing. But you know, I'm gonna speak on behalf of you guys I I know your lives. I know your commitment. I know your walk with the lord and and I'm just very proud of you and lory. What a great story with the mayor Are you kidding? I mean you said I gotta end with this But you said lord if you want me to give him word, you're gonna have to Sit me down with him. You put your ticket in and it gives you it suddenly changes your seat to the one next to the mayor That's the other thing. I didn't say his seat got changed too. Yeah, really After I told him he said, okay, I have to be honest with you when he pulled out He said my seat got changed as well. Oh, man He knew that he knew and I told him and so it's so fun how god I mean the the the devastation and the hardship that's going right now is terrible But it's so crazy. God is so good to just little bitty things set you up at the right place at the right time I so love that. I so love that. You know, we're told to go out in the highways and byways to compel them to come in And that's where you know, that's literally the highways and byways and another Another part of that says and along the hedges. Well, what is the hedges? Those are where your neighbors next door are looking over the hedges going. What's with these people Go along the hedges and compel them to come in. So I I wrote an article about that one day I said, have you gone compelling lately?

Oh, yeah, it was really awesome and and then of course the meetings We had people come from around the world to the one um that was at their church on mount zine. It was amazing So so good Well cat, let's see. Let me jump into you throw it to you and anything that's on your heart to share right now before We get into questions about heaven and when people ask other questions They're sometimes they're not about heaven, but they're almost all very very very interesting. So So what anything on your heart to share this morning before we get into that? I can just say that that um Sunday morning this last Sunday morning. I did spirit force in a way never done before Really it's so Um, so complete powerful that you leave that you left that meaning knowing exactly who you were in christ Wow, what's your whole salvation experience look like in the spirit realm? What are our weapons that we get is the army of god that the bible clearly says we are in the army of god And it was just really empowering and very very I had said kind of intense, but it was amazing. And so I will thoroughly enjoy doing all my spirit force meetings We'll be doing some more online, but I believe they this I believe if you go back you may be able to watch this one Yeah, that was this last sunday and um Is it go g o m z? I think is g o m z is their website dot or Yeah, g o m z dot organ dot organ or or you can go on gateway on mount zine Facebook or gateway on mount zion's facebook page and uh emily uh or michael one of you could you put that under the Rumble or in the comments. However, you do it Is I knew more of the youtube system than this one But I put it under facebook so people can see that that'd be awesome if we give them that link so Now can I got to ask you a question? Well anything else because I have a question to launch our other questions, but um And it's kind of a blended question. So let me ask it to you this way Um, we get from time to time people say well cat must have lots of new and exciting Experiences, I think you probably when you go there must you must be a little bit surprised each time with something He shows you that you hadn't seen before And has there been anything recently you think boy, I'd like to tell people about that when I was caught up There are things but first of all, I'd like of course to mention queen Elizabeth Okay, and because there's a lot of of course buzz going on about that, you know And I think it probably bothers me personally a little bit that everybody automatically thinks people went to hell I don't know why um, you know, christ is for us. He's not against this and she clearly and I just have to say queen Elizabeth Is in heaven people if she is there and god is giving her rewards because She's had one of the longest running um I can't remember what you think That allowed God in that country Okay, and and talked all the time about jesus christ on every special uh holiday they had she always mentioned to him every single time She had uh like a message to give to her kingdom and the people of uh, england and and the surrounding countries there It was always positive and she didn't just be positive herself She always talked about god. She talked about jesus christ He totally was allowed and because when when you are the head of something and you allow jesus christ As a monarch to come into that country there is no way she's not going to escape being greatly rewarded For for the longevity of her of her monarchy and how much she loved jesus christ So people queen elizabeth is in heaven there. That's the most important thing. I could say today Okay, the controversy was going on. You know, there's always so many things made up about stuff And she didn't have enemies against her because they didn't like it that she Didn't want evil and she didn't want to let certain things to happen in that country So there you are straight from the throne room people queen elizabeth made it to heaven really good Can you can you elaborate on what you said a minute ago? You said I don't I don't know why people always think people are going to help Now you you are one that also believes some people go to hell. I know that So can you elaborate on that? So is it that? Uh, you absolutely know many go to hell But is it that more people go to heaven than most of us think or what? Probably more people go to heaven now than ever before. Okay. It is because of the availability of the word Uh, you know of the message about the the kingdom christ in the kingdom that you talked about that we rule in with them There's so much revelation out there right now There's almost kind of no excuse if you have a computer have any access to a computer People by the millions are looking at people's sites that talk about jesus a lot Even if they don't talk about heaven they want to know about him That's good So I think now more because back way back in those days like in the day of jesus they of course didn't have the internet They didn't have television. They didn't even have radio. That's why he walked over He traveled so much himself to share the kingdom But the news about him still to this day is going around the world And those there are many many many more Millions of believers now than ever before in the world And ministries and places for help that there certainly would be more Um more people going to heaven now than ever before and yes, people do go to hell. They're wicked. They're evil. They hate everything Uh, their soul is so corrupted and they don't want to repent for things. You know, that's their choice Yeah, as the father has shared with me before He doesn't keep people out of heaven and he doesn't send them to hell Because people are always saying, you know, uh, a loving father wouldn't send people to hell He doesn't he gave everything he had to make a way for you to come to heaven. So that's where his love is He loves us so much. He loves the people in the world He even desires that the vial center be free free from what sin Yeah, sin and have his son so they could come to heaven He's just not going to allow heaven to be like the earth. He's just not going to do it He's not willing to pollute heaven to file heaven by people who bring that with them because they carry it and that's how they live So the father actually said tell them it's just just the opposite A loving father would make a way for them to come to heaven and he clearly And so all right by that you mean he didn't send people to hell by that. Do you mean they choose hell themselves? That's what he said. They choose to go there. They make up their own choice in their own will There's a scripture in the bible that says I make myself known to everyone. Yeah, so in their soul in some way He says he makes himself known that means you'll have an opportunity a choice sometime in your life Or he will impress upon you to know him and the scripture is never wrong And I've had a lot of people say I wasn't even thinking about something and sitting where just contemplating all of a sudden The thoughts started pouring into me that I needed to know Jesus Christ And then the love of God would sweep over these people and they would just be convicted And then they would want to know him then they would receive him. So that's how far he goes Yeah, make sure that they know there is a loving God And this whole thing that we're living in and around this world It didn't happen in a big bang people and there's many scientists that know that there was creation Creation did happen and it's even the evidence of even over the ages is very clear even in the foundation of our earth And the way it was made So I know you evolutionists you you would like to think yourself You get to choose everything including where you're going to end up in some wonderful place. There's only two choices There's either Jesus Christ in heaven Or you choose satan who is the lord of the flies and you will be in hell not just hell forever You'll be in the lake of fire forever. So I want to encourage people seeking your own soul What would keep you from wanting to know him? What would keep you from wanting to receive all that that God has for you in heaven and that christ died for you Do you have there's that scripture and I'm sorry part. Sorry that I don't have that reference to it, but it says Uh, it's it's a new covenant scripture. It says this the covenant I'll make with them after that time And It goes on Sorry that I don't have it in front of me, but it says no more will a man say to his neighbor Know the lord for the or his brother know the lord for they'll all know me from the least of the greatest What is that scripture referring to if you know? I'm pretty sure that it's referring to the times because he's talking about a time. There'll be a time that's happened Right, we're entering into that time right now because what he is about to do And there's a lot of people who don't like me talking about they don't like hank robin Johnny they don't like there's people who don't like they think we're rocking the boat No, we're trying to get you in the boat people. Yeah, so that you don't die a horrible a horrible death and end up Throughout eternity. No, we're gonna say the truth prophets a true prophet god will always always speak the words Of revelation from the father from Jesus from holy spirit and the truth is what makes you free Not all these other things that are lies that are deceptions. They don't make you free They control you they keep you trapped and so you need to know the truth so that you will be free And there is a way to be free from evil from from wickedness from hell from Satan ruling over your life Getting caught up in witchcraft or other things And you don't want to live your life like that because this is a very short life But the way you live this life will determine where you end up and there's two places a bend to boat Yeah, you do not want to go to hell When I started getting to know you cat and I've said this on the air once or twice before with you I don't know if you'll remember this may have spent probably a year But I was raised with the fear that my least little stumble. I would not go to heaven now My tradition taught that you don't there's not an eternal hell. You just burn up. That's it But I was afraid to just burn up and that's yeah, I wanted to go to heaven But I felt like I was taught that it would be really easy to be deceived And now I'm on the other side of that. It's on the flip side of that where it's almost like This is just my language not biblical language. It's almost like God's looking for loopholes to get you saved That's how it feels like he's going if I don't get him saved this way I'll get him saved that way and you know, there's that scripture. I think it's Romans 10 9 but we can believes in his heart and confesses with his mouth and Jesus the Lord and and believes that God raised him from the dead from the dead will Be saved so there are people in various stages of maturity or immaturity who we might not even say God, you know, if they died they probably would say They they didn't make it but if if a person in the privacy of their bedroom says, you know what? I think I do believe that I think I do And for the first time he says it in his heart and says it with his mouth And then he dies right after that. He's he's going to heaven. Yes, he is he really is he certainly is going to go to heaven And yes, they're always watching from heaven. And let me tell you a holy spirit is so busy on this earth A holy spirit leads people of he impresses people. He's even these people who are not believers He's still going around those seek seeking for those who might know Christ or want to know Christ They they have so many angels and members of the host the army of heaven whose very Assignment is to lead people to the place where they can hear the truth know the truth or even have them meet individuals Who know answers that they need to know so they can get born again and absolutely? Yes, if the father said he desires That's a strong word. He desires the vilest most evil sinner Be safe because his son paid a price for everybody But they do have to choose and it doesn't matter if it's in the last breath If you did it as a child and you receive Christ in syria And and I tell you I remember when I got born again at age four that never left me I knew that I knew that I knew I was going to heaven at age four. I knew Jesus Christ Wow And so even children very young can fully give themselves to christ and they're raising an atmosphere that's so So bad, you know god will watch over them. It's not like it was me That that was me. I mean I was raised and I gave my heart to the lord very early I was baptized in that almost cult setting But I knew I'd I'd received Jesus christ. I knew about his death on the cross except for that even though there's And then I lived a significant portion of my life after that in all kinds of drudgery I don't and you know most stations and all of that. So you were talking about if somebody Look, I don't know how far to push this question But I mean if there's a current person who's a pedophile and that's during this horrible sin Cat and then they died but if you look back on that person's life when they were a child and they said Jesus I want you Does the lord remember that or did they throw that away in the meantime? What I keep saying he throws it away I know that that stuff would not be allowed in heaven at all And even if was like I said before even at near the death of a person Let's say they haven't died, but they're close to that Even if they're unconscious the holy spirit can speak to those people Wow, and that does happen because we've had people not died. It came so close to death That people thought for sure they would never survive and they came out of that coma or whatever that was And said that they were that they saw Jesus christ. I mean there's testimonies everywhere that happened I know like ian, you know, I always go back to ian who's the one I think he was a surfer Yeah, something like that. Ian, I can't remember. Yeah, I'm like jellyfish and I'm telling you what Jesus pursued him But through that whole time until I think he flatlined He was in the morning in the morgue of the hospital. I think And jesus presented himself caught him up presented himself and said your mother has never stopped praying for yourself And jesus moved his hand in this person who had he died and he saw his mother praying and crying out to god Do not let and she didn't know that he had died people She didn't even know that he was in that situation, but this was her nightly thing that she had prayed god Don't let my son go to hell. Please reach out to him I i'm i'm declaring that he will be in heaven eternity with me And he'll have an opportunity to know you and and in here from you And so because of her prayers, she was a very godly woman He wouldn't let those prayers fall to the ground. So when he flatlined And was actually falling into hell. That's a testimony falling into hell You have to remember that christ has the keys To hell death and the grave those are time frames from the time you are dying and to your death And any of those times if there was somebody like in's mother Who is faithful to him who loved him has served christ and would cry out on his behalf every night It says if you believe in your heart and don't let your words drop to ground She will not let them be wasted. He'll answer that and so that this is this was his answer to ian's mother's prayers And here is this this guy who was actually died flatline. He was in the morning had a tag on his toe And she just said because of your mother And her belief in me her trust and promise in me because of her own declarations I have to i have to take her words and give you an opportunity. Do you want me now? And this person caught up in the spirit somewhere not actually in in heaven This was outside of heaven, but it was still up in the spirit realm And he said, um, do you want me now and this guy began to weep and weep and say i'm not worthy of you I don't deserve this, you know, I was wicked and jesus kept saying yes, but your mother I can't let her words fall to the ground my word gives a promise And so he said Well, then he said of course. Yes, I will receive him. He really then he really started crying And i think christ reached out and touched him. He said life like he never felt before Because he remember he said he received christ life slowed into his body and he was so on fire uh for christ and He he was totally changed in that moment And jesus said now Do you want to go with me and he moved and he could see heaven behind christ And his hunger was so great for that. He said do you want to go with me now or you want to go back And ian was really struggling. He says, you know, I want to come so much But if I went now my mother would not know I went to heaven. So please send me back christ sent him back He came back into his body the dead body in the morgue He was looking over him about to do an autopsy And and the guy freaked out the the doctor freaked out and he goes, why are you alive? Sits up totally whole like he never died He goes, I have to find my mother and the guy goes, don't you go anywhere? And so this doctor runs out ian runs down the hall Because he probably had his wrappings on or whatever and he finds an outfit I think it was some Some kind of output, you know, uh like a doctor's assistant or something And he puts it on runs out of the hospital and goes to his mother And she was so undone What christ had done because of her prayers and ian goes all over the world right now And actually gives this personal testimony. These are those are the very words he spoke and because of his uh Because of his mother and what she believed and stood for him And he had been angry also one of the other things about ian is he got really angry about somebody Didn't want to forgive them either. So christ said you have to forgive that person So he did forgive that person and this is when he was in his spirit body So don't ever think that christ can't do something If you're standing for your family's salvation, I know the very first time I was caught up to heaven And christ when he was bringing me back said please tell everybody never stop praying For their loved ones salvation because I will be listening That's so easy. He actually had the keys. He was wearing the keys right then and he showed me these keys He said these keys don't hang on a hook in heaven He said uh, when you die, there's a judgment that comes it says can can you be taken to heaven or not taken to heaven And he has opportunity if there are people standing in in agreement or they're they're Declaring that their family members are those who they call family members people who they love like family. Yeah to Um that they will not miss heaven then christ has the right Because of our declarations Are we're standing what we're believing for? And then he has the right to use those keys and I've I've since I was shown that I've heard so many testimonies Just come in saying You know, I was one of those people I died or right at my death christ appeared to me And ask if I wanted him and so it is true that really does happen Can I ask you a question about the non-loved ones that but they're people who? For instance Ruth Bader Ginsburg died as far as anyone that I know knows she never received the lord It was totally pro-abortion, but a lot of people I'm aware of have prayed had prayed for her for years and years and years What couldn't you say about that? Sort of thing this guy'd say look all these people have been praying for you I have to give you one more chance that kind of thing I haven't seen her in heaven that doesn't mean she's not and I understand what you're talking about There are groups actually that um that christ or holy spirit encourage people to start these groups There is a group of believers very strong Intercessors who really know christ and have prayed in different moves of god and everything They have a list of celebrities in hollywood probably close to 50 years Wow Without fail have prayed for every one of these people and I did see some of those people Because I met someone who was a part of that group and I was I was just overwhelmed at their Their fierceness to have these people have christ have opportunities to receive christ They were they actually stood there's something about standing in the gap Yeah, that's another thing also that allows them to use if there's some standing in the gap Especially if it's a prayer of agreement, especially if it's a group and that's what they do and have focused themselves to do that Then those people will be given an opportunity also. That's so good that you said that because last night, okay cat You didn't know that I had this experience, but last night I'm praying alone Either that or early this morning one of those two Kind of runs together, but I started that scripture came to me where jesus said so I looked for a man To stand in the gap so that I would not have to bring judgment I don't have that one memories either, but I said lord you only needed one man Or one woman to stand a gap and at that point he said so but I found then so I then I swear by myself that But uh, so he there are major issues and people's lives Where all god needs is one person to stand in the gap Yes, that true It is true. It is very true But because there's there's different there's different things that make it possible for him to use those keys Yeah, and even for the the keys and all that other stuff came up even before all that happened And we know in the bible how many were just one that prayed for whole cities to be saved you know and that And uh, I and I do know that that happened also and yeah And god had mercy on people because that one person's staying and stood in the gap and said please don't kill them Please allow them to live for the purpose of having an opportunity He did it back in the old testament and that's before christ came And god god himself had mercy on people So now with christ and his sacrifice is made and I am serving not in any way saying Everyone's going to be in heaven. That is not going to happen. Right. That's right. I don't hear you say because I've clarified that Will be in heaven that would not have been there Except that he had the chance to use these keys and I'm telling you I've saw hell And I don't talk about it a lot because in these days I mean he doesn't want me to talk a lot about that He wants me to encourage people get people empowered to know who they are in christ because some people They don't even have a clue what they carry in their self as a believer and what god has given them as a believer And I think that meaning I did a spirit force this last sunday Absolutely tells you what it means to be a believer. It's very very powerful I wasn't expecting them to say all that that I said I thought we'd have maybe a 30 40 minute meeting and it was far beyond that But people were weeping in the in the con in the conversation. They were they were laughing. They were weeping They were so empowered and found out things they never knew about their self being a believer But if you're going to be operating in spirit force, you have to know what is that? What is that spirit force? What does it mean? What what does it give us to be able to do for christ and with christ? Then you have to know who you are first before you can even start I mean if you're in the military Let's just say the military because we are in god's army. I'm not talking about heaven's army at all the host They were made for that purpose but ourselves as a believer We do have promises That christ gave us about who we are and the authority we had the dominion we have And and that we had power over the enemy so many scriptures and those people got a lot of those scriptures And so but it was very powerful that for the first time they knew who they were in christ And they had no fear about anything. They knew they had a story how to use that a story It was an amazing meeting So it matters that you make a difference in this world By by sharing things with people by loving people caring about people And yet you cannot partake of the darkness if you can speak to people and it's not really a wise Decision to have a very close friend who is wicked and evil you will not win them just because you're their friend And most of the time the opposite thing happens. It really does It just has just the way it is That if you're not a strong believer yourself and you're saying well, I'm going to keep this friend I'll keep talking to them about christ. I'm not saying don't do that But I'm saying as your best friend It is wise to have someone as a believer Or if you could partner with you in prayer maybe go out with you to to witness and stuff like that Well, that's that whole scripture about don't be unequally yoked, right? It can it can apply to marriages It can apply to friendships. It can apply to business Yeah, yeah, really really good cat awesome You know and I the whole thing that got Ian guy that story we've talked about it before several times it never gets old to me because God is by that testimony God himself of course knew this was going to be a worldwide testimony at the moment He was doing it. He knew that because why don't you want that as a testimony because he wanted praying mothers and sons and daughters and sisters and brothers to know you can stand for A person and he will absolutely he had the keys of hell death in the grave You said he had him in his hand Yeah, and and you can say to the lord I mean I with that I might say If I had a loved one that I as far as I knew had never received christ and now he's in a coma and dying I would say Jesus you have the keys to the hell death in the grave. I'm standing for this I'm believing I'm trusting you for this person salvation. They didn't want it with their life, but trust me in my heart I know they want it now. You know, I guess I'd pray along that line right anything else You would be a perfect thing to say to christ He's waits for words like that to be spoken He really waits for people to say things like that And you know, you know, you have friends you have family We jokingly used to call them the black sheep. I don't know people What is that? Yeah, I was about being involved in darkness and stuff and it's hard to be around them But you love them. Yeah, that's the best thing you can do is just stain them the gap and even say you need to I would say that say father Jesus, I'm standing in the gap for this family member. This is their name That I don't want to see them go to hell. I want them to see To receive jesus christ, please and thank you for making that possible Before they pass and go go to hell, you know, make sure that they get to do that Yeah, and they actually write that down. They'll write it down and they're gonna go after that person I'm telling you, they'll go after them while they're living and even at their very death Uh at that time when he can use the keys. He uses the keys Almost at the point of death or right past death people go. Well, that's not possible. Well, you're not god Yeah And you can make that either so don't say that you know things when you don't know anything about it I mean, he wouldn't have the scriptures that stand stand with that that practice to love people to pray for them And that you wouldn't want to see them go to hell and yes, he will because your words allow him To use those keys By satan satan had him so nobody could use them and i'm not making that up either satan had those keys And there was a time back in the now when he would just go take anybody out He wanted to you need to you need to hear both sides of those keys Why did christ take them? Why did he take them back? Why did he take them away from him? Because those were there's those were made for a certain specific reason to have but there's authority in those keys And but to get those keys back he had to die as a righteous person This had to happen so that he would go into hell and he would be blameless He would be righteous. They gave him every authority To take those keys away from satan who had no right for them But satan takes advantage of anything he can do He'll lie to you if you can to see if you can He'll do anything he can to you and get away with it for a long time But in these days people are getting more and more aware. I'm not having a part of that I'm not participating in that evil or that wickedness. I'm having no part of it. I serve Jesus christ and I serve him alone Um, the enemy doesn't want to hear words like that coming from you But he really doesn't like it that he lost those keys and he can in no way interfere with christ using them I just have to point out to you those keys are real and they do give christ The ability to go even at the moment of death or as someone is falling into hell or they're being buried Yeah, I mean what what that's real that story indicates because you know I was drilled in is drilled into me as a kid. It's appointed unto men. What's to die and after that the judgment So they would say This is not possible. I can hear Ian say yeah, we'll take that up with God because Because they would say at the moment of death that's it the scripture says is appointed man Uh, uh, you know once to die and after that judgment. Well the death process can christ use the keys people That's good. That's really good The great white throne judgment. I can even tell him if they would read the bible There's two judgments mentioned. Okay. This is like at the end of so at the end of someone's life They died. Okay, they died There's a great white throne judgment. That's for the wicked and the dead in hell Okay, and they're all taken out of hell at one time when time is going to be no more They'll all be taken out of hell and they'll stand in this long line before the father's throne the father's throne and uh And then is that at that time is you clearly see these are all of your sins This is why you're not allowed into heaven He's actually going to show you all that and then you'll be thrown into the lake of fire at that time Okay, so that's at the end of time. That's that judgment. That's at the very end of time There's another one called the judgment seat of christ. That's not about sin Okay, that's not about your sin. You're in heaven. You've been living in heaven But time is coming almost to an end when we won't need time anymore We'll still exist and we'll always be the christ But it does say in the bible you'll be judged for every wasteful word Okay, this is in heaven in heaven towards the end of this time when before the new earth is made This will happen. But the other thing that you'll be judged for the judgment seat of christ is Did you ever accomplish what he asked you to do like if he called you know, this is an actual calling And you totally ignored and you knew in your heart you were supposed to be a certain something It could be and it could be a bill where you decided to be a pastor But that's not what you were called to do or you were uh, you were you were a builder You chose that over being a pastor. That's what you'll be judged for Did you do what christ asked you what you how does that judge when you say judge again? The old me would have said if i'm going to enter into that kind of judgment and god's going to judge me It sounds like okay now i'm going to not be saved anymore, but that's not what you're saying No, no, i'm not saying that the judgment seat of christ are for believers Yeah, who are in heaven right that doesn't take away your spell So what is the judgment? Do I get okay? I'm just going to be silly about do I get demerits? Did they take one of the rooms off my mansion? What? No, no, no that's not what that's about okay people Rewards are given for what you do in your life Like if you just help people love people you're getting rewarded for if you give them kind words If you give them something to eat if you get the money to have food Those are some of the greatest things you do and you'll get a great reward for that I know you're not doing it for that reason. I mean i've done it my whole life my dad taught us to do that And I never once thought wow i'll get a great reward. I thought i'm so happy that I fed someone who was hungry I helped to feed their family to me. It's one of the greatest blessings I can do For the lord, but then there's people who continually decide in their flesh In other words, this is your own opinion or this is what you want And yet there's something very much so that christ needs you to do and you know this you know what you know You know that you were called to do something. No, this is going to be much easier over here. I'm gonna choose this. I'll choose this This is what happens. Okay. You don't get any reward. This is about rewards Okay, you won't get any reward for the thing you chose You're not going to get any and it says in the bible. You will see before yourself them burnt up the rewards And and I clearly know I know they're not even know I was called to be a photographer That's my gift. That's the thing he put in me. That's my passion to do. I've known it my whole life That thing gives me the greatest blessing and I'm excellent at it. I mean my photographs are beyond imagination Even in this natural realm And I don't use one of those cameras that do everything for you. I have the kind where you adjust every single thing on that camera You couldn't ate that photograph And from the time I was a little girl, I would make little boxes into cameras and my mama finally gave me her brownie camera I was beyond excited, you know, we didn't have the money back then to get things like that But so that my whole passion my whole life was to be a photographer and I didn't make money off of it I did it for free for I did I did like weddings. I did all kinds of things I did like weddings. I did all kinds of things I it's my passion That gift I use all the time That is one of the biggest blessings number one the gift he made you Whether it's the best baker or the best builder or the best singer or whatever it is That thing he put in you. He sends this as gifts every good imperfect gift what comes down from the father of Like us that's him sending us to this earth for that purpose because when you go to heaven You're going to use that very gift. He made you in heaven. So that's that's one thing. Okay But a call on your life That he has for you and you know that call and someone even does I feel like that you're supposed to you know And sometimes it isn't the five fold ministry Sometimes it's not it's not necessarily in the actual ministry But it's something to do with that and God wants you to do that and you know yourself and he's told you several times That's way too hard. I just think it's going to take too much and there's people that say that That that they don't love Christ. They just think their way is better. In other words, they want his will their way Not his will his way And so there will be people who will be feared and that this is the thing At the end of the bible in the book of revelations it talks about the judgment seat of Christ And it says he will wipe away all tears. That's good. There you go people You will if you did not Take the call he gave you that he really needed you to go on the earth He won't take away your mansion. He won't take you your place out of heaven. He won't take he won't do that But it clearly says and it causes the judgment seat of Christ and Christ will make that decision He'll show you and he will show you You these are the believers. Okay, this is what I called you to do. You knew you heard me You knew I really need to do that and yet you said no I'm going to do this instead and you said no. I'm going to do this instead You don't you won't lose your place in eternity. You won't that's not what he's talking about But the rewards you would have gotten for doing what he called you to do Would have been so much greater than what you chose to do and you may have helped people and that was nice and wonderful But that wasn't what he called you to do And then the gifts that you would have gotten But you can't you can't get him now because you didn't fulfill this other thing You said in the past many times and it's hard for in our flesh, it's certainly hard for me to See god, let's say that I went there and there were certain rewards that he showed me. I'm not going to get I it seems like as much as I was so grateful that I'm still in heaven I'm he's not it seems like I would have regret and yet you said there's no regret in heaven So I don't know like like I said those aren't sins People would have regrets for their sins. They may these are not about sins people. This is all about a reward And you can think of it this way you worked for a business all the heavens not a business It's the best way to describe the people if you worked in the business and you were hired to do a specific job And you yourself decided in your own self and this is like let's say this is a huge company a corporation You hired a significant job to be over something that was so important for the whole company And you go, you know, I just I don't think I like that. I'll do that later I do it later. Do you never do it? You actually do other things within the company that let makes you look busy and stuff do you think The person who owns that company they won't fire you necessarily but you think they're gonna be happy with you if these were things that you said I I'm gonna do this is what I've been hired for this I know this is what I was called doing this company and you didn't do it It's sort of the same thing in a different scale that they couldn't reward or give you what you would have had Had you completed what you were asked to do and there's a lot of people who do that in business too because I've been in business a long time But in heaven in Christ, he knows your life He knows knew you before you were born He saw you inside the father's your little spirit of life He knew you then and he knew things you were going to be asked to do and he was sending you for a certain specific purpose But you yourself that's called deeds done in the flesh So let's just say that's what this is about. It's about deeds done in the flesh That means your own mind decided you're a believer and you love Christ, but you just add in your own mind I have a right to do this instead. You know, I'm happy doing this more than this That's what I'm talking about and yeah, there's many people do that But and I'm not saying in every way. I was perfect, but probably for the last 50 years I have on purpose focused on what I was asked to do no matter what it was If it was even if it was hard, it didn't matter to me. I focused to myself. I'm going to please him I've read the please him then please myself Yeah, the when you talked about christian photography and I can relate to that because I was a photographer I I was a people photographer and I did weddings too. So I relate to that dream was the nature photographer is You know, she had an eye for that that I just don't seem to have but I could do portraits You know to you know, at least back then before Some of the more modern ideas came by But that's a very how do I say this? That's a very Unspiritual, unreligious gift Are you saying that? By that example, uh, are you indicating that almost all of the gifts are non spiritual non religious? Are there some people whose gift was specifically spiritual? How would you define it because that's a very secular gifted most all of the gifts? Yeah, I'm not talking about we're not talking about anointing. Okay, you're talking about Callings or anointing. I'm not talking about like you're anointed to preach. Yeah for healing and stuff like that Uh, that's an assignment you have because there is no five-fold ministry in heaven. That doesn't even go to heaven It doesn't go to heaven It doesn't mean you won't be rewarded for obeying god for those calls Those are very important calls the five-fold ministry very important on the earth But the gift i'm talking about is a natural gift He gave you that when you go to heaven you will use that gift to bless everybody That's how heaven operates. He made heaven to operate that way He knew that he gave enough gifts to people like, you know, you you make great food You design things that people love and can have a good time in Or um, it's all kinds of things that you need normally in your life or would enjoy in your natural life So i'm not talking about any kind of spiritual gift. Yeah, we're talking about natural gifts every good and perfect gift Okay, I could this one Cat the one the one that I a particular gift that I A particular gift that I had I don't know if it's if it's in this category, but even as a child as I as Newspaper route and I would make money. It was a thing with me. I didn't do it for reward. I didn't even know if I was being noticed I would give Gifts I'd buy disney that tickets. I went in a contest and I give it I had a gift of giving and I've always Pursued that is that any where is that on that kind of spectrum as far as gift? I would have to say that absolutely is a gift Steve because everybody does not think that way Okay, and my family was raised that way Any way you can help any way you can bless people, you know, we're here to bless people for christ But that is that is a gift To me it's like a pleasure to be able to help people with money I love to do that and I do majorly do that help individuals help families And it says it's more blessed to give than receive And I understand that it is a blessing to give but that is like a gift that is sort of like a gift Because not everybody wants to do that and there's some people who even cause treasure chest In the back of treasure chest that you have goods or you have ways to have goods But you use that to bless people you don't have to give all your money away and there's nothing wrong with having good things By the way, you need to know that If you earn in your life and you do and and take in money and well, there's nothing wrong with you having things Okay, god's not against that it gives you great things in heaven, but don't let them have you or control you Yeah, I think where I realized there was something about it It took me years to ponder that part of my life even my childhood Because I'm thinking the one that keeps coming to mind is the one where I earned worked really hard One of sales contests and then gave these Disneyland tickets that were expensive for the day, you know to my Yes, mother's sister-in-law or something. It was in their family. They were so so poor I I completely utterly Forgot about it because I would do that all the time I wouldn't and then I would about the time she was close to death She said I'll never forget what Steven gave me Disney that I guess that I go I did and then my mother reminded me I go. Oh, yeah, so it was like it was so natural to do it. I I've never even thought about it again It was very major for them and you touched the heart of some people and And they love that in heaven when anyone does that it doesn't matter who you are They love that and I'm telling you you're gonna get rewarded for that Since we're talking sort of like rewards and rewards aren't you don't do things to get the rewards That you're you cannot escape getting them. Yeah, it's a father's delight to bless you for all that you've done for him on behalf of him Helping people loving people caring people just caring for people Comforting people when they lost somebody in being kind These are things that maybe you don't think of as important, but they're important. Yeah. Well, I like that's that's I know That's going to touch a lot of people because there's a whole bunch of givers. I know because they give to us You know here at this ministry There's a big group of givers and I keep reminding people even if you give so much as a cup of cold water Which people when they give to these wells, you know, God's gonna remember that but Yeah, the rewarded is the reward itself was the giving that's where you know if your heart's right if it feels so good to give That's what you say, but you get a lot more than that in heaven And I'm not saying that I'm not bragging or anything. I'm just saying I've seen people get the rewards at the throne And uh, some from the father some from christ But the judgment seat of christings that people don't understand is is great when you have revelation on the word to explain the revelation Yeah, the pointer on the man wants to die And then the judgment well, that's clearly not the judgment seat of christ sets at the end of time It's not the great white dome judgment. That's what that's past all of that. So what judgment is it? Yeah No, when you die it says what it's a point on anyone's to die and at that moment. There is a Salvation that's heaven itself. That's that's a judgment is the judgment is are you going to heaven? Are you here in heaven? Do they can they use the keys to go to to meet with you and ask you do you want to receive christ? So that is what that scripture means the pointer on the man wants to die and Elijah and you know We we know that Elijah and Nina didn't even need that they didn't have to die Yeah, because of what they did for god He decided to take them to take them to heaven, but I'm telling you there's they are watching us all the time They're praying over us. They're encouraging us They're sending words to us through people or through holy spirit or even through angels sometimes and god does everything He can to reach people But I do know I love the scripture says That god makes himself known to every man. That means man woman. He makes himself. That's really good to know That's really good. So people but don't stop praying for your family or your loved ones or those who are life friends Or if you're in a group that's praying for a specific group And and there are many people praying for different groups who don't belong to christ right now And and and god will reward them for that, but it's important to know that that can happen I'm really really good. Well, let me get let's hit a few more questions here Um, these are actually all this is just you and me talking this whole time, which has been very delightful You know, I can hear you know, steve. I can hear I can hear people at the same, but what about heaven? What about heaven? What's going on heaven? What does heaven do? I can see people saying that out there Yeah, that's true. You they're pulling uh Okay. Well, here's a question that involves, you know, because I was never taught about three different judgments I'm still trying to get it in my head. So here's a similar thing about Where does what take place? So joe joe's the end if I'm saying that right joe's the end joe's the end Uh, we regarding the new heaven and the new earth. She can't mention how people in heaven will all be moving to the new earth So does that mean that heaven will be emptied of humans and also I'm so reading all all the wonderful things that she has seen in heaven Like the crystal sea are all those things also going to be On the new earth or do we get to go to heaven and see them? So how does that all work? That was an excellent question. I'm very excited. That's a lot, but I can answer all that And um, I just want to remind people that we are going to have a new he says there will be a new heaven and a new earth Okay, I do know yes the the current heaven, which is a spiritual world It's not a physical world people that is the father's house. It's where he has always been. That's why it's called his house He is willing to make a new earth Much more massive than this earth. I've had he's taken me to me glimpses of of this new earth It will be one mass. We'd be glam ass and one massive ocean Now I said it says in the bible. There'll be no more seas The seas on this earth separate the land masses. Did you not know that? Okay? There is the ocean the major ocean, but there are seas that come off of that And the seas separate land masses. That's why it's called the seas They won't need seas in in heaven in the new heaven because I mean the new earth Because it's one lay a mess with one massive water around it, but it will be a huge land mass And of course the crystal sea will always be where we're at because it flows from the father himself It comes from him. So wherever he is wherever he makes worse that will be where the source of water Okay, so there's one answer there will be an ocean on the new earth there will be it'll be much bigger than this this earth here and Uh, I have to just say what the scripture says go to the end the bible people He's going to it's going to be rolled away. It's going to be taken away And he'll make a new heavens the planets will be different. I've seen a few of those really Yes, I've seen those and the father himself Will leave probably be possibly the last person to leave His house because he's moving to the new one which will be the new earth will be our house It'll be ours and his together. It'll be all ours together It's not like we're just moving somewhere that belongs to him. It's going to be ours He is willing to leave that place He's always been in to move and be with us forever and ever ever on the new earth And it will never pass away the new earth will never pass away and the heavens heavens says it will be new And I will explain to you why because when it was made It was it was stretched out and it says it was stretched out. Christ was the word Made it the father spoke, you know, the physical realm and and so the christ the word Stepped out of the father and made that and what he did because there's a place in heaven where everyone goes all your family members Have already been there. They get to watch how they made it Not having itself because it always existed But when they made the physical realm in the beginning In the beginning means in the beginning of time. That's actually what that means It doesn't mean the beginning of things existing because they always existed father son, holy spirit Melchizedek the the forliving creatures the 24 hours have always existed In heaven a spiritual world. These are all spiritual beings It doesn't mean they don't have a body that just means that they lived in a whole realm Different from ours and that's the only realm there was So within this spiritual realm the word Jesus christ made a physical realm area So that father could send us from himself to a physical earth and exist there and have a body We didn't have this body when we were in him. We were just our spiritual body was little little thing inside him living in him playing in him And so he made this decision We're going to make a physical world and a physical realm that will support that world And we will stretch it out so the word steps on him and stretches out literally Almost looked like almost like a big scroll and he stretched it out like this around a great part of the cosmos And that was within that frame of where he made all that all the planets We currently see now the telescopes is part of that physical realm and and it operates in the physical He made this beautiful place. They started putting the planets out there the stars out there The nebula they call that space art and I do too like there's a big eye There's beautiful things out out in space just floating It's really like space dust that doesn't just on its own fucking the different beautiful things They make it. It's like their art that they gave us out there Those are all physical round things and so he captured he'll keep the physical realm Until He sends the last one from himself to be born Uh on this current earth that we're in now. So nothing's passing away now There's going to be no blowing up the planet. Everybody thinks it's going to happen now It's not going to happen now. We haven't even done the things Christ said we could do And so there's still several hundred years I don't know the exact date But there's at least probably a couple hundred years left in the physical realm to operate to have babies to do things and stuff Like that and for some time after this whole thing changes And trust me it's changing because god's not done with this planet. Okay. The lord made it It's his this is the earth is the lord's and the fullness there of belong to him They don't belong to any group not democrat or republican Not not evil or good. It doesn't belong to them. It belongs to him And the father has a time line of events Behind his throne embedded in the floor and there's things on there that have not happened yet And we're not going anywhere until they're done with it So there's still a lot for us to do here But the physical realm was created on purpose so we could have a body that we could know christ receive him and then Live in eternity with him So when the last one is sent from the father and that baby is born Time will be no more. This is at the tribulation at the end of tribulation during the millennial reign People still have children so it's all the way through the millennial reign the thousand year reign of christ that that makes you happy for me to say that There'll still be children born So the earth isn't going anywhere right now But when god is ready And that last child that he sent from himself is born in the physical realm Time will be no more. That means we will be in eternal in eternity We don't need a clock and calendar to go by to live by and we won't need this physical realm It will be blended it will be blended so that in your physical body you can love Enjoy and live your life and do amazing things. We can still visit the father the throne room will still be on the new earth It talks about the new city a new city through some on the earth And it will be much much bigger than it is now. So don't worry about what happens between the time He rolls away the old stuff like it says When he rolls it all away and puts it or does away with it if he has to hold us in his hand He will so in heaven and then when he makes the new earth and he puts us on the new earth first That's what's gonna happen We will be here first on the new earth all of us together We see christ and then the father will step on the new Jerusalem and you can see it coming down from the heavens on the new earth And then we will live an eternal life that will be so amazing and beautiful and creative And exciting and adventurous and we'll be with them. We'll all be together forever forever. Let me ask some follow-up questions on this on the spiritual Place of heaven It's a spiritual place and then we're gonna one day get in the new heaven and new earth where god will come Um, okay, so right when our family those who have a precedence are there in a spiritual place There are spiritual beings out there waiting for their physical body then but jesus is in heaven and he has a Physical body right now right so then when there's a new heaven and new earth And we get physical bodies to inhabit the new heaven and earth The new heaven and new earth is a physical place and from that point on Jesus will continue to be a physical Person and then the father comes down and lives as what a spiritual being on a physical plane You're really deep you're a deep person. Yeah, I tend to you're deep, buddy. You're I just gotta know that I've wanted to ask that for a very long time The spirit realm would be done away with it. I I mean here one the physical realm as we know it now everything on this earth is only physical everything the atmosphere is all physical It will be the spirit realm That of course the spirit realm we've all received christ who lived there who are with him Had the ability to live in the spirit realm likely did in the physical realm and so That's the way it's going to be because the spirit realm has always existed the spiritual realm Which we call the unseen realm, but I see the unseen realm all the time So I know a lot about how they operate what it looks like and things like that And he only made the physical realm So we could come down here and have a body and then through our eternity It's just wonderful to have a physical body and that physical body Like enic and an Elijah who live in a spiritual world with their physical body. They look really good I've seen both of them. They look great in that spirit realm. The father just keeps him and he can he allows or permits them to Remain there. They don't age. They don't get sick or anything. They look amazing We are glorified spiritual bodies Can operate and live in a spiritual realm Like we did in the physical realm like when I say that you walk on the ground You pick things you can eat stuff you can do things with people that are fun and exciting to do You still do that now in heaven in your spiritual body But the new earth The new heavens and the new earth will still be spirit realm But but with the ability for people with a physical body to live and exist in there You won't get married. You won't have children don't want that make you unhappy. You'll be very happy. Trust me You'll be happy to be there But that's what uh, that's what the end looks like the end of time When he says the end he means the end of time having to keep track of everything You only have so many hours. You're awake so many hours. You sleep Uh, you know, I never get tired in heaven now when I'm caught up in the spiritual body But I'm never tired in heaven. And so I don't need to rest. Um, nothing wears me out. I'm not tired It's just a different way of life. It seems like the way you describe it cat It kind of seems like You know six one half dozen the other so your spiritual being in heaven it feels like you're physical When you become down in physical being in the new heaven and earth it feels like you're It feels sounds like it feels the same either way It sounds like it's kind of the same in a spiritual world in your spiritual body Yeah, you walk through the doorways. Yeah Falls you can eat the fruit do everything that's in the spiritual world because you're in a A your spirit your spirit man is living there. Your body is what is resurrected Your soul never sleeps people. That's not right. They don't know what they're saying. I'm I'm not making fun of them They just don't have a revelation. Yeah But your spirit man and your soul Never have to sleep. They're both spiritual things You couldn't look inside a person to see their soul But I know what one looks like because he showed me a human soul And I understand how it operates and why it's important to guard it And not let wickedness and evil and darkness and it's important to keep that soul Uh, you know focused on him and and not let the darkness in you or Phil would light yourself as a believer You want to keep that light getting brighter, which it does but on the new earth We've already had the resurrection happen The resurrection has happened the resurrection of the dead has happened that will happen at an appointed time On this physical earth everyone who's died that belongs to Jesus christ Their physical body is coming back It's going to come back. You'll get it back people It'll be it'll be put together with your spirit man If you've been living in heaven, it's going to be put together with your spirit man And then it's called you'll be glorified, which means you can never get sick. You can never die You'll never sin. These are for people who know christ and you will be like that for all eternity So there's still different processes. We have to go through who are here But it clearly says in the day the dead in christ shall rise That is your body Because your spirit man with your soul have been living in heaven You're in you cannot separate a soul You can't take a soul out of your spirit. You just can't do it. Yeah The way it's made but your spirit man it says, you know, it clearly says to be absent from the body That means you die Your your spirit man was taken out of your body with your soul in it and it was taken to heaven This body dies, but it says the dead in christ. That's your body shall rise one day When that happens, all of our bodies will come up your spirit man will actually go into the grave How about this it goes in gets that body and it blows up that grave no matter where you are Whether you're in an urn or whether you're in the grave you're going to come out of that and And that will be a sight to see I think it'd be one of the most exciting things that will be happening One day when the dead in Christ shall rise that means you're going to get your body back and you look really good people They'll know you're you it says you will be known as you were known on the earth that says that in the bible So if you were a male, you'll still look like a male a much better one If you are female that doesn't change you rise from the dead you get your body back You're still going to be you people will recognize and know you So don't let people tell you other things. I'm going by what the word says And when people go and when you go to be with the lord one day and other people go to be with the lord You're going to be a like a 20 or 30 something looking One woman. Yeah, and we'll but will people look at you and go. Oh, there's cat Yes, and how will they recognize you? Will your hair be pink? How will they how will people know that's cat? I mean this the answer to this question is the answer to every other question related to Well, there's something probably you're you're not considered People in heaven are known for more than just their physical appearance. Okay Everybody puts out a frequency. You know, everyone in heaven knows exactly what I'm talking about You have your own frequency that is You comes out from you no matter where you go on heaven people can feel Or hear that coming before you ever come in heaven. You're walking on having people go cats coming I can feel I can feel her frequency and and this is a true thing that happens in heaven So maybe you didn't know you have a frequency right now coming out of you. You can't hear or see it Uh, but it's amazing just just to be able to do that. So people will know you first by that Wow And then when they see you they're gonna go well, you know enough people have seen me on there It's already and uh, but people will watching from heaven right now. They'll watch me from heaven sometimes when I'm speaking They want to see what I'm going to say is wild But some people will like to watch certain people who do things that uh on the earth They want to hear what words are going to speak for christ or what miracles are going to happen and stuff like that Or what will people learn? So when you get to heaven people still want to know you they've never met you Oh, come on and they'll have meetings where you share your testimonies. Really? It's amazing People are interested even now in your we like to know and hear about people and that doesn't matter What arena that is in they want to know they want to know about you and they like personal stories to be told from the platform They love it when I talk about my family They wild stuff the crazy stuff really good. I mean, yeah hear about it So, uh, even in heaven they want to know you in here care about so what we think of is Getting together and catching up on the news. It's not it sounds like it's not unlike that in heaven Hey, come and tell us what you did in your life. They want to catch up, right? Is it similar? Something like that only mostly they just want to know you don't want to hear what you have to say Yeah, how did you feel when that happened? Where did you think when christ did that for you? When you lived on the earth at that time wasn't that amazing what happened? They talk about things like you like maybe things in history or stuff like that Uh, they don't ever discuss evil wicked things. Nobody even thinks about that anymore So they're not going to talk about that part of your past They don't they don't do that But the fun exciting things everybody does and they just want to revive you even the disciples will want to know you The prophets will want to know you Even if you want to profit they want to know certain things that you did in your life to help people of Or just things that happened in the first of that time one last question one last question about if So dureen and I let's say we're we're both Graduated to heaven and our kids are still here And then our grandkids are still here and from time to time we Would probably see their special events probably at the same time dureen and I would probably see them at the same time Yes, we list they've been different but let's say They're cousins or whatever are there situations where someone will say well What's new with your kids on the earth and we catch them up of what we just saw was So and so just had a baby. Is that kind of thing go on in heaven? Were you catching that part? Yes, about family relations and stuff like that people want fellowship I mean people like fellowshiping here If you're in the right groups of people in fellowshiping it can be a wonderful thing But everybody fellowships in heaven they go, what do we do besides they thought all we would do was just bow down Right, there's many things where worshiping is bowing down. It's a lot more than just bowing on Everything you do in heaven you will thank him because he made it for us to enjoy Or gave us the ability to be together and do things together You never stop. It's kind of it's called a lifestyle of worship you worship all the time all over heaven You know for everything and it just automatically comes out of you and so it's not like down to the earth That you have to come to one building at a certain time of the week and that's the only time I never stop worshiping him. I never stop talking about him or talking to him If I'm by myself if I'm just anywhere I do that so and having that would be normal to me And that's what people do mainly they talk about christ the things christ did the revelation they get from him when he when they get up there And they get to meet him. There's just a lot of fellowship There's a lot of events that the father plans for all of us and having to be together and do it together There's things he plans just to do with you or christ do with you So it's not like it's a boring place. There's nothing boring about it. I was like, yeah, that's amazing Okay, a lot of things together and having they really do still do things together They do really really really really good. So good stuff. I never get tired of learning more about heaven You can probably tell Uh, well tell people we've got revealing heaven calm and cat curd calm I always like to have you kind of recap what people can get there They keep you busy. I'm sure they're good at your website and Yeah revealing heaven comm is where um our our store is it's where our events calendar is And I think there's testimonies on there that people give and there's a few other things that you can learn and watch There's a lot of things that you can click. I didn't design it. I don't uh I don't even know how any that I don't know anything about wi-fi sci-fi maybe more than wi-fi. I don't know but but I know heaven fi a lot I'm really good at knowing that understanding that but so the revealing heaven comm is for that Okay, we have a corporation god told us to have a corporation He wants us to create things that represent heaven things that are in heaven Like some of the things the white people wear uh things that they would have in their mansions We're going to have a whole new list over the next year and a half probably We'll have a home decor stuff that if you come in you'd think you were in heaven Nice He really wants that to happen. He wants that to happen on the earth And his point is satan has made all kinds of things that people wear they use They talk about they play with it. They probably shouldn't play with he said he wants stuff Related to heaven that people can hold they can wear they can use they can sit on Uh things in the wall that we'll talk to you about heaven The carpeting will say things to you when you walk on it We're going to have use light a lot because light's one of the main sources of things being built in heaven Or designed in heaven is with light. You're going to see that happen all over the world By the way, that's how this is going to happen in the new witty ideas and inventions You're going to see a lot of resources And things that we use every day plus spectacular things that will be done with light is going to come here because it's all over heaven on earth as it is in heaven Is what we're going to be seeing over this next 100 years. So Don't get on your rapture rug stick it in the closet because you've got a lot still left to do in this world And we're going to enter into the great stuff and to be great for for god on this earth but my other website is cat cur.com And by the way, I don't have any other websites. That's it I have cat cur.com and that's where you learn a lot of things about the spirit realm and different things what things look like In heaven on there There's all kinds of interviews on cat cur.com and it is the one and only and I really want to say this There's no other place out there on the planet where you can give to me personally Then cat cur.com. So if you find some other other places made up with my face on it and they say things on it that is not me Yeah, and I will never ask you I will never appear on a video and say please give this much to this ministry Or if this place is doing these awesome things and I don't do it on purpose because I don't want you giving to people Who are out there and damn you so I don't do it And people actually contact us. Was that you saying to give to this orphanage? No, that wasn't me Is this who said please give this money this person who had an accident? No, that was not me You may see my face there, but it's not me I pray you do bless people if they need help and I do myself But to protect you The more the more you become known the more of scammers.

You Well, good morning from the Pacific Northwest in the state of Oregon. It is Wednesday, September 21, 2022. We're sorry, we're a little bit late today. We try, but every once in a while we don't make it. So it's going to be a good show, probably worth the wait. So welcome to the broadcast. We're going to bring Kat Kerron in just a moment. A quick couple of announcements. First of all, people that have questions for Kat, we still continue to accumulate those. If you'll pop that up there, go to questionsforkat.com. You see down there below, questionsforkat.com right there. Just like at Cinerons, questionsforkat.com. And then you'll be able to fill out a little tiny form and you type in your question in a simple, keep them really short so that we can just ask the question. We can't get the whole story, but just get your question boiled down to the simplest as you can possibly make it. So all right, I'm going to bring on Jeff here. Jeff is going to talk about the clip channel and how you find things on our clip channel. We're going to use Kat as an example. So Kat, go for that. Okay. So hello, everybody. So yeah, Kat, we've been made aware by Kat's team that she's been getting a lot of questions about different topics that Kat has talked about a lot. So I'm going to direct you guys over to Elijah Clips. So I'm going to do both YouTube and Rumble. So if you prefer one or the other, but they're a great resource. So first off, if you type in youtube.com and you just type in Elijah Clips in the search bar right here, as long as you spell Elijah and clips right, you'll come right up to it. This is the actual channel right here. Here's a couple of recommended videos. But if you click right on the channel, that'll take you to the homepage of Elijah Clips, the Elijah Clips channel. So this little, this little looking glass, this little magnifying glass, if you type in this and say you want to know about pets, you're like, what happens to my pets when you go to heaven? Just type in pets, hit enter, and it's going to show you all the different recommended videos regarding that. See cute little puppies and all this good stuff. So if you want to find out what happens to your pets, you can type in, what about a loved one and suicide? Same thing. You can type in suicide right there. Paul has done a great job of tagging these videos so that it makes it easy for you to search. So again, that's for YouTube, really easy. And if you ever curious to get a little lost, just come back to this video at like the three minute mark and it'll, you'll be able to see our tutorial. So if you're on rumble, it's a little bit different. Rumble is still in development right now, so it's not as refined as YouTube. So if you type in Elijah Clips in the search, you'll get a bunch of recommended videos. So if you just click, see it says Elijah Clips here, Elijah Clips there. If you just click there, that's going to take you right to our homepage, our channel of all these recommended things. Unfortunately, there's no magnifying glass. So the easiest way to do this is to type in Elijah Clips and then you go, hmm, pets, hit enter. Same thing. So what I would do in your search for that is rather than using the actual designated magnifying glass for the channel, it just does it for rumble as a whole. But if you type in Elijah Clips space and then whatever topic you're curious about, it's going to pull up all those videos again, suicide, celebrities, you know, whatever the case may be. So yeah, again, those are some great resources you guys. And hopefully that'll, that'll answer your questions so you're not submitting. I would, my advice would be to check either on YouTube or rumble first if you have a question and then look through those videos. They're shorter clips. You're not having to sit through like an hour and a half long episode. They're going to be five minutes, two minutes, whatever. Great resource. Check that out everybody. Happy watching. Thank you, Jeff. Yeah. You gotta realize that that we've been doing this every week for two years, basically almost two years or just right at the two year mark next month or so month and a half. And so we've answered literally hundreds of questions and some of them keep repeating over and over. So that that's what Jeff was saying if you try and find it first, if it's already there, because we're always looking for new questions that haven't been said so we can continue continue to populate both YouTube and rumble with those questions and answers. So again, go to their questions for cap.com right there. If you have a question for that and we'll get you on that. We have a list. These are all of our questions from viewers and we start going through them trying to be pretty methodical about getting getting to your questions. All right. Thank you so much. And now it is time for cats without further delay. Let's bring Wednesdays with Kat and Steve and here we go. Hello, I got my pink tie on free cat today. I think this is probably the first time in my entire life I've worn a pink tie. So only for cat only for cat. It looks good on you. Well, thank you. You're very kind. So I see your new shirt. Tell us about your new shirt. Yeah, we we have just of course, return from open the heavenlies and if I sound a little forced to solve the yelling I was doing, you know, it was good yelling. Really? Yeah. And Rod Parsley was just wild people. I mean, he looks like he's 20 years younger. No knew this, but he had been sick for several years. I didn't know it. And now he's so much better. He's healed. He's well. His wife was there too. They were so happy. And he was excited to be there with all these wild prophets. I think he's a friend of Hank Coonamans anyway, but I'm telling you what he got everybody stirred up about right now what God is doing now. And I think it really surprised me, but it was awesome. But every single speaker had the same the same message just in different ways that the end is not here. And you better be ready for what God is about to do because it's going to be powerful. I mean, I every meeting I got to go to to hear this because I was I loved even more excited. So I do know that God is up to things and I know there's a couple of people later who actually had some kind of inside information. So if you get a chance to go watch any of those, maybe go to Lord of Host website, you might be able to see some of those meetings that we had, but they were really, really awesome. They were amazing. I didn't get to see yours yet. I'm going to try and get I saw Kent Christmas's presentation was circulating. Were you there when Kent spoke? I don't think it was. I think I had just arrived. So I was actually rest. That was my only day I had to rest. Yeah, so I rested that day. But I'm sure that my team was there and they loved everything that they saw. We took like six or seven members of our team to handle the products table mainly, but they all got to attend the meetings to so it was wonderful. Now you're going to talk about your shirt. Tell us about your shirt. Can people order that shirt. Yes, they now can order it will be on our website in about a week. Okay. We just returned from the website. There's several new things actually that you'll be able to see there. I'm sure we got plenty of things in case, you know, people want to order them for Christmas or something. But I can tell you that out of anything that I ever wear that pen that one can I usually wear all the time. I didn't work today because I have this. I don't do demons. It opens more conversations. And a lot of other people have talked to said they say the same thing it opens conversations people. I mean, I don't do demons. That means I don't participate with them and I don't holiday them in my life. That's what that means. That means I serve the living God. And what an opener, you know, for that but they get where they can't stand not saying something. And even in the grocery line or even walking down the sidewalk people always ask me about I don't do demons. So we thought we'll just make t-shirts this time and take them and I'm telling you what they are amazing and they certainly are going to give a point of view from you. Well, you're not bashing people or what they believe, but you are taking a shot at hell. And, you know, that lightning bolt reminds Satan how he was kicked out of heaven and unseated. And so this is probably going to be one of our best sellers for this Christmas time. But we're going to keep an inventory because it's really a thing that's in demand. The cops are the tumblers. The pins are we have car magnets, which people will take pictures of our car because we have several different the magnets that we sell on the on the car. People will come up behind. We see taking pictures of them. So you're making this statement without even have to verbally say something. When you have a car magnet, this thing is about this big and this is I don't do demons. And then we have other ones say wonder women doing signs and I love that. I love it. Yeah. And we had those also for our event. We had car magnets and we had some other things. I think I don't know if you have a tote bag yet. Jen's pointing at something. I don't know what she's pointing at, but we did have some wonder women stuff. That's our women's group. And we're redesigning the logo for our men's group because we plan to have both of those. And of course, this may be too shiny to see, but if you've read the book, you know that one of the most important things that was put in that book was the portal in heaven where everybody who lives there goes to pray over their family members or just there's rose petals. It sounds wild, but there's rose petals all around and big urns and it's got peace in them. And when they throw them over through the portal, peace will flood onto people wherever they whoever they're trying to send those that that word of peace to them. But this is also something simple and it can't even hold a straight. You can see it. Yeah. Oh, that's the portal, right? That's the portal. Yeah. And it's the portal in heaven. It's got columns and at the base of the condue. See, like, what do you call them, Jen? Monitors. Yeah. And on the one side, it shows people who are in heaven when the family members are born again, they can watch it on that very those columns. And at the base of the other condue, let them know when they're coming home. Now, Kat, on that picture, while you have it there, the little tiny stick figures almost down the very bottom, those are whole. Those are bodies of people standing. So that could be like, that could be like 50 bodies of a person sitting on. Are these all different people from different families looking in the same portal, but they're only seeing their own family. And is their picture of their family filling that circle in their eyes or are just a part that they're looking at it. If you if you know how to actually seeing them. Okay. I'm not talking about the monitors. I'm talking about what they see. They're standing. There's usually about 1000 of them in there at a time. Okay. Okay. And so they're even with 1000, they're all seeing many different things. Yeah, most of them, if they're there, whatever's in their heart, they'll see their family number that they're thinking about or want to pray about or something. Or if it's somebody's birthday on earth, they go there on their birthday, even though they don't keep time in heaven. They know when and heaven when that's going to be their birthday and they go there and sing happy birthday to them. And then they go to different places in heaven and get gifts and put them in their mansion that's being built. So this is a really phenomenal thing. It connects everyone who has anyone in heaven. This place is something that's probably one of the most used places in heaven, besides the throne room. And, and so yeah, there's a lot of activity that goes down there when somebody gets born again. Everyone there sees that and they all start shouting. They celebrate that very moment. They see their family member getting born again. This is one of the things that they go there for. But it is a beautiful place and it's called the portal. And I'm going to see what it says here. It says heaven is cheering you on. God's love from above. And I've signed it. It's already pre-signed. It's like an eight by eight inch thing. I'm not really good. I'm the good. I'm not in marketing. Anyway, that's what this is. And it's in, it's in my book. It's in my first book. And you can see this image, but we added color to it. And, and Ken, are there, are there many of these portals in heaven or is there one that everyone goes to? There was many. Okay. They're all over them. They're buildings you can go to, but there are some that are outside. Okay. They're outside that you can go to outside and see them. You walk up to them and go look down over and see your loved ones. So they're not really so separated from, from us as of course we are from them. Right. Yeah. Well, and then Kat, if let's say you and in heaven, you won't be married. Let's say you and being in the gun home to be at the Lord, your best friends now in heaven. Do you, can you just be having any old, because there's not days and nights, but you're walking in heaven at some point. And then do you just say, Hey, Bing, let's go see what the grandkids are doing. Is it at a whim or are you directed by God to go look? Well, most of the time it's your own choice, but there are times when he lets you know he'll let you know about to come home to heaven. If you want to view it from here, then you can run out to the gate and meet them. I always wondered as a child, how would somebody know I was even there? Well, he showed me and it's these beautiful buildings built for that very, very purpose and people go there. They'll sing to their loved ones. You know, it's just beautiful to see the fact that they can still see their life. Now, they don't see any, you know, they don't see any of the, the any attacks or anything like they don't see that. That's not what this is for. This is a way for they can tend to speak over their family members and to know when they get born again. Any important day in their life, let's say your grandchild was graduating, your grandchild was graduating, you would be able to see that from here. A baby is being born. You would also be able to see that from this place in heaven. So they're kind of kept updated on things, important things in your life here on the earth. It's really a beautiful thing that God has made possible. The great cloud of witnesses, remember when it talks about that? Oh, yeah. You know, run your race. Don't, you know, run your race and remove every weight that keeps you from the end or the goal of that race. Yeah. This is the great cloud of witnesses that surround this. This is one of the ways that the great cloud of witnesses would be surrounding you. Oh, okay. So because I would have pictured almost in the cloud and their witnesses are almost in the air above you, but you're saying this is how this is what it actually looks like. One of the ways. One of the ways. One of the ways. Yeah, and meaning is I've actually seen clouds. Well, people would call it a cloud. It's probably the glory. Yeah. Every now and then I see this cloud of witnesses in a meeting like way up high above everybody watching. Not very often, but I have seen that and other people have seen it. I think Heidi Baker. At one time she had meetings or a facility in Florida. I think it was like mid-floor or center, center Florida. And at her first graduation from this place that she had gotten to have, I don't know how many weeks you were there. To complete a course, but they actually captured a picture. Literally. A lot of witnesses. And I think if you put maybe if you Google cloud of witnesses, Heidi Baker, you may be able to see that yourself. That would be amazing. That's what that is. That would be amazing. So what we've got a bunch of questions, but do you have anything you want to talk about before we get into more questions? Just exciting and exactly what God has said that people are starting to come forward. We can't name those names and some we don't even know. We do know there are several people right now who are turning to be witnesses against, you know, the one to destroy us. And by the way, just so you know, Kat, we're not going to be on YouTube now until December. So if you don't, if you don't want to speak in code right now, you don't have to just, I'm just saying. Some of these people I don't know, because I'm not privy to every single wicked individual who's paying for things to be done or actually in charge of recruiting people to do them. They have planned this whole thing well planned that you can tell. And probably since when we were all celebrating, I'm quite sure they decided we're going to stop all this. We're going to take over. But by the way, every single speaker spoke against that plan and they all said, we know God has got a plan himself. We know the miracle is going to be some said reset, some said reestablish some said that God's just going to change all of it. So I think the fact that we were all in one accord, not having talked to anybody, I never call someone and say, what are you going to talk about? I would never do that. I have to only say what God's saying, you know, as a prophet and most of these people didn't know until they heard what they were saying. So it made it very exciting for everybody. But that was their heart that it is not over. There's too many things left on this earth. God's not done with this earth or with us or with the body of Christ or actually with the world. And so I think that was the most exciting thing that happened in the last few days was being at that meeting. I was a warrior Alabama at the Robin Bullock place. What dates do you know? I think it's a, I think it's like, I think it's like 15, 16, 17 or 16, 17, 18. If you go to Robin Bullock site, you probably see that we'll have it up on ours pretty soon. But it's this next month. I'll be there for a couple of days speaking. Okay. Awesome. We're Alabama. Great. Great. Yeah, we had a lot. I guess I won't say the date. But since I'm not going to say the date and it's not that date. So I'll just say it this way, because we try to keep Robin under wraps as far as when he's going to be broadcasting at his request. It's a security thing. But we gave him a date in the future that we would like him to come on the program yesterday. And God told me it's going to be a breakthrough day yesterday and I've had all kinds of stuff. But so Julie invites Robin through his through Krista. I think it was the one, he's, we'd like him to come in on this date. Yeah. And, and, and Krista calls back and says, I want to throw a little monkey wrench or whatever word she, she says, we would like to come. Robin would like to come two days in a row, which he has never done. And he, we named the date, which we won't say just again for security. We won't say. Yeah. Exactly. Sure. That's why I asked Jen. I know it is next month. Yeah. It is sometime next month. So you're good for the, for the church meetings. There's no question on that. That's not an issue. It's like there, there was an issue with him broadcasting live and people were in the area, that kind of thing. I won't, I won't go into detail on that. But well, listen, I've got some questions and I've got a question from a 12 year old. If you're ready. So we said kids first. So here's, here's one for her for Olivia. And then I'm going to, I've got one that I've been saving to ask you. So, okay. So Olivia H 12 says, will homeless animals also boy, I almost feel, I almost feel the compassion of the Lord for this little girl. Will homeless animals also go to heaven and who takes care of them there? For example, are they adopted by families or are they cared for in a center? So she's worried about the homeless animals, which is a really sweet thing. What would you say about that? I do know what happens to the creatures, all the creatures, but I've never a child always or a young person always asked the most exciting questions that no one else asked. I guess that's what is in their heart. Being young, you know, they would think about the creatures and I can just say this. God loves every one of them. He loves every creature he made. And the ones that have a soul in the spirit, of course, are going to be in heaven. And that's why he had no output, every animal or species that had a spirit of life in them. He had them put them on the arc so that they'd be able to replenish the earth and then, you know, create more of them. So I would have to say that all of them go to heaven, which might be quite a shock to people. Heaven is bigger than this entire galaxy. There's plenty of room for all the creatures to come there. And anything that has a spirit and a soul will live forever. Just so you know that not just humans, but all the creatures that have that. And I can tell you, we know our cats do because they have personalities, they have likes, dislikes. They make their own decisions every day about what they'll let you do with them. And, you know, you all know that you're a pest to that. But even the other creatures, of course, I don't know about the adoption thing. I know that they will go home with you for a while to your mansion and visit with you. And it's not like a zoo. There's no place where anything is enclosed or kept enclosed. No creature has. And anyway, behind any kind of cages or bars, they have different domiciles and areas that they live in heaven. But you can go there and you can take them home with you for a while if you want to. If they decide to stay, I'm quite sure the father would not care if they stay, but they're all cared for. And if he knows when one, I think his point is he knows when one sparrow falls to the ground that they died, he knows it. Well, he wouldn't keep notice of something he didn't care about. Yeah. And you think about how many, how many creatures and animals did he put on the art compared to people? Yeah. Well, that's a good thought. That's a good thought. Wow. So he needs to know that they're all loved, everyone in their love. And there is a way you can go, go where they're living, wherever their habitat is in heaven. And they have an area that's there and you can go visit them and take them with you if you want to for a while. And if they want to go back, they'll just go back. But they're all fine. And God takes care of all of us, the creatures and his sons and daughters. Wow. Now you said something that was the right thing to say. You didn't know it was coming in. You talked about the size of heaven and the size of things related to God. And, and you talked about the new Jerusalem, the new earth is going to be so much bigger than ours. Okay. So I got to studying this and I've seen this before I got back to it. So I'm going to ask you this because I know you've seen the new Jerusalem. I don't ask you about it. So in Revelation 21 16, it says this city was laid out like a square. As long as it is wide, he measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 steady and length as wide and high as it is long. So here's. So I researched what these stadia are. So here's what it really, really is the new Jerusalem on this earth is 1400 and some miles wide 1400 and some miles long and 1400 some miles high, which is the height of some of our satellites. In other words, I really, then I Googled it and I doubled it checked and triple checked. In other words, you look at the continental United States and you take 60 percent of our land mass of the United States. That's the size of Jerusalem approximately. That's right. Isn't that amazing? So tell me more about it and how could it be? I mean, of course, again, because God said, what, what do you see 1400 miles in the sky? It's like, why would you even need to go high if you've got the earth? And what would you, what, what have you seen? Oh, because a number one of the amount of the money, the many people who will live, we're talking about the new earth right now. Because the new earth is where that will be established. That is like God's not just God's new home. He calls it our new home. So the new earth, it will be all of our home. And that's what we'll call it. This is home. And I tell people it can exist only because of the greatness and how huge the new earth is. I mean, the scope of it. And I'm sure it's bigger than even our galaxy could probably be half the size of the whole cosmos. It is so huge that it can of course sustain and nothing's going to go upside down or something because it's so high. But I kept telling people it is big. The new Jerusalem, the walls are beautiful. The gates are always open. There's never any shut gates. The gates will never be shut on the new earth of the city. They probably will call it the city of God or the new Jerusalem, whatever anybody else calls it. That's just a city. Now I have to tell you that as big as that thing is, it's only a city. There's many cities in the new earth, many cities and places to go visit, do things on the new earth. And that's one of the reasons why it is so big. And there's no sun or moon. It's lit with his glory. So it's spectacular. It shoots from the ground. It shoots from everywhere. All of the trees have light in them. And there's there's no darkness on it. There's no shadows really. If the light comes from the ground, there's not going to be shadows. And people are actually quite excited about that when they walk around in heaven. Now there's not shadows because the light, the glory comes from the very core of heaven, which is a world. It is a world and all these worlds were made after the lightness of that. And so it's just huge. All I could think of was how big it was. And it was so high up, but you have to understand there are some angels. There are angels that are several thousand feet high. Wow, really? Yeah. And they're in heaven now. They're in heaven now. They're in heaven now. You have to remember that in the very last days, there will be an angel that stands with one foot in the middle of the ocean and one foot in the middle of the land. And they declare things in the last days. I believe it's in the book of Revelation, but there are angels that high right now. Even just some of the hosts are like 150, 200 feet high. And their dwellings, they have it called their barracks. It doesn't look like what you imagine barracks here. Yeah. But even the army of heaven has their own area defined area that they live in and they run their missions on or their assignments on from that place. Michael's headquarters is a massive castle like structure. Also, it is, it is like shroud, not shroud is not a good word. I guess clouds of glory, but it's dark glory. People are saying it says God says I have myself in my dark clouds of glory only because they're not white clouds. These clouds are like a camouflage for him. We're talking about the father now and it looks like a million peacock feathers with eyes in them. Really? That whole cloud sometimes you'll surround yourself with that. But Michael's headquarters, even like I guess the circumference of where you would normally have walls around a structure or an area are these clouds of dark glory with these peacock feathers with living eyes in them. And that's what the purpose for that is. So just walking around heaven and singing and having it helps you understand the scripture, some of the scriptures. But that new Jerusalem is really amazing. Very beautiful powerful. That's where the throne will be. The throne will be there and other things will be there. But there's so many other things to do and see on the new earth, which is massive. It's just massive compared. I mean, there's no planet out there that's this bigger than that's going to be the new earth. It's beautiful. Well, I mean, it's like, and I'm trying to figure out, I don't know if your eyeballs in the spirit can see, you know, because the Empire State Building, then they made the Twin Towers and then the new Freedom Tower that took place and then Dubai and some of these places they've got the tallest buildings now on earth and there are probably a hundred and a hundred and some floors and like, but still you're like a thousand and some feet up, but this city goes 1400 miles. It doesn't say the sky above it is that it says the city dimensions are. So is there anything more you can tell about what's up there in the sky? Literally sitting on the new earth, it literally will come down and he says, and I do know if the father had said to me, don't worry about when everything starts to be taken apart and then put back together. He'll keep you safe because a lot of people go, well, if this is gone, where are we going to be between there in the new earth? Well, he will. He does impeccably everything ready. He himself, when it's ready for things he's going to do, it's going to be ready. No one's going to have to worry about being left out or lost or something like that. They say these things to me, but no, he's not. He knows where every hair on your head is. He's going to know where you are, no matter where you are. It's going to float around. So he will have a place for you, but he's going to make the new earth and put all of us on it first. So we will be on the new earth and then he will climb on this new Jerusalem city and come down out of the heavens. And it will sit literally on the earth and it will be that high. It will be that high because the earth will be so massive. It's not going to be. And you can imagine that shows you right there how big the new earth is going to be. Something that many miles high can sit and sit there perfectly because he made them perfectly. And so it's just, you're in awe of seeing it. But the thing that you know, the most is those gates are always going to be open. People will live all over the new earth. It'll have one land mass and an ocean. The ocean will always exist. The seas will not. The seas separate land masses. We told me the seas separate the ocean is the biggest body of water on this earth. And yet there's rivers that run off of it, rivers that run off of things. And the land masses, when the land was broken up, the original earth, when he made it had one land mass and it had an ocean. But when that whole thing happened in the earth, then later on, you know, verse two, there's, there's a mess going on. Not a mess, but it's hidden under the total water. You can't even see the earth between one and two or probably millions of years, literally millions of years of life here on this earth. And when God got ready to remake it and he, when he put it back together and he said replenish the earth, he left the land masses separated. All he did was take the water off of everything. And then he began to build up the land again. And then he put the greenery and the fish. You know, he did all that. And then he made man on the sixth day. And then he, of course, he did make the sun and the moon and verse two, verse one, he didn't need the sun and the moon in the beginning was when he made it the first time people. You'll find that out when you go to heaven. You get to go see how he did all that much. All that happened. But this new earth will be so much bigger than the one we're on now. Do you happen to know cat if, because I know in heaven, I think you said sometimes you can think yourself in a place or walk through a portal and you're, you're another side of heaven. Will that still exist that, that ability once you go into new earth or are you more now you're in your, your flesh, but it's glorified body. You can do the same thing. You'll be able to do the same thing you did before for transportation around. Okay. You do it around heaven. You'll be able to do that on the new earth. Okay. Okay. So we don't know if there'll be even the necessity or, or let's, let's have a group. Let's all go somewhere and take a flight from one end of the city for a couple hours. You know, and today's travel would take you a couple, two or three hours, three or four hours to get to 1500 miles. Yes. On the one city. Well that where do you have you seen planes or are they simply not necessary? Maybe you haven't seen planes because people like to have them and some are piloted by you. Most people get a star cruiser and they're called star cruisers. So none of that was made up by Star Trek or Star Wars. Okay. That was always in heaven first and it runs on light and they will still have them on the new earth. That'll still be a way people love to be able to do that. There's going to be trains, but not trains like we have here. You will step into beams of light. It will still take you around to the other side of on the new earth. There's going to be even more ways of transportation on the new earth than there even is in heaven right now. You can travel on light on bands of the rainbow. You can travel through a star cruisers. They have things that can take whole groups like I call them. He calls them MMS like a mobile mansion type thing, but it's like it's like a bus, but it goes in the air, not on the ground. So I would imagine, yes, you'll have flesh, but that flesh will be glorified. It'll be glorified. You'll be supernatural at that time, really supernatural at that time. And so I'm sure that will open up even more things for you. You can go visit other planets without a ship even to go to those other planets. I know that for sure. Yeah. There'll be a new a new heavens and heavens is like planets. It's going to be a new whole planet system and everything put out. Some will be for certain things to do on just those planets and you'll go there for like vacation instead of just yeah. Well, Kat, will people be on the new earth inventing things? Will technologies be being invented? Or is that stuff all invented? Well, I have to absolutely the father being the great creator with his son, Jesus Christ. He and the word made everything that ever was made. Father did it by speaking and then the word made it. We will more and more be able to create things, places and things like that. I know for a fact he told me that we would he'll send this like to a planet. Now we can't, we can't create people. We're not going to create other things like that. The place needs to go for people to enjoy and do things. You get to use your creativity. I'm saying not building something taking 10 years, but taking probably like, you know, I don't know. I don't know if there's minutes or hours or something like that, but it would be so much quicker to create design things and create things and put them places. Very good. Very good. Now there was one. Make sure I get to that. I couldn't tell if it was a child because it was under the 12 year old. But the question is, this is Cherie was Queen Elizabeth II aware of any of the pageantry on her love and respect. The world was showing her. Did she see any of the processions? Her family mourners or services? That's her question. The answer is yes. That's absolutely yes. I know she is in heaven. She did make it to heaven. And the father actually really honored her because her whole life that she was ruling allowed Jesus Christ name to be spoken, the churches to take place. She honored who he was and she did belong to him. And so I think one of the greatest honors he gave her was that she did that in her ruling and what she had made decisions on her own. As the as a ruler over that whole country that she opened it up at all times to Jesus Christ. And so that was a he honored her greatly for doing that. And so yes, everyone who goes to heaven, they do see that she watched the actual service. But I'm sure she got to see most all the things that went on in her honor. I'm sure that it blessed her very much. Awesome. Now, Janet's asking this question uses the word portal, but she's not talking about the portal that people in heaven looked down on. She's talking about an open heaven portal from the earth, you know, where people say, man, it's an open heaven over this place. So she's saying, how can we get open portals of heaven over our home? You can. It depends on how you're living your life. Number one. What do you allow to be shown in your home? What do you play on music in your home? What words are being spoken in your home? I mean, people use a lot of profanity. Heaven's not going to come hang around. They're just not because profanity is the is the only language spoken in hell is profanity. It is hell's language. It is not acceptable in heaven. No one does that in heaven. And so heaven will come where they feel like they're welcome or the atmosphere is similar to where they live in heaven. But I've been in people's homes and I saw open heavens over their home like right over. I could look up and see through it like through the ceiling of their home. I could see angels swirling around that place. I saw them on their property. This one man and I won't give his name because of course it's that's a national privacy and it was in Reading, California. And this man I was invited to speak in his home. The one time I went by myself, which they won't ever send me by myself again. 10 days and 15 intercessors from Bethel. They invited me to come and speak. And so I went I stayed for 10 days with one of the one of the intercessors and got to know her well. And well, she was a naturalist and eight, you know, gray matter. I know I'm making fun of her and I love her and she knows she laughed all the time. But finally, my staff called and said, has she anything? And then she said, well, no, I'm trying to get her to eat better. And they said, we told you she not going to eat that stuff. She's not going to eat avocado, chocolate pudding. Well, then I'm going to happen. It's not going to happen. So I just was fasting the first few days and Margaret said, get her to an in and out burger place. I know that. That's good. Wow. But but yeah, I was invited to a Catholic bookstore to speak. How about that? To a what? The Catholics love the books. They love. Wow. They so believe in the supernatural. They believe in Christ. And in heaven, I mean, they do. I never, I never said that Mary was anybody more than Jesus's mother by you. You need to know that. And I said, well, if I talk, I have to say what the father's saying. And they said, we don't care. We're hungry. I think they had like 90 people in that bookstore, the Catholic bookstore, and they had my book already on their shelves. So it was quite interesting. You know, that whole group of people. But I did let them know, you know, Mary is very much loved in heaven and highly honored in heaven. Yeah. But she worships Jesus Christ. He had to die as her as her Lord. And that's why he gave his mother to John. Mother, behold your son, some behold your mother. And so that transfer had to take place. So he died as her Lord. And so anyway, I did mention that nobody care. They were all so excited that I was there talking about heaven. Some people had interpreters with them. But it was a Catholic bookstore, but I was invited to this businessman's home. And he had meetings there all the time. And it was the first time I ever saw the river of life flowing in someone's home. Really? I said, I didn't even know this man. This man is living his life right. Because I have never seen, I've seen it in mine sometimes, but never seen it anywhere else. This man was really living his life wholly on purpose. He was a great businessman in Reading and they couldn't get the people in the home. Some of them had surrounded the home. We're sitting outside and I went, wow. And I said to him, do you realize that your, your own angels are surfing on the river of life in your home? He said, yes, I knew that. Wow. And he was Catholic as well. You're saying I don't think he was Catholic besides, besides that place being invited to speak. It wasn't planned. It was totally unplanned. Okay. People found out I was there. I would speak in the intercessors, backyards. It started in their home. When you have 150 people show up, you can't just keep it in your home. Right. So they moved it outside. It was just crazy. The response from the people that were so hungry. But one of the places I remember very well was the Catholic bookstore. And how gracious the people were and how excited they were to receive heaven culture and what heaven is all about. But this businessman was another person that I did get to speak in his home. And they had so many people show up. They were, they were, they were filling the streets with their cars and everything. But that was very significant that he did have what she said, an open heaven over his home. And you can create a habitation for heaven is what they call it. They don't come and live there forever, but they'll come and go in, in the presence of your home. They want to see your life. They want to see who's invited over to hear about Christ. And so that's not an impossible thing. And does the person, does the person ask God to, you know, say, I'll do my part, but could you bring an open portal over me? Or does it just happen? And you're from what you've seen. I'm going to start creating a habitation for heaven. And then automatically that portal is one of the things that would be established over your home. Okay. Good, good, good. All right. Aaron is asking, he said, he or she can maybe be one or the other. I heard Kat Kerr teach about the temple in heaven. Is that a different place from the throne room of God? And then I want to add to that. Is it a literal temple, just like another temple, but it's just not made with hands? Or is it something different, but it's still the temple? What would you say there? Well, I know they don't have church services in heaven. Everybody's already born again. It's there. They do have different meetings in different big buildings, but that I was actually talking about the throne room. If anything was going to be like a temple, it would be there. There's the altar is there, the altar of God is there. And people do go there and underneath his area that he sits in, his throne is a structure. It's not just a throne sitting three feet off the floor. It is very high and lifted up and underneath that is our rooms that you can go into and to declare things for your family or pray. It talks about one of those places, but the altar at the top of the throne room at the top of the throne itself. There is an altar and those rooms are way down below that in rooms. I used to think, are they under the altar itself like physically under that altar? No, they're in rooms that are under that altar. So the altar would sit sort of at the top and there's a throne behind it and then the other throne is next to it. And so Jesus sits in a throne with his father, but there's other thrones there and sometimes he invites people to come and sit on them. Sometimes he had some for children to sit on and I think everybody, if you ever saw Colton Burpo's movie, he actually said he was taken to heaven and God got a little throne or a little thing and set it right by his. And so that just confirms he does do that. This is that book we're having. It's called Heaven is for Real, right? That's that book. Colton Burpo was the name. Yeah, under the altar. I wanted to ask you about this before because you said it before. I think it's in Revelation. It says under the altar, there were people that were crying out. And one of the times it says, how long until you avenge blah, blah, blah, our blood is something like that. They were the voice of the martyrs. Are you familiar with that very much and what's the difference between that under the throne or under the altar? Maybe that's all the same. What do you know about that? I don't know if they go. I know there's not like time. So I can't say they're there for three hours. Someone else is there. I can't say that. I say that that structure is so huge. You can imagine living creatures probably bigger than any building we have here. They're huge. They're standing at like the four, I can't even say corners. The throne room is round. That is the very center. It would be like looking at him. There's two here and two back here. So the four of them are always looking at him and shouting things on his behalf. And you have to remember some people go up to the throne room. If they're showing everything there, they don't even know what to think or say. They're so undone. The throne itself, the one the father sits on and Christ sits next to him. There's two arms, but those arms rest on the backs of two more living creatures that have four heads. It talks about them. There's four heads. Like now we know that there's four. We know that there's four different living creatures, but there's also two that actually stay with the throne all the time. And they have four heads. This is a living creature. This is not something that's just carved. They're massive. So this throne is so high and lifted up. Just because of the size of these living creatures that are surrounded and the ones that hold up the throne, the arms of the throne, I'm telling you, you don't know what power is. No one knows what true power and holiness is until you stand before that throne. And these tiny little ants of people of the wicked who think they're going to overthrow him, he could just suck the life away from them. They'd be dust, but he's not going to do that. He has plans. He follows what he has said in place. But there are days of reckoning. Justice is coming for them. And no one or nothing on the earth can stand before God and say, you're not going to do it. And I understand when they say that they have no clue who he is or the power that comes from him. And that's who you belong to. If you're born again, that's who your God is. That's part of the God. He had Father, Son, Holy Spirit, such powerful beings, so holy that they do have personalities. They do do fun things with you. They created fun and heaven on purpose because we come home as the father, son and daughter. He's not going to just leave you on your own to roam around there. He has already prepared a place for you. That's where you will live. You may have more than one place on your own property. Because he does do that sometimes, but you don't understand until that is why I am so fierce about having no fear. Why would I fear if I had stood before that throne, life coming in and out of him, seeing the lightning bolt shoot on him, knowing that he had decimated hell, Satan, and he knows the plans for them are nothing. Their plan is to die forever in the lake of fire, and he's never changing that. But you, you and I, who belong to him will live for all of eternity. There's no end to it. Life excited, life beautiful, life creating, life filled with love and his presence. That's who we serve. That's sitting on that throne. He knows every single person and what they're doing. He knows your life. He's heard your prayers. He knows your heart. He's not for you. We're entering into and he is setting up right now. Some of the greatest days this earth cannot pass away into everything he has decided to do on this earth, forest with us and because of him, it's going to happen. And no matter what people think, roll up that rapture of people and get your heart. Because we will be rolling with Christ in this very earth before we ever get to heaven or the new earth. And that's what needs to be on your heart. Not all the sad, sick stories, lame stories coming from the fake, the illegitimate and the wicked. They're in another whole book. They're not even what your name is written in. And you need to understand, really think about that sometimes. Talk about that sometimes. Because if you want the supernatural work in your life, you better be talking about it. Even if it's only to yourself. Yeah, that's good. That's really good because some people say, who do I talk to? And you just said, only if you only talk to yourself. Because your thoughts are like shouts to him, right? He hears every word. Oh yes. Every time you say something like, the Lord is God and there's none beside him. All of heaven gets excited. All of heaven can hear that. But the heart of God, our Father, it swells with love because he knows his son is being honored. And anyone who honors Christ on this earth, you're not going to ever lose your place with him. You're not going to lose the reward. You're not going to lose things in the exciting times. Your name is already on the list to be used by God during these days. And so you need to understand, he knows what's going on and he knows who's doing it. And this is going to be one of the greatest fraud exposures in the history of this world. And because he has his own plan and those are the plans that will happen. Not the other plans. So can you, you know, you remember seven years ago ish somewhere. Somewhere that you came to our room on the cruise and I said, okay, Kat, I was just getting to know you. And I said, are you telling me that you, you sat here like before the God of the universe and you talked with God face to face. And you said, yes, so my question is, how does that work if there's even any way to describe because we know God is high and lifted up. And the Lord's, you know, and so there's that God who is fearsome and almighty and wonderful and all these things. But is it through his omnipresence, you can talk with him face to face at the same time he's there, or is he go there. And then how would you describe the difference between sitting there talking to him face to face and the guy that's high and lifted up that you're probably not going to be chatting it up with. I don't know what what are your thoughts. I have to say it's one of the greatest experiences I ever have and I've had that many times. I mean, you know, before all of this started back in the late 80s, when Christ came to me and said that father and I are going to let you reveal heaven. We're going to take you on tours around heaven, let you reveal heaven to earth. We are tired of the myths and the mysteries and the lies Satan has been spreading. Man has been spreading. We're going to set that straight and people will know what how heaven operates. They're going to know what goes on there, what life is like, what happens when they pass away. And obviously, at this time in my life, I was, I mean, passionately pursuing Jesus Christ to know him. And they had already planned to do this with me. It wasn't something I said I want that I wanted what they wanted. That part had happened. I had given them permission to come to me anytime they want to say something. It didn't matter if they said it inside me or outside me. And yet this had to start at a certain time on the earth, heaven had to be revealed beginning at a certain time on the earth. And so that was their choice. And because they choose whatever they choose, I'm going to go along with. And yeah, visit me face to face. Just like what I was talking with you. They came through the wall. They don't have to walk through doors. They come to the wall. They come to the wall, a hotel and speak to me. And all many times they'll say things to me. Sometimes you'll see the father is a swirling rainbow. Most of the time I just see him. Many times I'm caught up to heaven itself. I've been in the throne room. There's besides the main throne room, there's a commissioning throne room where mantles are given out. The commissioning throne room is a throne room that has the altar with the horns on it. Those are two different authors. The altar before the throne is the one that is used for people to bring their prayers and their desires to the father in person. But then there's a commissioning throne room or mantles. I said mantles are given for people on the earth. They're commissioned at this throne room and then they're brought down to the earth and placed on the people. There's so much to understand about how heaven operates, but whatever they choose, I have stood in the presence of Holy Spirit, the invisible member of the Godhead, and seen fire outline his whole body. And he can be as big as he wants or not, but he does have a real body. And I've seen Jesus Christ so many times, even before I was caught up in heaven, I saw him face to face. Even when I was young, I would see him face to face. So I'm from, I'm seventh generation of believer who actually believes and lives wholly on purpose. And I was picked out of all those in him to represent heaven on the earth as a seventh generation believer. My dad lived it, his mother lived it. We've got his history back to the others in my family line. Sometimes a whole line, a certain line of believers is chosen to do certain things during the different generations on the earth. I am not doing this just because of me. I'm doing it because I represent that family line. And out of all those who are here, he chose me knowing what my heart was, what I was willing to do his way, his will, his way. It makes a difference, but yes, I do really see him face to face and I'm undone every single time. The time Christ came and sat next to me and actually told me what I would be doing. First they just announced it. Then later I was caught up in heaven for years and shown things. Then when Christ came back in 2005 and told me that I'd be writing books, traveling around the world and all the stuff that began to happen. I don't even think I was breathing. I don't even remember breathing with him sitting next to me. The love he had for me, the waves of the love of the father and revealing their plan. And they picked me because I'm a detailed person. I have photographic memories. So there's reasons why I never argue with God. I never tell him to do it a different way. And I've met a lot of people that tell God he should do something a different way. I don't do that. I don't do that. I honored my own father. I loved my dad. I served him also when he was on the earth, but it was just something he had already had planned. And I didn't say no. I didn't argue with anything he said. And that means a lot. So God says something to you. Don't argue with him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you, as a seer, you might have had a really clear connection. I know there's other people that are operating out of faith because they're not hearing actual words. And so they're going, Lord, to the best of my ability, my answer is yes. And then they may have to proceed without a clear direction. Is that also true in other words? I think if you ever do that, he's going to start giving you clear direction. Once you have actually said, yes, verbally said it. Yeah. Openly said it to him is very important. Yeah. And if you're not sure you say, I'm not sure that I really think this is you speaking to me. I'm going to go in the direction you want me to go in. So that's good. Open the doors and give me clarity whenever I need it. And you need to be like, probably more focused on what you're saying to him. Yeah. It makes a difference. It's not like, it's not always going to shut you out if you don't, but it opens more and gives because they don't take things. Satan steals and takes, he'll control you, he'll use you, abuse you as much as he can get away with. He's getting away with it. Well, I'm not letting him get away with anything. Of course, being a seer does in that way. Maybe it gives me a little bit of an edge. But, but I had always been seeing ever since I was little. And yes, I do clearly see, I see things walking down the street going on in the spirit realm. Some of them will say, just leave it, keep going. Sometimes they'll say to declare something. So my life is like, not normally any sense of the word, but I'm telling you, when you get to heaven, you'll always be able to see any of them when you want to. But there's coming a time on the earth, not too far in the future. Well, these visitations and heaven encounters will be for many people. They'll be for many people. During this time, it probably pretty much eventually you're going to go because of your staying that you made and you didn't back up and you don't bash people who are doing things for God, even though you didn't understand it. Whatever you do, don't side with the left. Don't side with evil, you know, whenever something's presented, you say, you know, I'm not doing that or I'm not a part of that or I'm not believing for that. I'm not agreeing with that. All those statements you make, every statement you make matters in heaven. It matters in the atmosphere at home. Inviting to your home because if you're watching things that are like defiling or all the time, guess what? I was in someone's home. I went there to that was my place. I was staying in and there were two demons standing right next to their television and Jen was with me and she goes, what is in this room? And I said, well, they told us to enjoy their selection of movies they had. We wouldn't watch any of them. None of them. The person who lived there had been almost killed eight times. I said, it's the movies. I just told them it's the movies in your cabinet. There's so much gross violence just knowing the titles of those movies and and the fact that those were not visitors. Those were those were residents in their home because of all the content of the evil that they had there. And I just tell people you need to get rid of this stuff. You need to burn it. I said, and you've almost been killed how many times I said such graphic violence. You invite those spirits to to get into your life, which is true. And so being a seer, it makes it different when they go places like I'm going to go stay at the holiday in somewhere. But while we were there, we we couldn't even make them leave because they were residents. They gave them by the movies they were watching. The wife decided she's not going to tolerate. So I don't know what happened when we left. But I got a couple more questions. We started a little bit late, so we'll go a little few more minutes, but two more questions. Maybe I wanted to circle back to the to the altar because you said people in heaven will go to the altars and pray and give prayers and petitions. I think in heaven at the where where the Lord is where we're gone as high and lifted up. And yet there's also decreeing you go to the rooms under the altar and you said where they're making decrees. So my general question is both for them at the altar and for those under the altar making decrees. It seems like every decree in every prayer in heaven would by definition be a perfect prayer because you're sinless. There's no guile. There's no environment. There's no issues. There's no job. So if all of these people in heaven are praying, perfect prayers. Kat, what can you say? Are all of those prayers getting answered? Yes. And amen. What would you say about the effectiveness of those who are decreeing from heaven? Does it always happen the way they know that answer because I'm getting the prayers. Okay. They go right there as the throne or like I said under the throne, I probably will do a basic sketch of that so people have a better understanding. But I understand why images are stolen by Satan and used everywhere because from a distance the throne itself looks like this. Like a triangle or like a pyramid. I would say, well, what I would call a pyramid because there's depth to it. Four sets of steps going all the way up the throne on the four sides going up there. And then there are some areas that have closed doors where people go in and pray for things. So I know what I've seen or I've been told. I can't tell things I haven't seen or haven't been told. I do know that's where people go to declare, they go to put petitions before the Lord. I would pretty much think that most of them are on behalf of their family or things going on on the earth. And I do know that from there, from the throne itself, angels are being sent. I can say that part. They're being sent all the time. They're called up to the throne. They're given messages or assignments and they leave from there and come to the earth. And I think that probably has something to do with those prayers being given or petitions being given from from those rooms underneath the altar in heaven. Yeah, awesome. Well, someone had a word for me that they heard what my father, my natural father who is down in heaven was praying for me. And so they told me what the prayer was. And it made me wonder is that you say you kind of saying you don't really know the answer. The question was, was that prayer that he asked, was it absolute? Was God going to absolutely pray because every prayer in heaven is perfect? He would think. I think there may be timing on some of those prayers. Yeah, right. If God is in the midst of drawing somebody closer to him, or maybe they're in a time of training in their life for things that he's going to give them to do or something like that. And I don't think he'll give you something that is too soon for what you're doing with you. Right. You know, for three years, especially three years in my life, when I lost my job, my great law job, they let me go because I wouldn't take another lawyer on because the Lord said they're going to do this. You're going to say, no, you're not taking on the lawyer. He said, I know that I need those three years to train you. He didn't tell me what I was being trained for. It was all this stuff I'm doing. And I said, OK, and it happened exactly the way the day he said it would happen. It happened 30 days. Really? They came in, they said the very thing he said they would say, I gave him the answer he said to give. And so from that time, I was totally blown to the Lord. And there were things he did train me in. Yeah. Go places when he said to go to do what he said to do. And for three years, he did that. So he let me know that was going to happen. I didn't know within that timeframe, he couldn't give me all that I have accumulated now in revelation. And in training and ruling. He had to have me go through that three years of preparing me that I would understand him more and understand having plans more. So yes, they're given prayers. Trust me. They're there. I know that some things are asking for things for their family members and places, maybe your areas place places. And I know the father writes it down. He likes to literally write things down, whatever said. Yeah. But he's not going to ignore them. He's not ignoring. They're up there cheering you on praying for you declaring over you. And when something suddenly happens so totally unexpected, that thing was probably an answer to the prayers of one of your family members. Very cool. You were talking about God trains you and you were training. I'm going to share this. I'm not going to give the name of the person, but there's a famous or was famous person to see she had a global. Recognize she was globally recognized. She said to me this last week, she said, I knew I watched cat cur when she worked at that church in Florida and she she did. She was in the she helped prepare food and she ministered people and she did everything God told. She didn't try to get ahead of anything. She didn't try to be something and she says, I watched her do that and now I see what God is taking her. I just want to say that because here was a person you may or may not know who I'm talking about, but she was watching you the whole time. And now she's so proud of where you come in and now she's learning from it. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about? That could have probably been several different people. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I thought I'd share that. And then we'll come and ask me a question or something that I was doing, but I was about the father's business that was cooking, cleaning, setting up, decorating for all those events that we had. And that wasn't my favorite thing. Isn't that funny? So it may be inconvenient sometimes. It may be inconvenient for you. Maybe you don't understand why, but if he said it, just do it, people just say yes to him and do it. And then you won't miss what he has for you. Yeah. Yeah, that was amazing. It was a good lesson for me and for people watching because I go, oh, so Kat wasn't always, wasn't born ready to be a prophet and caught up to heaven. God's giving her promotion after promotion. You served and served and served. I did. You said you got fired from that one job. Did you? I did. Well, it wasn't really fired. I made it. It's the way they give you a choice. You can stay. You can take a second attorney to be under. There was no time. It didn't make sense. Yeah. And my boss lawyer said that doesn't make sense that the board is saying you have to take a second lawyer. But I knew why that was happening. It was his way of releasing me from there. And I could see that it happened exactly the way he said it would. So I did a great job and I had great relationship with my boss, with his wife. His family came to visit him all the time in the law office, which was very rare. He was a Christian. And so he knew I had favor with the judges favor with the county clerks. You couldn't just call a judge and say, change this date. I can't make it there. No, I wouldn't tell you what they'd say to you. But some people just have favor and they go, of course I'll change that. And so there was reasons why he recognized that I had favor from God for things. But the time came when God was taking me to the next thing to repair for what he had for me, which is what I'm doing now. Yeah. And I was excited when I went home and told my husband 30 days from now, I won't have my job anymore. You did. I was excited knowing that something was going to happen. And then he told me my husband at one point wouldn't have his either. And it happened just like he said, he wouldn't have it. But he really took care of us so amazingly during that time. And then he begins to establish us in what our call was in our life. So even in the times when you don't understand, maybe you don't clearly hear, you trust him because he is preparing you for something that he really needs done. And he's always watching when you say God writes everything down. Of course, aren't angels recording things too? Yeah, there's five angels sent to be with you. I see them with some people and they're always, they have a tablet kind of a thing, not like we have here, but it's just different. But the father is the one who loves to write things down. Jesus, not so much. Not so much. Jesus has to go and speak and share and not, but the father has always written things down. He loves to write things down. He has book of remembrance. He has a lamest book of life. He has got many different books that are his own that he writes in. Okay, let me ask you. Here's one last question. This is Elaine. I'm trying to find one that's a little shorter, but Elaine's asking, Kat, I know Jesus laughs in heaven, but have you ever seen the father God laugh? A big old belly laugh out loud is a question. I was just imagining the father with his head back with long flowing white hair, just letting out a big laugh. He absolutely does do that. He absolutely does. I think I'm continually amazed by the father. I know why his son loves him so much and he does. I mean, I think the hardest thing Christ went through is the three days he was separated from him and was not allowed to hear him or anything. And he had to stand for what he knew was going to happen when he had to go over to hell and then wipe them all out later. But the father does laugh. He actually does laugh. Sometimes when people come home, he's so overjoyed that he'll just laugh out loud. And then you can't help everybody and someone will begin to laugh because like contagious. Yeah. And he does have a big laugh. It's a big laugh. His voice has got layers in it. So it multiplies the intensity of what he's saying or laughing at. Oh, I'd love to see that and hear that. Awesome. And on that question, where you said, are you actually just volunteered this? You said going up to heaven or visiting heaven and these experiences are going to be for the many soon. Roughly. You said something roughly like that. My question was right now, I know, I can, I know seven or eight to have had these encounters. I know the war details of that between you and maybe Kim Robinson, Robinson, Donna, the multiple things, but when you say for the many, are you talking about for millions upon millions of Christians will be being caught up? What would you say? I have, I'm not sure about the number, but I know that many will. And I think we're entering into a season of greatness of God being demonstrated and manifested all over the world. It's going to start happening. I do know you told me at one time he'll take whole congregations or whole groups of people at one time. So it's going to increase. It's really going to begin to increase. That was a huge word you just said. You're saying God sometimes is going to catch up a whole congregation. Yes, he did say that to me. Whoa. Dream. I used to pray that when we go to heaven, we could be go together. I don't think we pray that any more because right now all we want to do is go, whether one of us goes together, we just want to go. But it'd be cool knowing that God would sometimes take a couple or a church or an interesting time. He really did say that. Is there anything before we close that you can think of that in this hour, crucial hour that we're living in, things are happening in the news, things are happening in the church, that you would like to leave the people with? If you could just, sometimes I think, Kat, you must, I know you don't, I know you don't get anxious, probably, or fear like that. But are there times you just wish the body of Christ could grab hold of this one thing right now in this hour that they're having a hard time grabbing hold of? Is there anything like that? I think sometimes it doesn't make sense at all because God doesn't live. He doesn't live or think the way you live or think. He is God, and I'm talking about the Father. And I think the one thing he told me to tell everybody to do is still the best thing to do. You start celebrating, and I know in your head, well, all the stuff's going on, these words are being said, but when you do, God has said to do, it's him saying it. Eat, cake, and celebrate because he knows, no matter what's going on around you, what's being said, even the regulations, even the criminal acts that they're doing in our government right now, or other wicked people, you cannot let that be your new norm. It is not your new norm. God is your norm. It should be the thing you go to, the thing you talk about, the thing you're excited about. He holds time within himself. It comes from him. He knows the days are getting very short for those things to continue that you're seeing now. He wants every single thing and person and group totally exposed that are part of trying to take over. He wants that to happen. Until that time, besides just praying, giving your prayers or your praise, make sure you're praising and praying. Don't let it only go to like, I've got to pray this or else you need to pray. Sometimes praise is better than praying because he already knows what you need. Praising is actually thanking him for doing it before it happens. And this celebrate thing he wants you to do is those who've done or building layers in your soul of that celebration. And when it happens, it will be so powerful for those who have agreed with God that celebration is coming. Things are changing. It is totally going to be different. It won't be anything like it is right now. That's what you're actually doing. I would say the most important thing you do is do what he is saying himself in these days with all this going on. You celebrating victory and freedom before you actually see it happen is one of the most powerful things you can do. Not just for yourself and your family, but for the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit and all of heaven. Looking down and saying they really believe and trust you that this is going to happen what you have said. And I think that other than that is helping other people who are in a place of fear, who are in a place of turmoil. Pray for them that that fear will leave, that understanding will come, that clarity will come. They don't have to live in a place of doubt, of fear, of being taken over by the enemy. We don't belong to the enemy. You came from the Father and lived in him. He knows your name. He knows who you are. He knows what you need. And sometimes the fastest way to get things you need is to thank him. That's good. You have to pray. Well, Cece, because you need something, you pray once, then thank him. That's so good. You have to get that. Whatever that thing is, a lot quicker by thanking him and showing gratitude that you're trusting him for it. Really good, Kat. Really good. Would you go ahead and pray for the people? I know they always love it when you pray and decree over them. So awesome. Yeah, Father, right now I just take authority over all the darkness out there, the evil, the wickedness, the killing, stealing, destroying, defrauding, taking away, you know, robbing people, all of that. I take power over all of that darkness. I say it has not got permission to be here and has no right to operate in the life of a believer. We will not tolerate that continually going on. I'm an agreement with the Father that end is coming for wickedness and evil to be present everywhere. They don't have permission from us. I will give permission to nothing that is evil or darkness. I evict darkness from my home. I evict it from my life. I evict it from my city in Jesus' name and I release the life of God, the love of God, the plans of God, his celebration, his validation, his justice that is coming to this earth. He and he alone do I serve and I will serve no other God. I thank you Father for showing up and showing off on their behalf, set a place at your table in the very presence of the evil going on. That you know what's happening and you have a plan and I believe you and trust you with everything within me. I am on the same side you're on, the side of the right, the side of life, the side of love, the side of justice, freedom and liberty. Because that's life in heaven on earth as it is in heaven in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen, amen. Thank you, Kat. Hey, I think in the interest of time, let me just remind people revealing heaven. I want to do it with my finger. That is where you get the books and materials and that I don't do demons. Her website, catcurve.com is the one place. It's got spiritual resources that are free. It's the one place you can give to Kat and the only place you can give to Kat. It's right there, catcurve.com right there. Please support her ministry. I know many of you do and maybe most of you do so. Kat, thank you so much. Let's see, Barry Wench will be on tomorrow, Prophet Barry Wench, tomorrow is Thursday. Kat, you and I are taping a second show tomorrow, so we'll do that for next week. So that would be good. How are you doing? I love her. I will. I will. God bless you, Kat. We love you. God bless you. We'll see you all later, everybody. Have a great day. God bless you. God bless you.

You Well, I would say happy Wednesday, but it is Thursday a week before you're going to see this We're recording the six days before For us you'll see on the clock behind me that it is Thursday, September 22 You will be seeing this on the 28th. I believe I'm not right if I'm correct I believe it's you'll be seeing this on Wednesday the 28th. So just so you know This is when the words this is when the words were said and you'll see it on the 28th So, all right, so that's the story. We have Kat Kerr coming in here in just a moment Time I don't think I have any announcements. So we're gonna get right to it. So without further delay Let's bring in Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go You Well, there we are she is how's it going Kat? It's looking a little better right now Yeah, so when you're on your live on the air Kaz So we just for those that are watching we've been struggling with the lights It's a little better right now than it was. It's got you know, it's kind of we had a change in the light and the brightness We were trying to fix what what was broken so to speak. So anyway, welcome. Welcome. Good to see you So it's much later. It's actually 5 30 in the early evening for you, isn't it? I guess I'm just getting started. Yeah, this is your day. Yeah, this is towards Well, I mean this so that's good because that means it's gonna be a good show because you're gonna be awake and alert Yes, not that you aren't always so anyway Well, well, Kat, obviously this is today the set the 22nd, but they'll see it on the 28th. So Anything you want to say before I've got pages of questions, but about heaven and other things related But anything you want to tell the people before we get going on these questions? I think there's probably a little bit of something to tell them Sometimes I said sometimes I can't release it all one time, but I do know this for a fact I don't know who and I have to say that I always am honest I don't know who but I do know That there are covert people out there Gathering information that the other side, you know when I say the other side I mean, you know, if you decide not our yeah They have no clue about it because when you get so full of yourself and you think you've won And this goes for anyone if you're if you're on the wicked side and you think you've won That means you convinced you one that does not mean you have won in any shape or form of the word and a lot of that's actually still going on however Some are realizing even more realizing that this whole thing is going to go down the drain From what their plans were not our plans. Everybody knows our plans right goodness light hope love joy celebration So but the other side has no clue really they think they've got it made They think they've got the plans laid out and they're happening and they aren't happening at all and that should bring you hope That yes, there's more going on not seeing than stuff being seen What you're seeing is their plans their announcements that they generate all the time that brings no good If you didn't know this by now Satan, I'll just say Satan Satan can't create good. There's nothing good about him There's no good plans. He's never made. He's never done anything to help anybody and that's never going to change But the side of light is always working towards Great things happening more happening on our behalf on behalf of the world because this world still brought belongs to the Lord of Glory And he has let's say spirit realm operations for sure. You don't see them I see them and it's amazing the things going on that are about to happen and then on the other side On the flesh side, there's also stuff going on that no one is aware of whatsoever Which has to remain that way so always know this there's always somebody on your side If you're on the side of light, there's always somebody go things going on plans being made that actually will happen Because we who are in the light have a great foundation that cannot be shaken the other sides already been shaking Yeah, you remember that what the father said on November The fourth 2020 he said when it begins to shake and when the shaking begins It will not stop until everything is accomplished that he has planned and Therefore because that shaking has started in earnest in many places in the spirit realm and in the flesh because they're both happening That always tells me something is about to be exposed Something is about to be done and finished. So that's all I can leave you with today I hope that helps you to stay excited and remember to share truth Remember to share what brings hope and life and celebration and stop broadcasting what Satan wants to happen So I want to I want to ask you this now You have said before cat several times on a broadcast that the enemy Satan promised Hitler all kinds of things and he was going to make him Famous he was going to make him whatever it was and now as I recall you said since then since he he's been hanging on a hook and hell Is that am I saying that right? On a hook so on a meat hook. So what I'm so now is it or is it not true that even the deep state? Literal people have been promising their foot soldiers people we see on the news if you cooperate with these evil deeds We're going to do these good things for you. That's a lie, too Isn't it? It is a lie Well, the father of lies who is yeah is really in charge of everything even some of them don't know that they think it's them And it's not them. So because the father of lies Satan Cannot ever create anything good that is productive. It's going to bring forth help. He can't do it It's been it's been blotted out of his mind and that lightning bolt that you come out of heaven burnt part of his mind away That's what the father told me so nothing good will come from that for anyone involved in that That's just the way it's going to happen It's always been that way and I wish everybody could have been there and open the heaven leaves a meeting and her What was said by a couple of speakers if you can go to the Lord of hosts and watch those meetings You'll probably find out what I'm talking about They clearly exposes that deep state stuff and what's going on with them and what's going to happen according to the word Which is they're going to fail miserably and yet we who are here I will say a scripture I will quote with you until he that remains is removed the end of Christ cannot appear on the earth That is in the word of God He who remains is the body of Christ people operating in absolute dominion authority by the time those other greater days get here That's what will be happening. No one's going to need a rescuer people The only reason the antichrist comes is that people are screaming out for a rescuer But when we're gone and no one knows that day, but the father and it's not right around the corner just in case you wondered That is a scripture that is in the Bible and that's exactly what that means So we're here Not to be beat up and stepped on in the views, but we are here to rule Jesus Christ rules and mean now in this life And the time to come that's what's about to happen in this world And because that will be phone less greater than you ever imagined speaking to the land the sea in the air and running things for God on this earth so that it will be great There will be hope joy celebration and that is going to happen. That is those are the father's plans That is what is about to happen and you will just further further see the demise of everything else on the other side Because there's no one that can stand before the living God and say I'm taking over too bad That's never going to happen and until we are removed as the light in this world the body of Christ Operating in dominion in authority That's why I keep saying get your crown on because that is about to happen the other side is going to fail every single time and I think in these meetings that just happened was so fully explained by more than one speaker Including myself it was just a glorious time with the presence of God and everyone getting so excited about what was being shared From having what having the plans were so that's what I can tell you today And that's what you should expect to happen. That's what you should be talking about Yeah, I want to encourage those who are listening there are people that are part of the deep state They think we're nuts right now, but you're beginning there's some watching this that are beginning to a little way You're beginning to say maybe these guys maybe that lady with the pink hair is right Maybe that Steve Schultz of them are right. Maybe I'm on the wrong side Can I just say this if you're one of those people get out of there repent tell the Lord you're for you're sorry for for You know wanting darkness instead of like repent from it till ask the Lord to forgive you He'll rescue you before it's too late. So yeah, don't wait. Don't wait. Don't wait. Don't wait I wouldn't wait any longer if I were you. Yeah, it's right there folks, you know, you know, there are already in covert operations actually That are getting stuff from those some of those that you'll be shocked to find out who they are It's not the V person who's telling on everybody else who's involved in that But that's what always happens in these operations. It's always what happens when evil tries to take over There's already always somebody either a plant in that group or someone in that group getting Realization of the truth of what's happening and they don't want to do that anymore or be that anymore And as I've always said, please pray for their families the ones who under one stuff Illegally pray for all their families if they have nothing to do with that They don't want a part of it and yet they're probably in hiding yourself right now because of that So I do father I pray for all those right now who have a family members out there being evil and wicked Killing stealing and destroying father. I pray for their families father. You will protect them You will keep them you will bring them peace in their hearts and run after those who are doing that Let's sick Holy Spirit on them in Jesus name That if God has a plan for their life, they're gonna realize it and they're gonna turn and come back to him in Jesus name There's my prayer for the there you go. Awesome cat. Well, then well, we'll get into questions anyone That's new watching this cat has been and not she's not the only one many people on the earth have had this in Many encounters in heaven where they're caught up before the Lord cat is one of those primary ones that I know and she's she's been called To to bring heaven the teaching about heaven to the earth is that how you describe it cat? In person face-to-face commission with Jesus Christ when he informed me that father and he were gonna start taking me on chores of having to reveal the truth about heaven what life is like what happens from the moment you pass from this world or Step out of your body your physical body and what life will be like there That is a commission and I started back in the 80s and they have no intention of stopping it And I have no intention of asking them to stop What would you say cat To someone that says look we have the scriptures. They were codified. We know those 66 books God's told us what we want what we need to know There's there you shouldn't tell us anything. That's not in the Bible Because he's given us what we need all the things we need for life and godliness. What would you say to that? I think the Bible is definitely One of the most basic things you need in your life because it gives you truth Truth about Jesus Christ truth about life and death Truth about who we are is the body of Christ and it clearly says in there that he gives his power over all the power of the enemy And if you don't know what that is you need to know what that is He fully intends for you to understand what that means and also what what we have the right to do in this world as Kings and priests and to our God which it also states those are positions of authority and dominion and Some people can they'll read scriptures and they may understand they may not understand But when things change and these times are definitely changing Yeah, the messenger and has always sent a messenger John the Baptist was such a messenger He was changing everything by the word God gave him to speak that the Messiah was coming Then we would no longer offer animals of sacrifices back in those days that totally changed everything For those who believed in Jesus Christ's our life is changing their understanding the revelation was changing We're in one of those times right now where you need to know who you are and use the authority He gave you right now and therefore that is why he's revealing himself the father of the Holy Spirit Revealing how heaven operates what he has given us to do in this world if he says the earth is crying out itself For the manifested sons and daughters to stand up and say and do things To impact this world. That's what I share It is Scriptural and it is in the Bible and I had a personal commission and you all know even in the Bible people had personal commissions given by God Given by the Lord, then that's what they did while they were here on the earth I am no different than those other ones. Okay, and because I was asked and I said yes, that is what I am doing Yeah, good good good stuff. All right Deanna's asked the question. It's it's her granddaughter's question So I'm gonna read you that question and then I'm gonna add a couple more to it myself She wants to know are there schools in heaven and I'm gonna add to that The details are their classes are their courses are their trade schools any of those type of things any or all of those are none of those in heaven I I don't know about the trade schools I think that anything you don't know how to do or you would like to do horseback riding skydiving I mean, I can I'm just listing a bunch of things if you really have been doing that You go to the one who knows how to do that and yes, they will teach they teach people They they give classes and teach people But there is word university, which is the main one that everyone goes to when you come to heaven everyone revelation on every single scripture in the word and The ones who wrote those books in the Bible teach those books with revelation to you when you come to heaven There are classes. There is a specified place called word university Whoa, and I think pastors are the most excited people when they go to that go to those classes and they've learned the full revelation Of what the word what those words meant when that they were given and but being able to see or meet those Who wrote those scriptures who after they got to heaven were given revelation on that? That was going to be what their assignment was and also there's royal university that teaches you how to rule and reign Really not just not necessarily in heaven, but in the world to come on the new earth There will be people who have positions to be over certain areas In that at that time and you learn how to do that at royal university So those two places I know I've seen them word university and royal university actually do exist in heaven Yes, you will attend classes not in a school room behind a hard desk I'm not going to tell you how they do that, but it's in different places throughout heaven Even in the celestial realm that these classes take place in it You are so amazed and I'm done by what the father has to share with you when you get there I was totally going to ask you you mean sitting at desk like I'm picturing these school desks Where somebody walks by knocks your papers off just to have fun So this is not behind the desk. Nope. It's not like that. Okay. Very cool All right. Now, how come you said I'm not going to tell you how is it kind of a more secret or we just wouldn't understand How the learning exciting ways exciting ways that has taught you I want you to find that out when you get there Okay I'm gonna ask something my wife and I were talking about this thing where you've heard me talk about our loved ones that went before us and That didn't agree with the things we're doing like the stuff you and I are doing now people that are now going to be with the Lord and You know, we were talking about it was hard to visualize Even now them and even though we know they understand everything. It's hard to visualize them. They're going Wow, look what Stephen dream doing or doing because they always didn't like what we were doing You said they will be saying that it will be saying that they will be so fully Understanding what God has given you to do in this world and it will be excited. They'll probably watch a lot Don't watch a lot. Oh, that's a good word Well, that was my supposition I was saying I think they might from time to time Look down and say let's see what Stephen dreamer up to now because they're doing this prophetic and you know now They understand it. Okay interesting. So that for a lot of people who had people that went to be at the Lord They never understood what you were doing with the Lord now. They're cheering you on from heaven Yes, and I want you to repeat this one thing and I'm going to ask the next question But repeat to me what you said if you remember it and if you don't know, but the moment someone steps out of their body What they understand you said the moment they step out They understand you leave this physical body behind your spirit man is free from this physical body The presence of the Lord will begin to invade you right then it doesn't wait you get to heaven You already can feel his presence all around you joy floods your soul. You're so excited You know when you're going your guardian angels right there with you You'll see your guardian angel for the very first time if you've never seen them before There's probably more than one you'll see them right there They're waiting to take you home to heaven and that is the very first thing they experience is seeing their guardian angels And they're going to know they're the guardian angels and they'll introduce yourself to you and they'll tell you you've got to go home We're going home take you home to the glory We're going to the heavenly realm and we're here to take you and it's going to be okay But then excitement begins to pour into the heart when they realize they see their body They can clearly see their dead body Yeah, that they can feel and touch their self because of the spirit realms all around inside the physical realm and they're now There's spiritual bodies and they're they're able to touch they feel joy. They feel celebration. They feel excitement and And so that's what happens very first thing happens when you step out of this body You will get it back people even if you're cremated It's okay if you do that because God knows where every single ash is every cell of your physical body He's gonna bring it back together one day and you will have it back You know when you said Well, but well, I was gonna say but I had heard that before not only from you But someone else that God knows where all the pieces are and I'm thinking I don't necessarily want the old pieces Just give me a new body. Why do I want the old pieces? Did he literally get the pieces? He can find every single bit of it and he will put it back together Wow, okay, love your body because it will young it's gonna be young Yeah, there's no age in the spirit realm. You will be young. You'll be filled with life. You'll be strong The possibilities of what you will experience just because of what you are experiencing now It's okay. He's gonna give you your body back people, but it will not be old It will not be any cap. There'll be nobody blind sick lame None of that will be in your body once you get that body back So cremated or not God God takes the pieces and puts it all back together cremation. Nothing Yeah, put it all back together Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. All right here. In fact, you kind of know this is different. I thought it might be similar Okay, Amy's asking this question when people freeze their embryos like IVM in vitro Fertilization when they freeze their embryos are there spirits? I don't know if she means souls Are there spirits frozen with them or does the spirit still live in God until it's implanted? That's the question normally it is after the conception has taken place It was it would be after conception is taken place. So I don't think the spirits in those embryos That's like the egg, right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, once it's implanted and I have no I have no opinion of my own ever about what people think I think about that. I know that when conception takes place Either from intro in how do you say that in vitro fertilization in vitro? Yeah, that conception must take place It has to so that has to they have to meet together like they would even in in the natural way and at that second At the very second that that implant takes place and there really is life right there That's when life begins. That is when your spirit body and soul is attached God can't attach it. There's nothing to attach it to. Yeah, put it in an egg He you have to have that conception take place. It's the best way easiest way I can say that and I know people Understand what I mean life begins a conception We cannot make a spirit and we cannot make a soul So our part is the the physical part and once that conception takes place Holy spirit will bring down from the father a little spirit of life Which is your spiritual body and your soul and it says it says in the Bible God said I knit you together in your mother's womb Well, he said that because he's the only one who can do it He's not talking about putting these arms and legs on people He's talking about your spirit man and your soul Being attached at that time of conception because they grow together the spirit and so grow with your body They grow and so that's when life begins. So no matter what they're trying to say through abortion It's not true. That's my people That's a baby that is a baby and that baby was sent from God and heaven It's little spirit and soul was knit together at the time of conception and from that time It grows through the different stages until it's time for it to be born It doesn't become a living human being when it's born. It already is on the inside of the mother Okay, yeah, I want to ask you probably the most controversial question. I've ever asked you I've known you for seven eight years I've never had the guts to ask this I'm gonna ask it today. So We all know the horrors of rape a woman women that get raped and out of those rapes sometimes there's conception What do you know of anything has God shown you anything about what how in the world does he then Put a spirit and soul in that Is he there's a plan of salvation kick in at that moment for for this little What what can you say if anything about that any babies any and all babies? Even if they're like a week old in the womb or something else they all go to heaven when they pass every one of them Goes to happen when they pass they're innocent. They weren't a part of that, but I will tell you why it happened Steve God makes I could call it a protocol. I don't want to call it a law There are laws of creation if you want to call it that the way it happens There's just the way it happens and God made that a Protocol he will not change or take away Because there's so many to send the way he ordered it to happen is at the time of conception No matter how the conception takes place if that is that is joined together if the eggless one is joined together That is true conception He always made it that when that happens He will send a send a spirit and a soul in an innate in a body and send that and attach it He can't take that away There'll be too many ways for the enemy to get in to prevent things or not have things happen And so that baby can still be kept and watched over it can still be raised even if he sent them as a prophet I've known quite a few people that were born because of that and the mother still wanted them born and they're in their And their destiny still happen So I know those aren't the best of circumstances Yeah, but I will tell you that when that takes place no matter how that takes place when conception takes place Life will happen and there will be that joining together when God said I knit you That means anyone who was sent by him. I knit you together in your mother's womb That means he attached that little spirit with someone at that dot of flesh that was just created by conception You know, do you know anything about the scripture where David says in sin? My mother conceived me has God shown you what that meant at all. Do you are you familiar with that scripture? Yes, he basically says it's in my mother. I don't know. Maybe perhaps she didn't know Possibly she didn't know that there was a creator or didn't do even that wasn't even her thought pattern of doing that But I'm glad David remained. Yeah. Yeah, for sure No, I knew he would become David when he sent him when he needed to gather in that mother's womb He knew who he would be when he grew up. He knew that would be David. He knew that would become King David It's amazing. Amazing. All right, Aaron asked my son is down nine But when he was young maybe two or three while in his bedroom He said he saw the spooky bats going in and out of the spooky castle I'm positive. He was seeing the spiritual world. This hasn't happened since but how can I encourage this gift? Is he a seer? I feel like he has a big calling that I don't understand and I want to make sure we don't miss it It sounds like he was seeing spooks It that that could be for many reasons. I'll take a little bit of time to explain each It could have been something that went on in that house before they bought it If they this is a thing if you buy a home as we live in form You better evict everything out that you don't want there Open your front door because of people did wicked things in that home or they operated in witchcraft in that home There are they'll be spirits that just remain they just do and so it's up to us to cleanse that home I've done it every single time. I've moved if I didn't have a brand new home that was built by me Which I haven't so we always evicted everything out in Jesus name We took communion and to cleanse the home we poured it some of it on the land outside and if anything was there it left So I would suggest to her she do that first Because if they had a place it was operated in in different ways or they watch things all the time in there There were life witchcraft or The darkness, you know all kinds of things go on in movies now Spirits are attached to those movies and you don't want that to remain either There's different reasons how that could have possibly happened and he may have seen it Sometimes when children are younger their eyes or some some of them are still open to spirit realm some or not I would certainly pray for him to lose that from his soul But I wouldn't pay attention to what he said to her if he sees more if you begin to see angels and other stuff Without her coaching him or anything I would totally write it down in the journal and share it with him when he gets older But that he saw either he was just having a bad dream Maybe somebody watched something or went somewhere and brought something back with them all these things are reality in the spirit realm You cannot go visit places that have evil in them and leave and think something's not following you Yeah Responsibility to guard our children from all that stuff and not participate in any of it because you actually are almost putting a Welcome mat out for it to come. Yeah, and so someone if someone says Don't get that house or don't go into that house. It's haunted. There's a there are ghosts in there. You're saying they're not ghosts There's what? They're familiar spirits Even not it's not that it's not a ghost is usually somebody who died and that was their spirit remaining that does not happen It could be it could be demonic It could be and but there's those those are evil spirits But a familiar spirit can look like somebody you knew once before and they will like I just spoke about Sometimes I'll hang around in different houses That was not the person who lived there before and that was your dead spirit. That is not what you're seeing There are things called the familiar spirits in the spirit realm that are dark from are from the enemy And they will try to influence people sometimes they make sounds in the night and stuff like that Open your front door. Say I evict all familiar spirits. I did all wickedness and evil anything of saying I evict you from this place In Jesus name and they will have to go. I know some people who think it's funny. I don't think it's funny. I don't think that any Partnership or of anything to do with Satan because eventually it will bring control over your life and But those things like that that people call they're not you're not haunted by a person usually They're saying the person who lived there through their spirit behind your spirit goes one or two places when you die It either goes to heaven or to hell. There is no hanging around on the earth not not for humans not for human Okay, now let's see. I lost here it is I I came across a piece of paper when I was preparing for this the other day and this is from last year almost over a year ago and So so I thought well, I better ask her question and here's the question is Proverbs 31 This is Francis Hansen is Proverbs 31 a real woman It's almost seems like Proverbs 31 is an unobtainable goal for women. She's what it what what were your thoughts? I would say it's not unattainable or he wouldn't put it in the word Okay, it is not unattainable. It's what it's really about what your heart desires for him Are you spending time with him? Meaning Jesus Christ? Are you running after what he has what he says? Are you hungry for his word yourself? Only the enemy would be telling you that is unattainable The truth is what's put in the word and talks about it could have been somebody who was alive at that time and they Operated like that. They operated in holiness. They love people. They help people They they really wanted to know the Lord at that time. I can just tell you I know people who live that way and That is not unattainable. It's not We live holy if he says in his word be holy as I am holy He's saying you can become that that's guess what that means. You don't sin Well, you know, if I can say because my wife and I've talked about the Proverbs 31 This is not our question or this is Francis but I remember going over this years ago and and You know, it is true that this woman Proverbs 31 rises up early before everyone else Fixes the food makes this thing then she's in business Then at the during the day and she runs the business affairs It seems and then she's back to fixing the food and I think there's some people that says I don't have enough energy in my life to ever have to be like that And I I kind of think that's what they're talking about. They're talking about becoming that woman I think you could have that kind of energy if you ask for it. Okay, you have not because you asked not people think For whatever reason they think I can ask for my rent to be paid I have food on the table. We're safe and protected. You can go beyond that. You You can ask for strength for energy You can ask for for for more of God of him You can ask him that and I can tell you I begin to learn how to ask and I didn't hesitate to ask if there's something I desired or wanted that would help what I'm doing for him But but that is not unattainable. It is not Thing is this Basically, he was saying she had integrity in her life. Well, she said she would do she did it And this is really the truth. Well, she said she would do she would do it She put her hands to something she finished it She didn't abandon it and that that has in someone who is a believer that goes a long way With the father that you're showing him I'm serious about representing the body of Christ. I'm representing Christ on this earth I represent heaven on this earth you need to have integrity in your life And if you if it's getting hard you ask God to send help you can say father Some me help to do this or have sent me to someone that can explain how to do it better There's all kinds of things you can ask him, but don't reject the whole thing And having integrity it goes a long way not just with God But with people watching your own life that if you promise to do something you do it Can I ask you a question about that about asking thing because you're you hit on something that's really intriguing to me And I practice I play with it I experiment with it and I and I have said to dream my wife If you knew the things that I asked for and the things that I prayed for Yeah, you just wouldn't leave because sometimes I'll just I'll go into I want I want my memory to be like this and I'll do I'll Describe Bible characters and I'll describe people with you know Photographic memories and I want it to be this plus this plus this now And I I feel like in different areas and I'm just talking about many many different areas I pray I feel like at this stage in my life at 67 I'm just beginning to see some of the prayers. I've been praying for different things Happen. I mean, are we literally leaving on the table? Prayers that we if we only prayed them God would do for us in our have you seen anything ridiculously crazy that some we prayed for and God just did I Think it depends on the timing is everything with God, although he doesn't go by time itself Timing is everything in our lives. Where have we gotten? What level are we at? Are we pursuing him do can if he gives us stuff will it make it squander on ourself it gives us wealth And we're not ready to handle it. Well, make us lose everything we have because we begin to have greed for that God is not against giving people wealth at all But what would you do with it if you know that that matters to him very much? He doesn't want you to lose where you already have with him because you're you're tempted now by wealth and some people are I happen to know that I will have great wealth because I'm already using mine to help people I'm already doing that and my goal is to be able to help people with things that they never could have or do That is my heart. I love people so much. My dad did that I my dad was a great example of taking stuff We hadn't owned that we needed we gave away because we love people so much So what are your plans? And I think that means so much to God if you gave you this What would you do with it? No matter what it is you're asking for what would that do? For you or how would that better help you do what he's assigned you to do? I was born with a photographic memory. That wasn't something he reached in and put it was already in me I already have a great memory and It does help in everything that I'm doing because I remember every time I've been taken to heaven and forget any of it Wow every time. Yes Wow, but I'd love to have that. I love that. Okay, so yeah, so you would encourage people to pray Bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger prayers, but maybe but Lord, you know the timing Lord You know when you know how that's not my business to know I would say make sure you consider What would you do with it? Yeah, or any God he obviously can give whatever he he wants to give you can give it But what would you do with that? Yeah? More important to God and I'd write down something if you wanted something that much I'd write it down father really would desire to have this This is what I would use it for This is why I would want you to give it to me This is how it could better help the the kingdom operate or you can use me in the kingdom better If I had this that would mean more to him than you just saying I want this Well, right, and I guess in my mind that was implied, but I hear I see what you're saying state You're saying come right out and tell the lawyer. This is Yeah, and hold yourself to the fire because he will you know Oh, yes, you're right. So Okay, this I'm gonna read to because this lady She's waited for a year and a half. So I'm gonna ask a second one from her It says we do communion daily from obedience, but as we participate Meaning in the flesh. She's saying in the physical is what she's saying. Is there anything actually happening in the spirit? I'm thinking maybe the lightning power of God would be released or something similar but she's wanting to know what actually happens in the spirit realm and And if you're if you're sincere about it does something happen in the spirit realm every time you Drink eat this bread and drink this cup, you know I do know this to the father that is a holy act and it is a holy thing To remember the death of Christ It really is and I think it should be in the heart of every believer to do that at least somehow on a consistent basis I do know that sometimes when you take it healing can come Um faster By taking that cup and it's even taking the cup represents healing It's one of the things he gives us or that happens. So a lot of times healing happens when you're taking communion Things are brought down from heaven and put on the inside of you when you're taking communion It definitely things happen in the spirit realm The enemy is you sometimes who's been bombarding you a lot and you take communion over that and say Uh, I recognize your blood and your body being broken for me that I can be free And I'm declaring that I will be free from these attacks of the enemy. You would be shocked at how quickly that was taken from you It's what are you taking it for just like I was saying before he watches the heart to see Why is this important to you? What are you thinking this represents? It represents all that his blood does for you all that sacrifice and all the stuff that he's laid down in his own life To so that you can have more of him You can understand him better have more of his More of his presence around you and I also know this it literally will evict every single thing off your property That does not belong there no longer No, no matter how it remained I already mentioned that to take communion if you're having things going on in your house It's not you open the door evict the enemy go outside take communion and say this is your holy communion Representing your blood and your body and I pour it on the land to redeem the land And this property to be used for the kingdom because I will no longer tolerate the enemy's presence And I promise you hosts from heaven will come down and they'll rip everything off of there and evict it because you did that You know I this makes me think of a question that's been happening in the last year or so that I'm because all my life because I was raised in the church. Although it was illegalistic in the first half or third of my life, but I've always said the name of Jesus in the name everything was in the name of Jesus We always we never forgot to say in Jesus name or the name of Jesus, but later in this part of my life. I'm tuning into How much incredible love the father has for his son And the name of Jesus wasn't just saying the words, but it was like what he did on the cross and oh my goodness The love that this father has for the son So when I say and I pray this in the name of your precious precious son now My heart is filling up as I say that is that a more effective prayer with the Lord, especially when it's from the heart I would say anything that adores the Lord is powerful in the spirit Anything that recognizes his authority His right to rule is very powerful in the spirit and I do encourage people to do that It's not you're not saying just a rote thing like that's like written in a book You're not just reading that it has to come from your heart and your soul when you say that And you are recognizing his authority his dominion He trashed hell on his own Crushed the enemy took back the keys to hell death in the grave And opened it and made it possible for those who believe in Christ to go to heaven And no longer have to go into Abraham's bosom or paradise so many things happen that was crucifixion We haven't really talked a whole lot about that But absolutely yes, the more you honor it the way you honor it It totally is going to uh, it totally is going to affect the father And I mean in from the father's perspective two people can be praying Uh seriously one person says in the jesus name the other person says in jesus name One of them may have That love for the father that only the father would know no one else could see that looking upon right And he would he would see a different kind of a prayer and you know, they both sounded that's that's fascinating because To me it gives me motivation to Tap into what it is that i'm saying. Why am I saying it in jesus name? So All right, uh, do the prophet jenny asked do the prophets in heaven listen to what his god is telling his prophets right now For example, does isiah listen to amanda grace? And already we can say johnny or any of those or hank or whatever or and try to decipher the Okay, so let me read for example does isiah listen to Amanda grace or other prophets and try to decipher the riddles From the word she receives i guess i guess she's asking if prophets in heaven are trying to decipher riddles To me it would seem like there wouldn't be a riddle in heaven anymore But anyway, what i don't think there would be a riddle in heaven I think they would have full understanding of what was being said And by the way, they do watch they do watch they watch us they watch meetings in different places Uh, if you were a member of a certain church, you probably would still watch to see what's going on and just declare over people still there There's many different reasons for watching Either prophets or pastors or people like that, but they they are being watched by those in heaven. They certainly are Yeah Okay, um, let me see this one. Uh, uh, I didn't read it fully. So i'm just going to read it live Nancy asks scripture tells us over and over to watch Be alert for the lord's return. How do I obey those commands? When i know the lord is not returning as in the imminent rapture Any time soon. I think it is in part. She's saying a misapplication of these scriptures that prompt so many People to constantly it seems referred to waiting for the lord's coming I'm not quite sure of the question there, but maybe you can get my favorite scripture explains all of it It says, uh, um, jesus christ Occupy until I return Um, occupy is taken dominion taken authority over all the gardens. Is you ruling as a king and priest? Before him on the earth and they don't want anything to end too soon They they know christ doesn't know the day, but the father knows the very day that christ will come back But until that time you're not supposed to be sitting somewhere just talking about that It said clearly occupy which means take authority that means you're actively taking authority over the darkness That means you're actively operating with you with With all the power that christ gave you on the earth. That's what we're supposed to be doing We're not trying to always look like we're going to escape And I say it because I know some people are looking at it right now. Let's all just escape. We'll be gone. It'll be over No, you're leaving out the best half of what still has to happen on this earth It's a testimony of the of the sacrifice of jesus christ by us operating In authority like he did the things I did christ said you will do also and greater things in those you will do So we haven't done those greater things some people. I've even done the first things And and he's not taking anybody off this earth in a rapture until that has happened That's why you have to have understanding of the spirit realm how to operate in that what your authority is How to use your authority how to operate with your dominion the weapons of warfare he gave you That's why so much of that kind of thing comes out of me He wants them to know how to do that because we will demonstrate and manifest the power of the living god To this earth that there is a god That's the whole point of it Is a god and that the darkness does not rule the darkness does not have more power Than a believer does and that's why you hear that from me from hang from johnny I can go down this long list. Yeah why they talk so much about that That's what you're supposed to be doing and people just want to sit on the rapture of praying every moment. He's going to come And yet you're asking christ forget all the things you're supposed to have demonstrated on your behalf Forget all those things that the body of christ will be doing one day to demonstrate who you are in this world That's what you're saying when you say all you want to do is escape If you happen it will happen one day But I still think the greatest proof of what you do is when he said He's not coming at this time. It will happen at a time. But until then Occupy which is in an authority until I return. So that's what we're supposed to be doing That's what we are trying to show people to do You're not supposed to be running in hiding. It doesn't say hide in the hills. It doesn't say that these are not the perilous times They're not anything like the perilous times And you know, we were I was always taught that word to occupy. I meant stay there stay put never meant But I was not taught that we're occupying force. So an example of that is Yeah, when when the world war two when we took over japan, we had to Occupy that land for a season and believe me. We were in charge We told the leaders of japan. You can do this. You cannot do that. We we were in charge We were occupying force. And so god's saying occupy as a force Where where you're in charge even to see even satan wants that that's what satan's going to do right now He's trying to occupy People who don't want to be occupied people who don't want him don't need him. They're already set with god They already know what the purpose is in this world and since we know that there's no way that's going to be taken away from this by some squany Want to be leader from anywhere from hell. That's just not going to happen And therefore that's why this is going to be such a crush It's going to be crushing to the darkness because we still have to do those things that christ talked about He wants to see us do the greater works the greater works is raising from someone from the dead that was just That's a greater work. I say well, we have to be at least raising the dead Okay, we have to be doing these things because christ said these things i did You will do also and greater works you will do He wants those greater works seen operating around this world because we belong to him And that won't happen for everybody's just with out of here And I will say this for him. He said please tell them that I said the rapture will not be a rescue party The rapture will be a celebration of glory. That's good. That's good. That's good. In other words, you say these words You say these words the rapture will not be a rescue party. It will be a celebration of glory Good because we're operating like him to the point where he can't bear to be without as well in other words by the time He has the celebration. It's a celebration event We were already celebrating on the earth. He just came and got us and the celebration Amplified is kind of what I'm hearing you say Yes Okay, okay. Good. Good. Good. All right. Hannah is asking god is three part being father son Holy spirit and we are three apart being body soul and spirit But did jesus have his did jesus have his own body soul and spirit While on earth i'm not quite sure why they're asking this question And if he was god in the flesh did the other members of the trinity make up his spirit and soul well That's complex. I don't know. I guess they're trying to figure out the god head Within jesus the father's to me. I am in him We are in each other. I think that may be what she's trying to figure out. What did we made up? What was he made up of? I could certainly tell you that when christ was on the earth He had to be willing to have a body There would be no reason for christ to come as christ. He was the word That's who he was he worked with the father. They made everything the father would say what he wanted the word would step out and make it That's how that worked. That's why christ made everything. There was it was ever made The word was to say the word was with god and was god Right the word became flesh. It even says that that means he got a flesh body so he could rule in this world Indominion in authority. Okay He had to have flesh on him so that he could live holy Give this the permanent a sacrifice of him dying for us and then the fact that in his spiritual body He wasted hell. He wasted it He melted the faces of hierarchy of hell took the keys of hell death in the grave away. He knew that was a plan It was finished for salvation on the cross But he still had to descend to take back our authority that god gave adam that adam gave to the enemy There was all this reason why it all had to happen But I can tell you for sure that was jesus christ Okay, who had a flesh body born from the womb of a woman the holy spirit over overshadow mary's mary's womb and holy spirit planted Christ who had to become a seed the word had to become a seed And that was brought down from heaven by the holy spirit overshadowed mary planted that in her womb That happened to no one else ever on in all of time That's the only time that happened because he was the son of god And mary couldn't have that happen from a man. So it had to be planted in her womb and christ was planted Okay, the word was planted. He had flesh on him because of that He had to have the flesh to give us authority in the world and because adam was flesh and he gave him the authority And then he gave it away christ had to come in the flesh and that was his own soul and his own spiritual being He was all spirit. He already had a soul He had to be willing to be made into a seed by the father and then brought down and planted in mary's womb That's how it happened. That's why it's called an actulate conception It was done by holy spirit and sent by the father and then he grew up. He was born He had a body that was a real bus body. He had to have blood in his body or there couldn't be a sacrifice All this is boots and revelation that was given to me So i've always known that christ was always had a i have to say the word always had a spiritual body And even though he has a flesh body, he still can step inside the father Holy spirit can still step inside the father. It can still be the three in one even though he has his glorified flesh Yeah, it's just a it's a phenomenon. I you know, I used to read those scriptures about I think it's either john 14 or 17 where he says you and me and i and you and And us and them and he's talking about that thing and I always thought it just was like a it was like poetry We're so united that's like urin s and we're that he wasn't talking poetry wasn't he was talking about reality Talking reality. That's crazy because it's a crazy reality who but since you told the story where jesus stepped inside of you When you got saved that's the first time I realized. Are you kidding? I know the holy spirit comes to live with us But I didn't realize that it was literal that jesus steps inside you It's literal because he has unlimited Layers of himself the father has unlimited layers. Holy spirit has unlimited layers. That's how he can be everywhere all at the same time That's why holy spirit can do that when you invite holy spiritual and value as a believer He sends a whole layer of himself in you and it literally lives in you and he will guide you He will protect you. He's not just walking alongside. He actually comes inside When you does Cat when you pray to the lord and let's say you're talking to jesus now You're a seer and you've been there, but he's living literally in here So when you're praying to jesus, are you praying to what you see? Are you praying to who you know up there because you've been there or are you praying knowing? He's right inside you. So you're literally talking to him inside you. What is the fuel? When he comes in person to see me, it's not the him. He's still in me. He's still in there And so it's holy spirit. He comes on assignment Uh to personally talk to me because when he leaves from that encounter, he leaves and goes back to heaven When the father comes he'll walk through the wall He'll come wherever he wants to say something to me and he comes in person And I see him face to face because I am a seer I see the fire blazing in his eyes with love for all of us I I see I can feel the power and I see that rainbow coming in and out of him in waves You can actually see the little spirits and souls of all of living in him riding on those. Oh you oh, you're seeing those That's amazing. Wait. Yeah. I mean, I figured it was good enough amazing enough to see him But while you're seeing him you're seeing the spirits that he still has with him. Yes. Wow Wow, wow Jesse saw him and Jesse was caught up He was caught up in the flush his whole body was taken to heaven And he began to get weak and they had to give him this copper colored fruit And that would give you energy because you were there in the flesh and that body physical body wasn't prepared to be In that atmosphere for very long it would begin to affect you I don't ever have that because I'm taking in my spirit. I'm taking out of my body My spirit is taken to heaven by holy spirit by the Lord To be shown things on purpose. But when they come here, it's them coming They come they share the Savior they want to and then they leave that doesn't take away Christ living in me That doesn't take away Holy Spirit. Yeah, it's hard to grasp that because he is him. Yeah. Yeah here. God. So you can be This is interesting cat because I read you something from the year and a half ago where they want to know When you do come in and hear what happens there Here's the one that's from right away right now And this is cat being a seer tell us what what what she sees what you see when a person This water baptized can she can she tell? As well what is happening there in the heavenly realm at the exact same time is something happening in there or Are they just watching I don't know what fully with the question There's always something happening when you do something that's a greater commitment to Christ Always something is recorded in heaven. It's recorded from heaven It's also written down in your book that he's writing that the father's writing continue writing your book He wrote every day of your life before you were born But he adds continually to that book with the things you choose to do yourself There's also books of commitment There's so many books the father has a whole library of his books that he's written in And of course there's something very powerful when you get born again But even the water baptism thing is representing us dying with Christ and then rising again That that is something that will happen in the future eventually But that does actually represent that it gives you a closer commitment to Christ. I was four Um, I was four when I got born again, but I was 18 when I was actually water baptized And I felt a greater uh impartation from really When I when I went under that water and came back up I was overwhelmed by the presence of the Lord at that time because he was there That's amazing, you know, because again as your testimony That is true is that you felt and saw and felt Jesus step inside of you and yet years later You get water baptized and you feel a greater power and annoying. Yeah, that's amazing Go ahead. Don't leave me alone So Generally saying you need to explain that you need to explain the scripture Okay, Jesus said father me and you and you and me. I pray that one day They will also be that way Okay I pray that what happens then because when you go to heaven if it never happened before you can totally step into the father Holy spirit will step into the father. Jesus will step into the father and you will be one He will not have said those words. I pray that they be one even as we are one Inside of each other you actually can do that in heaven When you have died and moved to heaven Well, uh, yes, but to clarify then but didn't you say there's a certain amount of that? You just said of course that he will step inside of you now and So maybe you can clarify what happens in heaven When that has already happened to some degree here on earth. He steps inside of you. So how is it just more? When you're born again Well, I don't know when yeah when you're born again. He stepped inside of you. You said Jesus So what so when you when it says that and the word that he's right So when you go to heaven And he steps inside of you. What's the difference between that and the earth thing that happened? I guess I think that that that is the very first time he was stepping inside of you at your invitation And your invitation to receive him as your savior you're receiving him as your savior And and he does when you say that father. I'm not father. You say uh to the lord I receive you as my savior. I repent of all my sins ever committed right now I don't I don't want that in my soul right now. I'm asking for you To indwell me the bible says he indwells you it says that and he does step inside of you And you sometimes he will say things to you and that's still small voice you hear sometimes is him Yeah, and yeah, I guess I've always wondered how do you tell the difference between him and the holy spirit talking to you? I mean, you probably know because you know their voices more, but I think I think it depends on how long you've been listening Because I can tell the difference. Yeah Yeah, right now I get an impression. I see a picture. It's all like thank you. Holy spirit kind of or I'll just say Thank you Jesus, which it means all the above. I guess it's the lord, you know, uh, let's see, uh, Okay, this must have been some something you said the last show You said you pray once and then you keep thanking him So send the uh, that's an interesting send the uh, I guess I'm a bit confused I heard that if you have to pray more than once that it has not been in faith Are we to continually pray over and over the same prayer for unsaved loved ones? I think that uh asking for things from the lord Not necessarily the salvation thing. Uh, I would tell people. Yes, you should not stop praying for them You don't have to pray every day every night, but I would totally say uh to to make sure that you're just saying, you know It's a declaration you're making. Yeah You're making a declaration and it says what you dare to declare and decree it shall be establishing to you So if you're declaring that you know that your love them will know christ That they will receive christ and they will be with you in eternity Which is one of the most important things you can say in your whole life for your family members That is surely going to happen. He will pursue them So that that will happen and so I have to say it depends on what you're saying and what are you asking Yeah, your family member to be saved is different than saying. I need this. I would like to have this I would love to go there. There's different reasons and different type of prayers that you pray Of course, the most important one would you be stand in in that place? It says stand there for when you should stand there for and don't step back about your family members knowing him Uh, he is going to do everything he can in possibility And there's a woman that I that I've been friends for years and years and she said her testimony is Years and years ago She prayed for her mother to be saved as far as she kind of presented it as if she prayed once and that was it From that point on she said thank you lord that my mother is saying to that you're gonna say And that's kind of a variation on a theme right that works the same way Right, that's whatever your soul is whatever strengthens your soul more If I ask for something which is rare, but if I do I just I personally just thank him after that Okay. Yeah, that's Thank you for blessing me for this Thank you for helping in this that what I'm seeking after I I'd like to thank him and I think a lot of people don't think I think they should I remember Lord came to me a long time ago and said it would be wonderful If my people were more grateful. Yeah Yeah Well, it's a it's to me. It seems like it's a higher level prayer because to pray and pray and pray and pray For this is lovely to get saved for 20 years where this person's prayed at once and thanked him For 10 years. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you 10 years later because god without faith It's impossible to please god and right gratitude is okay that I mean that's a higher it seems like it's a higher level But I think you will take either one One Does show that your faith is grown If you can just ask that one time and your faith is there to believe for it and then thank him after that I think that's probably how most of the people I know that's how I do it But it depends completely where you're at what level you're at as a as a Christian and a believer They may for a while feel like they have to Keep saying something is better than not saying anything or not even asking at all So it depends on the level of the person who's doing that But it's certainly blessed the lord when you say it enough to and believe this is going to happen because I'm trusting him for this to happen and then thank him for Awesome now linda's asking how do how do you pray for people? Who are hateful and evil and she says in a meaningful way what she's saying is how can I meaningfully pray for someone who is just Full of hatred and evil. That's what she's saying. I guess she's wanting to know how to pray I think you do that as an act of your will and not from your emotions Your soul has three parts your mind when you think about Your will what you choose to do and your emotions that display what's going on on the inside of you I think you can totally even though you somebody despises you they abused you a lot You don't do that as an act of your emotions. It's not an emotional thing It's a statement made by your will and you say I choose to my will to forgive this person Then god will actually act like you forget them But you cannot keep bringing up the thing that they're doing. I think that's more important than saying You know, how do I do that? But your will your will is the strongest part of you and your will can actually override your mind What you're thinking that can override your emotions what you're experiencing in your feelings Your will is what really matters because that's what really moves thing is your will Kat the We've talked a number of times about abuse and there's innumerable viewers that are watching right now who are abused by a parent one or more both one or both um, I was one of those um A lot of those parents that did the abusing have died. Some went to heaven. Some we don't know. They may not have made it So there's these wounded souls left behind Who have not figured out or been able to forgive The parent now the parents gone they may or may not be in heaven How does that person forgive in a way that heals their soul when It ended badly. There were never good words. They were abusive It's going to be the way the father showed it happened. It is using the keys to the kingdom It's losing every unkind hateful abusive Word or action ever done to you by that person and you say I lose that in jesus name and jesus comes down It says he restores our soul. He will literally come down and pull that out of you He'll pull it out And that is the number one way to do that and then you don't have those thoughts can't keep returning to you about that The ending is going to give you those thoughts every day if it's still in you If it's in you he's going to mess with you if you don't want him to then you have to get that out of your soul And when you lose stuff from your soul, it's gone. It doesn't return It's gone Then you bind the things of god and I choose instead to bind the love of god the life of god His plans his will his way into my life that I will keep And guess what you're going to think about Not the abuse you're going to think about the love of god the life of god And then you will be totally free from all those thoughts of that. You know, no matter how long it happened It will be gone okay, is it fair to say or Accurate to say that even with this what you just said There would be some people that got their soul was so damaged that it will tend to be a little bit more of a process than an event They'll end up having to do that a few times In other words, because they haven't figured out You may have to do it a few times any time it begins to rise up. You say no satan. I'm not taking that back I have loosed it from my soul It is not coming back in Jesus name and some people have to because they the experience it was so long But there will come a point where you say that that is gone and it will not come back But I have prayed with people who went through three marriages of horrible abuse And I had just been shown this by the father and I went to new new I don't know where it was New Jersey Genu I went to New Jersey and I was invited by a pastor and his wife to speak in New Jersey I went back many times by the way and he went in the store to get milk or something Milk or something and those few minutes his wife turned to me. She said I don't know why I know this But you're here to set me free Should I've been abused in three marriages and I still have nightmares of the torment? What do I do? And I said I can show you in three minutes if you're really going to mean this you said I will mean it What do I do? I said you choose You choose to use the keys to the kingdom and you're going to choose in the name of Christ to lose all of the abuse You can name the people I use I lose the abuse from and said the man's name The other abuse from this person the other abuse. I will not keep any of those thoughts any of those feelings in his motion I lose them all in Jesus name right now And a minute later Steve she turned to me in the car and said I am so free I It's gone. It's gone. I I can't even try to bring it up. It's gone. It's gone. I'm a new person And she just grabbed me and how we should I don't know what to say I said this is what the keys of the kingdom were always meant for You can lose the bad stuff and the evil and the abuse and the harsh words and the critical unjust judgment lose it Lose it and then you say and I did say after you've done that I said let's bind the joy of the lord I actually say let's bind the joy of the lord you choose to bind the joy of the lord his love in his life And it was that one minute later. She her face had light in it because she was so crushed with life itself And she married a pastor wanting to be free. She said but even though I've been married a few months It's still it's still there. So that's because you have to get it out You have to choose to get that out and I went over the period of seven more years and it never came back And not only her but her 16 year old son or 17 year old son at the end of my meetings Brought them up front. She said they want to do the same thing because they see that I'm so changed They did the same thing They lost all the abuse the words of abuse the actions of abuse by those by those men Loosed them all from their soul and they bound the joy the lord and the love of god And they were jumping up and down and they said it's gone. It's gone. I She she when I come back two years later the the woman said it's never come back to me It has never come back to my son You know that I mean I wish there was a magic bullet where we could teach this to the entire body of christ because It's so powerful. I mean I've used loose from my soul A whole lot of times with this because I've been in process Um, you know, maybe some of it was from abuse, but by the time I met you most of that abuse was healed Uh, but it took me decades cat when maybe it could have taken me minutes Because I didn't know this because it's fairly new teaching but and when the father came to me And I was actually in my room when he came to me He said what am I about to train you and it will change the way the body of christ lives He said in these days. I don't have six months. I don't have a year for them to get whole I don't have that time. I need them to be active and I need them to be free He says so I'm about to show you how to use the keys to the kingdom Uh in with revelation and that's what I'm going to show you he said and with these keys with this revelation You can lose wishcraft from your soul All abuse any satanism anything you've done concerned the darkness words that were spoken actions that were done even as a child Things you saw happen like trauma and all this violence stuff He said you they can lose it in minutes. That's what he said in minutes Oh, man, they lose it my son's name. He will come and pull it out of them But then they need to find love and life and things about whatever they choose You know god's love price love his life his joy his celebration and he said and that Can never be taken up by anybody And he said if it's a hard time, it's been a really hard time in a long time They may have to repeat that because the enemy will try to bring it back It's gone at that moment because he took it out But he will try to represent that by giving someone a dream or a nightmare and you I would tell them Why would you I'd sit up saying I'm not taking that I refuse to take it because he wants you trapped He wants you to be controlled But this is exactly what the father told me and that was the first time I actually got to use it outside of my own life So I'm gonna bash you somewhere. I don't know they bashed me. I turned around from them and went I lose every wicked I'm kind word spoken to me right now and by the love of god. I turned around at that moment. How are you doing? It was gone. It was gone. I had to prove that myself Me and Margaret used to do it all the time and Margaret is the one who realized you can do it as a as a lifestyle She said well, I did it four times this week. I went. Are you kidding? Really a one-time thing she goes. Oh, no, we're supposed to be doing this and the Holy Spirit said she's right You're supposed to be doing it as a lifestyle because satan and wicked man will present themselves to you all the time And that's how you handle it. You get it out of your soul So if you're going through the grocery store and someone Decides they don't like you and says something mean Maybe you're not wearing the mask that they're wearing and they're they're mean to your faith You might have to go outside and lose that from your soul or lose those I would do that or just turn right around in front of them I wanted them to know I was free and I sometimes did it on purpose to show them. I am free It's gone. They wouldn't have heard me say that And they're like, what are you doing? I went being free You mean right there you would just lose it from your soul in front to their face Are you saying I would why they didn't mind giving it to my face That's hilarious The fight is in the story of our souls and if we know how to use the keys to the kingdom I can do it every time Wow I live that way That's why I could easily forgive those two people who made a blog to bless me I sincerely could really forgive them because I had been living that kind of lifestyle I keep nothing in here that is not god That's good. That's good. Ken. Well, I don't want to hit any other subject because I want people to end on this one Pat would you just pray for the people especially in that vein what you were just teaching anything that Anything else the lord would give you so Yes, and any in any walk of life no matter who you are how old you are You probably have experienced some kind of trauma or unjust judgment Spoken over you criticism harsh criticism Even witchcraft spoken over you. You don't have to keep any of that in you The keys of the kingdom were created for us to be free And so I will just pray this is what you would pray I choose as an act of my will To lose from my soul and sometimes I lead whole congregations Any witchcraft any wicked thoughts any actions any trauma any violence Anything I watched that I had not wanted to see any anything my eyes saw that they shouldn't have seen Any perversion I lose it all if somebody practice that in my home I'm not keeping that in my soul if I heard it. I lose all of it in Jesus name And it's going to go right now And then I make people wait because I have to see christ come down and you pulls are them Sometimes it looks like gray matter. Sometimes it looks like really And and then when they're done with that I'll say okay now We're going to bind the things of God and then once you have done that it doesn't matter what it is It could be perversion you watched online It could be things that you read books you read about witchcraft Any of those things you can lose all that you have to name what it is and lose it from your soul So that it would be taken out and then you say I choose with my will to bind The life of christ his joy his celebration His validation His plans for my life those I bind to my soul And Jesus name and then he will actually come down and walk down and put them in your soul And that is what you'll think about every day. That is what you will repeat every day because it's in your soul If you find out you're just sad, I want to tell you sadness is a is also one of the enemy's greatest plans He can make you sad over nothing. You don't even know what you're sad Lose the sadness if you if someone has passed away lose the grief Retain the memory and the love you have been the but loose all the grief especially if they Did abuse you you want to lose all that from your soul? You don't want to keep it But it doesn't matter what it is if it blows the enemy if it was plans the enemy to control you To harm you to crush you to steal your joy your destiny I mean the enemy tries to do that. He'll make you sad if you don't get it out It'll go to a oppression and then depression and then it can keep going further And you don't even know why you're having those experiences is being put in there by an enemy you Get it out Cat is that the same thing or does it accomplish the same thing? Because we weren't talking about deliverance But do some people lose from their soul and all of a sudden they've had deliverance from the demonic Is that well actually the father said it would accelerate the one thing he said to me is it will accelerate deliverance Okay I was a woman and she had had witchcraft spoken over her and they had uh in her family and they had books She said a red book one never never received it. She said but something's controlling me She said this after meeting it was like out west somewhere and and nobody was around. I said, you know what loose that book Loose the book if you remember the name of the book loose it because if you saw what it still went in your soul So first get rid of that so she got rid of that I said now you're going to evict you're going to loosen your soul the witchcraft trying to operate with you Up with you gonna lose it and she got to the words. I loose and tried to say it She couldn't even say she said something is choking me and my goodness Tell you the reality of the stuff and I said I put my hand here not hard And I said I want you to shout Jesus Christ after I say I choose to lose And you say I I choose I choose Jesus Christ I choose Jesus Christ as soon as you say that you say I lose witchcraft And she did she said I choose Jesus Christ and all of a sudden she goes I lose witchcraft And she said I felt it leave me I am free. I am so free. Thank you for helping me. Thank you for helping me And so in caught the father who told me you can lose those things that are trying to control you Uh, if you still do it in Jesus name, I've had people who were thinner These girls wanted to commit suicide because their boyfriend dumped them That's a serious thing and all I could think about was suicide suicide. So my one sister called me and said well I know they're not believers, but what will happen? I said, let me call them And I told him I said you're about to do something in the name of Jesus Christ You have to be willing to use his name if you want to be free and she goes I'll use his name I'll use his name. So what she's doing is reaching out to christ As her deliverer. That's what she was doing And so she said I I received christ I'm going to speak in his name should I choose with my will to lose suicidal thoughts And deep breath over and she said the guy's name I lose it now in Jesus name and then she stands for a minute and light came from her face And she said I'm so grateful to have Jesus Christ in my life now because you remember she had to receive it Should I have him in my life? I have no thoughts of suicide. There is no grief. Nothing. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone She said I'm going to follow him for the rest of my life and this was someone my sister just met on the street And and she looked like she was in really really not a good way. So guess what She's Jesus name It's like when people quiet up for healing you remember in the word when he said they asked him to be their healer He said that was the same as asking me to be their savior And he said not only to the people not only are you not only are you healed but your sins are forgiven Yeah So if you find someone in turmoil Tell them to do that. Tell them they have to choose Christ He is the deliverer and the restorer of our soul and no one else can do that for them You may go through a course for six weeks, but but is that going to get rid of that or is it going to make you feel better? Yeah, I mean it makes me think of I've had Um, oh, this is not anything recent or anything, but the some deliverance ministries They'll take you through hours and hours of stuff and it's complex and it's helpful and they name it They name the demons and they they cast a matter or whatever But what I'm sensing from you is you can get the same place. He took someone else four to eight hours to do That's right in in minutes if you know, it's not like there's It's not like what they're doing is wrong. It's just more like but it's not right at the same time if you can do it this way Is is it's for the kingdom age is for us operating in freedom and that you have to be free from the enemy Are free from things that crush you and take your life away from you It is really that simple and like I said, you may have to do it more than once if you've been if that's been happening a long time Yeah, it will it will it will have to leave you it will have to leave you and the same thing cat if someone is Again, I'm not asking for myself. Although there were times I used to have this but if someone Said I've done everything I can I can't forgive this person. I can't forgive my father. I can't get forgive my mother Do they do that? Do they say I lose unforgiveness for my soul? Is that what they could absolutely lose the Unforgiveness from their soul you can lose unforgiveness You can lose a fence from your soul any of those things that that be set us to hold us back You absolutely can lose all or any of those things from your soul Really the reason why you're doing it and experiencing it is because it's in there You know if someone's having an issue whether it's rage or anger or they're just they can't have any control of themselves It's always always a soul issue. It is always what's in your soul Awesome. Well, cat. Thank you so much. Um, hey quick. Tell people about your two websites and how they can get a hospitalist tell me to say one more thing Okay Okay, let them know that because they are the guardian over their soul of their children or the watcher over their soul Whether you adopted them or they are your own If someone's been bullied at school or maybe they were showing something They don't want to see and they keep seeing the images You can lay your hand on their head and you say as the watcher over their soul I choose with my will to lose from my child's soul All of the unjust criticism the cruelty the lies the abuse I lose it now the bullying I lose it from the soul in Jesus name and Jesus will come down and take the out of your child's soul And then I choose to bind the love of God the life of God to their soul and I have heard from parents That said it was gone when they prayed that over their children Well, and you could do that if there sound asleep, right? Didn't you say that one? You can do it while they're asleep It's what you're saying that you're believing for them and that means even children who were in an abusive situation and adopted Some of those things will hang around with those children if it just has been proven And so cash or try to help them but the help they need is for Christ to restore their soul So you as a parent have the right to pray that over any of your children's soul Those who you take care of like a child if you have adopted them And I was called down to Orlando to a teen center And I taught this to every worker in the center that probably was about 80 of them And they were crying after I was done because they said when he used to sit here with its drugs or its abuse We have to work a whole year just to gain their trust just to help them get rid of what they're experiencing inside We will be able to do it immediately And then that whole year can be spent So let me know Christ to learn how to operate with Christ and and they I heard from them since and they said is Spend the game changer for that whole place in Orlando that's been around for years They now lose all that stuff from their souls So good so good. Wow. I'm glad you added that part too. Okay. Go ahead and talk about your two websites now that Thank you for adding that stuff too. Yeah, I have a revealing heaven calm, which is the name of my book That's my main website where you can get products you can find out events from there I think there's testimonies on there. We're about to upgrade that one and also cat her calm That's k a t k e r r.com It's where you can get a lot of revelation given there's um tutorials on there teaching you some of the stuff I've been sharing say how to do that There's also a gallery that shows some of the things in the spirit world that they actually look like some in heaven some around the world And it's the only place you can give to me online I do not ask people to give to other people or the organizations because people are out there trying to cheat you Prove you that it's me saying this is a good thing. Give to it. I'm not going to do that If I was going to ask you that I'd tell you in person or write you maybe a personal letter or something But I'm not ever going to ask you to to give to them Okay, because that's your own personal decision if you want to give to somebody But if they're saying that's me saying that it is a lie It is not true. So don't believe anybody who sends you stuff like that They'll take my pictures and make a fake facebook or a fake youtube and they try to do it all the time But the stuff I say on my own is where truth is If i'm if i'm interviewed by people from my own website That is truth the truth makes you free Not lies and deception and I pray that you are free today and you can operate with christ in this day To give powerful things for him to be great for him In jesus name Amen, amen cat. Thank you so much. We love you. Love your team and I say give our regards to being he tells us a dad joke every now and then he comes on He's great. We're gonna have fun in israel Um in april.

You're helping us do go ahead and run that Giving a cup of cold water is a simple way to show someone they are valued That you care about them When Jesus talks about this Maybe what was trying to say if someone cares enough to stop and think about what you need Or what might help you and They actually do something about it. Wow Sacrificing for the benefit of another That is loving your neighbor Thank you for loving us For giving us a cup of cold water You give me a cup of cold water and me And me And me That was so good the young woman there that was telling that little sermon at whatever we might call that That was really even a teaching from the scriptures. It was so good. So I love that We are now we have not we're not only digging wells in Uganda But we we've dug some in Nepal and more to come and then we are providing fresh water now in several different ways in the state of Mississippi We're providing some water boxes that were put we're installing at some fire departments where people can come and fill up with clean water clean filtered water because Jackson Jackson, Mississippi. I think it's not Jacksonville Jackson, Mississippi has had a lot of water issues And so we're providing cups of clean water or in this case gallons and gallons of clean water at a time So there is some of the equipment that Emily was said we were going to show this last time. That's a water box see They're filling there's someone comes in at the fire department fills up their own water with their own buckets And we we're installing I think four of these either three or four depending on we've had we paid about a hundred thousand dollars to get These really expensive water boxes that are mobile But they they filter the water and so it's clean and send the local fire departments And let us put them there. So you see right there in the box. It says Elijah streams. So excellent So thank you for showing that and we appreciate that now quick quick Let me read this thing we have we're going to start every day giving you a 30-second spot about one of our Episodes of American Warriors.

I can We're gonna put chocolate cake so far. It's showing angel food cake, but that's that's a that's a good kind of game Anyway, welcome cat. How are you today? Well excited. We are back, of course from our covert activity in Mid-Florida that was actually during the storm people really really which really never affected us and by the way It actually had to skirt Jacksonville. It wasn't even allowed to come to Jacksonville. I don't know if anybody knows that No, we didn't know that I actually hit it with my staff and People think what is this crazy stuff you're talking about taking authority over the weather the other thing is I Never intended just so people know the weatherwaters have very specific Assignments when one starts to come when it's in the midst of it and even after it's done or goes off the coast or something I know that about maybe probably close to a third of America is in drought actually a lot of it's in drought So I fully intended to send that storm all the way up around the coast to where those drought areas were and if one comes Again, I'm going to send it out over the west because they they really are in serious drought And I think California's had fires already Have had fires, but we won't have any fires here We had plenty of rain and I'm not ignoring the fact that it did some damage down in Tampa But that wall of faith that we built is all along the east coast So I'm gonna have to get with a group seriously on the west coast and teach them how to build that wall of faith that Lines up with what the father said is when he made the ocean He made boundaries for the ocean and even says so in the word of God Then he made the land in the sea. He told the sea you will not pass over the land You must stay within the boundaries. I said for you true As weatherwaters we began to say that because most of the storms always would come up the tip of Africa up the east coast and then you know do damage everywhere and so We decided to use the words that God spoke himself and say you can't go beyond these bounds You will not come ashore and do destruction and we started doing that No storm has been able to come in along the east coast at all and they would even try to get close And they'd be bumped back out the sea We have records to prove that and so does the meteorologist. They don't know what's wrong That's what they say. We don't know what's wrong. And so it kind of has to sneak around how to come up the other side to do something But we drove through it on the way home from down near Orlando Yeah, the only thing we got was somebody's Construction orange cone was in the road. We did hit that but that was about it Now can't what do you say now some of people say well point out that that the Fort Mayer Beach area got hit really hard There was an island out there So is that an area where you weren't dealing with Fort Mayer? So you know? What would you say? It's on the west coast of Florida. Okay It's on the west coast of Florida So we have found that we can build these walls wall face by agreeing with what God said to the ocean himself And that's why that has worked powerfully here, but no one on the west coast has picked it up I I thought that to everybody no matter where you are in the Gulf. They've started to do something about that now But it's mainly that wherever you're at wherever you live is where your greatest authority is Okay, that's just the way it is right now. I'm sure it wasn't going to be anywhere We go, but some people are just beginning to take authority real authority over the storms and over the destructive weather I'm not changing what God put in place. He had these seasons for different reasons He needed them for the earth to either rest to be nourished or to make way for new growths to come There's a reason why he created weather, but he didn't create destructive weather Yeah, I see what you said authority over the storm He had authority over it because he was righteous of course as the son of God But he knew that he could speak to the weather and he was trying to teach the disciples to do the same thing and So that was one of the things given to me to start weather warriors and teach the body of Christ How to come against destructive weather and there's too many testimonies even talk about all over this country From people who operate in that who do take authority over it and know what to declare to it no matter whether it's a tornado if it's an earthquake if it's a flood whatever it is and We've been really successful according to the word of God taking authority That's just a work Christ did works the works I think you will do also that includes the weather But we are not we don't live on the West Coast I was in central Florida and Central Florida didn't get very much anything of all happening and we were even there during part of it And there was some wind some palm fronds and there was some rain But even in that place so I think the hardest hit was where it came in I think Punta Gorda and Fort Myers not that people weren't praying they were praying I'm sure some of them were praying but Really how to make a stand for where they live that destruction will not happen and cat Can I ask you a question about you? Let's see. I'm from California initially. I'm in Oregon now I was born in this state Oregon, but I was raised in California There has been so much drought in that state now if there was a big old front even if it was almost a Dangerous amount of water you would almost think that we'd need that thing to come Assure, how would you pray? It'll say if you live there and if you were if you were making a stand in Southern California where it's such a drought How would you make the right kind of stand so it's not destructive? But it gets that water in where it's needed. How would you pray? The first thing is I would begin to command low pressure systems to form Or to come a low pressure system is what brings the rain and actually God based the operations of weather on Pressure systems a high will bring in a dry cool air It helps with humidity if you have serious humidity stuff like that not that you'll take it away forever But we can actually make the temperature adapt to that so a high pressure system Will actually destroy a storm it will so if you have high pressure coming in you want the rain to remain Then you command the high pressure system to go off either to the west the east or wherever you need to go It to go to or you just command the low pressure system to come through quicker and bring rain That will not be destructive and you see it's it's really a whole thing that you're taught and there is and I always teach it For free and I try to do even at meetings when I go to them because they make a major difference People have stopped tornadoes may then go back up in the sky They have stopped lightning from striking and just circle in the sky They've they have caused the whole areas of their city not be destroyed because they've been speaking against when the weather people say You know, this is what's coming. This is what what this is what's involved in it Then you would know I actually have a manual a very simple For different things that when they start to come what you say Before it gets there while it's there and even after it leaves if you need rain You need to pray you just you can say I pray for rain But you need to command the low pressure system because you get to command You command because Christ commands not everything and not people ever You're not going to command people that's a waste of time your authority is used in the spirit realm But the devil has learned for many so many years how to take advantage and use weather to do destruction He didn't really have the right to do it, but he'll do whatever he can get away with so that's why the father had me begin Weather warriors and we have had floods recede I'm not kidding We've even put out forest fires in certain years because we would command a low pressure system to come with a great amount of rain And just rain until the fire was out There's all kinds of things you can do as a believer You don't have to sit there and be destroyed at all But if you need rain you can say father I declare rain to come in Jesus name I command a low pressure system to be in the form right now It will bring rain and the rain will remain until our ground has been watered and the earth has been nourished here And then it will go that's that simple. It's your faith It's still faith Steve. You still need faith. Yeah, you start trusting God Then you actually believe him and at one point you step into faith and from that moment in your life You should continue to let that grow and that's where the words we started speaking against I knew because when I was younger I would watch the weather just to see what they're gonna say And I would sometimes say that is not gonna happen Not understanding even what what authority I already had and the things wouldn't happen And then the fathers are doing the start weather warriors It'd be one of the first things the body of Christ will come in agreement Wow their denomination or whether they like anybody or whether you know, I don't like them There's this and that they won't care if destruction is had that way They will want to do it together. We have about 60,000 people who are now involved in weather warriors and pray in Really 60,000. Wow. Okay, so there'll be a time on years when we speak and these things will happen and people always say The manifest and sons and daughters will come in the land to see in the air But they don't know what that means. This is one of those things You will speak and the weather will follow the pattern the father made it to follow with no destruction involved and I had already spoken before when the father took me into the future and showed me a serious earthquake it was in California and I don't know who know who did this, but the father said this is This is a greater work that is coming and I know people for years have prayed But more people in California talk about the big one coming then they do stopping it. Yeah, they do Yeah, the words are seeding your atmosphere people is seeding your atmosphere Well, this always happens here. Well, probably will if you don't stop saying it your words have power and authority so I was taken into the future not not a long way and I saw a serious earthquake come and Expressway systems collapse buildings collapse people were dying and I was I was standing there and of course in my spiritual body But I was watching all this and all of a sudden one young man stands up and says I command you to stop moving earth I command you to cease earthquake, and I command you to put it back the way it was before you came Wow Those words the earth came back together the buildings came back together and the people who died were no longer dead Wow To me very poverty said that is a manifested son of God And that's what I mean when I say that the land the sea and the air will have to obey those That follow Christ that believe in him that do the works in greater works You will do also that was a greater work So it is going to happen people will begin to get it They'll get it and they'll start operating and it doesn't have to be everybody in the city But he does need people who actually believe What that you know there's a scripture that says if you confess with no believe what you're saying don't doubt your heart You should have what? You should have what you say. Yeah, whatever you say that is that is walking in authority That's called dominion in authority. That is occupying Occupy until I come Christ. Yeah That doesn't mean sit on your rapture rug That means take authority where you see that it needs to be taken and operate in the spirit with your faith and That faith does please God and you when you the more faith you have in the greater it gets then the greater things You'll be able to do for Christ or with Christ and the thing about the faith thing is that you know I pointed this for years in practice now and then God knows the exact level of faith that's emanating from you whether it's vibrations or whatever it is He knows so one you may have a minute from now an increased faith But five minutes from now it may reach a level of faith I think is that true your faith can grow even in a moment and all of a sudden grow very quickly because as you're speaking and Eventually we will when we move and get out of the place. We will have news and media Program or network. I'm not quite sure what it is and we will actually Teach people that way through those resources of having We're gonna have a weather. We're gonna have a weather. We will have a weather channel But we will all in the body of Christ begin to speak to the weather and we will keep our cameras where with it So they can see what is happening They speak the truth. This is what the father said. This is being added to your list And then you'll go broadcast things where things are happening and then you they will speak over the reporters One of our people will speak and you begin to see changes and people will join them. Wow cat And that's why the earth will be a totally different place to live in and God wants it to reach that level and Operating at that level see if you can see there will be no use for the antichrist No, there will be absolutely no need for him because the body of Christ will be operating in power authority with Jesus Christ and The mass miracles and the things that people see changing. They were one after they're after Jesus Christ at one point They don't want to know him and so that is one of the reasons why some of the harvest will be so great But I'm not talking about the last Harvest before we all get out of here But I will promise you there will be a catching away because he said there would but the rapture will not be a rescue party This is from Holy Spirit himself. The rapture is not a rescue party It will be a celebration of all of us operating such power authority that God just has to have us That's why that's good Christ will not be able to appear or have authority on the earth until we're gone Because he can't you serve the authority? We're already operating in after all these generations He won't be able to do it and the Bible says into he that remains is removed That's the body of Christ the antichrist cannot appear and so we have to get greater in authority and dominion And our faith is going to change. It's gonna get greater And so he gave us weather warriors sort of this is how you start this is what you begin Yeah And people faith everywhere has grown so much to see even in this storm that went on there Well, I was rescued there were miracles that happened because people were declaring and taking authority and I know two places not this time But one of them when there was great floods coming and God said tell them to begin to stomp on the ground and command the water To go down and before their eyes it did really happen in more than one place Okay, I wanted to ask you right a few minutes ago, and I wanted to get circled back to this You said I took my staff and I pounded it down. So my question was You were you're in Jacksonville, Florida? Harry, did you do it there? Did you do it on a map? You have a map in front of you did it on a map? What what what did you do that had the that had the effect that you're talking about? That was before I got to Jacksonville, Florida. Okay, we had to leave Orlando in return of course because well, we just had to come back and And so I actually started speaking to it when I was in Orlando. I didn't waste any time I went out and sent the host on as the host are always sent to shred the bands of the storm. So these hurricanes We we know pretty much how to speak to them and we know there's gonna be some kind of results Every now and then one's actually stopped and it never goes anywhere or it's shredded in the morning But this storm here that we just had come here was I know that the devil's real purpose was to set it up through the entire State of Florida mass destruction. Well, that was not gonna happen Not on my watch or the weather warriors watch and I was not tolerating it even coming through my city And I did hit it with the staff. I hit it and I said you're gonna get off and you're gonna go quickly But when you go through the wall of faith that's been built along the east coast because if it was going to go back out In the ocean actually had to go through that side of it. I said when you go through there, you will be shredded and The next day after that happened people woke up in this city and went where did the storm go? Where did it go? It was in pieces people. That's where it was. It was in pieces Well, even the tail of the storm was not allowed to stay on the east You mentioned the bands the destructions in the bands a lot So do you speak to the bands and say I want you to disintegrate you? You know, do you speak to them? Do you name bands to having to go and shred those bands of the storm? Okay, because one this one of those bands begin to separate it loses power. Yeah No, I send the host to do it. Yeah That's good. And so the one clarification when you so before you were in Jacksonville But because you had authority over Jacksonville, you were in Orlando area. You took authority with your staff while you were in Orlando about Something to represent in my staff that that's where I hit the storm But when I got here, I actually went out to the beach area Okay, I guess some of the bands were beginning to come through we kind of got ahead of it And I my husband with me and we stood right out there and there was rain and there was wind blowing I I told I told it again It was getting offshore and it was going because I was standing in why that wall of faith that was built It goes out some miles offshore along the and I was standing there And that's when I was telling you will be shred as you go through there gonna be shred You will have no longer have the image of the hurricane and when that begins to fall apart the storm falls apart It just does and then the high pressure can grow the high pressure going up into the storm That's what it was saying also in Orlando I've come in the pressure to begin to raise because when the pressure goes up the storm can't get any Greater it can't and then it will actually begin to be downgraded And I remember in Hawaii when that huge massive storm was due to hit the next day and all the weather channels were saying Hawaii will be wiped out We have powerful weather warriors in Hawaii and I told them to agree that that the the host would come and take the head off The storm just take it off the storm. It would fall apart And I still we somewhere have a copy of that weather report from the Hawaiian Islands the next day going what happened There was nothing left of it. It was nothing. It was like something came and took the head off of it It fell apart completely Destruction was there ever we don't understand and then they then we would take other channels And they were all beginning to say that that year was a great year to to take authority and people everywhere begin to take it And so we actually saved some of those weather channel reports and them saying we don't know what happened It's gone, but this one especially I think all of my friends and the weather warriors in Hawaii said you stayed up You did a great job. The head of that storm was totally just taken off. There was no I left there was no kind of nothing left and So people need to know that if you have received Jesus Christ, he said I give you power I give you power the things I did you will do you should expect to do them But if you never step out and I'm not saying God, I pray this won't you can go ahead and still say that if you want to He wants us to take authority. He wants to see us rule Jesus Christ said you'll rule with me now in this life So you're saying it's not that you should say dear Lord, please take the story It's like saying I take authority over this storm. That's a totally different thing. It is a totally different thing It's called it's called you're using faith Yeah, the Lord said when I return will I find faith? He said that in the word because he wants to see us use our faith and yes we were given authority in the earth as the body of Christ and We demonstrate that by doing those things and it's going to get greater and greater So the days that we're now are not the end of everything because we've only just begun to do these things Yeah, and the father wants them seen for generations to come us taking authority and what we do is we represent Jesus Christ We show people that he's real because we're using his name We're doing the things that he did and that's what he said to do. You cannot use them against people I have to keep saying that because people want you know want to send a host to kill their whatever or whoever That's never gonna happen. They're not gonna do that, but you need to understand who you are first Who are you? What are you talking about? Do you talk more about the devil's exploits? Or Christ's conquest because you should be talking about the kingdom the kingdom of the gospel the kingdom of heaven That's what should be coming out of your mouth no matter who you talk to you can't repeat everything the devil is doing That's all that's gonna be in your soul. That's the only conversation you'll have with people How is that directing them to know or want to know Jesus Christ? And when you do these things You you must be very aware that you what you did and what you with that wall of faith that you built and what you Go out there with your staff and you might literally be saving billions upon billions of dollars in damage And I know of course you always have people usually Christians People don't make fun of us or lapidus the Christians who are clueless to who they are themselves Say we're wasting time or we're not supposed to be who are we Jesus Christ? And I always say I'm just like him because that's why That's why I received him. That's why he wanted me to do this. This was his commitment to us Take dominion take authority. That's what he said to us He didn't say to be afraid and run and hide. Yeah He was very clear the works I do you will do and greater works in these because I go to the father is very very clear, isn't it? And yet you'd be surprised how many people bash the weather warriors for taking authority And I'm like, well, you don't even know what the word says Well, you know, and then there's exactly the works of Christ. That's what we're doing We're trying to help people save lives, you know, let them know he cares, you know He's the one he's the only one who can give us authority to do this But you still have to choose to do it So don't waste your time bashing people and this is what the father said if they're out there bashing the good works We're doing that's because they have no they have no vision their self They have no plan their self to do anything with God So what they do is go around and find people who are doing and they spend their time bashing them Yeah, it's yes That's not helping the body. That's certainly not helping the image of Christ was so slow on another and care about one another If you don't want to do it, that's fine pray for the people who do Yeah, I mean we used to call that there wasn't I won't say the gentleman's name I'm sure he's alive anymore, but after Walter Martin died Who was a pretty well balanced teacher another guy came along and he became a heresy hunter And all he did was look around for all the errors that the body Christ and he decided he was God's gift to point out all the errors And there was no life in that Yeah, yeah, it was not a gift it was a It's almost like a curse. It was like taking the enemy's accusations You know anyway, it's it's really bad. So what'd you look up? You looked up at something just now you looked up? Oh There's all kinds of things in this room to look at if I was gonna get distracted. Yeah, anyway, well anyway High-fiving each other see that's what they're doing. Awesome. I love that I mean, they have a lot more sense of humor than we really don't they I mean, there's some serious ones. I think you said before but there's also some hilarious ones and that's their gift They're angelic gift is there funny and they're humorous and there are some that are very funny and God always sends them with one who is not He explained to me the two scribe angels were signed to me. They're still here because I haven't written book three yet they'll be with me until I'm done with book three and One is very serious and you know, he likes he likes He likes setting the fire of God places to do things to wicked people and and he would rather do about they talk about that kind of stuff He's out, but the other one is hilarious And I'm gonna tell you the names but one actually means holy one and the other one who's funny. It means humorous Humorous he kind of bugs the other one and father said this is why I do is that there's no other way? Really to have them rub against each other, you know, like a husband or wife dust We help each other kind of die We learn to die Yeah, you know, I don't think of the angels is needing to learn that or learn to die. Yeah, but you're saying they need to learn too, huh? So the father will find total opposite You didn't send them on assignment. He'll let them know I'm watching you Seem more real now every angelic being whether a member of the host of the under Gabriel or under Michael They have personalities. They have favorite things. They like yeah, like where they like to see they like to eat I do know they eat man up with the more than men and heaven people and And people always ask me I want yes You will get to meet your angel and know them in heaven and they won't belong to you and they won't serve you like a butler So I've had that question asked to No, no, they're they're free from having to take care But you will get to see them and I'm always amazed at they have their own places. They live in heaven. They have They do have angel games, which is probably where the Olympics came from. I'm quite sure And it's sort of like extreme sports. It is like that but but the angels with the What the way he's he's gifted them because they Very cool the things that they carry the things that they can do and stuff like that They do and it's not the only reward they get is that Christ is always there to watch them and they love that they love him Very much, especially the army does a lot but but they Actually will fellowship during big meetings, which is one of my favorite things to do is sit there I just got back from open the heavenly and And angels were everywhere They're saying hello to each other. They they will give each other if they want it to become They don't know everybody every angel doesn't know every single angel in heaven. Okay, there's millions of them there And they do they have friends they have friends they do things with and everything in heaven or they help work on projects in heaven together But the one thing they always do is sometimes we will exchange like an address with somebody back Yeah, I say hi. Oh gosh. I like your story. I I'm so happy I can meet you You came from a home state can can we kind of stay in contact to let's change addresses We used to they exchange feathers with each other. Oh, really Wow, so it's almost like a friendship rain a friendship necklace a friendship feather So wow and I so I see that a lot in big meetings because everybody's guardian angels come with them They come and they get to attend the meeting they'll sit there and they get more excited sometimes I think from the people do Hearing what's being sad because they know what truth is they recognize it But they do they do have friends and sometimes they get to see them if you go to the same meeting Maybe three years later or something else though. They they still know that they know each other, so I love that I love it Well, Kat anything else before we I've got questions for you. Did anything else that you want to share? Before I was mainly going to talk about the weather thing so people would understand Now literally there were millions of people praying I got I got so many tests and so many messages people saying we're standing with you We're praying we're agreeing with you in florida in florida, you know for everybody that was there And I love to see those kind of reports that people are with us together with the body of christ praying for one another And so that also I've seen a lot more of that happening That the body is becoming closer the body that's listening that knows that there is a god they love jesus christ And it may be some simple person You've never heard of before but some of them are some of the best intercessors ever And now along with their intercession they actually will command the army of heaven also They'll command they'll send the host now in their prayer closets They'll do it all the time and they make strategic times on their even on their calendar to send the host different places So that makes me happy seeing people step into something that christ clearly did He commanded the army of heaven and the things he did that is one of the things that we will be doing And it's really starting to make a major difference in the atmosphere of the spirit realm itself And even now when I go places, I'm seeing less and less darkness spiritual darkness over places because of people taking authority and Bearing yes, I am And I know the news the fake news are never going to say anything about it But I can tell you from the ones who know about the foundation of this whole woke thing this whole thing That's been been trying to shove in our faces Is falling apart and the spirit realm can't lie The spirit realm shows clearly what's happening in the spirit realm between goodness Between the light and the darkness and and of the evil You know god over the evil and what's happening in there things are already changing Setting up for what's going to happen in the natural that I am probably the most excited about awesome, so yeah, I mean we You've talked about this like they're um I mean we could get off in all kinds of tangents here, but I mean you talked about One day and I can't christmas. I just saw him prophesy Not not necessarily the one where you were all right, although I saw that too, but he's quite a prophet But he said at times coming when god's going to wave his hand and a lot of people who are stuck in Homosexuality will just begin healed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and you've mentioned that Is that part of what you're saying and things are getting ready to fall apart? um from the dark side And is it is that is god chipping away at at that? for instance that area of Sin homosexuality and one day he goes okay. That's enough the rest of it just goes And it and it's just largely gone or what I think for him. It's more Of the layers he's building around okay Okay, I know you said chipping away. I understand why you said that but but for god when things begin to change It's what he's putting there. Okay, but he's putting in places or over places over cities I can see layers of light Uh hovering over whole cities and the darkness when they see that begin to leave that area they don't want to be They don't want to get caught in that when when it gets brought down to over these different cities And and you know it says he even says can a city be changing today? You know, uh, when I know they were talking about israel can Israel be saved in a day There will be times in that thing that begins to happen It will it will begin to happen and I do know he specifically mentioned And groups of people to me probably maybe I don't know five six years ago Maybe even before that before that he did but even more so now that yes All a lot of these people who are in confusion who's believed deception and living a different kind of life It will be in a day in a day He will wave his hand and and every single one of these people Involved in these certain things their eyes will be open and they will dump the darkness and run into the kingdom They will run so good so good man. I hope there's angels high-fiving with that too I mean, yeah, that's such good news because It has gotten to be so dark and we've talked about this And starting about seven eight years ago when we were talking about you said it's not really actually getting darker darker It's that he's ripping the veil off. He's exposing how dark it's been So in reality, you know, I use the term chipping away, but you're saying in reality He's putting layers of light and light and light and pretty soon. That's all that can remain. It sounds like Yes, because see the the evil Can't operate in an atmosphere of nothing but light They can't I'm talking about people at this point. Yeah They really can't operate when the presence of god is so great There's no evil spirits around To help commands, which they don't think they can command, but they're just being used by the devil Uh, there's not a lot they can pull on to do evil things. That's basically the way it is the regions of light Evil will not want to be there Crime will not be even evident in regions of light and that's what he's really beginning to prepare the regions of light to be shown um he reveals the good And exposes the evil and all these several years he's been doing almost nothing but exposing evil But the whole time he's been exposing the evil. He's preparing to take that away And in when in doing that he makes deposits. I think thank you, holy spirit He'll begin to put deposits of his presence deposits of the glory of god deposits of all these different things over areas right now And now the wicked the wicked the spirit in the spirit realm they can see it They don't want nothing to do they they can't stop that from happening And I don't care how long people have been evil or evil spirits been wrong. They cannot stop god From doing what he wants to do When he has people on the earth willing to work with him to do those things that makes us very dangerous against hell Can I ask you this about the air? We've talked about it in the past. I think I can't remember what you said Well about hollywood because it's one of the darkest areas Of sin because there's so much junk going on behind the scenes Even a cultic worship and all of that kind of stuff luciferian stuff Is the same thing happening as god even as we speak is he building layers of light? If you've seen any of that In hollywood or what he is but actually the angels that the city is named for City of angels is what lost the angeles. The word angeles is angel people Yeah, it's the city of angels and it actually will be probably called the city of angels Uh, I do know that when I was there a few years ago and I was speaking I was shown these angels that have been there forever With these urns and they were pouring out Before the last time I when I left they actually poured oil on the whole city and anointed that city in the spirit realm Whoa god Whoa, so that's really good news. Yeah, that would that would be something I would try and pray out of you Thank you for doing it because a lot of people there's a lot of people that have been praying for that and there was someone that I Talked to a number of months ago and they said well, we were going to minister And then they learned out some of the actual occultic things that were going on where they were going to minister And I think they pulled off because they didn't realize the darkness that they were dealing with so Yeah, I just think god's gonna need to help them. Well, I've got some questions here Let me start with the kids one seven-year-old mackayl m-i-k-a-l. I don't know if that's a Michael or mackayl. I don't know. It's a boy or girl. Sorry, but mackayl wants to know Why did god create adam as an adult and not a baby? That's what mackayl seven-year-old wants to know There's a very good reason because he needed people on the earth A baby can't have a baby people and that's what he made adam and eve so that they could create They with him And bring all those I don't know how many they ended up by doing together themselves But the reason why he made it male and female was when they come together Of course, you know babies come and those little spirits of life that live in the father At the time of conception He takes one of those from himself and knits it together in the womb With that little daughter flesh that was just created and that is when life begins right then And that's when the baby begins to form and grow and then eventually it's birthed into the earth And uh, and he made this so that we we all lived in him. We were little spirits who were still us Um, we didn't really have a name yet And maybe not all of our personality was there, but you can think of billions of them living in the father Crazy and that's that's where we came from Okay, now adam's body was made but we Lived in god our little spirit a little spirit person with our soul in the spirit And that's how he creates human beings at that little dot a flesh at conception one of those and he says I knit you together in your mother's womb That's what he did Because you were still you that's what he said. I knit you together So he's saying you were with him I don't think people even get that and that you together But you were already here but in him So he took your spirit with your soul in it and knit that and attached that to that little dot of flesh And then the spirit grows with the baby inside the baby and uh, and so He's ever been you've been from the beginning to the end because you were there with him in the beginning of time And you've been to the end when we won't need time because god's already been there We were in him and we would move in and out on the rays of the rainbow We saw everything that there was out there to see You know, that's an interesting question of this young child because I never really stopped and pondered it But the only two human beings that ever lived that were never a baby first We're adam and eve unless i'm forgetting something You know, I think Is this when he when he made animals He made animal he made the chicken people not the egg first. Yeah Yeah chicken that could lay eggs, but he bought the all the animals were created also that way Okay, he didn't send them to the earth to be little baby things He sent him as you know, those who could create the little baby the chickens were laying the eggs Okay, yeah, but they got he didn't send an egg to exist on its own So that's just the way he's always done it. He made sure that those babies when they came They had parents to take care of them His whole thing about be fruitful and multiply Yeah, he ranked with all these adult creatures and adam and eve and then he says now multiply and fill the earth um, it wasn't I mean in in human thought it takes weeks Before all of a sudden the babies are coming all over the earth, right? So But through the animals, but all right, so Julie is our producer Julie Smith, you know, Julie So she don't ask me if I would ask you this question. She says okay to use her name So she's saying can't my mom passed away two years ago today She was a mighty warrior over her family since she passed I've seen many prayers. She's prayed for her family Come to pass and I know many more will as well A couple of days ago. I asked the lord what mom is doing right now and I immediately heard quote She's cheering you on close quote. I know this includes prayers over her family Yet has the lord revealed what else what else cheering us on Means in heaven and do our loved ones in heaven fully know our destiny on earth that is still yet to come So what he's asking? I guess what does it all mean cheering him on a lot of questions? But I can I can't answer I can't answer them I do see people cheering us on my own dad Um every now and then I'll hear him say something and not not real often Every now and then he'll say that was that was great. You did a great job. You got it that time I mean, I don't have to say that That was pretty pretty close to my dad And um, but I do know they go to the portal that we have shown people pictures of that And um and actually I might as well show it now But we actually created a smaller size to them So almost anybody can get them if you want to give them as gifts or something Uh, I just had it in my heart is one of the most important things that the father gave me was to take me to this portal They're all over heaven They're huge beautiful buildings that people go in there and walk up a stairway They literally look over a railing and when they look down They see their loved one on the earth now one thing they don't see they don't see death and destruction But they see you uh when you get married they see when you have a baby They know if you've been rewarded for something they know if you did good deeds Uh, but every year on your birthday, they especially go there and declare over you They sing actually happy birthday to you and yes, they cheer us on because god What he knows when something's gonna happen. So he'll let us know he'll let everybody know Uh, your loved one is about to have a child. You need to go to the portal so you can watch it And so people get to watch these things and they're going. Yay. That's great. Yay. We're so happy And so they don't miss those happy moments in your life. And so that's what he meant when he told her That she was cheering her on she was cheering her family on and the other thing is the prayers she prayed My dad prayed my grandmother prayed my great-grandmother prayed It's still circling in the atmosphere until they are fulfilled. That's all my dad I know he prayed for every one of us. I know he did. I know he prayed for certain people And if I'm in a place where it was that he was I can hear the words I can go into a building and hear prayers that were already prayed And somebody invited me they built uh, they took a piece of property and they built um a christ a church And then across they built a big school And they always felt the presence of god in the school They didn't know why so they invited me to come to walk in there. Did I see anything? Did I hear anything and I was almost went down on the floor Really of prayer. I found out it used to be a place of prayer not labeled a place of prayer But great intercession took place in that building And I literally could hear the prayers and I began saying out loud what I was hearing and they they got totally undone That this is where the students now go in this place that has the presence of god so strong because prayer took place there And that's incredible Sometimes people walk past me steve and I hear things coming off of their clothing Really? Yeah, such as give an example If you can think of one well, sometimes it's good sometimes it's not really good Okay, I know one time I was out somewhere Excuse me at a place a nice place people went there to have fun and stuff. I think there was like a Sort of like an amusement park type of thing There are people coming from all over the world and I would see things with them that weren't really good And so I just on purpose. I didn't want to necessarily stand next to them Uh, I might start saying something to the spirits who are with them and then the people I don't I don't want I don't want to make people afraid so I'm gonna go off somewhere Then I would speak against the spirits I saw with them But I was standing in line to get on this boat ride And and there was a woman there and I won't tell you what her she wasn't from America. She's from another place Demons started coming out of her Really and I turned around And I shoved my husband I shoved him. He's always he's used to strange things like this I said get back and get out of the line Well, he didn't even wait any more just because he said what I've said their demons coming out of that lady over there And I want to say something about it, but I can't do it behind her and I'm not getting on the boat because I'll be saying I'm on the boat And I did I broke the power of the enemy off of her life. I commuted them to go Uh, or to shut them out. Were you talking out loud cat? Were you talking out loud that she could hear this or what? No, no, she couldn't hear me. Okay. You need to hear me They needed to hear me. Okay They probably were leaving her because I was behind her. I see. Okay. Well, that's helpful right there So the presence is with me all the time men or where I go there's always things reactions in the spirit realm if I go somewhere And it's no different than no different than paul or peter is that when you walk past them his shadow heal them That was the cloud of anointing coming from him Well, I have a large cloud of anointing and it impacts whatever is going to be there with me So I think that's what happened, but I wanted to say something so I knew I couldn't say it right then because The lady would have to be afraid and leave and so I went off where they could hear me Um, but I didn't go on the boat with her because I knew I'm gonna be laying hands on her and then they'd throw me out And um, I was wanting to help her Yeah, but I see things I see things like this everywhere and I'll let god tell me pray for them Uh, that's dude. That's for someone else to pray for or whatever So tell me what to do about each situation with that one was I was kind of kind of surprised And I mean they were like a lot of them coming out and I'm like, I just wanted to put you get back That was really good I gotta pray I gotta pray so he goes, okay, but let's go up here. Okay. Go ahead and pray and you know, my husband is The perfect person for me because he doesn't get excited about much. No, he's very mellow being is is a mellow guy He's Yeah I won't say any more about all that, but anyway, he's great. Yeah over it And uh, and some I could see leaving from where they were just leaving they would just disappear, disappear, disappear And then I just left I sent the presence of god to that woman to begin to surround her that she would know christ And so but that's the whole thing about me going anywhere even to the mall. It's like not normal Yeah, well, I understand that more and more. Hey talk about for a minute. Okay. You said like of our loved ones So I would have for instance in my loved ones I'm sure that I had a lot of them were praying families But many of them had really really wrong doctrines But they loved god to the ability that they were able to love him They understood about the cross more or less they got that but they would be praying now with their prayers Although albeit sometimes they would they were probably prayed amiss. They were praying Make them Sabbath keepers lord and god wasn't interested in making them Sabbath keepers He was interested in making their followers of christ. Would their prayers be circulating and accomplishing things? I think the prayers that that remain are the ones that you usually pray over your family members Okay, it's always about christ to know christ to have a great relationship with christ to understand who they are in christ Those kinds of things like that those those are the prayers my dad prayed and my grandmother prayed Or for people she knew that didn't know christ those prayers remain They're productive prayers. Yeah, and he won't remove the words the words that you speak actually remain They saturate your clothing So or they saturate you Depending on even what side you feel with the darkness you feel the light Um, but but a lot of people like the building I walked into the prayers and the words and the and sometimes it was worship I heard saturates the walls Wow, that's what heaven also, but it saturates that place And is the lord cat is the lord? How do you know how to ask this question is the lord therefore constantly hearing those prayers in the air? Yes, even though it may be two or three generations later. He's hearing those. He's still hearing those prayers Yes, that's fascinating because I've never been caught that You know, we've always always thought their works do surely follow them and you know, he remembers the prayers But I think of them as they were prayed and he's got them in his hand or a bucket or something But you're saying no, they're circulating even come up before the throne of god. Okay Interesting interesting. All right. Let's see. You've got a time for a few more questions here Um, okay. This is a cute one. This is a mom asking about her two-year-old son since Mallory is asking since I began commanding the host A few months ago almost to the day my two-year-old son began talking to me about cow c o w cow In his room every night. He smiles at him talks to him tries to feed cow his snacks shows cow His toys and has described him as what I believe to be a host Have you ever seen one that looked like a cow? My son has always seemed to see in the supernatural even as young as he gets Interesting question Probably more than likely is a member of the host because I keep telling people most of them look like creatures like The royal guard all look like lions That is a tribe the host as well as gaverals are all made angels are made in tribes the first tribes were in heaven And so all of gaverals has they different tribes of angels some are the guardian angels some are like scribes some are Like courier angels some would be for different They're bringing mantles down or they bring body parts down from the warehouse Those are all tribes and those members of those tribes do the same type of thing Because he needs so many to do different things. They would do that The hosts are also made in tribes and that is usually depicted by they are usually Like assigned to one type of thing like they wore in one type of a battle or they wore with certain weapons And when he needs those weapons he sends them to the different places he needs them in some of the hosts are Are a weapon themselves the way he puts them together and that's hard to explain but most of the hosts of the armies of heaven I see them as creatures And there are some that have heads that look like Remember the ox? Yeah, yeah, what did he say one has the head of a what? Yeah, that would be like a cow Yeah, it would wouldn't it it would so he might well have seen Yeah, something that would have had of an ox it would look like a cow little boy. Oh interesting fascinating, okay, so Okay, Susie asked is we get a lot of questions about have you seen this person or that person in heaven Here's Susie Goose is her handle Susie Goose asked has can't see never can either in heaven I've been studying Jeremiah and Daniel and though the king never can either acknowledge Daniel's god is real And encourage people to worship Daniel's god Did he finally do the same that's her question About that I'm pretty certain that he is there. I mean even the fact that he recognized god for who god was Um, that was actually why the father created a paradise which is in the earth where Were the those who believed in god before christ came along they believed that there was god He wouldn't they died he'd send them there. He didn't send them to hell or hades That was for the wicked and the evil and of course that place is empty because when christ died on the cross One of the things he did when he went down into the earth Before he went into hell He had to go into hell it mentions that he had to take back the keys of hell death and grave wipe up hell Show Satan that he had no power over the son of god He was in paradise first and when he was there Uh christ saw ever ham isaac jacob but many more who believed and knew there was god and would speak to god They didn't call him a sign or something christ actually went there and it said christ led captivity captive He preached the gospel to all those in paradise and once christ Left hell on the third day and came back in his body when he was the first resurrected from the dead At that time many of those all left and went up to heaven when christ finally went back to heaven To pour out his blood on the mercy seat That's what happened after he came up into the grave and he told mary remembers he told mary I had to go to my father and your father that was father god in heaven And he had to pour out that blood on the mercy seat as evidence that he paid that price And at that time all the ones who who received him of course in in paradise And you also remember that it said that people saw the dead walking around Yeah, yeah, they did hundreds of them that they saw them walking around And that i'm quite sure happened at the time that probably when christ was preaching to them When he was what speaking to them Yeah, when they they all received him every one of them in there Yeah, you can imagine how long that had been going on adam and eve were there I mean a long time Prepared a long time well, okay, um I I wanted to ask a follow-up question on that because never can answer you hadn't seen him But you you're you're assuming that he probably is there I've wanted to ask what about cyrus? There's a scripture that says though. You did not know me I did this and this and this through you, you know and people talked about trump being a modern cyrus But that scripture says that though cyrus did not know him. He had a calling honestly Do you know anything about whether cyrus ended up in heaven? No, I don't know anything about that the father will probably tell me now that you asked that question He probably will eventually tell me uh I have I have seen many many many many many many many people in heaven Some people think there's a handful there and they'll know there's a lot of people There are millions of people already in heaven So it's not like it's like you sort of walking in new york city and thinking can I see somebody? It's almost kind of like that. There's some yeah And I don't just walk around and have been looking for somebody they always escort me where they want me to go Or what they want me to see uh seeing I do know john Wayne made it That was really good. I know the disciples are all they're except not judas Yeah at all And neither hit people you know that may um Come into the question that I wanted to ask one of the okay, so Here is sherry is asking this at the time of the new earth Okay, the new earth is created. Where is hell located? Is there any way the spirits of the people in hell Will be destroyed so that they do not have to suffer forever. So that's an interesting question That is not what the word of god says at all Hell will be empty because nothing will be in hell and this whole earth will be gone It says so in the bible He's going to wrap it all up. It will not exist at all But the lake of fire will exist but it won't be on the new earth But it will be forever where whatever he put that Uh, it's still be a spiritual place of torture not a physical place Um, so I just know that the lake of fire will exist. It says they'll burn forever never That's why it's important to pray for people. I have a question to ask about a follow-up on that because I've known some people some are even close to me Relative wise but one of them Anise told me a few years ago. Well, you know, she's got a church and she's She's a co-pastor at her church Uh, but she says but we don't believe in hell anymore. Now. I'm assuming she believes in jesus christ Talk about if you if you have anything to say about Because you're not saved by The way you correctly believe on hell you're saved by grace In in in jesus christ as your savior to talk about what you would say to someone Or about the situation where someone says I just don't believe in that. I don't believe in hell. What what would your thoughts be? Well, the first thing I would do is tell them my experiences that I had when I was taken into hell In a while I was taken there and explained that this word of god that That god had written Is uh, it's a book to live by it really gives you the truth about how to live how to live for him with him And his plans his plans he had for man his plans He had for this earth and then of course We know the end when he says the end will come and the bible says the end will then come That means the end of time. We won't need time anymore But this earth we're on right now will not exist it clearly says he will make a new one That doesn't mean he will remodel this one again because the new one will be so massive Uh, even just because the city of god that's going to be on there. He would have to make it massive Yeah, probably gonna be bigger than our whole entire galaxy the new earth I would really assume to do that. I've seen parts of it that I can tell you that We don't need time. We won't need calendars things are always done by events in heaven And you know, there is the jewish people have a calendar they follow. Um Just so you know, not everybody in heaven is a jew Uh, there are jews there who receive christ and many of them do that right almost at their death Many of them. He'll appear to them. He just does Um, he appeared to those who were in abraham's bosom or paradise at the same place And god kept them because of their faith in him for believing that there was a god The world talks about that too But everything changed when christ came and died for us from that moment christ is the one you paid the price That all evil and every sin that could ever be committed. He had to carry that in his body That was destroyed on the cross and he's the only one who can say I receive your repentance and yes, uh, yes, I will when they ask him to be their savior That's what you're doing. You're saying I recognize who you are. You're the only one who can forgive sin So i'm repenting on my sin. I want I want to belong to you I'm inviting you to come and and be in me and be my savior forever. That's a significant thing because there's no other being ever That ever existed that paid the price for your sins to be forgiven So just because you say well, I like how they do this or we do it this way because of this Uh, your life at one point you must give it to jesus christ. You must receive jesus christ And uh, the one good thing that's uh, is happening now is christ does have the keys of hell death in the grave Which means he can go At the very moment of your death and say do you want me now if you've got people praying for you to know him That's surely going to happen But you're the only way into heaven Is through jesus christ There's no other way. Yeah Didn't send you to hell on purpose. He actually made a way because he loves you. He made that way Back to him where you used to live in him. He made a way and that's what the word says christ paid the price No one else paid the price and he was god And yet came to the earth lived the man lived righteously And was he laid down his life and paid the price with his blood That that blood when you receive christ washes away every sin you ever had like you never did it That gives you entrance into heaven when you die It gives you all the eternity to be with them when your family members who go there That's what you do. You're securing that for for your all eternity That's good. Would you believe something is good? That is not well, i'm god showed you how Multiple times at least i i think and because he wanted people to know hell is real Otherwise, he kind of just kept it to himself and said they'll find out You know, but he's he wants you he's taken other people to hell as well so that they can talk about it Right other people kind of like you as well. I have a question about I wanted to ask you this before I don't think I ever have when we lived in him before We lived in the father before And he's getting ready to send us down to here's mom and dad and he knows this is where he's Does he Tell let's say me does he tell me when I'm in him. This is your life. This is what you're going to go through these are some of the things you're going to affect you and do you still want to go do you receive this this um Plan for your life or or is that none of that It's shared with us. We just come down and what happens. I think there's a part that is shared um, I remember laying in god's hand and him talking about Really really some of the things he told me wasn't just about my life, but the future itself Uh, but I clearly remember laying in his hand looking at him. I would lay like on my stomach and just stare at him I was so fascinated with him and uh, there's a holy hill inside of him And we could choose to run up that hill and he would put his hand This is deep stuff inside of his mouth and we would climb in and then he would bring us out and he would that's how I was in his hand. Wow and it says Who shall I have my tent? Who shall ascend my holy hill? um That holy hill is inside the father And there's a lot of footsteps going up. There's some going up and coming back that didn't mean you weren't important That means you made a choice even then. I'm gonna pursue. I'm gonna I'm gonna know him I want to know this person that I'm living in we knew we were living in him because we would write out the rays of the Rainbow when it would go in and out of him because the stones of fire were in there the river of life which produced that Holy, uh, it looks like the northern lights. It's bands that come in and out Like there's a band of teal blue Gold I mean they just come out the most beautiful But there's always these little spirits that can we can jump on them and ride in and out of him That's what we used to do. We couldn't leave him. We couldn't live somewhere else in him. We live We move we have very existence. Oh, wow. That's how that goes. That is exactly what that scripture means And the other half of that scripture says the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things So there was a time on the earth when prophets who knew this and God showed them They knew that's how we lived we they knew it And so people think well, there's nothing in there. Yes, there is you need to read your bible more We lived in the father He was our father. We are his offspring the bible is very clear about that Well, guess what when I had a child that was my offspring that came from out of me So everyone who ever lived or existed on the earth they all we were all at one point in him And he didn't start sending us Until he made Adam Right Made the body Then the father the the word stepped out because that was Jesus's name also when the father spoke the word stepped out of him And made a form in the ground and they made the body of Adam and it was perfect and amazing But there was no life in it Then the father leans over who was carrying Adam's spirit And it says he breathed the spirit of life Into Adam's nostrils and Adam became a living soul. That's exactly what the word says That's proof we came from the father and he was our dwelling place And I love that scripture because I know what that means And that's what you were You remember him Did you said you remember him talking to you about did did he tell you anything about what your life would be that you would ever remember that? And you know, I didn't always remember that but there came a point in my life where he began to show me Okay, you know When he was training me to do things he actually caught me up and showed me And then of course there was the time in 2010 when I began to say to him I want my heart to be like your heart I want to be just like you because you know, you say that to your father if you love your father You say that to your father I want to I want to be I mean, of course, I adore Jesus christ and still do he was my beloved He always has been I spent 20 years just Approaching christ to know him and one day he walked in the wall of my house and he's never stopped coming So he was first I I received christ at age four. That's a long time ago A very long time ago. So good 70 human years ago I was born and then four years after my birth I could see angel. I mean, I already saw angels. I saw them. I wanted to know him in our home We heard about Jesus every day of our life. It was just the way my dad was. That's what he he loved the father He loved the son So I grew up knowing them but at one point I went hey in Sunday school. Hey, I need to receive him I know I want to receive him. So I actually asked christ repented of my sins. I don't know what they could have been at age four But I received christ and I literally he appeared and stepped inside of me crazy He is in there and no one on the earth could convince me. He's too late people Oh For that's amazing With him the angels over in the room were applauding. Uh, they were writing things down in heaven when I got at age four I Understood this That's amazing Well, it sounds like to me you are you are you sound like you are almost a protege If I can use that term the same way akeana was at four or five or six She's drawing masterpieces of art. You're at four five and six and you're walking a masterpiece with the lord There are some people that are so far out ahead of The rest of it because you were born with it would be like putting a genius only instead of making you a genius Which you might be you made you go ahead But that's why I have such a passion to tell people Yeah There came a point when he said you can't keep this anymore yourself And he put me in places not meetings. I never shared ever shared in meetings. I didn't really want that I never wanted attention. I didn't want to draw attention to me. I had one friend in school because I had a tribe at home I didn't need a lot of friends But I had uh, I had some of heaven's wisdom and every now and then I would just share a word with somebody And it would kind of freak him out because I knew exactly what it was I needed and I would say it and I would just I would walk away So my life and I'd see things all the time. I tell my dad my mom would just keep telling me I was strange Compared to the others. I was strange. Well, RJ was there. He was kind of strange too. Anyway, um, But but yeah, I I knew this inside Christ is real and he's in me And I would tell other kids and they go what what what? How can I see him? I know you need to invite him in yourself But that was the atmosphere we grew up in so for the Holy Spirit that was normal Uh, I wouldn't say familiar at all. I'm not familiar with going places I'm always undone when he takes me but that is choice but but that's why I was sent And I was choosing in a generational line of many people for generations who love god serve god Obey god. I was part of that generational. So this is actually a generational thing. I'm doing That those who went on before me in these generations whose platform or whose steps I followed in I was chosen this time to do this.

This is the end of this video. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. We were in Korea. We took on Marines and headed to Vietnam to evacuate refugees. We had no idea what we were going to find. I don't even know that I necessarily knew my dad served in the Navy at that point. The war wasn't a popular war and we weren't popular because of that. So I never talked much about who I was or what I was. I turned on the TV and I sat on the bed with my wife. And I watched the people running from the buildings. And I turned to Judy and I said, I've seen this before. She said, where? I said, Vietnam. I said, where do you think you have PTSD? And I said, how could I dock? My boots never hit the ground. My time when born in the Durham was when I grew up. I guess I got a foundation of what I wanted to be and who I wanted to be. Amazing story, amazing story. I hope you'll get it. It's on both YouTube and Rumble. In fact, let's pull up that sheet here. Thank you, Emily. So it's on the Rumble channel. It's rumble.com slash American Warriors 22. And then on the YouTube channel, this is the same YouTube.com slash American Warriors 22. So don't miss that. It's on either one of those channels. We're just doing a lot of great service to the veterans of the nation from all the wars. World War II, Vietnam, Korea. We'll be doing things probably in front regarding those who are in Fallujah or Iraq or all of those places. There's stories, many, many, many hundreds or thousands of stories to tell. But Bible says no greater love does anyone have that except when they lay down their life or another. And that's what these people are doing. So we want to honor them strongly. So all right. I think that's it for our announcements. So without further delay, let's bring in Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go. Hey, there he is. There she is. Someone needs to square. You realize how was this? There she is. There she is. Hey there. Yeah. They're squaring your camera up. Well done. Yeah. Well, you know, we kind of got on last minute today. So welcome back, Kat, as always. So good to see you. How is your, this is the beginning of your day, even though it's two o'clock, right? Yeah, it is. I get up probably around noon. I did go to bed this morning at almost 7 30 a.m. Wow. Sleep at least four hours because I'm up for 20 hours every day. I've been packing because if you all don't know, we're moving not out of the city. We are moving and I'm right now sitting in the midst of everything's, a lot of it's packed. So I had to unpack stuff to get ready for today. Really point where you know, you're going to be done in a few weeks. So, but you got to kind of keep stuff out to put on. And I bought some stuff for my trip to warrior, Alabama, which I'm very excited about that. So it's just been not as easy to get stuff out and get it ready because place has to be painted. The flooring has to be replaced and you know, a few other things. So we're right there at that, that ready to cross over into our new home, which I'm very excited about. But I'm happy I'm here and I'm happy I'm here right now on the earth. I'm very excited. The father's been speaking to me about quite a few things. I can probably mention a couple. I can't tell you the other things right now, but he will tell you eventually. Okay. I am going to mention again about the storm that came through. And I want to thank all you weather warriors. I know you, you know, now the minute something comes up, the tip of Africa, which is where most of these storms form and come across here to, to America and had its normal MO the way it normally operated would come straight across, you know, the Atlantic and then just hit the whole east coast and go up the east coast in New York sometimes. But the weather warriors have been taking authority over the weather, especially the storms. We haven't reached, you know, as powerful as Christ did, but that is his goal for us to speak to the land, see in the air for anything's causing issues and to make it straighten up. And we know that Jesus stopped the storms. We have a right to do that. We actually should be doing it on a regular basis. So we did start attacking that storm, sending the host to shred the bands of the storm so that the eye would not be formed. And we started doing that right away. Well, the storm changed many times. If you haven't heard this report. And at the very last moment, I actually hit it with my staff. I said, you're not coming to my city. You have no right to be here. And it had already by that at that point was downgraded from crossing over land. We really did what they said it would, because we have the final say. We as the body of Christ have the right to not have destruction done to our lives, to our property at any time whatsoever. And so when I did that, it went around Jacksonville actually went off a shore early and it never actually fully came through our city at all. But I did go up to the beach anyway. And I kept speaking against it, telling it that it would not do severe damage to people that would go up these coast and come inland or bring some relief about a third of our country right now is actually in drought. So you need to be praying for low pressure system to people who are in those drought areas so that rain will come and nourish the earth and nourish the land. And that's why the father made weather. He never made it to destroy that's the enemy's plan. So I just want to give an update on that that we were all busy. Many thousands of people were praying. Thank you for your prayers. And a lot of miracles have happened. I'm probably get some of those together. Maybe the next time I'm on, I can read some of the miracles that happened during the storm. But you know, God's ear is always tuned into us, his children. So thank you all for praying. Thank you all those who helped in those cities. Thank you for the volunteers are still out there cleaning up other places. I think I don't know if it's South Carolina, Virginia and North Carolina, one of those were kind of were hit, but not as severe as they said. So thank you for your prayers. They do make a difference. It's awesome. Now, Kat, you mentioned a second ago, you're going to be with, you're going to be a warrior Alabama with Robin bullet. Go ahead and put up that slide. They, it says the church international, which is Robin bullet, Robin and Robin. You can just watch the name or both Robin welcomes Kat October 15 and 16. So I assume by this announcement that there must be some seating laughter. Is this, is this tickets or is it first come, first server? Do you know? I think it's first come, first served. Now he is in his new place. He has a place that's still in warrior, but it's much bigger and of course more improved. He was in a place that maybe could hold maybe 200 people, I think, and they would, they began to get so overwhelmed. They could not get all the people in there. Wow. When I came, they couldn't, they were inside rooms. They had cameras in there and people were so excited to, to get to hear the prophets that really do know what God is saying. And I really am looking forward to it. I helped to, when he first found the place, I actually was there in the city and prophesied over it and said what God would do for him and what would happen. He would have that piece of land. It's very strategically located. Two places you should always look for. If you're, if you're building a place that God is going to do stuff from, you should live on the highest hill in the area. Oh, wow. Oh, really? In the center is where you need to be. The center is very important because the epicenter of anything is where the hardest thing hits and that includes the power of God. And I do know that's what's going to happen there. So I'm very excited about being there and getting to bless his place, the place that God gave him there. It's going to be very powerful. And that is, that is this hell from that place and also all over this earth just because that we're both there together, speaking and speaking for God. That's good. I just realized, yeah, that's like three days away. Yeah. 15 and 16. So they've written me a note and I assume they'll put this underneath your comments under YouTube. I'm sorry, under rumble. We're not on YouTube. It's a 204 camp drive in warrior Alabama. They said it is free. No registration is required. And services will also be live streamed. So if you can't go, you can watch it. I'm assuming those are probably, do you know if those are evening only cat or do you know? I probably think Sunday isn't Sunday is Sunday morning. Okay. That's okay. I'll make sure I sleep later. Yeah. Saturday night and Sunday morning. I think that's when the meetings are and I'm telling you their worship is really out of this world. Really is like very powerful stuff happen. Angels come and go and things happen even during the worship. And, but I'm excited to be with someone who understands and believes not just having, but the heart of the father and how God operates and what's going on in the spirit realm right now. He's very big and understanding of the spirit realm operations and has been involved in a lot of stuff for God doing things like that. So, and I call her lady Robin, by the way. Yeah. Robin and lady Robin. Robin and lady Robin. So by the way, they're telling they've typed in this. So on Saturday is seven PM central time, which is their time period and Sunday is 1045 central 1045 AM central. So it's one evening and the evening in the morning. Okay. It's in the morning where the day that Robin and cats. Yeah. That's going to be awesome. So now I'm going to go into questions on having anything else. Make sure I give you time. Anything else? Any other questions? That's it right now. Okay. So I'm going to start with it again. Anyone that may be new cat has been to heaven. He catches you up. And would you tell people, you know, Paul, it's believed that Paul went up to the third heaven that it was himself. He was writing about. He said he didn't know if he's in the body or out of the body. So how would you describe it when he catches you up out of the body in the body? What would you say? I understand that also. I know Paul did. He went a couple of times. I think John, the beloved, has one of the best examples in the book of revelation. I think revelation four, where he talked about when he was in the spirit on the Lord's day, that's the way he lived in the spirit. It means many things can happen that don't normally happen. And that's when he heard the voice and he was told, you know, and he saw a door open and they, they took him up. He literally went up to heaven and was standing for the throne of the father. I don't know if you all realize this, but in the book of John itself, and I'm talking about revelation right now. This is much later in his life when he would say, you cannot see the face of God and live. And yet God on purpose, the father caught him up before his throne. And he saw that living rainbow. He even says it in there. He saw the rainbow like unto an emerald. That was probably the color of teal. And he saw him described him, the fire in his eyes, the lightning, the thunder, the living creatures. I mean, that was a very accurate description of what I see when I'm taken there, but he was taken before the father's throne. Jesus is not the one who has the rainbow coming in out of him. That is the father. And I know the father did that on purpose because here's John living a righteous life on the earth, still carrying out what he was sent here for. And yet he was caught up to heaven without dying and saw the face of God himself. So that tells you right there, if it's God's choice, yes, it can happen. And because you're born again, you're dependent of your sins, you're righteous. You have entrance into heaven. You have the ability to, when you pass from this world, to go live in heaven. But the fact that he could see the father's face before he died is very significant because he was born again, you know, filled with Christ, doing his work that God gave him to do. His sins washed away. That gave him the ability at that time to be caught up and shown the throne of the living God and all the things that go on there. Paul was so overwhelmed because I think so many years later, there was more things that could be understandable to John. I'm sure that what Paul, you know, Paul didn't know what in the world to say to people about what he saw there. There's so many things that are so supernatural, unless God pulled you on purpose to explain and gives you revelation about what those are. Revelation changes everything that comes from the heart of the father. And the Bible says, we shall not live by bread alone, but by every word spoken from the mouth of God. So yes, God can give people things directly from him to say on the earth. And there's a scripture right there to prove it. And that's what he does with me. He'll come in person or he catches me up to heaven or other places in heaven. I've been taken back in time, forward in time. And let me tell you something. If you're a believer, you've already been from the beginning to the end and the end to the beginning before he made the earth. He could time came from the father. He could go back as far as he wanted or even forward into eternity if he wants to. And we all lived in him when he did that. And we would ride out on the rays of that rainbow that comes in and out of him like the northern lights. That's what we used to do when we lived in him. And him you live, right? You move, you have your very existence. And that would be in the father that we lived in him. He is our father. So there's some correct scripture revelation for you. And one, I like to bring this up every few months for those who may be new is you tell an experience once where you were, you, you're shopping, you lift up to get something on the shelf by the time your hands up there, suddenly you're caught up. You have an experience. I don't remember if it was minutes or hours or longer. And then you have the experience. You come back and your hands still up there and you put it in the basket. Am I saying that about right? Yes. But in heaven, there's no real time. Yeah. They don't have clocks up there. They don't have to keep time because you're living in eternity right now actually. But there is a difference on how long I can gauge that by how long I'm not here or I'm taking my spirit. Man is taken out of my body. My body is kept alive by Holy spirit. And like the thing in the grocery store, I'm sure seconds, probably maybe three seconds, two seconds go by. If you're going to reach for something, I use my cup for an example. If this is on the shelf, let me get in there. This is on the shelf in the store, right? And I'm reaching for it. I touch it. He takes me to heaven. My hand is still in the store on the thing. And a second later, I'll be back and put it in the cart. But in heaven, I could have been taken to three or four different places in heaven and shown that. That is the beauty of heaven, that there's no real definition except, you know, how many places you saw. And even though I was gone for a few minutes down here, because that's eternity and there is no time, I could go to several places. I do know one time I was taken for four hours Earth time. I just happened to glance at my clock right when he's told me I'm taking you. And then I was gone when I was back in my body. Four hours Earth time had passed. And that was when he was teaching me about the keys to the kingdom, how to bind and loosen things from your soul. So your soul can be free that it can prosper. Well, and when you, when you say it was four hours at Earth time, because you, you saw it on the clock, would you have, if someone had said when he got back, you told Jen, your sister, this has just happened to me, if you were to describe all the things that happened during that four hours, would it have seemed like it would have taken longer than four hours? If that had happened in Earth time, do you see what I'm saying? What might, I know there's no time in heaven, but if you had done all those things on Earth, would it have taken four hours or maybe a lot more than four hours? Would you guess? I, I, I can't gauge that. The spirit realm is so different from this natural realm, this physical realm. Every moment passes by in this physical realm. So you know what that time is allotted for. And that's why people can plan events and stuff. That's how they have to plan. I mean, in heaven, the events could just go on and you go right to another one, or you get to go visit other people. And you don't have to have an appointment to do that. You don't have to have a schedule thing for that to happen in heaven. It's just life. It's just the way life is. I did get shown a lot though. And I have great understanding not only of how our soul operates, but what our soul looks like. Our soul is a literal thing. It's not just a little wispy thing that appears and disappears. It's one of the, it's the very core and heart of our spirit man is where our soul is. It's your mind, what you think about your will and your emotions. Now in saying that, I'm not talking about your brain. Your mind is not your brain. Cause in heaven, you live there when your body has died, your brain is in your body, obviously. You have buried or whatever's been done to it. You still have a mind that's a spiritual part of you that thinks and chooses and does other things. Your will also is with you in heaven. You couldn't decide what you wanted to do. And your emotions are definitely in heaven. You can be very expressive about a lot of things. So having a great understanding God calls me a soul doctor now. And he said people really want to pursue that can be soul doctors. You can help people lose things from their soul, the tragedies, the traumas, the fear, but then you bind the holy things, the powerful things, the love and the life of God to your soul. And nobody can take that out of you. When you have bound the things of God is the keys to the kingdom. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you lose on earth will be loosed in heaven. And you show me in great detail how to use those in that four hour time span that I was gone from here. Wow. Now, because you're talking about the soul, I'm going to jump to the fifth thing on my fifth question on my list. And then I'll go back to the top because this is, this will just, you know, pick you back on top of this. So a person by the name of Sunday asks, I have heard cats say that our soul does not sleep. And she said that a few times. My question is what does our soul do while our bodies are sleeping or our dreams, the journey of our soul? Now, I think this person's asking about physical sleep, but I'm thinking you might have been talking about the default doctrine of soul sleep. So I don't know for sure if she has the same angle of what you meant when you said our soul doesn't sleep, but maybe you did. Go ahead and touch on any of that that you like. Well, the one thing that they're talking about, that people think that when you die, you're doing nothing. They think that your body, you're in your body, your body goes into the earth or gets pre-made, and therefore it can't do anything. They don't understand the soul. The soul is a spiritual, fully spiritual part of you. And it says to be absent. This is when you pass away. The Bible says to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord that clearly tells you when your body dies, out of this body steps your spiritual body that looks like you, but much younger, is very aware of everything. It has memory. It still has emotions. And the excitement fills your spirit man because you know you're going home to heaven. When you step out of this body, the body, when the dead in Christ shall rise is your body you had. And then the soul, that spirit man, when soul will be joined back together on the day the dead in Christ shall rise. All those living in heaven will come back with Christ and they will get their bodies back and their bodies will be glorified at that time. So your soul does not need sleep. It's a spiritual thing. People do not sleep in heaven. They don't need to. You don't get exhausted. Your body doesn't have to be rejuvenated. You're living in the life of God there. But your spirit man has a literal life in heaven like you sit on your furniture in your mansion because you're in a spiritual realm. Those are spiritual things prepared for you. Your mansion is a spiritual thing, but it's literal because it's in the spirit realm. You, therefore, in that spirit realm can eat amazing food. You can go places, do things. So your spirit man is very active in heaven while your body is resting because it died. Some people don't even understand something that simple. But your spirit man still can make choices and understand things, get more revelation. You can learn to do new things in heaven. And so people are very active in heaven. No one's sitting around just resting in the arms of the Lord. If they did it, it was just because they loved him when they were near him, but they're not literally sleeping. And so your soul person, your soul and your spirit do not need to sleep. And sometimes he will catch you up and do his things with that spirit man while you're sleeping. And people have already proven that because they go into a foreign country. People recognize him later, say, you came and prayed for me and they never left their bed. And so you have your soul that are all you. I know this is really deep for some people, but that's how he can take you somewhere more than one place at the same time. And that will begin the increase. Oh, really? He can take a person more than one place at the same time? Yes. Oh, I haven't heard you say that one. That's interesting because you've taught about layers for years and years. So I've heard that. I didn't realize. So I've had people thank me for being in Argentina and different places. They've thanked me for. And I never was there to my knowledge. I mean, I've never been there on purpose. Okay. And yet they've thanked me for coming. And so that happens. But you're saying he could take me to Argentina and New Mexico at the same time. Yes, because you have layers of you. And actually the father's probably got more than anyone else, but the father is a many layer being. Holy spirit is a many layer being. It's one of the ways we're made in their image. Our soul has layers. The layers are not like this. They're like, I'm going to have to bring a model of something. But I've already got, I've already drawn the human soul, the spiritual one and one that would look like a model you could hold in your hand, take apart, understand how you're made. But that's one of the beautiful things about being made in their image. They all have layers of themselves in their soul. That's how Holy spirit can be everywhere, all at the same time. And if you, if you get born again, invited Christ in your heart, then it says he moves in. It says that he lives in you. It says that. And then he can influence you from inside, but you can also and then invite Holy spirit to indwell you. And then he takes a layer of himself literally and sends it to you when you invite him in and he moves in there too. And then it says in the Bible, when Christ sent him, he walks alongside you. But when we start inviting him, which is what he wants, you give him permission to indwell you, then he can speak to you from inside. So you'll hear him all the time speaking. Now I've heard, I've read where Paul said, at least in one place, he talked about, I think some of it was when he was disciplining the church, but there might have been another time when he said, when you're there and you come together, I'm with you in spirit. And I always thought that meant I'm with you. I'm with you in spirit. I'm for you. But I think, does it mean more literally like he really was there? I think sometimes he probably was there to observe. Yeah. Sometimes he sends you places to observe things. Sometimes you actually speak to people. Sometimes he makes it like you're in a place praying for people or even part of a meeting somewhere. And that has happened to several people and not just several quick, excuse me, quite a few people who've had that happen to them on a regular basis. And that is one of the things, if you give permission to the Father, the Holy Spirit to use you in any way they want to, but it's going to begin to increase because we can, in the natural, be in other places at the same time, but in the spirit we can, if that's what the Father wants, can take us to different places. And your layer of you looks just like you. Looks just like you in there. Yeah. Do you, do you recommend maybe not even just once, but every night when you go to sleep, say, Lord, if you can use me while I'm asleep, I give that permission to do that. I would totally say that. Every night even. You say it as often as you want to, because when you begin to show him, you believe that it's possible. You believe he does do that. And he did it in the Bible with Philip. Now, Philip, he just transported him physically in places, which he also can do that. And he looked for Philip, you know, he ran right up next to the chariot, that tells you how fast he was running. And God had an appointment with him to speak to that person in the chariot. And when he was done, he was no longer there. I said he was no longer found, but he was found in another place. So there are examples in the Bible about being transported in the spirit, but people don't understand what they mean. So some of them don't read them. There is a question that I think is one of the best as a supernatural God, because everything has the ability and made us in certain ways that he can do things like that with us. Now there's a question also on my list today that says, from Simone and the question is, when Jesus lived on the earth, did he still have layers of himself in heaven when he lived here? That's the question. Um, I don't know that he did. I think when he came that was, that was that had to totally be him that had to be his. He was in his spiritual body, but God put flesh on him. It says the word was flesh. He had flesh put on him. Jesus used to be all spiritual body. He was a spiritual being. He didn't have flesh on him at one time. But when he said yes to come and die and walk this earth as a human so that people would know he was here, know he was real, then he had to have flesh put on just so people could see him. He has still got that flesh. He's got the same flesh. You can see the holes in his hand. And actually, they're in the wrist. You can see all the things on him from his crucifixion. He actually does have his immortal body. He's in his immortal body, but looks very similar to what he did when he walked on this earth. Yeah, so good. OK, good. Now, here's a Daisy, age 11, is asking this. Was it the Holy Spirit's horse named Thunder, one of the horses in the chariots of fire that took Elijah to heaven? OK, so that's the question. I guess you must have said that the Holy Spirit had a horse named Thunder. I haven't heard you say that. OK, so I don't want to know if that's the same horse that took Elijah. That's what they do. I'm not sure which horses were used. I'm sure there was more than one, though, to take that chariot. Jesus does have a horse named Lightning. And when he says in the Bible, my Lightning goes from the east to the west. He's not talking about natural Lightning, but he's talking about his horse that he rides. He rides it quite a bit in all over heaven, outside of heaven. And Holy Spirit, and he do ride together sometimes. And that was probably especially before he had flesh put on him. They're very close. I mean, they are all God. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is a triune Godhead, which means that they all rule together. But they each all have their own body. And some people picture, because it's a spiritual body, that you can't actually see it. But that's not the way it is in heaven. So that is, I know for sure, it probably was Lightning since Jesus sent that chariot. He sent that. The Lord of Hosts, I'm sure some of the hosts were even present also when Elijah was caught up in that chariot. But that was a physical thing that happened. And yet he was still seen, especially by Elisha. I did see him go up in that chariot. OK, cool. Now, Kathleen is asking, will tattoos show on a resurrected body? So your resurrected, will tattoos still show? I can't say that they would, because that was something you had done on the earth. And I do know that when your body is resurrected, it's going to be new. It's going to look young. I don't know that you will keep marks from the earth at that time on your body. I know that God's going to put some on you when you get to heaven, it says so. So God puts a mark in your forehead and a mark in your hand. It says that in the Bible, the city of your God and your God, you'll be marked with those marks in heaven. So in other words, if you had other ones that stayed on you, he wouldn't be able to do that without erasing them. So I believe probably that when you get your resurrected body, I don't think that there'll be earthly tattoos on me at all. OK, good. Yeah, you know, I'm being the purist. My idealist is maybe a better word. I don't like the idea that Jesus still has holes in his hands in heaven. I want him to be all healed up. But I get the point. We can see what he did for us. But I find myself often when you describe that, I go, I don't want him to have holes anymore. I want him to be healed. It's the evidence. It's the witness. It really is the witness that it's him. And he loves those marks because he did for us the fact that they pulled the wool over Satan's eyes. In other words, Satan would not have ever wanted to kill him, had he known what was going to happen after that, that he would show up in hell, wipe up hell, take the keys of hell, death and grave, and we very jumps on off of Satan, which the Lord did that right before he came out of the grave when he was down in hell. It says he crossed over hell. And so he would have never, ever wanted for that to happen. And yet he encouraged them to crucify Christ, although that was the plan for Christ to give himself. And he said, no man takes my life, but I lay it down. He actually said that about Calvary, that he laid that life down. So I don't think had they wanted to kill him and he wasn't supposed to do that, they could have never killed him. I have a question about hell, you talked about Hitler is now, even literally, on a meat hook in hell. You said that. And last time you were on, we talked about there is no let up that the punishment is forever and ever and ever. And you mentioned that in so many words. So my question is, are the people like Hitler suffering? I don't know how to ask the question. Are they suffering much worse than someone that just says, I don't want Jesus, I don't believe in it. I'm sorry, I just don't want it. And that person now doesn't go to heaven. Is suffering equal? Or is there some that are tortured more than the other? I think the more evil you are, he puts it in their face. Because they think they do. Most evil people who have actually made a covenant with Satan to be evil on the earth and Hitler did do that, he thought and was promised a position. And Satan has always done that. You all remember when Christ was in the wilderness and that was his time of temptation. And Satan appeared to him and he said, you see all these amazing, beautiful cities that belong to me. I will give you them if you bow down and worship me. And that's what he wanted. Of course, Christ said, get away from me. He only serves the living God. But even that happened then, because that was his mode of operation, Satan will go to people who don't care about life itself that want to be wicked and he'll make a pact with them. If you're as evil as this and tell somebody he wants them to do, I will give you power on the earth. And then when you get to hell, I will give you places to rule and reign. He gives nobody anything except torment. And he makes it, he mocks them in hell. He just got them to be stupid enough to be wicked for him thinking he was going to celebrate that. Let me, oh, excuse me, I've got to take a drink, just a minute. Go ahead, take a drink. I'll do that too. Well, no. Yeah, so because there's a part of me that says if somebody just, I don't want this Jesus, I don't believe it, I think it's a fairytale and they just reject him, that seems like a hugely different thing than what Hitler did and some people who are torturing children. And so I wondered if their punishments were very... It is worse. It definitely is absolutely worse. But the thing is, God desires even the violent sinner to be free because of the price his son paid, the price he paid for sending his son that is available to anyone who will receive it. It's not God's wish. And I don't think hell was ever created for people to suffer in, that was a place for the demons to stay until their extreme punishment, even they get punished later, they won't have any ability to rule. And I do want to make one actual comment. They are tortured, everybody in hell is tortured by all kinds of horrible things up until the day that the dead in Christ rise and even after the tribulation and all that time is over when it's all over that God intends to do, Christ ruling on the earth, that big final last battle when the last one is sent from God himself to be born in the earth, time will be no more. The Bible says that at that time, we will all be in heaven, of course, being celebrating and everything, hell will be empty. There will be a time when hell is empty because that's not their final place of torture. The lake of fire is clearly talked about in the Bible. They will all be thrown into the lake of fire that will not be on the new earth or even around the new earth that will be in a whole different place. And that's where they will spend eternity burning in this lake. And even Satan will have no power in that place. Nobody will have power and it will be their captive prison for all of time. They will be let out from hell so the books can be read. We will not be at that. We will not be at the great white throne judgment. That is for the wicked. So you will not be present there and God will read all the sins they did and the rejection of Jesus Christ and why they made their own choice and they're gonna know why they made that choice and then they will be cast into the lake of fire. So there's something worse than the torture that in torment that goes on hell now but everybody will be tormented the same at that time. It won't be like different, different, different things. And we've covered this a number of times what I'm about to ask. And that is God will, if people are praying and standing for a loved one, you've said many times he will then obligate himself to answer that prayer by going to them at the moment of death and say, do you want me now? It gives them one last chance. So it's not like someone said, I don't believe it. I think it's a fairy tale. They'll have an opportunity for a moment in time at least to see him in his glory and then reject him or not reject him. Am I saying that right? I think anybody who has somebody passionately praying for them to know Christ and you know that they'll have the opportunity, but he has the keys. That is the clear evidence, Steve. That's why he took the keys Christ when he was on the before the third day, end of the third day, when he was resurrected and came back into the tomb. The last thing he did was wipe up hell. He literally melted the faces of principalities and powers. Those are high level demons that sit on thrones around the world. They do not live in hell. I mean, people don't understand that type of thing, but they were called into hell to see Satan torture the son of God. Yes, that was the plan on their side. It never happened. Then he took every gemstone off of Satan, which was his pride. He took them off of him and took them back that God had put on him. And then the last thing he did was take the keys of hell, death and the grave. The Satan did not have supreme authority to hold people there. If there was a reason why that was given, the Bible says it's appointed unto man once to die. And then at that moment, the judgment, that's not the judgment seat of Christ and that is not the great white stone judgment. At the moment they died, there has to be a judgment. Does he have the right to go to them and say, do you want me now? Are there prayers that have been put forth for this person that he can use that key, whether it is as they're entering into hell, as they're being buried or at their moment of death. Those are time, those are like windows of time that he's allowed to use those keys, not years later, not months later, he can do that. But it's appointed unto man once to die and at that time, the judgment is made in heaven. Can Christ go to them? That's why it's important to never stop praying for your loved ones, those who are like your loved ones, that they will know Christ, that they will be in eternity with you, don't stop praying that. And Christ said to tell people when I came back, they will be surprised when they get there, some of them, even though they prayed for them, to find out that they actually did go there. And of course, he has to ask them, he doesn't just say, I'm here to take you, he must ask them, do you want to receive me now? And then they still have to repent and repent to him. There's a few, I don't know how many, but there's a few who said, no, I'm not wrong with you. And you would think they've become so insane that they just don't want anything to do with them and then that seals their. That seals the weather. So either, I think I asked you this about it because this was the thing when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, some people were declaring her already in hell suffering. And I didn't feel right to me, not that I claimed to know whether she was or not, but I know whole women's groups who stood for Ruth Bader Ginsburg for years and years and years. So God, by that, God would have obligated himself to give her one more chance. If everything you're saying is true, which I believe it is, he would have said, do you want me now? And I'm sure we probably did do that. And I can also say this that I personally know there's been a group of people for almost 60 years praying for celebrities in Hollywood to know Christ. Wow. They've been praying that they even, I even got one of the lists one times of all those that they were praying for. Some of them are still alive on the earth, but I have seen, I haven't had time to write a list down or anything, but I've seen a few of the celebrities in heaven because they did either at that moment of death or them knowing. Now, it was easier back in the day when people knew and believed there was a God and there wasn't heaven in hell. A lot of people would have at that last moment say, hey, I'm receiving Christ. They would have automatically done that, knowing where they would go. But in this world today, that's not even taught a lot in a lot of places. But I'm grateful to God that he did allow that window, those windows of time. And that's why Christ, one of the reasons why he had to die. And you know, people go, well, it was finished. It was finished on the cross for your sin. But he had to go back and take back our power and authority and dominion. He gave Adam and Adam gave it away to the devil. There had to be a way that somebody could enter into that realm and because they were righteous, had the right to take it back. And that is exactly why, one of the reasons why Christ didn't just go back to heaven the minute he died when he left his body. He asked his spirit to leave his body. It didn't go up to heaven at that time. And even when he comes out of the grave later and Mary sees him, he says, I have not been to the Father yet. So that clearly tells you he didn't go up to heaven when he died on the cross. He descended into paradise, which is where he counted people faithful because they believed in God himself. And when they died, they were taken to paradise, which is still sort of in the middle of the earth, but you can look down and down and across. You can see where the gates of hell are. These are spiritual places. You're not going to go down there and find the people. But it does talk about Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and that Christ went and led captivity captive. That means he captivated them with his death and with his willingness. He went down there to share the gospel to them, number one. And then he went across on his own, which no one had ever done to show up at the gates of hell. So he could then on that day, when the Father made it known, it was time for him to stand up and the power of God shot through him. And he basically wiped up hell at that time before he went up and got his body back. Awesome. All right, this is probably a quick answer, almost a yes or no kind of. Mary is asking, do you by any chance know if Vincent Van Gogh is in heaven? I don't know. I haven't, I don't know. I haven't seen him. Yeah. I know that we get lots of questions that it's not like God takes you all over to heaven and shows you 2,300 people. No. Yeah. So, okay, Simon asks, it's humanly possible to speak something into, oh, I guess. Oh, okay. This is a statement on a question at first. It's humanly possible to speak something into existence as we are made in the image of God. Success coaches call it manifesting and meaning the secular world do it to create a life they love. What does the Father think of this? And can we as believers use this gift in a similar way, or does he want us to do things different? So what, how? Well, there are some things that people in the secular world kind of understand. They're not sure exactly how that kind of thing operates, but I'm telling you the manifested sons and daughters of God are mentioned in the Bible itself. It says the earth is crying out and is in travail. So a lot of the stuff going on in the earth right now isn't saying the end is here to get out. It's the earth saying, okay, manifest sons are a stand up and start speaking of the power of God and the life of God into this world that needs it. So things can change at different times on the earth when we do that. I mean, it's gonna happen. That's one of the reasons why Jesus isn't coming to take people away in an escape plan, okay? He's coming to set us on fire with baptism and fire to let us allow us to carry the glory of God and release it all over the earth. This is the knowledge of the glory and the understanding of the glory of God will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea. That's us taking it and shock waves of that will go through the earth and things will happen immediately. There's too many things left that we have to do that the Bible says we will do, but a manifest and son and daughter to God is that, that this talked about in the word. It's us going to higher levels, believing in God and knowing him, understanding what he wants done and knowing that we are allowed to do these things because it was given to us by Christ to do these certain things. So I don't know about what they're doing or what a man themselves are doing. I do know people do get what the ideas do come from heaven and many of those are just taken to the earth and they go around there to drop into the mind of man so that certain things can and will be created. But as far as that statement, I'm not sure probably. Well, and you know, there's just me guessing what he means, but could he mean, I think as Job, it says he decreed a thing and it was so, you believe probably and I mean, do you, have you seen the father talk to the father about our responsibility to decree things on this earth? We send the host, but what about decree? I decree God's best and life for me and for my family. I decree that, you know, what about that? It's similar to sounding than what he's saying. Can we be clarifying? I think that what he's talking about is making things happen. Oh yes, some things actually will be formed. I mean, there'll be a point where we go and speak to the desert and command vegetation to come up. And it will. Okay, well. Now we don't want that thing. Yes, that is gonna happen. It will, we will speak to the land to see in the air and things will happen immediately because we have to manifest. One of the things God wants done is we have to manifest the presence and the power and the existence of Jesus Christ. And of course, the father and Holy spirit, that's going to happen and it is up to us. One of our assignments is to do that. In different times on the earth, there are always things given to man, especially those who believe in God, that things would happen, things would change, things would be built. We're in a transition right now, a very powerful transition of things like that, beginning to happen. But I have been seen and taken and shown that the mass that died, there'll be, I've already been shown, there'll be a mass death in a land, not here, it wasn't here, not knowing exactly what the land was that they were spoken to. All these bodies were laying there and they spoke life of God into them. And everyone in that whole bunch came to life. Oh, wow. Those kind of things are going to happen, Steve. They have to happen because manifest means to clearly and plainly make known who you believe in and who you serve. And that is why it's called a manifested son and daughter of God. It's not going to be everybody in the body that does it, but there'll be those who choose it, no matter what he wants or when he wants it, you're going to say yes to it and you continually obey. And if you keep obeying, you could do a point in your life where you learn the joy of obedience. And from that time, he doesn't no longer judge you on whether you did something or didn't do something because it's already in you and a part of you, then he will give things to you because of your love, is your love extravagant, are you helping others? It's, there's a whole process to being in the manifested son and daughter, but if the earth itself is crying out for it to happen, it's going to happen, it's going to happen. There'll be people do things like raise the dead that was cremated. That's the manifested son or daughter of God speaking to the earthquake in the middle of the earthquake and telling it has to go back and the dead will be raised. It's going to happen. So those things you're learning about, the clearing and decreeing, yes. It's powerful, it's not ruling. At the death of Christ, the earthquake and the graves were open and some saints were seen walking around. We don't know how many it doesn't say how many. Maybe there's a thousand, maybe there's 26. I don't know, maybe there's 20,000, but whatever that number was, will we see something like that on the earth before it's all finished, on a sinful earth? I'll just put it that way. We'll see that. Okay, go ahead. I don't know if that is what will be happening soon as the sons and daughters. I think when there's like, I don't know. I don't know how these people died. There were like thousands of them. Really? Wow. I don't know where it was. The young purpose probably didn't tell me where it was, but I was taken into the future before 2030. This will happen. This will happen before 2030. Before 2030, it will happen. And none of the bodies look like nobody was like blown up or none of that. I mean, I could clearly see the bodies. I was walking down this road. It was like a dirt road, like a sandy kind of a dirt road. And we rode in the Jeep. I actually was riding in the back of the Jeep. And I would probably assume I was there to raise the debt. Wow. And it just didn't look like it had been, just like it had been a recent death. Like it had just kind of happened. Okay. I haven't really explained this much to many people, but yes, this is like a whole town somewhere. Wow, okay. And the people were just all they had time to do. And they obviously knew that was gonna happen. Whoever was driving knew I was there for that. Oh, really? You will do this. He actually said, you will do this. But not just me. Other manifested sons and daughters will do. It's going to happen. See, it has to happen. If God said, can these dry bones live? And he said that as an example, you know, to the prophets that could these dry bones live? And finally he said, guys, he said, well, you know only, you know that, but they did come to life in front of him. And all that, I mean, everything that sent you, everything came back. And now those, those were really dead bones. Well, yeah. That's all we're not like that. You couldn't tell anything had happened. Like they weren't shot. They weren't bombed. Okay. Anything like that. But they only had time to wrap them. And they had just wrapped them on. They were just stacked. And I knew that that's what he had me there for. So I will say, I know that's going to happen. The only shows me reality. He doesn't show me symbolism. Yeah. Yes, literally. What will happen. And that really, actually, honestly, that's pretty close to the exact answer I was looking for. I don't think it had to be in my mind, people shaking earthquakes and the dead coming out. And more like, will there be groups of people is what I was asking that will suddenly be raised from it. I suppose there could have been, therefore on another time, a 9-11 type thing where 3,000 perished and someone manifested sense might be clear, something like that. Resurrections. And it's kind of like that that you're describing, honestly. I'm quite positive that that is why. One of the reasons why it is not the end. Because we are entering into a supernatural time where things will happen that nobody ever expects. The God would have already prepared the heart of these people. And they would have already been going towards total surrender of their life. I'm not talking about being born again. You're already, these people are going to be born again. But then getting to the place where, wherever you want to send me, wherever you want to take me, I'm giving you permission. You need to do it ahead of time, people. And then you stay in that place with him and build that relationship with him. He wants you to know him. I'm talking about Christ. He wants you to know him. But these things are clearly going to happen. The Bible talked about them happening. And that is why the earth is saying, okay, things are getting really bad. You need to stand up and start taking authority because Christ said himself, you will rule with me in this life. That's not just a statement. He wasn't just making a statement. He was talking about things that will happen. Ruling and reigning is dominion and authority at great levels. That's why he says, know you not that you are kings and priests unto your God. Those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion that some will walk in. They're going to walk in that. And they will speak and the waters will part and people will walk across. They will speak and literally speak to the ground and say, come forth life of vegetation and you'll see before your eyes come up. It's going to happen. Good, good, good, good. All right, Teresa is asking this question. What does the fear of God mean? Are we supposed to be afraid of God? No, that's not what that means. Okay. I do know what that means. That means you love him so much. You would never do anything to disappoint him, to hurt him or to make him look like not God. It's a reverential fear you have that you would never want to do something in your life to cause any distance between you and him, although that would probably be on your side, that you do something so wrong that you wouldn't have a relationship with him anymore. The fear of the Lord, there is something called the terror of God. Oh, man. That is for the wicked. Yeah. I think we'll be seeing some of that soon. And let me jump off on that for a moment. You've talked about, of course, we send the host, talk about or remind me what you said about, can we send the terror of God against God's enemies? It seems like you said, you don't speak against people or cursed people, but can you send the, it seems like you said, you can't send the terror of God against his enemies. Tell me what, if you remind me what that was. God had purposed us to, this is the thing. We were given this earth. I know it belongs to the Lord. So guess what? Satan doesn't get it. He don't give a mud that belongs to him. It isn't his. It clearly says the earth is the Lord's and the fullness of what it will produce, what we're going on. It's his. This is his earth and he made this earth and he made it for a purpose. So we could be born, sent from the Father at the time of conception and knit together. And it says in the Bible, God said, I knit you together in your mother's womb. He's talking about your little spirit man that lived inside the Father. That at the time of conception, it's knit together and attached to that daughter flesh and it grows within the mother's womb. So life begins at conception, not at birth. And so that's one thing I can just add for free. The Father is furious with those trying to kill the babies, take away their destiny. He had a purpose for everyone he sent. He's not gonna long tolerate that happening. There will come a time on the earth where it will be against the law, literally against the law in these years ahead, these generations ahead of demonstrating the power and authority of Jesus Christ, his dominion, what he wants, speaking his words and that happening right away, that's what we're going into now. Darkness will be crushed and pushed back and they won't even be allowed in some cities because of the power and the glory of God in some of those cities. But I can tell you right now, the terror of God usually is set from heaven and it does affect and impact physical wicked people. They can become so filled with terror, knowing the awe of God is affecting them. Some of them will probably run to get saved. Someone even wanna live because it's so powerful but God, it gets to a place. And you saw earlier in the, even the world when the world was made, there came a time when he would not tolerate things and he finally did something. He not finally, he did something about it at that time. But that is going about to happen in our lives. And you're living in a powerful time because no matter how much darkness is there, you're about to see that darkness severed and you're about to see a crushed pushback, judgment, serious judgment come to the wicked, the physical flesh wicked who've all come together to do this thing, to try to take our lives away, freedom away everywhere, they're not gonna get to do it. It's not the little drop of time Satan has and the tribulation is a very small part of time and it's not that time. There's too much that has to happen yet. So I'm gonna say the terror of God is usually set. It was sent at one time for Israel when Egypt had stuff going on, terror came upon people even back then. And it does happen, but usually the terror of God, I had a prophet walk up to me one time. I was one person in the church who always was on the floor. You know, I was so wiped out by God that I couldn't move. And I was sitting up in a prophet game, I'm playing it and he said, the terror of God is gonna be released on the surface and you'll be able to tell the people what to do about it. Oh wow. Which was a rare thing. Yeah. So I'm just telling people right now, don't be wicked. Don't be a part, don't participate, don't tolerate them, don't advertise, stop advertising about how wicked things are going on and start talking about the power and the life of God that is much greater than all the evil that's going on. And this evil is a temporary thing, so they can be judged. They're gonna be judged by God. I'm talking about the flesh people are gonna be judged by God and they will not escape that judgment, but the terror of God will probably come a little while before that. And people, what happens is you can't think straight. This is for the wicked. Your mind will be lost. You'll be so severely confused. You won't know how to even think normally because you'll be so terrified by God's presence moving across the earth and it is going to happen. It will not hurt us, it won't affect us in that way that belonged to him. But I'm telling you, there's about to be some demonstrations that no human hands will demonstrate at this time. It will be God himself. Good, good, good. All right, Frederick asks this, what will Michael and the host, which of course is the armies of heaven, what will Michael and the host do after the thousand year reign of Christ since all evil is God? So a lot of people have that question. What do you need an army for after it's all sin free? Well, they're not quite right. Okay. There will be a battle that will happen at the end of the thousand year reign. It clearly talks about it. It's the final battle. Okay. And Michael and the host and the father, the father will send fire and burn up all the wicked on the earth at that time who come up against his son after the thousand year reign, you have to remember, there is a thousand year reign, but there's a time period after that. At the end of the thousand years, it will be loose from the bottom of the steps that he can go around the world and tempt those who probably still don't want Christ. There'll be people alive. There will be seven, eight, 900 years old. It's just going to happen because of Christ's presence on the earth. So even after the thousand year reign, there's still another season of time. The Satan will go around, try to get people to come on his side and he's going to find them. And they'll want to do a big battle. It talks about the battle. They're going to have great armies come across a certain area on the earth to destroy Christ, to take the throne away from him because Satan is still stupid and he still hasn't learned that he's not going to win. And at this time, the father will himself defend his son. Christ will not have to lift a finger because in the battle prior to that, before the thousand year reign, at the end of the tribulation, Christ will be doing something about those coming to fight and war. And a lot of people that are wicked they will die at that time. But even during the millennial reign, there will be people on the earth who didn't choose Christ, who's still alive, natural man, and they will live for hundreds of years under Christ's rulership. But at the end of that thousand year reign, Satan will be lose to tempt those to see if he can get anybody to side with him, to build war, warring equipment and do these things to remove Christ from that throne. And I tell you in that battle, there will be no decision about anybody about who's going to win. The father will send fire from him, the clitoris says, and burn up all those armies. Wow. And then, Kat, okay, after that, after the final battle, then what happens to the armies of heaven? If you know, you may not even know. I'm quite sure that they will probably get to know a lot of people that they defended on the earth. They'll be speaking a lot of places on the new earth to them and I'm quite sure they'll probably be part of, I know that there will be people that will actually be taken to a planet to make things like vegetation and places, not people, that's never gonna happen again. They won't have to make people. But I'm sure that that army will be involved with going with them to make sure everything goes okay with them, not that it wouldn't. It wouldn't be to protect. Yeah. Because we won't need protection at that time. When all that's done evil will be judged. There will be no evil on the earth, no evil in the spirit realm. And all of that will be in the lake of fire. So I'm quite sure that they have plans of things that they would like to do and get to do things besides warring because that's all they do right now. Okay, awesome. Now, Shay is the name of this person, says I'm a Christian ventriloquist. Have you seen ventriloquists using their gift in heaven? I'm quite sure that people probably do that. I don't know, I don't think I've personally seen that happen. But I do know that gifts like natural gifts that people have and that is a gift. I've known a couple of people that did it. It was amazing. They do actually do it. It's not, none of my magic people, it's not magic. It's the skill they have and they've gotten very good at it. And so I'm quite sure that that would probably be in heaven. Okay. It's the skill it's a gift. Okay, now Margaret's asking this question. I get some of it, I'm not sure I fully understand. Margaret says in heaven, will we be able to trace our spiritual line of salvation back to Jesus' meaning similar to how family trees are traced backwards like so-and-so and so-and-so. So-and-so led so-and-so to Jesus. Then that person led another and then another. So they wanted to know like, if we could go back find out who was led to the Lord, I guess a thousand years ago that ended up with me or 2,000 years ago, if we're back to Christ. I'm quite certain that you will be able to do that because I know generations are God's deals and generations, he just does. That's why it's not gonna end. Now this generation is still coming on you is that things will have to happen through them or with them. And I'm quite sure there's a way you can trace that when you get to heaven. Okay. Now we're doing a good thing. And we're Margaret, we're doing a lot of questions today. Elizabeth asked, will we still be able to have our ears pierced in heaven? I really like mine and it's really the only jewelry I wear. Okay. I think that's gonna be between you and God. I do know that there are things, I know people will have marks put on them. I don't think I've ever seen that. That doesn't mean that's not gonna be allowed if it's done with the realm of God, you know? You probably wouldn't have to actually pierce it. You probably wouldn't have to have something pierce your ear to do that is what I'm saying. Just do it. You would have a way just to put things on yourself or anywhere, wherever, without it being pierced because you'd be supernatural. It's not like on the earth where food comes from. In other words, he's not subject. He doesn't have to have either piercings or clip-ons. He could say, put it there and tell it to stay, right? I mean. I'm quite sure he probably could because I've seen people's, everybody's mansion has a wardrobe room. There's probably thousands of square feet. I've seen it. I've been, I've walked through some of those like that and the apparel you get is unspeakable. It's just not even something I can describe. Even your clothes are like alive. There's only one size made in heaven and whoever puts it on it conforms to the size of your body. So you don't have to shop through racks of clothes for things. You just pick out what you like and it fits you when you put it on. I do know that much. Speaking of clothes, this was one of mine that I could keep meaning to ask you. Every picture of God and Jesus is always a big old long robe, white usually. Maybe there's other colors. Have you ever seen anything like the father or Jesus wearing jeans or jeans like? I'm just curious if you've seen something like that. I have seen Jesus. You have? I've seen, I've not seen the father where, I'm sure if he wanted to, he could wear whatever he wanted to wear, but normally I see him in the most glorious, their gowns. Not like a, of course a woman's gown. You know, it's just like a ship kind of thing. Glorious beyond description. And he has many different robes that he wears at different times. And then maybe that will change. He may wear other stuff. I don't know on the new earth, but. But did you say you've seen Jesus wear jeans? I have seen it. There's jeans in heaven. Awesome. I like that. There are heavens brand, trust me. They have heavens brand. They have them. You don't buy them. You just can go get them anywhere. I like that. That's very cool. Because you ride horses, Steve. You can't ride horses in a gown. That's right. Oh, I like that. I'm going to ride horses too. You're not riding the rush in the gown. You're not going to swim under the crystal sea in a gown. You actually have things to use to do that with. So, but I have seen Christ attending rodeos because he loves horses. I think he's always for the horse, though, not the ride. I think he's probably there to cheer the horse out. I'm real serious about that. Yeah. That's very good. All right. Why did David Joyce ask, why did David pick up five stones and only use one? What do the other four stones represent? Do they represent our authority and power for us to use against principalities, powers, rulers, or darkness and spiritual wickedness? I mean, they're guessing, I guess. What do you know, the four represents something else? I don't know that, but as you know, this David was very wise. Yeah. And David would get as many as he thought he might need. He's never going to just take a thing. He's going to take more than one. He should something else show up or something else happen. He might need it for that other thing. He didn't know. And so, but I'm sure there was a reason why he chose that money. So you'd have extra if he needed it. Someone said he had four brothers. Yes. Someone said he had four brothers. I don't know if I've never studied that, but if he really had four brothers, and that was just in case he needed to take out the brothers, but I have heard that he had four brothers. So I think it might be the, all right. Suzanne asks. I'm sure Goliath had others around him. I know he wasn't the only giant in the land. I think it was before if they showed up, I don't think it was about his brothers. I think if the other one showed up, the giants, if more guys could take them all out. That'd be awesome. All right, Suzanne asks. If Cap could take a picture of anything in heaven, it could be a person, place or thing and show it on the Elijah list. So that's a thought question. What would it be? What would you love to take a picture of and show it if you could? There's too many things. Come up photographer. You're asking a photographer. Yeah. There's so many good things. I want to, when I go to heaven one day, I will be photographing all of heaven just because I want to do that. But I think the most significant, moving, powerful, beautiful would be the throne, the throne room. Yeah. Oh, I love to see that. I can sketch the throne room and at one point I will paint myself the throne room. One of the promises God gave me was that I will, he will make me a fine artist. Oh, wow. I don't know how far down my journey I have no end to my journey. He's not told me any end while I'm on the earth. He will let me paint heaven and it will come alive when people look at it. And that's on this earth before things wrap up. See, now that's kind of one of the questions, type of questions I've tried to get an answer for is like, what if I want to be doing something? I often think of it as in heaven, but there are certain things that I've been asking him privately to do on this earth that I was talking with him about today. I'm not going to say it here, but I'm saying, Lauren, I'm not going to keep asking, I'm not going to quit asking you to do this on this earth. And so you kind of answered that, Kat, honestly. He told me because I was willing to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted and I can tell you all, if you had stood before the throne of the living God, you would know how real he is. Just because you can't see him doesn't mean he's not real. He's very real. He has great plans. He plans well in advance. He knows what is in time and eternity, but he also sees his own plans coming to pass. That's why it's not over right now. Nothing is over, except how awesome we will be living with the body of Christ. If you can't, let me expand it. So outside the throne room with Jesus himself, if you could snap one picture of Jesus doing something outside of the throne room, what would you take a picture of him doing? Probably something he really loves to do. Probably maybe him in the gardens. He's got the most amazing gardens all over his own. He does have a mansion of his own. It's glorious. He uses it to have celebrations in. So when somebody comes home to heaven, he can throw a big celebration. Besides the throne room celebration, he'll take them there. I think also probably I've seen him with the children. I've seen him with the little babies. That would probably be something else. I would definitely want to take a picture of when he's with the little babies. Maybe they were aborted. Maybe they had become miscarried. How much he loves them. And he holds them in his hand and talks to me like that. I think probably something like that showing that he has a heart. He does. He's all powerful. He now is our king. And he says that to me all the time. When I come back, it'll be as a king. Because he already came as savior. When he comes back, it'll be as a king. Awesome, awesome. By the way, while I'm talking, put that, if the team could put up the website for people to ask more questions of Kat, we're going through them really fast right now on purpose. Questions for Kat, fill out the form and go to, they're going to put questions for kat.com, which I don't see up there right now, but I think it's going to be there in a second. All right, this is the middle of my time. We can ask a couple of quick questions here. Virginia asks, is there a place in heaven where we can watch a replay or a replays of our loved ones' reactions to their homecoming and see the joy that they experienced when they first reunited with the father and the ones who had gone on before them? That would be a cool thing. They say, what did it look like when my dad showed up? I would love, can you see anything like that? Yes, absolutely, I have seen that. And people love to do that. They have this, a place where they have many different, I call them mini theaters, and they probably maybe hold a hundred people. That's a small one, because I have been to the movie theaters, which of course is no profanity, just so you know, you can't start judging. They make movies in heaven people. Guy has always told stories. He loves to tell stories. The best movie theaters are in heaven. You're playing to be there. You better receive Jesus Christ. They capture what's being made in heaven. It's not like a film, you have to process it. But there's places you can go into. You can go into your parents' theater. They have one that shows their life really, minus any sin. No sin is shown at all, because they've already been forgiven. The great days in their life, fun times in their life, really funny times. But in that theater, towards the end of that show that you're watching, you will literally see how they were caught up to heaven. Were they taken in a chariot? Did they go in something else? What did they say? What did they see when they got out of the, there's a place you disembarked. Oh man. These things that bring you what the expression was, what they were feeling, what they were saying. And then you could go in the throne room and see their whole celebration party. Then you could see them go to their mansion that was given. God doesn't let you miss anything. You're not going to miss anything. That's good. That's really good. You know what? Then this before when we talked about the theaters down, I'm thinking, man, the popcorn's going to be so good. Oh, we do have food. Oh my goodness. Like, they wouldn't give you, they loved to eat in heaven. Oh yeah. Absolutely. I think in my first book, I described the movie theater I was taken to. Isn't that? Well, that was actually the first time I was taken. Yeah. In Christ that I was taken to somewhere fun. He said, I'm taking you somewhere fun. He said, you were so serious about everything in your life. You need to understand that we're fun. We do have fun. So I'm taking you to a fun place. And it was a movie theater in heaven. And that's when I saw John Wayne acting in a movie. And they do have popcorn and they do have snacks. And then they have another place outside within the theater where you could sit there and discuss what you saw, how excited you were. The actors who were in are right there to talk to you. Usually your family members get to start films too. Again, nothing defiling is in there. There's no profanity. And that's when God also told me, I'm going to give you what we think about the movie ratings. And he said, God said, you know how they rate movies? Yeah, yeah. You know, rubber, 17 and then R. He said, this is what we say those ratings mean. G means good, you know, depending on what the movie is about. We wouldn't say it was good if it was witchcraft. I can tell you that. But G means good in heaven. PG means partly good. Okay. PG 13 means it's got some not good stuff in it. R ratings down here. R means rotten. Don't watch it at all. And he said that to me. That's what he's saying. That's what we call those ratings. I see. Yeah, he's talking about the earthly ratings for the movie theaters. R means rotten. Don't go see it. Okay. Wow. Wow. Let me just, for the last question, let me ask this. Cause you just opened a interesting door about God took you up and a very first trip he gave you was to do something fun. Cause he said, you're very serious. Talk about what if you could, there's a bunch of people who they say, you know what? People are always telling me I'm so serious. And I know I don't want to necessarily be too serious, but what tell them the people who say, yeah, they're always accusing me of being too serious. What would you think God would want to tell them now? Right now, try to lighten up some. You know, it's okay to be serious about the Lord and, you know, and I'm not talking about change your relationship with him at all. I'm not saying that. I'm saying the way you respond to people who ask about Christ. Yes, he is a risen Lord. Yes, he died for sins, but he also enjoyed laughing. When he was on the earth, he loved to laugh. He loved to be at celebrations. He loved to attend the wedding. He loved to attend the wedding. He loved to attend the wedding. He loved to attend the wedding is essential. That's why he was invited. He was at that wedding where he changed the water into heaven's wine people, not earthly wine. He made it into heaven's wine. And he did love to celebrate. And he was quite a character. And he was really good friends with a lot of the, not just his disciples, but he had other people that were his friends. And so, you know, don't be so serious that you can't have time to smile every now and then. One of the things the Lord said, you're gonna start smiling a lot and laughing a lot more than you do, so that when you get to heaven, you'll be used to it, probably. So people can actually see that you are a happy person. Maybe you might want to know them. Maybe you'll be more a little bit approachable. I'm not telling you to go out drinking. I'm not saying to go out partying, just so you can be with people, don't do that. That messes up your testimony and your witness of how Christ lives in you. So I'm not ever gonna tell you to do that, but you need to be seen to have fun and like to have fun and to laugh at things because we have to show that we have a sense of humor sometimes. Yeah, and I think I can say without fear of being wrong. Well, because you talked about eating cake, I think I can say without fear of being wrong that you're saying God wants you to laugh and lighten up now amidst all of this COVID and geopolitical things that are going on and threats of war. He wants them to still have fun. Yeah, he's not saying to ignore the evil or wickedness, but you're supposed to rise above it and you need to let people know. I am not afraid of this. I'm not tolerating it. I'm speaking against the evil. I'm praying for people. I'm setting the army of heaven to hold on strongholds of evil in places, but I also can laugh. I need to take time to laugh. It's nice to have a balanced life. People know that they can come and see you and maybe discuss something that is fun or is exciting, even exciting. And so I would encourage people, and I know some people are having hard times, but why don't you ask? He actually had me people start asking, asking for him to let you have fun. That's good. And people don't even pay for it sometimes. So you have not because you asked not. And I know it's important to have bills paid and people healed. Those are always gonna be important and you haven't got to worry about that, but you also need to make sure that you leave room for fun in your life. And yes, it's okay to ask. Can I have fun? Can you send me some fun? Or you want me to have fun? That would probably be the best thing. Because he will surely do that for you. He will surely do that. Okay. Okay, Kat, tell people real quick about revealing heaven and catcur.com, those two, and then I'll maybe ask you to pray as we go out, but talk about those two sites real quick. Revealingheaven.com. I really didn't choose any of this stuff. I didn't choose the title of the book. I didn't choose the names of the websites. I don't choose almost nothing because I let him tell me what he needs and what he wants. So he actually named the book revealing heaven. And I had picked other names and he said, how about revealing heaven? Do you think that explains what it does? Reveals heaven? I went, yeah, I think it does. And so revealingheaven.com is our main website. It's where you can find events that are gonna be planned. It's where you can find products that he wants us to make on purpose. He wants us to reveal heaven and earth. Sometimes us to written form, spoken form, but sometimes it's through things that we make. Things you can hang on your wall, things that you can wear, things that you can drink out of, like this is our newest cup we just had made. It is a coffee cup or a hot chocolate. And so we probably will have it down at Robin's place, but it says, I don't do demons. And that is the number one quote the Holy Spirit gave me to make things out of because you're not supposed to really bash people. You're supposed to love people, but you can bash hell. And so that means I make a statement. I don't do demons, means I don't tolerate them. I don't participate with them. They were thrown out of heaven on the lightning bolt and therefore I will have nothing to do with them. I will help people get free of them, but that's about it. So that's why we make different things. So you'll find a store there that has a lot of things about heaven on there. And of course there's testimonies, I think. I think they just revamped the website. I barely got to look at it the other day and I'm like, wow, it's completely different, but it's easier to navigate through. And so there's new things on there. And then there's catcurve.com, which is a spiritual platform for the father to say whatever he wants to say and everyone wants to say it. And so there's a lot of quotes from Holy Spirit. There's a gallery that shows you what things look like in the spirit realm that we have created those things. There's also some photos there of the host and stuff there. And again, that is the only place you can give online. There is no other Facebook I've made than the catcurve Facebook or the catcurve YouTube. I don't have other places like that. I only have those two. And so that's why you go to the two different places. And if you want to give online, it's catcurve.com. And I think you click on the treasury or something like that and you can even become a member, a guardian zone member that helps to bring heaven to earth by supplying a funds for me, praying for me. And I really appreciate the guardians very much. We're gonna start some new things with them. Once we move and get our building, we're not just moving for a home. We're also looking for a building. We have an actual building that we can have our offices in. That's gonna be exciting for us. So thank you for praying for us and standing with us. And we stand with you in these times. We're not tolerating the enemy, Satan is your number one enemy and that he's just has a hold of a lot of people right now and God's exposing who is in the light, who is in the darkness, and he does have plans to do great things on this earth still. So good. So good, Kat. Kat, go ahead. If you feel like it, go ahead and pray for the people as we go out and that'd be good. That'd be awesome. Yeah, Father, I just pray right now on your behalf, God, before the throne of God, I declare and decree that this earth will be free, this country, America. America was born to be free, still is free. Yes, God's gonna do some amazing things, Father. I thank you for helping those who are in fear, who are in lack, who've had things stolen from them, taken from them, things that have been lost. I thank you for restoring them, restoring their properties, restoring their homes with even better things. God, I thank you for showing your hand of justice on their behalf and also extending the hand of life and love towards all these people out here who are praying to you, Father. I thank you for the suddenlies coming in their lives, the things they never expected to happen, will begin to happen in Jesus' name. And right now, every demon out of your home, I sever every spirit of witchcraft trying to operate against you right now, and I say to the devils, get out in Jesus' name. You have no power here. We give you no power. We give you no permission, but we rule with Jesus Christ, and you're about to see us rule and reign for many generations to come. I'm looking forward to tomorrow and the rest of my life on this earth, and I pray God that you get help wherever you are, whether it's spiritual, physical, mental, or emotional. I thank you, God, for bringing ways of healing to this nation and to this world in Jesus' name. Remember to forgive those who speak against you. It opens the door for a Holy Spirit to go pursue them. Very good, very good. Kat, thank you so much. We love you and your team. And a quick reminder that Roger Stone will be our second program today at three o'clock Pacific, six o'clock Eastern. Have a great day, everybody. Thank you again, Kat. We love you all. See y'all later, Kate. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. 

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE - Episode 99

This is the end of this video. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video. I hope you enjoyed this video. Hope you enjoyed this video. Hey, everyone. Welcome to Elijah Streams. Today is Wednesday, October 19, 2022. I'm your host, Kelsey O'Malley. I'm filling in for Steve Schultz today. We have an awesome Wednesday plan. Kat is here with us, and she's going to be sharing updates, but also answering questions that you guys have sent in. And there is a list of amazing questions. I can't wait to hear her answer because some of these questions, I myself am like, yes, yes. What does this mean? So I'm so excited to be here with all of you today. Thanks for tuning in. Thanks for being family with us and coming and watching us each and every day. Thanks for sharing the good news of Jesus to all your friends and family and just being so faithful to us. And you know, you guys, your giving has done incredible things for the people in Uganda. We want to share a video with you guys of what your giving has done for these people. I mean, fresh water is absolutely changing their lives. So take a look at this incredible video. The words that were already existing here in Uganda, we thought they were the safe ones to have, but actually they weren't safe at all. We would have to share this water with the animals. And you can imagine all the different contamination that can happen and go on in Uganda. Fetching water is done by the young children, the young boys and the girls. You had to move a long, long distance. And usually it is done in the morning and also sometimes very late in the evenings. We also have the elderly who we call the judges. These are the very old grandparents of different families who sometimes can't walk and also sometimes can't be able to carry the cans that we use to fetch the water. So they have to take days without even taking a shower or sometimes even not preparing a meal because they are saving water for the next day. I would like to say thanks to the opportunity that you guys came to this community and are changing so many lives. We appreciate you so much and may God bless you. And may God bless you, Lillian and all those sweet babies and all those people there. I just think of the scripture when Jesus says when we give a cup of cold water to one of these His disciples, our reward is great in heaven. And moving the heart of the Father looks like giving to the poor, looks like giving to those in need. And by partnering with us to do that, I mean you are really touching the heart of God and touching the heart of so many people who see His tangible love through our giving and through them building wells and it's changing lives. It's incredible that video is so touching. So thank you again so much from the bottom of our hearts for giving and partnering with us to show the love of Christ to the people all around Uganda. Thank you guys so much. If you have not yet followed American Warriors or heard of American Warriors yet, it is an amazing, incredible documentary series that Steve Schultz's Brother Warren does and it talks all about different soldiers and all these amazing stories from these men who've been through war and seen at first hand, lived at first hand. There's a brand new episode of American Warriors premiering today. You can find that on YouTube and also on Rumble. If you search American Warriors on Rumble or YouTube, you can find a brand new show going to air today. And today's show is about Les Davis. He's a 17, he was a 17 year old farm boy who joined the army to get away from home for what he expected would be an exciting adventure. He found himself in Korea within 600 men in his company caught in a brutal battle in which only he and one other survived. This is the story of his experience and how it changed his life. This here's the story of of an annoying massacre. The fighting just went on and on and on and finally I thought I better just get out of here. I started running. I think I must have run for two miles. I had no idea at the time but later on I'd found out that there was supposedly two survivors from that massacre. I didn't really think about myself as a survivor, just another soldier and I just did what I was told to do. Les, thank you so much for your service to America and for everyone that's intrigued in watching that. Please head over to American Warriors. Make sure you subscribe, click the subscribe button, the bell notification so that way you guys can be aware of when a brand new episode of American Warriors comes out. And we appreciate you guys heading over there because Warren works so hard you guys on these shows and he does an incredible job. Make sure you comment, like, share this with others, encourage these men, pray for Les Davis, pray for others, get involved in showing your love to these men who gave up so much of their life for our freedom. All right, without further ado, we have Kat Kerr coming on today and she's going to be sharing amazing stuff with us so let's bring her on and hear what she has to say. Love your intro, Kat. It's so cute. No fuzzy. It's nice to have you today. I'm happy to be here. I was just trying to tell Jen I'm a little bit fuzzy looking. You're clear to me. Okay, then it must just be my must be mine. Okay, I think I think you're clear to me. So I think you're good. But I know it says Wednesdays with Kat, but it's going to be Wednesdays with with Kelsey and Kat today. So yeah, I'm excited to be with you, Kat. I always love hearing all your revelation and your wisdom on heaven. But before we get into the questions, would you share with us any updates and amazing things that happened last weekend? Oh, yeah. It was awesome this past weekend. I was with Robin and I call her Lady Robin since Robin and Robin Bullock. And I actually got to stay in their vintage Victorian mansion that someone sold them so ridiculously wonderfully priced. And it's on the highest hill right there in Warrior, Alabama. Of course it is. And I got to speak in their new sanctuary that they had, he had bought like a shopping center in such a short amount of time. It is an amazing place. I think they went from seating like 250 to 1200 now. And it was awesome. But I got to speak twice. And then for Sunday morning, the Holy Spirit said, you need to impart the life of God to people. And that is the thing that is the thing that I carry. It's not just something. It's not just a word about something. It's not just a movement. It actually is the presence and it's the life of God. And when the Father anointed me to do this, I was not expecting what happened. It's sometimes for the very first time when I do that, people literally feel the presence, the manifest presence of God, because it's his life. It's just like standing before him almost. But it just comes out of my hands. It's like blue, it's like blue smoke or blue fire, sometimes with anointing, it's like blue fire, blue smoke kind of. And it makes a cloud that you can't always see. Some people see a little mist of it, but somebody captured a picture which really amazed me. And you literally see it coming out of my hands. I'm about to lay it on somebody's son and they took the picture. And you could see it come out of my hands, wrap around them, and then go into this cloud around the area I was standing in. And I always let people know you need to be prepared for being undone. Okay, it's not me, it's him. Totally undone. Sometimes you hear him say something. You sometimes you'll shake, sometimes you will jump, sometimes they jump. It's like getting hit with lightning sort of in some way, but the presence is so strong. People sometimes weak, sometimes they laugh, but they don't stand up for very long. And it even goes to the people, it passes through, it's a spiritual thing, which it can happen to people who normally lay hands on people in any kind of a ministry situation. It's the spiritual thing, the releasing so it can pass through that person's body to the people behind them, to the ushers. And the ushers always get really kind of wiped out, they'll stand up there, they're standing up there. It lasted five hours, five hours I stood and imparted to every single person there. And it got stronger and stronger. But I was not expecting to see it in that picture, but it totally captured it. I'm going to see if she can send it to me, maybe we can show it next time. But it was amazing. And people were so overwhelmed. Some people were healed, some people were set free. But the most precious thing was everybody in the line when they would come up to me, they would go, they wanted to hug and hold on to me, but we never got done. We would have never got done, but it was awesome. It was powerful. And God really does love you. He does. And they would walk up there and I would say, He loves you. And then I would lay my hand right here on them. I always tell them we're going to lay it. And because it comes right here from the center of my hand, and it flows right into their spirit. And so it was an exciting time to be there. And of course, I got, we got to sit a little bit with Robin and talk to him about things that are coming, things that are hearing, we do the same thing. So it's wonderful to develop a friendship with some of these prophets, you know, because we understand each other. We know it's not going to be normal in the household. It is never normal, not in mine, not in theirs, not in Hank, not in anybody's. But it's wonderful that in the past, you didn't always get to do that. You came and went, came and went, but I really want to have a relationship. So that's really developing. And I'm exciting about it. But we are all in agreement on one thing. Life is about to never be the same again. God is absolutely going to move on this earth. And a powerful, amazing things are about to happen. And I think next week, which will be number 100 episode, I think we should definitely have some cake during that event. Yes, everybody get your cake already for next week, next Wednesday. Yes. And I wanted to ask you something about when you release the life of God, when people walk up, is there a posture for people who've never experienced anything like that? Maybe they haven't been to a meeting where someone's laid hands on them. Can you posture yourself to receive? You stand like this, you know, you have your hands, you're receiving it. This is, this is, like I'm receiving it. That's what that means. It's coming from God. He just uses me to do that. But that's what I tell people. If you're uncomfortable, just hold your hands up. You're about to receive something because you are. You don't, you don't have to raise them up. You don't have to even touch me at all. And so I, but I always let the people know sometimes he'll tell me to impart it to their soul, which is by your stomach, the core of your very core of your spirit man, the very center of your spirit man is where your soul is. And your soul is not a little thing. It is not little. It looks like this beautiful, amazing, big column and God has written things to you on this column. It's your soul. He writes on it. So it's like this column and then off of that comes the layers of you, like a big fan. And it's you. There's many images of you and on your soul. Those are your emotions. And then your mind is a little bit at the top of this thing. So your mind, your will, which is that powerful column and God did write things to you on there when you were in heaven before you left to come to earth. So I understand how it operates. All those layers of you, if I could have a book to bring it out, I would do it in between all those layers. So it's not layers like I used to say, not like a fluffy biscuit. No, I used to say like an onion. And the Holy Spirit said, excuse me, we'd rather be a fluffy biscuit than another one. If you do not know Holy Spirit, she makes me laugh a lot, but he also tweaks me. He also shares things with me. That's why he's there. Guidance. He gives you instruction, but he also can be very funny. So after I start saying, you know, sort of like a fluffy biscuit, not an onion. I actually finally just drew and we're actually going to have the image made like, like a piece of art. It's amazing that you really understand how you are put together. And you know, those things, the soul and the spirit man, no man can make those. You know, the flesh part, yes. That's why they need heaven involved. Heaven is involved all the time in your lives, even at the very time of your conception. They take one of the little spirits of life that would be you or me or someone that's where we came from. And he would take us down to the mother's womb at the time of conception and knit and attach that little spirit man in the soul to that flesh. And that is when life begins. That's when your life begins, when you're attached together and the body, little body, the baby grows, your spirit man grows also. But it says in the Bible, God said, I knit you together in your mother's womb. And people think, well, he put her arms and legs on, that's not what he did. He literally put you, that was still you, your little spirit man and attached it to the mother's womb so it could grow. So that's how life begins. So really, when you have that moment where a husband and wife meet and that happens, life gets created, you really have a true visitation from the father. Every single woman who's ever been a mother had that visitation. And it's the only way life can be. It's the only way. If you remember in the Bible in Genesis, when they made Adam, when the Lord made Adam, and his body was perfect, and it says it was laying there, but there was no light then, it was just the body. And the father who was with him leans over and breathes Adam's spirit of life that it says in the Bible, that was his spirit, man and soul, breathes it into his nostrils. And he said, you have become a living soul. That's what he called him. So that's when Adam got his soul, then he was alive, and then he could think and make decisions. But really, in a way happened to all of us. So at the time of conception, your guardian angels are sent them. When Holy Spirit brings that little spirit of life with your soul in it, and let us attach, your guardian angels are brought with that. So you never even left heaven alone. And they will hang around the mother. I see them all the time with pregnant women, that baby's angels are outside the mother waiting, so they can never be with that baby from the time that you're born. And what do you think about when Jesus blew on the disciples and said, receive the Holy Spirit like it would, it always reminds me like it's, it's like, it's like that new birth, like God blew into Adam, Jesus blew into the disciples. So we actually, we receive from each of them, the Godhead, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, there's something we receive from each of them, at some time on this earth, you will have an encounter, even though you don't see it. The Father sends you down here, right? And it plants you in there. And then Jesus helps to bring Holy Spirit, and then he also was inside of you, right? And so, but you get something from all three of them. Because you've been forever with the Father, you lived in him, it says in the Bible, in him, we live, we move, we have our very being. That is the Father, because we didn't live in the time of Jesus. He had enough of us when we were born, and he had to come die for us. But you know, when you receive Christ, he does step inside of you. When you receive Holy Spirit as your guide, you know, as your guide and your counselor, and he's still part of the Godhead, he puts a layer of himself, which is a whole of himself. This is, this is revelation to some people. Okay. And then you receive him. So I'm telling you, you are so filled at that moment with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. That's what makes you powerful, but you need to know who you are. And so I love all this revelation that they have given me about how they put us together and know what begins to happen in our lives because of us having them. But Holy Spirit who indwells you, really, that's the best way to get him to have him speak to you. Now, when he first comes to you, he'll walk alongside you. So he's alongside you. So when you get born again, he comes alongside you. He comes alongside, he comes alongside. But you have to invite him. Inviting is part of heaven's protocol. You have to invite to partake. So you must invite Jesus Christ to be your Savior after you've repented. And then he literally will step inside of you. And then when you invite Holy Spirit, he will too. So if you had a spiritual picture of this, this thing about them dwelling and abiding in you, you would be so amazed. I can't sketch it. I haven't sketched it yet. It'll probably be in book three. But you can have them step in you and allow them to give you this information. When you get to have it, the Father will be sitting there and Jesus will step inside of him. Holy Spirit will step inside of him. And you will step inside of them. And we will be one. Wow. Jesus was talking to the Father and he said to the Father, you and me and me and you, that means they can have ability to step inside of each other. Father, I pray that they will be just like us. They will be one with us just like that. And so you do get to do that when you get to heaven. It is an amazing, you get overwhelmed so much by the love and the life flowing in you. And you feel so powerfully amazed at what has just occurred in your life. But most people don't get that told them. They don't understand. Most pastors don't understand that God did put you together literally, sent you from himself. And it says, you know, he is our Father. We are his offspring. Well, every mother knows that means you carry them and then you have them. And so he literally did carry us. And by the way, everybody, you've been from the beginning to the end. And the end of the beginning because we were still, we were in him before he made this earth. It wasn't like one day he made us. Not that way. We've always abided in him as a little spirit being. And he used to jump on the rainbow as it came from him. You'd ride it. You can see him in heaven. They'll come from in right on this rainbow that goes in and out, moves like the northern lights in and out of him in waves of vans of color. Do they look like, do the spirits look like little lights or little beings? Because he's called, the father's called the father of lights. Is that the little spirits? It is. We had a little, our little spirit you saw. It looked like a little child kind of, but not a baby. When he says, you know, every good and perfect gift, which be us, comes down from the father of lights. The reason they said that is your spirit man has made totally out of light. You can see them. They look like, you know, little individuals, but you're lit up. You literally have light in you from living in him. So the father of lights is not talking about the stars. It's talking about all of those, all of those, whoever lived. You lived in God first, even the ones who don't want him. That's where you came from. You are his offspring and he's going to get you. And does that tie in too with like, because a lot of people wonder about for knowledge and predestination. You hear a lot of people, well, if God knows everything already, then what can I, you know, even the Bible talks about, what can I do? You know, God knows everything. We were foreknown in predestined. Yes, we were foreknown. And that's because we've always been. That's right. Yes. Yeah, he already made plans for us while we were in him. And he literally chose what generation of time you would be born in. He, this is what the Holy Spirit says. He timed your birth on the earth. That's what the father does. He knows when he needs you here. He knows what your gift will be that he puts in you. He knows what will be happening. So he needs you for specific things on the earth. That's why he sends you in a certain time. Like, all of my family, he handpicked each one of us separately for us to be a family. So he knew we, while we lived in him, would be a family. He knew my, he knew who my husband was. Now the father even told me, okay, I wasn't necessarily looking to get married at the time. The father said, I chose him. I chose him for you before the earth was made. So you need to marry him. No, he doesn't say that to everybody. I've heard other people say that they knew that God picked him. But the father, because of what I'm doing, had to pick somebody as my husband who would not mind me spending a lot of time traveling and speaking, or even live living the very different kind of life. You know, some people wouldn't like it or wouldn't want me to do it. And so he picked somebody who wouldn't mind it all. And that's why he handpicked him. And so he chose, he chooses who's supposed to be in a family. Now he doesn't cause things to happen to you. There's a devil on this earth. And anytime the devil can kill, steal, and destroy, he's going to try to do it. He's afraid. Every time somebody's born, it threatens him. Because that one might be somebody powerful in the kingdom that would crush him, push it back, and expose stuff. So that's why he doesn't want us here. And Satan knows where we came from. He knows that we are God's children. He's not. He was made, like formed, like, you know, I was something. He was, he didn't exist inside of the father. Just us, just us who are humans. We did exist in him. And there's still more there. And they're still coming. They're still coming. So if you love God and you're serving God with all your heart, is it possible for you to ever miss your destiny and God or live out the books that have been written about you? I think it would, unless you totally decided you didn't want to. I think unless you said, if you ever said, I don't want to do it. And sometimes he might need you anyway. And he has this way of getting you to change your mind without forcing you. He just does. So sometimes you're very important. Everyone's important. He made me reword that everyone is important to God. And he loves us all the same. And we are his children. It's like, if you had children, you'd love them all. They would be different. And they might want to do different things, say different things. They may respond differently to a lot of different things. That doesn't mean you don't want them. And so even sometimes when children don't listen, and they pay consequences, doesn't mean you don't. Sometimes. It does not mean that you don't still love them. So the father's just like that. He really loves us very much. But that is where you came from. If you ever wonder, you didn't appear somewhere in time on some other planet and found your way here. No, people come up with all kinds of excuses. No, I was from another world that nobody knows about. No, there is nothing like that. There is heaven. There's God, Father, Son, the Holy Spirit. That's the divine. That's the Godhead. And there's heaven. And there's Satan and his minions. They live in hell. Well, they're supposed to live in hell. So there's always battle going on up for us, you know, to try to pull us into whatever, especially on the enemy side. The enemy never asks permission, by the way. The father always asks if you're going to do something for him. He will ask you, Satan never does that. We're going to get away with stealing, hurting, you know, that's Satan doing that. Okay, that's not the father. And so I wish everybody could know the father and Jesus introduced me personally to the father and he loved his father so much. He talked to them all the time when he was on this earth and how much he loved him. And even when he was here on the earth, he would go away to the mountain to spend time with him because this mountain that was in Israel. And so except the three days that he couldn't. That was when he was down in hell. And he had, Jesus had an assignment to, when he was, when he went to hell, he was actually released himself, his body, his spirit from his body on the cross. He descended into paradise, which was Abraham's bosom. That's what God put people who believed in him. They didn't let me know the Messiah. Jesus had not come yet. And so he counted them righteous because they believed in him as, you know, as God. And let me tell you, I will tell you this. I've been to that place. I've been to paradise. There's no one in it right now. It's been empty. They all were taken out by Jesus Christ, golden buildings, people. It has a river. And I'm talking about a spiritual abode in the middle of the earth. Below that and off to the side is where hell is, the great gulf between paradise. It calls it paradise in the Bible too. When Christ was on the cross, talking to the thief who accepted Christ. And he said, today you will be with me in paradise. He said that to the thief. And he was. So Christ died first. The thief was still on the cross. And Christ descended down into paradise. And he's got to see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, King, David, everybody who had, who had, you know, followed God for who he was. And I'm sure that even his father, the one who raised him, you know, he was there. And also several other people that had known Jesus. When, when he was walking on the earth and they died, they were taken there if they were found faithful to believe in God. And he actually preached the gospel to all of them. It was really an amazing. But the place he put them in, God counted these as his friends. They had feasts. They had tables set with feast. And people were eating. And they were laughing. And they were all talking, of course, this is when Christ descended down there. But it was a beautiful place. I didn't expect it to be that beautiful. They had an atmosphere. They had a sky. These are all spiritual places which shows you, yes, heaven is a real literal place, although it's a spiritual realm. And people eat in heaven. They enjoy all kinds of activities in heaven. So if you're in your spirit, man, and you're in that spiritual place is much like you being in this physical earth in your physical body. Did the Lord take Enoch and Elijah? Did he take them to paradise in their bodies? Or did he take them with him to heaven? He, they were in heaven. They were going to humans that were in heaven because the father caught up Enoch first. You know why? Because Enoch had such a great relationship. I mean, really relationship. I mean, he wanted to know them. He would talk to them all the time. Live the righteous life and love people. I mean, he only lived to be, I think, 300 and something. Back in those days, you could live to be almost a thousand years old. Back in the days when Enoch was on the earth. But they couldn't bear to be without him. They loved him so much. They just took him. They took him to heaven and he's been there ever since. And of course, Elijah also, all the powerful things he did. And you know, even when he had to deal with the prophets of Baal and all that stuff like that, he wanted to go. No, Elijah wanted to go to heaven. So God sent the chariot for Elijah. And Elijah got in this chariot and that he had told. I know when he is spoken to people and said, I'm going to be going. I'm going to heaven. You know, I want to go there. And but God actually sent this for him. So Elisha, who is his like, I guess he was mentored by Elijah. Elijah told him, if you see me go, if you're around when he's when I go up and you see me, I'll throw my mantle down to you. So Elisha just followed him everywhere. He was not going to miss that. Of course, that was God's plan for him to step into that place. And he did. He was there. So he, Elijah threw his mantle down and Elisha caught it and struck the ground with it and said he was served the God, the God of heaven and earth. I got Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and he now would be that prophet that he had to double. He did double miracles. He did double everything. And when he died, when Elisha died, and he just went up in the mountains and died. And then years later, they threw somebody who had died over this mountain. And when they fell on the bones of Elisha, that person came back to life. He carried the noting that you carry stays with the body. It doesn't need to go to heaven. It stays with the body. And so that's why it's very powerful for people who are anointed to lay hands on you. But even this is a wild thing. Even if they're cremated, whether you're buried or cremated, that anointing you carried stays with your body. And when I got to visit Israel the first time, we were allowed to go into where King David's is sepulchre where his big tomb was. And because they were the Jews and they had curtains dividing it like the men got to go to one half of this place and the women went together. Before I even reached the tomb where he was in, I felt the anointing leaving that thing. I could feel David's anointing leaving. And I heard songs he had sung. I don't think I've ever told anybody this. I heard songs he had sung. Whatever he was wearing, when they actually buried his body, but it was wearing and he's, if he had sung in those garments, the garments would carry those songs. So I heard him singing. He wasn't alive, but that was anointing he carried. But the anointing he operated on was coming from where his body was in the tomb, even though he was dead. Wow, that's incredible, Kat. I know I've heard your testimonies from when you go to Israel and you still see the angels standing beside the tomb. Is that right? That is absolutely right. The same two angels that it talks about in the Bible. Those two angels are there. They guard the tomb because it is a holy place. It's where Christ's body was laid. It's where he was resurrected from. And a lot of people go in there and they feel, this is wild, they feel a presence so strong. And those two angels carry anointing that was given to them by Christ. And then they were anointed to guard and protect not just Christ when his body was in that tomb, but the tomb itself. So I would encourage you to go to Israel. Don't miss going to the tomb and just know that those two angels are still there. When we talk about Enoch and we, okay, I want to ask you this question because I'm curious your take on it, but you know how there's two witnesses and revelation that come and then they get killed and they get raised three days later? Yes. Do you know who they are? Do I know? I don't know who they are. I know it's Helens who lived on the earth and they will live on the, I'm not saying they're here now, but they will literally be living on the earth when that whole thing happens, when the perilous times come and then the three short years that it will be in the perilous times and the tribulation three years long. Those are two people. I would think probably they might be prophets because they said things that's so annoyed and enraged the Antichrist. I mean, they enraged him by, they probably declared things about God, probably did talk about Christ sitting on the throne in Jerusalem while he's trying to take over. And so yeah, they, they, they were martyred and they left their bodies laying in the street. They didn't even bury them. They just left them so, so Antichrist could say, look, I killed them. I killed them and he was probably laughing until God raised him from the dead. That's going to be incredible. I don't think that'll be an amazing, people need to think about the amazing, supernatural events that will actually happen on this earth. And that is one of them. I know my brother wants to be one of them. I've heard a lot of talk. This could be one of the two living witnesses. Yeah, I've heard people say it's Moses. It's Elijah. It's Enoch. It's Elijah. Moses and Enoch. So I was just curious. I do not think it's any of them at all. I don't think so. Okay. Okay. Number one, people, they already are immortal. Abraham, Jacob, they're immortal because they have gone to heaven. They couldn't come back and die. Okay. They couldn't come back here and then die. That's not even possible. It's not even possible. So it isn't them. It'll be somebody who lives in that time when all that's happening and they will be known that they hear God, that they love God and they speak about him. So it can't be somebody who nobody knows. Okay. These two people probably have, they're probably really tough, tough, strong willed and everything because they had to be on the earth when it was really, really bad. This is not bad. I know it's not, you don't like it. I know it's, nobody wants it, but it's not anything like it will be in the pair of the sun, which is well, well, I'd probably say close to 200 years or more away because there's still too many things we have to do. But yeah, those witnesses, they're car witnesses because everybody's hearing them. They're probably on television. I know they are annoyed and probably insulted the Antichrist because he couldn't wait to get rid of them. So when he killed them and they stayed dead, he should have learned from Jesus Christ. All right, evil? He thought he hadn't even gone to and he shows up at the gates of hell on the third day. This is not going, I'm going in a different time zone. So you understand, I'm not in the girl's time zone way back when, when Christ died was crucified in the cross and his spirit man went down into paradise. He preached the gospel. He ate with them. The things showed up because remember he Christ told him he'd be there and celebrated with them. And then when he knew the time came, you have to understand the way that God designed, um, paradise and then hell or Haiti sometimes is called. This was a place of delight and God's presence. Uh, uh, was paradise. And then hell was total opposite. It would be a boat of Satan that he ruled there and a lot of demons ruled there. And that's where torment was. Well, nobody could cross over from where there was a great golf. I'm in a great distance. You couldn't just decide, I'm going to go to hell. You wouldn't want to anyway, if you were in paradise and yet Christ did go there and he was the only one who ever went there like that and you went or showed up at the gates of hell, then that whole scenario happened where Satan's thinking, I got him now. I know he didn't. He got a lot. He got a lot of fire and light and that's what he got. And on the third day when Christ stood up and melted the faces of the principalities and powers that were called him from all over the earth, principalities and powers are evil, wicked spirits that sit on wicked thrones around the world. And Satan called them in. He wanted them, their leader, to wanted them to see him torture the Son of God. Well, it didn't turn out that way. He wiped up hell, put up part of it, melted the faces of the hierarchy of hell, stripped Satan of all his royal guard, all the gemstones he was wearing and took away the keys of hell and the grave, beating him up and left him in the dust of hell. Pretty much that's what he did. He wasted it. That's what he did. And in the Bible, it says that Christ, that Christ spoiled, this is why he's in hell, spoiled principalities and powers making a show of it openly. Yes. You know why it was openly because those in paradise hadn't left yet that he had gotten born again, but they were watching because you could see the down into the courtyard of hell, you could see from where they were up there yelling and cheering on Jesus Christ. Satan says tearing them up, people, he's tearing them up. And so what a wonderful experience. That is a powerful, powerful thing. And I know that paradise and hell aren't on the earth, but they were still part of earth. So that whole thing took place within the realms of the spirit realm in the earth. So that was an exciting day for everybody in heaven. I can tell you, they were cheering too. And then he comes, explodes out of that grave, picks his body up in the tomb, goes into the tomb. There's those two angels waiting right there, comes up, fill a bowl of light and glory because he had just reached hell and gets back right into his body. And of course, he's an amazing thing. The stone is easily blown away, rolled away, whatever you want to call it. And then he goes outside and steps into the garden. That's why it's called the garden tube, steps into the garden because he loves flowers. And that's where he was when Mary came and she thought he was the gardener. Nobody knows why she said that, but that's why, because I was taken back and I saw that whole thing happen. So she came in to bring anointings, you know, she was going to anoint the body again or herbs and put it on the cloth that was wrapped around him. And he wasn't there. Wow. He was not there. Okay. And so they, she left to come outside and there was the gardener, she thought. And the only reason she said that was because he was in the gardens, not on the sidewalk, looking not on the path, he was in the middle of all the flowers. And then when he turned around, she knew exactly who he was. Having revelation just makes the word come alive, but make sure you realize that is your king. That, that, that God, Jesus Christ, he's our king. And I'm telling you what, he still rules over everything. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof is his and this whole left group who think they can take it over. I would laugh. You don't get nothing because you don't own it. You didn't make it. You didn't make the people on it. And we belong to Jesus Christ. You're about to see, you see the power of his justice. That's what you're about to see. I'm talking about the left right now. I'm talking about all the wicked evil people who are killing, stealing and destroying thinking that you have one and nobody knows. I tell you somebody who knows Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. Yes. And what about, can Jesus, or does Jesus still come? Like, you know, how he appeared on the road to Emmaus with the two disciples and they didn't recognize them. And even when he came to Peter, does, does the Lord still come in that way? Like, could he be in a, in our church service or could he be appearing as someone where we're not recognizing his form? Does he still do that? He does that because I've personally seen him. I'm seeing. I'm not sure. I've seen him too many times, you tell you. I've seen him a lot. He comes into my home and talks to me, no matter where I'm outside somewhere, he'll come and talk to me. Does he come, does he come as his, his, his form or done? Okay. No, when I see him, it's him. I've seen him in heaven. I've seen him on the earth. No, it's him and his physical body that he's been glorified. He is glorified, but you can see the, you can see the, the, this is where the, the nail scars are. They're not here. They're not in the palm of his hand because that weight of his body hanging on the cross, it would have, it would have ripped. It would have ripped right through this. So literally, it's right here. These two joints in your wrist, it was, he was nailed there and you can put your whole finger in it. I mean, you can see them and if the wind blows when he's here and it moves his hair, you can see all the holes in the, the wounds of where the holes were in his head. When they put that crown of thorns on him, you can see that. So in his feet, the same thing you can, he's still kind of wear sandals most of the time. I was going to ask, does he come barefoot? But now people need to understand before he came to the earth, he dressed differently. He looked differently. Yeah. When he was called the word, the word was with God and was God and there was nothing that was not made by him. It said he became flesh. He had flesh put on him. The word agreed to have flesh because he had to be born from the womb of a woman. So he had the right to choose whether sin or not sin. He actually had that right to choose that. He had to be down here to live just like us, but he never sinned even walking as he was still God, but he was walking and living in a human body. And so Satan didn't recognize him. He did not know he was the Son of God. He remembers what he looked like as the word because when Jesus got the body, the physical body, it changed. It changed his spirit and he still has that body. He's about six foot tall, something he's very muscular because he lifted trees down here. He's a master carpenter and he he worked all the time. So he was, I wouldn't say he wasn't up gloriously beautiful face like some handsome man, but he had a real strong features and everybody loves him. It doesn't really matter, but I just sometimes people want to know he had to walk this earth just like us. He experienced temptation in every way like we do, but he never sinned. Therefore, of course, living and walking as us, he already was righteous because he was the Son of God, but the fact that he chose not to sin in his human body, that really he really was righteous in hell. And he knew this when he descended into hell from Abraham's bosom. He himself knew the Father had already told him on the third day, I will raise you up. This is what's going to happen. I will not have contact with you during those three days. This was all on his own. He had to be there to make the choices and and he he did know that his father would raise him up again, but he didn't talk to him again from the time he was on the cross before he died and the father did not look upon him. He had to be there. This could be something where the father was empowering him with extra grace and mercy. He literally had to experience the suffering and torment and the crucifixion. He had to say yes, because what he took to the cross wasn't just his body. Right before that, when the soldiers came to get him, he was in the Garden Garden of Gethsemane, which I have been in. And I knew exactly where he had been, where he knelt, where he prayed, because there's so much glory in that very spot where he did that. And the angels came and tended to him the same two angels when they were sent from heaven to comfort him and minister to him. That was just, I don't know if it was a reward the father gave him for something or whatever, but why they were chosen, but they were there. They, when they came, brought the cup and everybody should know Jesus Christ had to drink a cup, not made, well the cup was made on the earth. That was a cup that was a gift he took to his father in the mountains one time. One of his first good projects, Jesus Christ actually made the coffee drink from. And the father put all that stuff in it because that stuff, every evil wicked thing, no matter every evil thing, every disease had to go in that cup because he bore that on the cross. That's why he has power over all of it. That's why he has a right. And the only one he can forgive sins because he carried all of that sin in him when he drank it in the garden. So he died in the garden when he said, Father, if it's possible, let this cup pass from me. Because he was righteous, right? But he had to drink this and carry it. It was the spiritual stuff in the cup, but it was a real literal physical cup he drank. And so those two angels brought that cup from heaven filled with that stuff. And they had to give it to him as a garden. I can imagine how hard that would have been. And then they had to witness, they were there as witnesses that he drank it. So then all of that was in him. It didn't make him evil. He was the carrier destroyed that stuff, the power of it. So that's why he went to the cross. It was crucified. All of that stuff was crucified and therefore gave him the right to forgive sin. And so that's why he is the only one who can forgive because he bore it. He chose to. And so can you imagine making a gift for your father? And then it comes back to you with all this. But that's what those angels did. So their reward was to remain here on the earth by the tomb. Get to see all the people just worshiping Jesus Christ, thanking him and everything. But that is their position right now. They are still there outside that tomb. And so that's that for what a reason he chose them to do that. That's what they did. I know there's a question on here if I can find it. It's okay. Lynn asked, have you been shown what actually happened on the day of Christ's crucifixion and how there was darkness for three hours? The time span is too long for a normal eclipse. Yeah. I have seen glimpses of the crucifixion as well as it sounds. I don't see a lot of violence. I'm not showing a lot of violence on purpose because I'm here. I carry hope and joy and celebration and revelation. And so he doesn't really want me to have to. It's not like I experienced it. I saw him on the cross. And I do know I heard him say the things to John that he said in the Bible. I actually did see that. So he's taken me. It's not that I'm better than anyone else, but I have a photographic memory and this is my assignment. And I've always been, I know that I've always was supposed to have this assignment. God told me. And so because if I'm going to reveal heaven, the fathers of the Holy Spirit, their operations and their actions and stuff that happened in the spirit realm, they would have to take me to these places to bring truth about them. And so I did see glimpses. I got to see Mary crying over him. I got to see him tell John, behold your mother and to her, behold your son, because Jesus Christ had to die not as the son of Mary, but the savior of Mary. He had to die on that cross. That's why he gave his mother and the care of his mother to John. And that's what he was doing at that moment at the cross. I did get to see that. I got to see, I saw him when he lost his spirit man from his body. He descended into Abrahamism. I saw that. I was taken to Abrahamism. So when I'm showing things, it's not a vision. It is in that time I've taken to that time and actually happened. I'm pretty certain at this point that we will write a revelation Bible and it will have all the revelations. He's given me wherever in those scriptures he's given me. It will be in the not in place of the scripture, but it will probably be down at the bottom and explain what happened in the spirit of things happen. But he had to do that in order for me to understand things and know. That wasn't a pleasant time to be there at the cross. People were really just heartbroken. Some of them had fear in them. And then of course, the powerful thing that began to happen. Darkness came on the earth. The veil was rent in the temple. In the Holy of Holies, it was rent. It was rent. But I think, I don't know if it was rent. I think it was rent. I don't know if it was from the top down or from the bottom up. I don't remember what it was, but it was rent saying. What that was saying was now man, righteous man now had the right to step into that place because we had to build streets to receive Christ as our savior. And that, that made us, that means we were just, okay, we were righteous. We were not unrighteous anymore if we received Christ. So there's reasons why all those things happened. The earthquake came over 500 dead were walking around alive in the city. That's the most, that's amazing to me. Yeah, because he had died. He, it was finished. Now that part when he said, it is finished when Christ said that he was talking about your salvation, the way of salvation. That was done. It was already handled. You just have to repent and receive him. So that was what he did the cross for, but he really wasn't done with being here on the earth. He didn't just go home to heaven when he died on the cross. He had something else to do. He had to take back our authority and dominion that, that Adam had given away to Satan because he chose Satan's words and chose to operate under Satan, the things he did and not God. What he was doing was giving away his rights to Satan to have dominion. Christ had to win that back. It had to be a just righteous man. They had to go into hell and take that back for us because hell cannot keep a righteous person and they had to know that. So when Jesus showed up and on the third day, he wasted them and he walked out of there having taken the things away from Satan that no longer he had the right to have. So then it was quite a powerful time. All of those encounters were very powerful times. So someone else asked on here, if I could, they asked about visions because you were just talking about how you were actually, how you were actually taken there, that it was not just a vision that you, so they were asking the difference between, if I could find it, the difference between how do you know if it's a vision or if you're really taken there? I think most people know that they're really taken there because everything in that place is alive. It's active. In a vision, it's like you're watching a movie. You know if you're in a place or if you're watching something on TV, you just know it. You know, there's a huge difference. You're smelling the air. You're tasting stuff. You're hearing things right there and you're standing there next to some of the people who are doing it. So it's not, a vision is different. A vision is different. You sometimes see things a little bit far off. Sometimes even if you see a vision and it's close, it's still not the same as standing next to the people where this encounter is happening with. So I know, I mean, I know what a vision is. I used to have visions. I don't have dreams either. I never dream. So don't ask me to interpret your dream. I wasn't there. So I can't help you with that. There are dream interpreters that do do that for God, but I'm a revelator. That means I reveal things. I reveal truth. I reveal things about places, about the Word, about heaven, about hell, about time. And so that's what my, that's what my assignment is. So you, you know that, you know, you, once you experience, through experience, you know, there's a complete difference between actually being taken and just maybe a movie screen opening up before your eyes and seeing a vision. Total difference. Total difference because a long time ago when I used to have a vision, I know that it's like I'd be sitting somewhere and then like everything would disappear and I would be watching, but I knew I was watching. I knew I wasn't in that. I wasn't in the scene. I wasn't with the people that were in that, in that thing. So an encounter is totally different than a dream or a vision. You'll, you are literally physically encountering something. And it's like, you know, you're there. Like I knew when I was taken back in time and I was taken to right at the time when Christ was resurrected. I was in the garden. I know which, which there's two different tombs. I say there is just the one that's inside this little pretty, like, I don't know what it is, like a temple or something like that. And they have beautiful tiles in the floor and everything. And they say that's the place where he died, but it wasn't. It's the one outside. It's Golgotha. It does look like a skull. The mountain thing that he's in is gardens are everywhere. So that is the right one. The one that's outside is the one that Christ actually was in, the tomb he was in. And so, uh, yeah, I knew I was, I knew I was there because I could touch the ground. I knew my feet were touching the ground. You know, if you're walking something or you're walking on the ground, there's a big difference. If you pick up stuff in the counter, if you hold things in that encounter, so there is a big difference. Yeah. That's, that explains it really good cat. Um, David, he's 10 years old. He asked what language did God speak when he created the world or the earth? Now, when I heard him speak, I heard him speaking in English. It may, it didn't have to be that, but in order for me to be able to share with people, since I don't speak Hebrew and I don't speak Greek and I don't speak, you know, other languages that were around on the earth at that time, I speak English. Now, if he wants to tell me what they said, sometimes he may do that, especially with angels talking. Angels have their own language. They can also speak any language on the earth. Angels can, but sometimes they have their own language also. I don't always understand what they're saying, but then they may, they may turn to me and say what, what it was just said. But I heard God say what he, what he was going to create and what they actually used to do when Christ's name was the word, it was the father, the word in Holy Spirit. That's what the Trinity was. And, but they still were, you know, they didn't, they didn't become somebody different, even though Christ had flesh put on him and his features changed, changed. That's why Satan was questioning him. By the way, let's go back to that scene. When he was tempted in the wilderness by Satan, he wanted to find out if he was a son of God, but he didn't know for sure he was. And Satan at that time didn't tell him who he was. He just used the word of God to make him leave. When he said, if you, you know, if you, he was asking Christ to do these different things to see if he was Jesus Christ and he didn't, he wouldn't do any of them. He gave him an answer of the scripture. He wasn't going to turn stones into food. He wasn't going to jump off the cliff. He wanted to jump off the cliff and prove that he was a son of God and Satan said, I'll give you all these, he was showing him all the kings and everything and wealth, which he always lies with and Christ wasn't fooled at all. So until Christ said he was the son of the living God. And then that was repeated by his disciples. He did not know that he was the son of God until that. So in the temptation part, he didn't find out because he didn't look the same. When, when Satan was Lucifer lived in heaven, Jesus didn't look like Jesus Christ. He was the word. He was a spiritual being, a spiritual body. He had all of his arms and legs and everything, but his very features changed when he had flesh put on him. They didn't take, they didn't take the appearance of the word. That's his name. They didn't take those features and put them on. He had to be born to the womb of a woman. And so that's when, then when he had that his body, then that body developed its own image, which he still has that body now. So that's one way that Satan didn't have a clue who he was because he knew what he looked like when he was in heaven. Wow. Can we, can we do a couple more questions? We're at an hour. The time goes by just so fast. Okay. Edmund is 13 and he wants to know, can you change your age in heaven or will I always look and behave a certain age of maturity? Nobody looks old in heaven. So let me just say that. If you die, go to heaven. You look like you're in your 20s. Your spiritual body looks like it's in its 20s. There is no age in heaven because there is no time in heaven. Nothing decays. I think it's old just so that you understand that. So no matter what age you were on the earth, normally when you die and go to heaven, unless you're young, because if you were young, when you passed away, you would still be that young in heaven. And you would actually stay that young until I think probably until the dead in Christ are raised. And when your mother passes away, when she's ready to Jesus to take her, she will finish raising you in heaven. So if you're young, when you die, you look young in heaven. But if you're older, when you die, you look young in heaven. Everybody's young. And so that, that I can, I can just tell you that. And I think, yes, I have seen people, a lot of people want to be like a child. And there is a place you go to. It's a fun place in heaven where you can be younger. Let's say you died and you were 90, but you want to be like, and you normally look like you're in your 20s, but what if you want to be five again? This place, when you go to, when you step into the boundaries of the place, she would, let's say, it's a woman she wanted to be five, you would be five while you were in there. But when you came back out of that place, because it's like sort of like an amusement park, you can be five, play like a five-year-old lap. You still know who you are. Sometimes friends go together and do that. And it's a lot of fun. I haven't done that. But when I go to heaven, I look eight, just so you know that. So. Oh, wow. Oh, almost every time I'm taken, when I get there and eight, they want me to understand this is why he's going to speak to me like what he would say, explain revelation to an eight-year-old. That's why all the revelations are simple. None of them are, none of them are so, you know, brainiac that you couldn't understand what I was saying. If some wise person who is studying university for 30 years explains something, you'd be wondering, well, what the stuff is so detailed, I can't understand it. He wanted people to understand like a child. So that's why he makes me eight. And I look eight when I'm there. I remember I was, I was interviewing Kim, Kim Robinson, and she said that she was, she would see the, the people hold hands like the father and the daughter. And the daughter would, she said, would, before they entered this, like circus tent would go down to like five or eight years old. And so it's like you're saying, there's places you can go or yes, it was probably a amusement park, probably. Yeah. She talked about the circus and how you can go with your parents and you can actually be like a little kid again. Yes. So that's really cool. Okay. That part is, that part, you can, you can do that. Yes. That's amazing. God is so wonderful in all his ways and so creative and beyond what we can think or imagine, right? Right. So Annette asks, what happens when people with special needs die? Is there anything special for them based on their disabilities? Yes, you don't have them anymore. Praise God. Amen. There are no blind people, crippled people, sick people, handicapped people. They don't, they're not there. You are made whole. If you're sick and you're in the hospital, you're not doing well. I don't know, maybe you lost a limb or something. The day you pass away and your spirit man stepped out of this physical body, no matter what infirmities or handicaps that had, you have none and there are none in heaven. So nobody has to have crutches or wheelchairs or none of that exists in heaven. Do you know what, Jen? I said no down syndrome, no autism. No down syndrome, no autism, no, none of it, none of it. Your brain is perfect. Your physical, mental, emotional is made perfect. Wow. That's awesome. That's, that's a great answer for you, Annette. Jesse asks, how does the sea of forgetfulness work? I just know that that's where the father puts all the sins that he forgives. You know, whenever you repent of sins, he takes those and they're put, it's not on, it's not in heaven. It's outside of heaven. And I haven't seen it itself, but I know that's what they do. It's sent there and the father, when he sends it, is never remembered because he's the judge. He also is a judge in heaven and judges things in heaven. And Christ also is involved in this whole thing when somebody repents to Christ for all their sins. Those sins are taken to the father, so he has evidence that they repented. That's why they do it. Then the father sends them to the sea of forgetfulness and he doesn't remember them. You can't even bring up these sins. He'd be thinking, why are you doing that? I don't even know that. I don't even know what that is. I don't remember that. And he did, he did it on purpose, so it wouldn't dwell in his soul. So if you have repented of your sins, don't talk about them anymore. Don't tell people, you know, if you have a, you're having a meeting in a church and you want to give you a personal testimony, that would be okay. But don't run around telling everybody else, you know, I used to do this. I used to take drugs, use the steal from people. I'm like, don't say that because then you're living in your past. You are a new creation, new meaning. None of that is a part of you anymore. Talk about the new creation you are. You know, I used to say, but no more sins, not a part of my life. I have living a holy because of Jesus Christ. What he did for me, I totally gave all that back to him and it's gone. It's gone. And someone asked on here too, if I could find it, because I read all these questions before, someone asked about your soul, if I could find this, because is it important to, you know, when you repent, you're, is that loosing it from your soul when you're repenting? Or should it, maybe if you're still dwelling on it, should you lose it from your soul? Well, you shouldn't be dwelling on it, but when you repent of your sins, okay, it is automatically the sin which abides in you by the way, until the day you repent of it, it's in you that sin is to lend you. And once you repent of it, it's taken away from you, it's taken out of you. So I would tell people, don't let the enemy try to bring it back. He will try to bring those images back to you, say, no, I've repented. That's not a part of me anymore. I would actually tell people to say that. But no, once you, once you at repentance, you wouldn't necessarily have to lose it from your soul. You just to have, if the devil tries to bring it back, say, no, it's gone. And just say that we hope it's gone. And then he'll just give up. So, but when you've repented of something, it's not something you can dwell on. But I promise you, if you have sin as a believer, you will think about it all the time until, this is after you've repented to Christ. And you're now a believer. You're someone set free from the sin. It's then removed from you. You're clean on the inside. Your soul, your spirit man has nothing in it. None of the sin is in there for you to think about or choose again. You're free. You're free. You've been made free by the blood of Jesus Christ. Don't let anything come back up to you. The enemy is the one trying to do that. So don't believe him. Just tell me he's a liar. You don't do that anymore. But once you've been set free at the time of repentance, usually people don't just lose from their soul. They've already just spoken. You're actually speaking to Christ. He reaches in and takes it out. But anytime after you've been born again and you sin, you do need to repent of it because if you don't, it'll stay in there. And you'll think about it all the time and over and over again, then the same will begin to beat you up. Look at you. You're supposed to be righteous. Now you've sinned. You've lost it. You might as well just throw your life into them. Just give it to me. That's what he'd like to say. So you can't let sin ruin your life. That's why it's important. And the Bible says, since grace abounds, should sin abound, should sin abound. And he says, God forbid, that's the answer when they're asking the disciples, you know, because grace is here and we're saved by grace. Can I go out and sin now because I've been forgiven? And they're asked what they're actually asking. And the answer to them in the Bible is God forbid. Yeah. That means God doesn't want you to do it. Can't you wonder? No, don't go sin. Because then you will be unrighteous. Yes. To the blood of Christ is unrighteous when you sin. And there are people who preach once forgiven, always forgiven. That does not say that in the Bible. Yes. It says, if you, if you have sin, right, so now you're unrighteous, well, Christ forgive you. And he says, yes, Christ will forgive you and cleanse you from all unrighteousness when you repent. That's what the word says. If they've left this in the Bible, that I can let you know for sure that's what the Bible says. No, don't sin. But if you have, go repent to Christ and then he will take it out of you and then you will be righteous. Yes. If you sin as a Christian, yes, you're unrighteous because you sin. If you don't want to be unrighteous, you repent and then the sin is removed. And that is probably one of the most important messages that should be preached in every single church. Yes, I agree. Because you know why if you sin and you don't repent, the devil will get you to do it again. And when he keeps doing this, you'll sin worse and worse and worse because you never repented for the first sin that you did. So the sin out of you is very easy. You just recount and you can get to a place where you actually live holy. I do not sin. I do not sin at all. I choose not to sin. It says, be holy as he is holy, be perfect. If it wasn't possible to live that way, he would have said so. So yes, you can. Don't point at the past. The Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. But did you ever realize what the scripture is actually saying? What sin was that coming short of the glory, meaning because you have sinned, you will not produce glory for God. You can't get the glory and then later impart the glory. The glory is a very extremely important thing. When you sin, it will be taken from you. You can't carry the glory because you have sin in your life. So that scripture that everybody uses to say, everybody's a sinner, that's not what it means. The sin departs in. That's past tense for all have sinned at one time in your life. You sin and you're in short of the glory of God at that point. But when you repent, it removes all of it. And then when you do God, you are creating glory for him because you are righteous. The glory builds in you. You can say to Christ, I give it to you, but he's going to make you wear it. You take it because the Bible says the knowledge and knowing and understanding of what the glory is, it will be demonstrated all over this earth, just like the waters come to see what this earth is to. There's water. Another was what they're saying is you will many times carry that glory to different places and you would release it from yourself. It causes a shockwave of glory penetrating buildings and cities and people and it begins to change their heart and what they think about Christ. So the glory, how do I know that you do that? Christ in you is the hope of glory. The hope that you will prove it, that you will carry it and that you will impart it to change places. That's what Christ, that's what that scripture is, it's revelation. So all this needs to be understood. It's the beginning. You can pursue a greater relationship with Christ. Amen. Every day of your life, not the sin. Amen. And even in John 17, Jesus says, he gives us the same glory that the Father has given him. So that he tells us, I've given them the same glory. That's right. It's amazing. Well, Kat, thank you so much for all, there's so many more questions that are, I mean, I could be on with you for, I could take three hours of your day, but I know you're busy. So thank you so much for being on with us today. And would you pray for everybody before we close? Yes. Father, I pray for all those watching God and those who will watch later that they know you, like your son knows you, that they understand your heart for them, that you do know what's going on in this world, but you have a plan to change it. I thank you, Father, for loving us to bring justice, really powerful justice, not just to America, but to every single country. There are believers all over this world crying out for you to help and to do something about the evil. He's so intense to do that. So Father, right now, I just impart the life of God, the presence of God, the power of God, authority over the enemy. He is your doormat. He is not your king. I release an impartation of the presence of the Lord, the joy of the Lord, His will, His way, that this day you will run after Him and know Him and know that He will come to get you. The day your day is up on this earth, He will come to get you. He will take you home to heaven and walk you up the steps of the throne and your celebration will begin then because in heaven you exist to live. Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Oh, Kat, thank you so much. Wow, it's like waves when you pray. I feel like waves of the glory. Would you share how everyone, I know we have revealingheaven.com on the screen now, but I know you also have another website where people can find your stuff. Yes, it is called Katcur.com. Is it the Katcur? There we have it on the screen. Oh, it's on there. Okay, that's good. Yeah. Facebook page is the Katcur. Okay, no, but this is on the other website. It's just Katcur.com. That is what I call a spiritual platform for the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to say what they want to, whenever they want to, and I post it there. There's videos you can watch of some of the interviews I've had with people. There's, I think there may be testimonies on there, but there's many videos you can watch that teaches you how to pray for your family over certain things, how to declare things for him, how to know more revelation. So it's a really awesome place. There is a gallery on there where I have created images of what it looks like in the spirit realm, places in heaven that you can enjoy and see. So that is what that's about. It is also the only place on the earth you can give to me online is at Katcur.com. And by the way, I need to let people know there is a new fake Facebook page and it's called Prophet Katcur. I don't ever put anything that is not my Facebook page. My Facebook page is the Katcur. And so if it doesn't say the Katcur, then that's not my page. Even though it's got my face on it, people just stole my image. And usually they'll say send money to this group for this and send money. They'll give you a link. And what they're trying to do is rip off your money. So we make a place for you to give online if you want to. As I said, it's called Katcur.com and you can click on the information about the guardian zone, which is what we call, I'm actually wearing a guardian zone, a pin right here today on purpose. This is what people receive when they give to me on a monthly basis or an annual basis, whatever you want to do. And we send out gifts. We already send out our first wave of gifts. We have some more we're going to be sending out. And I'm so grateful to all of you. And you have something for me to show Jen. Oh, one of the things we're doing right now is we are creating a lot of new images to put on, on our, on our, in our store, on Kat, on the rebel, okay. Revealing money.com. Because the last calendar we did was all about two, two events that will happen on this called the fire and the glory. And that calendar is all about baptism and fire, which will happen. And also the glory I just talked to you about beginning to impart the glory and places that you go to this calendar was done for that purpose. So the father has put images. We have an image of the father sitting on a throne, the commissioning throne room, not the main throne room. We have a picture of Christ with fire in his eyes. So we also created an image of the invisible being the third member of the family called the Holy Spirit. So I'm going to show you that image. And it looks like an invisible being coming through a fiery portal. One thing that is always around when Holy Spirit is, is the fire, the fire is like a fire. And he carries that fiery crease portals to go through to come to the earth and other places. So here is that image right here. It may be shiny. I gotta move it over there. So that is the invisible spirit of God. You know, he does have a body. He has a whole real body. It is invisible and having you see the outline of his body, you see the outline of him. And so there's a fiery portal he came through and it says right here, yeah, it says Holy Spirit, invisible and something with fire, filled with fire. But at the bottom of the top says live Holy, because when you live Holy, here's what it says, be dangerous against hell. There you go. Amen. We have these posters available now on our store. They're not, this is on phone court and you can take like Office Max or Office Depot and they can take that poster and put it on phone court. It's a really high quality poster and it is that big that we send it to you. So the father wanted it to be released. So that's what we have. That's new. We also have these cups that are new. Let's say the coffee cups, hot tea, coffee. I put, I get a hot chocolate or a coke in it and I don't drink a lot of coke people just so you know that. We have many new images. I think we also showed this before already. If I can get a hold of this one underneath here, I can show you. I think these all have, this one might not. Here we go. It does. This is shiny, but we thought people would love to see. I talked so much about the portal in heaven where all your family comes to see you and if I can get this, I'll use this one. Where they come to watch your life, declare over you, pray for you and this is it right here and that is actually in heaven. That's where they go. If they want to see what babies are born, when marriages happen, they don't miss it on, miss any of that stuff. They go on your birthday every year to this place in heaven and they lean over a balcony and they actually sing happy birthday to you. So that looks like a really big building cat. It's massive. It's massive. At the bottom of those columns, you see like screens, like the media screen, but the ones on the one side will show you when your family member is going to, it's got born again and on the other side of the room, those screens show you when they're about to come to heaven. That's how people know to meet you at the gate. So this is now, not in the scene or all the angels flying overhead in this place, beautiful angels in there and angels even go to with people and they regard an angel. Sometimes they will go to to stand next to your family members. They declare over you. So they haven't forgotten you. Your family love you probably more in heaven than they ever did on this earth. They're declaring over you. They're praying for you. The angels are heaven is cheering you on in your life in this race we run from Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you, Kat, so much for being with us today. Make sure you guys don't follow any fake accounts and just a general rule for Facebook and Instagram. Don't give money that way. Go to the minister's website or a secure place to give money. And Kat, we love you just, we love you so, so much. We love all your team. Hello to everybody behind the scenes there with you. I know there's a bunch of people there. We love you guys too so much. Make sure that everyone joins us tomorrow. Steve will be here with Mike Thompson. You don't want to miss it. Have an awesome day and we'll see you tomorrow. God bless. Bye. you

Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Good morning from the Pacific Northwest. I'm Steve Schultz, founder along with my wife of both the Elijah List, ElijahList.com and Elijah Streams that you're watching. You see flowers behind me. We are celebrating today the 100th episode of Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So we're going to talk about that in just one second, talk about that a little bit more and then of course Kat's got some great message for today and some questions and answers. So if we have time, so it's going to be a great fun, fun filled day, but welcome to the broadcast a very quick announcement. Let's see. First of all, Cash Patel will be back with us tomorrow. So don't miss that as far as far as profits and Patriots, but we're going to do American Warriors real quick. So let me read this to you. Paul Lesher, Lesher, I hope I'm saying that right, was a young man enraged by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and quickly enlisted in the army. He found himself on the front lines of World War II in Europe, directly fighting some of the biggest battles of the war coming face to face with Germans behind enemy lines. He has some fascinating stories to tell and this is part of it. Go ahead. So we had to be frequently behind enemy lines or you might say ahead of our lines. There was hell and destruction everywhere with Grant, but we were here in the southern area and we were sent back up to the Battle of the Bulge and that's where it was so cold it was colder and it had been in a long, long time. But it's a good thing we were as young and healthy as we were or we wouldn't have made it. Wow, great story. You got to see today's episode of American Warriors and here are the places to look on Rumble where American Warriors 22 where you can just type American Warriors at Rumble on YouTube. It's American Warriors 22 or just type American Warriors on YouTube and you'll be right there. So my brother and I produce these together. It's a great, these are great stories. Many of them give glory to God. And you hear, you know, it's, it's, it's good to honor those who went before us and fought for our freedom. You know, we were attacked on December 7, December 7, 1941. And the world was never the same. So we are in crucial times even now. So this, this is good to remember those who went ahead of us and fought for us. We honor, we honor, I just put his name down, but we honor him. So, all right, well, it's time to bring in. It's time to bring in Kat for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Well, Kat, we're 100 today. That's amazing. Isn't it 100 weeks? We are 100. Yeah. 100 shows, 100 weeks. I see the blue, they added a balloon since I last saw you. Boy, your, your, your balloons there are, are multiplying. I have flowers that were sent, these flowers behind me were sent as a celebration and they pre gave me my cake. We're going to show your cake in a minute. Here's my chocolate cake. Look at this piece. This is one piece. One slice. Wow. I may take a bite, but this is the actual full cake. Happy 100. Yummy. They sent that to me. So they, they gave you a cake. Let's bring your cake in and show it to me while I take a bite. Oh man, this is so good. This is the cake right here. Oh, look at that. What does it say Jen? It says eat cake. And this chocolate also, there you go. One hundredth episode it says. That's so good. You know, they call, they call, there you go. You know, they call white cake, angel food cake, but I think chocolate cake is actually angel food cake. So really? I'm just gonna, I'm determined that. So, Hey, so you've seen Jesus love, love sweets. What kind of cake does he like? All cakes. He loves sweets. He really does love sweets. And I think one of the things, believe it or not, that really changed the way I thought of life in the throne room was the time they took me in there and there were sweets lined up about 50 steps up to the Wow. Are you serious? The summer sitting there, he was eating a piece of cake. People on earth probably would think, Oh no, that would never happen. Yes, it would. It's a family. We're a family up there. And God is our father. He has all these kids that would be coming home, his sons and daughters, and they do plan amazing events. Some of them are fun. That is so good. And in heaven, you don't gain weight. Right now, if I just look at this cake, I gain weight. So, oh my goodness. Well, you know, happy 100th episode, you know, little did we know two, two years ago, just right at, right at the two year anniversary where, or Johnny, some of you have heard me say Johnny and low text to me, he says you're supposed to do 10 days in a row with cat curve before the show. So I said, Oh, I did the forest gum thing where I go. Okay, you know, I didn't know. I didn't know if you would say yes, we weren't doing this that we weren't doing daily shows at the time. And so you said yes, and we jumped in and God just breathed on this thing and put his favor and this ministry has exploded. I assume yours has too. Yes, it has. It's just been an amazing ride. So what else tell us something else about this? I think I also mentioned at one time, the father actually have been talking to me since you told me about what Johnny and love said, that you probably need to do more than just the 10 so don't be surprised. Yes, just don't be surprised. Well, I was surprised and here we are 100 weeks later, while just thinks the how much the world and the body of Christ has received revelation about having itself, how they operate. What the Father, Son and Holy Spirit look like what their actions are activities, how they operate heaven, and things to come and revelation on things from the past has filled the heart and the soul of so many probably millions of people by now. All over the world have been changed because you listen to God and Johnny and low and so it was so fun. By the way, in case anyone wonders, I've no only known about this cake just it got delivered about 10 o'clock today. Or maybe 930 somewhere in there. And I thank my staff, Dennis, Julie, all those that were involved in the whole staff. I had talked about doing something on the 100th but I didn't know I was going to get cake and my favorite cake of all angel food cake, which is chocolate cake is my very favorite. Yeah, the whole world and I just found out about just now. Wow. Yeah, because when you found out I use. I said I think there's a cake for you and you go where's my cake. That was hilarious. I love it. So well, God is in a celebratory mood and you did say just before he went on the air, you said they're eating cake in the throne room and I said did you just see that. And you said yeah, they're eating cake everyone in their thousands and thousands and thousands of people can fit into the throne room of God, and they all have cake. Yeah, you know, there was a coming victory which to them you have to understand they've already been there. Yeah, I say the coming victory is the coming victory for us, but they have already been in the victory since they go to the beginning to the end and the end of the beginning. They've already seen it happen people. So yes, yeah, we'll be celebrating and eating cake soon. And when you do I'll be doing it with all of you. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Well, you know, there was a time if you go back seven, eight years ago about the time I met you. I thought I don't know if I wouldn't have known about this cake thing, but you talked about amusement parks and I'm going I don't know I'd like to believe that but I don't know well I have no, you know, in the ensuing days I have in years in this case I have no question whatsoever that God has fun that God eats cake that God has enjoyable times. You've talked about extreme sports and you've even talked about people that love cars will car collect and people have will have their. Can it be said that people have hobbies in heaven would that be a thing. Yeah, I think what they do the most in heaven is what their hobby was on the earth. We all carry a gift in us. When he sends us he already puts in his mind to photographer that's actually I am a photographer that's where I really am that's what he made me. That's where he sent me to earth as a photographer when I go ahead and have a I have my own studio and do supernatural things with photography. I will wait. I will wait. So that's what you do the thing. The most the passion that you have that way. His purpose always was he said your gifts are without repentance, which means he's and you're not he's not going to take him away because that's what you will do in heaven. Whether you sing, whether you teach dance, whether you have rodeos, you know, they have movies in heaven, they capture them, they don't have to produce them to actually capture them. And what you see is live action in heaven. Now you have to have heaven they don't even have to have what do you call the ratings. They're all G rated or fun rated. There's fun rated. There's excitement, intensity, beauty, wonder, splendor in all of the movies made in heaven and even music in them just by signing up in heaven for them. You see a lot of people that was their gift on the earth doing that in heaven. If they receive Jesus Christ as a savior, you will surely use your gift. I have been working in Christmas Town, my brother writing music and playing music in heaven. My dad is running over heaven probably helping God with things. Or it's the M.M. Parks that will be mobile mansion parks. I know what they're doing because that was their passion. You know, you and I are not that different as far as photography when I was part of the photography club in high school, the annual on the annual team. And then I did portrait photography for not a living for a second income. I did weddings and I did portraits, but you know, yours was nature, which I love, but dreams better at that than I am. But I was a portrait guy. I wanted to capture portraits in a way that that would be, you know, very, very complimentary and creative. So, you know, I don't know if I'll do that in heaven or not, but we'll see, I guess. I'm sure you will if you love it that much. Yeah. Yeah, I think, you know, there was sick. There's a family of eight, six kids. And I was the first one to get a camera. You know, back in those days, you had that little brownie or the little thing camera. You write about this big. Yeah, do anything with the lens, but take a picture the way that lens is made. Yeah, stationary. You couldn't do any enhancements on your photography. Yeah. And mostly in the beginning black and white film in the beginning. Yeah. Yeah. And then when color came out, it was so amazing and you'd have either people don't understand who come up today where they even take unlimited photos. You had 24 or 36 exposures. And I remember this, even the smell of that film and it just smells so good, fresh film, you know, and you'd put it in there and you'd take very careful, but you didn't get to see him sometimes for weeks later. I love the way it is now better. But I but you but it's missing the the smell of the film and I of course I'd work in the dark room and I would, you know, you do all the creative things with the with in the dark room that was you know, I still have a it's called s is that camera like the 35 millimeters were the first ones made that had a 35 millimeter lens, which means you got better pictures. If you want to enhance them, you bought different colored lenses and screw them on the front of the camera. Blue, yellow to cause different effects for your camera. That's called SLR cameras, single lens reflex, which means you really put a different until it came up, of course, with the with the camera. Well, they got it. Well, now they call him a DSLR. So it's a digital SLR. Now look at it right after you take it. Yeah, they combine it. When I was at summer camp, you know, I met Doreen the third year I was a summer camp. But the first two years I pioneered the photography program for the campers. So that's awesome. The photography, they would pay to take that class. And we would have them all take their pictures and then I would go in the dark room and develops color slide film. And then on Saturday night, we on Saturday night, we show. Yeah, on the Saturday night, we show the slides with music. It was all different. Oh, I did. I did. It was fun. You know, everyone looked forward to Saturday night where we see the slides for that for that week. It was very, very fun. You know, so. Well, even now, we have, we have so many different cameras and all kinds of attachments and stuff like that. We, when we do a cruise, when we speak on a cruise, we have workshops, one of those workshops is basic photography workshop. Everybody's encouraged to bring your camera user phones. We teach them how to take the best pictures of their crews and how to use light, how to stand people properly. And we love it, except actually using our gifts. So yeah, we still do that. I didn't know you did that on the cruise. Oh, wow. We do. We do. Wow, that's very, very good. Yeah, it was fun fun. I had a deal with Kodak where Kodak sent me their best teaching materials and it was professionally produced. It was fun. Photography was a lot of fun, you know, and so, yeah, it's hard to get that. Oh, I love the smell of photography developing. It was so good. Yeah, it's kind of a, well, you know, it's got, it's got, you know, the developer, the, you see, it's the developer, the fixer, and then there's, there's a third one. And now it's, it's, I'm rusty on it now. There's three chemicals and you put them through that. But you had, you had techniques back then, especially in black and white with dodging and burning. If something was underexposed, you, you'd cover everything else and expose it more during the. I love even just talking about photography, but I don't do as much. I only, the only thing to take pictures of now is teaching people how to do it or I do host, I take pictures of the host. And we also teach a workshop, host ID. And we teach you through the film and the pictures that I've taken, what a real cloud formation is or what activity in the spirit realm is. And then what the host looked like. Which is awesome. Then we go outside and we do it on the cruise ship too. And everybody, the hosts have gathered and they all take pictures. So now Kat is what I understand is people's hobbies and gifts. They are just as much as you and I are, are, are talking about the fun with photographer. They would photography. They would be talking about the same thing in heaven with cars. You said cars. Take into an antique car show, but the cars were not actually old. Nothing ages in the spirit realm. There's no aging. So that was the, they were really awesome looking cars. Some are new designs. Some are very old designs. You know, God can remake anything he wants to. And this person on the earth, that's what they did. That was their gift to create car shows, some old, some futuristic ones. And when they died and went to heaven, he already had a place made for them with his special places to put on shows and stuff with the cars. And I know you all are probably saying, well, what about, what about preaching the gospel? What about soul winning? Number one, there's no soul winning in heaven. Right. While you're there. It's done. You have to understand the five fold ministry is not used much. It was made for the earth. That was set in place so God could have some structure to the five fold ministry and they would understand what that was and what their part in that was. And that was specialized in a certain field. Like they would do revivals. They would do healing ministries. They would do teaching. They would share the word of God and teach it. All kinds of different things with the five fold ministry on the earth. But in heaven, you already have that and you haven't even already got all that. The one thing they do in heaven is you go to the royal university, which teaches you what ruling and reigning with Christ through all of eternity. What they will look like. It'll be caring for some things that they will take us and let us do. So that part is still there. That part of it will be there. But mostly there's no soul winning. Nobody has to get filled with the Holy Spirit. She's right there next to you talking. So you have to think what else is there then? And people have for centuries said, well, we're going to worship. And every church you ever went to would talk about, well, I'll get together. There are crowns in the street. We'll all bow down for all eternity. And I had people who actually thought heaven would be boring. And I went, no, with a God that created that made this search, it's got to be more than that. That was before they started taking me to heaven. And boy, is there a lot more than that. And the father said, I can't leave the fun side out. If I'm your father and you are coming home as sons and daughters, I would have to have places prepared for you to have fun. And he did. So what he did was whatever gift he gave you, whether it could be singing, creating music, it could be baking. That is an art in heaven, baking or food preparation. Restaurants are there because people owned them on the earth, wanted them, always wanted them. They create some different clothing and apparel. I was going to ask you about that. I was going to ask you about that a minute ago. So if someone says, I love to make clothes or I love to fashion clothes, you know, you said that I did, I did a show, which I did every week. So someone that makes clothes would do a fashion show in heaven. That's right. They would make things and then they'd have a show. And then they would give them away because nobody pays for anything in heaven. You use your gift for everybody in heaven, no matter what that is. There's campgrounds in heaven. There's the places to go and the mountain of spices or things to do, you know, in the valley of the falls, there's all kinds of things to do there. And the other places I was shown in heaven, most of them were for having family time because you still spend time with your family in heaven and do things together. You meet new people, have new friends. You're always, always a fellow shipping. Fellow shipping doesn't mean you just sit around a table and eat. It means you're going to different events that are going on in heaven all the time. And there's throne room activity where you get so undone when you worship, you're caught up into the air in the throne room and you get totally undone with the ways and the love of God consuming you. And you were so glad that Christ died on the cross for us. We had an opportunity. We came from heaven. We lived in the Father. He made a way back to him and that's what the Bible says. And that was by his son giving himself to carry all sin, evil and wickedness. Nail it to the cross so you could choose him to forgive your sins and then you would have a way back to heaven. And forever and ever and ever be together with all those you love and those who you only take to heaven people. You can't take things to heaven. You don't need them number one. He's got so much stuff up there for you, but you won't need. But souls you can take. Those you share the gospel with, when to Christ. You know your family members who know Christ. And you're together forever and ever. They may have left you, they have moved to heaven early and you're not there. And I know people really sorrow, but because of releasing Revelation on heaven itself it really has helped with the grief thing. People actually consider the family members doing things all over heaven preparing them for them to come one day and be with them. Even all the little babies, every single little baby that passed. They're all in heaven. And if they're yours, they will be waiting for you when you get there. So good. Now I know we're going to talk about things about Halloween, things in just a moment, but one last question. Is there photography and cars and sewing and shows in heaven because it was on earth first, or is it the other way around? It is the other way around. Everything is says in the Bible, every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of life. That would be God our Father. We were little lights living in him. He timed our birth on the earth. He knew the gift we would carry and would use even on this earth. So you use it because it is there. God did already have it in heaven. Of course, there's nothing defiling, nothing profane, nothing like that exists in heaven. None of the movies have any horror stuff or any of the wicked stuff. None of that's in heaven. But the gift he put in you with it was making the best spaghetti sauce on the earth. That's what you'll do in heaven. That is your gift. That's why there's surf parks. That's why there's all kinds of things to do together with your family. Places to go with the Lord, to be alone with the Lord and say things to him that you always wanted to say. Passionate paradise is about the love of God. It's a place he takes you to honor all the things you've done with your life. There are so many beautiful things to do up there. And places to go. There's adventure. There's excitement. And there's fun. It's part of heaven. It was always there. So good. So good. Paul didn't know what to say when he saw things. He didn't even know how to explain them because they didn't have them on the earth yet. Yeah, I mean, I can imagine him seeing an amusement park or old cars and saying, I've seen things that I'm not even allowed to tell you about. And I always thought, well, this must be something so holy that, but I'm now I'm beginning to wonder if it was just the simple things that there would be no good for such as photography, which didn't exist, you know, and fashion show. Say again. I was in the sky that you fly in the sky and heaven. That would really get him, I'm sure. Oh man, someday I'm going to ask him what all he saw. I want to know that answer. Well, we better jump into what you have for today. But this has been really fun going down. Some of this is memory lane, but I've got my cake here. I may take a bite, but anyway, jump in where you want to go and tell us what's on your heart for today. You know, God made this earth for a purpose. Number one, he wanted us to have a body when we lived in him. We had those spiritual bodies. He wanted to make it possible for us to have a physical body for all the time. So he made a physical. This whole, you know, this whole place out there in space is physical. What we can see, what we can send ships to, you know, space ships to and circle and take pictures. That is called the physical realm. Most of the most of the places are spiritual realm places, spiritual realm places. I stand with the Southern girl right now. Anyway, so he made this physical earth so you could have a physical body. So he came up with a whole plan for a man and a woman to get married, fall in love, get married and have a family. And at the time of conception from the man and the woman. Okay. And they knew each other's husband and wife. Then he would send a little spirit of life from himself. He says in the Bible, I knit you together in your mother's womb. He's not putting your arms and legs on. He's talking about knitting that little spiritual body to that dot of flesh. And your spirit man grows right along on the inside of your physical man. And then one day, whenever that day is, when you pass from this life, when you pass, when you die, that spirit man steps out of your physical body. It looks just like you. Okay. It has all of its thoughts and the memories of his family and all that stuff like that. And that spiritual body, that's what goes to heaven. Your flesh rests on the day the dead and Christ shall rise. That is your body. But it's not your spirit man and your soul that cannot die. It would never be sleeping anywhere. That's why they come to take you to heaven and heaven, which is a spiritual world. You have a spiritual mansion, all the stuff on your property is yours. Yes, you eat, you sit, you enjoy all the stuff God gave to you. Your family, your friends come, you go to other places and enjoy what God made for them. And it says those mansions are made not by human hands. I'm sure the Lord had a lot to do with the building and design of it. And they're great designers. Some is very supernatural. You know, that's what I would call it, very supernatural, even beyond what you call modern. But some is very beautiful and amazing. They know exactly what you want. So they had all that plan and it was going on fine till Satan got his face involved. Decided he was going to take over Earth since he was kicked out of heaven. I'll remind you all that Satan was kicked out on a lightning bolt. I've sure fried part of his brain, which is why some people who are evil can't think very well. You get around those evil people want to be a part of them. Something happens to your brain too. So have nothing to do with wicked evil people. I'm just like, you know, right now. He's going to take over heaven. He was kicked out the day in hell. He thought he would torture the son of God. That didn't go well either. You know, he failed again. He failed. Epic fail. Epic fail. Now people around this world because the wicked and the evil are going to fail miserably along with Satan. This is not the time for them to have their takeover. I'm not even sorry, but it's not time to take over. Although he's trying. He's going to fail miserably. Justice is coming. Holy Spirit is making me say that right now. Okay. So when Satan decided, I'm taking over, you know, remember some of the, the, the walker, the watcher angels were sent to the earth to help educate man. Some of them decided to follow Satan. They became worshiped as gods on the earth to introduce human sacrifice, all kinds of black arts and magic and stuff that came from Satan today in this world. The wicked evil stuff going on is from one being. His name is Satan. Okay. He is only the Lord of the flies who can't beat over the Lord of the host. So I might remind him of that because these days are glory days. And God had told me several years ago, the fire is coming to be baptized. Everybody baptized in the fire of God and also the days of glory, carrying the glory that you created for Christ, releasing it all over this world. The Bible says the knowledge and the knowing and understanding of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea and the waters cover two thirds of the, of this world. So that's a lot of glory being released. And it's entered like a shock wave. It'll pass through you to people in building people run up to get saved when that happens. So God's not willing in case you all wondered if he forgot about us, God has not changed his plans and he will not change his plans. The plans made by the evil one, the Lord of the flies, it's going to fail miserably and everybody who's a part of that will go down the hole with him. There will be like dust not remembered. They'll have no power, no property, no place, no say, nothing. So don't be concerned about what the evil is doing. Why not start talking about what God himself has got planned. Today's of greater glory, the fire of God coming, the money, the money, remember the money thing that's going to come from the wicked. It's going to be given to the just and the righteous, more money than the wicked has ever had. The body will have that you. If you've been faithful and just, and that's what it's laid up for, it is going to happen. It has not happened yet. They're not even doing the great, the world's on the greater work. So there's too many things that we still have to do in this world. He's not done. I've been taking well over 150 years into the future. Now it was a hundred and silver 150 and the tribulation had not come. Okay. Things were the greatest they'd ever been and creativity was so wonderful. People were amazed. Your life got easier and better. Okay. God also in these days coming will erase the great area that says there is no God. So you can, you can throw that in the trash. There is no God. He's about to show up and show up on behalf of all of us. He knows what his plan is. He knows exactly what's happening right now behind the closed doors of the Justin, the righteous. And then real soon what was planned behind those closed doors that they had. They don't believe in God. Anyway, they're about to suck his fire. That's what's going to happen. And then they'll be like dust on this earth because he does have a plan for you and I, and I can't wait to see it happen. I am celebrating what's having doing there celebrating these days coming on the earth. They're not set there scared and afraid of the wicked evil beings on this earth. Not the spiritual or the physical God holds the air they breathe and they better watch out. So good. So good. Now, Kat, I'm going to ask you a question. A lot of people and I think Christians as well. Not myself because I've never wanted to be scared. But a lot of Christians go, man, I just love scary movies. I don't believe in witches and warlocks and ghosts, but I just love in Halloween time going to scary movies and being so scared. It's so fun for me. Talk about that. I think that's a bad plan, people. It's enough to talk about what the wicked evil people the flesh are doing on the earth. But when you start glorifying and seeking out and craving horror movies, that is the enemy working on your soul. Okay. Normally as a believer in Christ who knows him, who's seen his miracles happen, have read his word over and over again, would not want anything to do with horror. Horror comes from hell. And that, that vacation, that's what Satan thinks it is. Halloween. You need to know what the first part of that word mean. Did you ever think about it? Okay. Hollowed ground is holy ground. Well, they can get property or buildings or movies or haunted houses or witches operating. That makes evil hollow. Wow. Halloween is a wicked day created by Satan to get your kids to look at these things. And think they're fun. But all he's doing is tagging them. And I'm telling you, don't take your kids to no haunted house or anything to do with that. They will tag them. What does that mean? Tag them. That means the enemy will put a mark on them that they willingly entered into something that was that wicked and evil is still horror. Horror is not in heaven. It is not in the heart of God. The horror comes from hell. So when you're interested in hell's plans or their ideas, you get a mark. You're going to movie theater to see something like that. You get a mark. They mark you. They sit on these platforms over top of the doors of all these R rated movies or wicked evil movies, satanic movies. And you get urinated on. I'm just going to be honest by the demons sitting over that door. Wait, wait, wait. You went by that really fast. Say that again. What you just said, you get your theater. There are platforms created by Satan. And he positions a demon over the door. You walk into the movie theater to see that movie. And when you go in, you get urinated on. That's their mark. And it leaves a visible mark in the spirit realm and no matter where you go after that, they will, they will, they will look for you. So they pull you into something else and get you deeper and deeper into darkness. They'll get you to go to sales. They get to have your palm read. Whatever, every time you do something like that, you get another mark on you. Satan has a mock graveyard. And if you do that enough times, he puts your name on those great songs. Heaven. What about it's not Halloween and somebody just says, man, I just think it's so fun to watch zombie movies where supposedly these dead people are walking around. It's not, it's not Halloween. I'm just watching zombie movies. What about that? I wouldn't want you anything to represent anything of evil. There is no dead walking around. That is not, that's what Satan would like to do. And if he could pull everybody out of the graveyard, make them wick and let them walk around doing horrible things. He would do that, but he can't. He is not over life itself. So he tries to go after people who are alive to use them. And I can tell you, if you watch enough violent movies, you will be violent as a man think it in his soul. So is he. Okay. That's what you will do. That's what you will follow after. That's what you will look for. So I encourage people don't say, you don't see any of it. Don't participate anywhere. Never go to any place that Satan is represented in any way. Witches are not good. They are all wicked. They're wicked. They even make movies called Satan named wicked. And the one thing that Satan will try to fool people with in the future. I'll just let you know right now is that witchcraft is good. You know, so which is performing miracles and things, but all Satan has to do is take the sickness off people. He put on there and it will appear that those witches healed them. I'm just gotta be honest people. You understand have nothing to do with October 31st except for this. Did you know that was reformation day? It was all saints. It was reformed. And when that when that one of those articles were nailed to the church door for people to have freedom in their life to have the word for themselves. October 31st is reformation day. Yeah. They also call it all saints day. I remember being when that happened and yet Satan stole that day. You know, I had an encounter. It was that profound. So I would call it an encounter. It's not that I saw something. I was in Europe by myself. I shouldn't have been there because I needed an assistant, but I was there and it was October 31. I think I was mildly aware that it was all saints day, which is one of the names they call it. And the bell started tolling and it wasn't very far away. There was a church because they got churches all over year. They started tolling on October 31 and cap the spirit fell all over me on October 31 all saints day. And I knew that I knew this was not Halloween doing this. This was all saints day. And what do you think about that? I was going to say also, you can either call it reformation day or all saints day. Those are both two holy things that represents what God wants us to have and to know about. So Satan, when he looked for this fake holiday he wanted, he decided he always will go after what God has. He always does it. He'll mock things that belong to God images and places and make them evil and say they always belong to him. No, nothing belong to him. Hell doesn't belong to him. That was made for his abode because he was kicked out of heaven. But yet you're right. You're right Steve. That is a day to be hollowed for God. It is not Halloween. I have no participation. I'm even going to have a sign made a really big one that says we don't do demons here. We celebrate all things day. We celebrate revelation. We celebrate the life of God at this place. If anybody comes to our door, they get a little thing that talks about Jesus Christ. Well, it makes me think of the fact that the enemy specifically and purposely perverted October 31 simply because it was meant to be that way. I can even go back. Dren and I found out starting about 88 that God would visit us in a way, not that I'm seeing him in person, but on October 31 he would visit us. And of course we knew it has nothing to do with Halloween. God was giving us encounters and confirmations. It was like a day that he pecked. So anyway. It was his day. It's been his day for a very long time. No one in heaven celebrates Halloween. Nobody does. It's not mentioned. It's not practiced. It belongs to the devil. I would not take your children anywhere to have anything to do with that. They're innocent, but you as a parent are giving permission when you take them. And some people probably mad at me. Well, at least I told you the truth. If I love you, I will tell you the truth. I want to save you from all kinds of harm and things later on in your life. My dad was always right. We wanted to go trick-or-treating ourselves. This is way back in the 50s. Okay. In the 50s people, they didn't have the stuff going on. My dad said, I don't like this. I don't think this is God. Yeah. He let us go for a while because we started seeing some things happen on that day. And we said, no, we're not doing this anymore. We do not practice it. And yes, I do speak against it whenever I get a chance because you need to be aware. Anything that looks like horror, suffering, death, dying, manipulation, control, pure evil. You know, the images as well as the actions. I know people went to some haunted house somewhere last year and people had horrific testimonies on what they saw and what happened there. They left really terrified. Wow. Anything you've ever done that you need to lose those encounters and that stuff in your soul, lose from your soul every time you participated in that or any other day that represents something that Satan is over. Yeah. And let me, I want to come back just for a moment. You talked about, you used the word both tagged and marked. He tags and marks. If you go to a horror film, by that, are you meaning if you go in, first of all, you've given permission for him to tag you or mark you or urinate you. And from that moment on, unless you repent of it, he has permission to, to what? Well, he'll have, well, demons will follow you sometimes and get you pulled into something darker and deeper. Because that was your choice to go. And that's what they do. And God himself actually can't stop that because you have a choice. You have a will. You're old enough, you're old enough to understand this is bad and this is wicked. I still want it. You're, you're yourself are giving permission. You do. Yes. You do need to repent for any time you participated with anything that belonged to the enemy, whether it was things that was said, things that you watched and movies, things that you heard, things that you attended yourself. You need to break all that off of you, especially the witchcraft, break it off of you. And I have news for you. Some of the stuff being, being made and shown in movies for kids has witchcraft attached to it. You need to be careful what your kids are going to see. You're responsible. You are raising a soul. You're raising a human soul for God and for what he has planned for them. But you cannot, you cannot put harm in their way. If you're choosing to take him with something that you know is darkness. It was darkness and evil. That is not for your children. It isn't for anybody. It's the one way that Satan can get, get to you is by you give, you give permission when you go, you give permission when you go that. Yes, I chose that. Yes, I knew it was in it. And I went, if you get there by now, you didn't know, then leave, leave. Don't stay. Yeah. If your friends, your friends, if you, if you're afraid that your friends will be ashamed of you. You don't want to be ashamed of Jesus Christ and his blood. That's what's keeping you. So all these days, so you can tell them, I'm sorry, I don't participate with the devil. That's a nice line to give. That way you're not saying anything against them. You're speaking against the evil. And I'm going to encourage you to do that. The days coming on this earth, people are going to know absolutely what is the darkness and what is it of the light? There's no place to hide in the middle. Pretend like you don't know anything. Yeah. You will see acts, acts that have already happened during these last two years. There are so wicked beyond imagination and we are not putting up with it. No one. Okay. No one voted for the right person who actually won number 45. Yeah. Once any of this, this was not our choice. This government was not our choice. The way they're running it was not our choice. And they're not doing anything good for this country. You are about to see the hand of God move. And I mean move mightily in this, in this country and in this world. And there we no doubt in your heart who won and who didn't win. And we don't need any more evil because God's, this devil is pushing this right on the heels of the entry into these days of glory. And God will let it just go so far and it's ending. It will be an end. This is not our new norm. The fire and the glory and the love of God and creativity, that will be our new norm. So good. So good. Well, Kat, we have questions to ask you today. But I want to make sure you, if there's anything else you want to say or share before we get into questions, let me know. I just know that things are very, very close, especially what I have recently. I don't just so people know. I don't look up other people and listen to them. I don't number one have time. I don't watch videos sent to me by people. I don't listen to broadcast or whatever. I don't have time. I don't care. I pray for these people who are doing the work of God. But I, I'm not going to be accused of hearing something and saying it because someone else said it. If I say it, then God said it. And that's the way it is. He won't let me put certain things in my soul. I can't read books. People have written. I pray for those people. They wrote their book. If it's from God, then I pray that they do well with it. I am only filled with revelation from the father, from the word of God, from what the Holy Spirit takes me and shows me. What from Jesus plans for this earth? That's what I am filled with, which is why I know if something good enemy comes along trying to fool me. Last night, he was trying to tell me to stop breathing. I'm going to die anyway. He was telling you to stop. What? Out of my room and said, get out. You liar, friar. I'm not having nothing of your garbage. I will complete what God has given me. And I will do that 100 day, 100 week broadcast. I'm doing it. I'm going to yell loudly against you to get out double. Wow. Wow. And you said that really fast. He was telling you to stop. What? Breathing. I had had a minor injury to my, my chest bone. Okay. And because I was overactive, I was healing. Well, it was doing okay. Nothing broke or anything. Uh, but I was really overactive the other day. So it was hurting. And, uh, I just kept holding onto it and the devil comes up behind me. I want you sorry thing. Oh, you just need to just stop breathing and give up. You just not going to survive. Wow. And I turned around. I went, you are afraid of me. You're afraid of every believer who has God inside. It doesn't mind sharing it. You're not going to like what I say tomorrow, but I'm going to say it loud and clear. And then I told him, he wasn't going to affect me in any way to get out. He actually ran. He ran through the wall. Wow. Wow. You know, that was what you just said was very, very helpful. Cause there's a whole, uh, there are thousands of people that just said, that was so good to hear. Cause even cat can, can get attacked, but look how she handled it. So you really helped a lot of people with that. Yeah. That's, that's great. That's awesome. How you did that. So super good. So, um, okay. We got 45 coming back one day soon. Anything else? You just mentioned that anything else about 45 before I get any questions. I think, uh, besides him, there's going to be so much activity going on. Uh, you know, I November, if you remember, November the fourth, 2020, that was the first time God spoke that was after the day we said we would, we'd have a meeting. I mean, it shows up to land until that day came. Then we wouldn't have anymore. That was our original plan. And I remember telling you, Steve, God wants to fourth, he has something to say. And, and I called you on the Thursday, something to say. And so I'm not quite sure what it's going to say, but he said it very boldly that justice was going to come when the ground began to shake the, the, the, the amount of fraud exposure would be almost unbelievable. The people, the landslide of fraud exposure is actually what he said will not stop until everyone who's involved in the whole stealing of 2020. Of 2020 election. They will be brought to justice. They will lose their position. They will lose their property. They'll lose their money. They'll lose their voice. And that's what God, the father said the day after the November 3rd, 2020 elections, he already told people they threw them in the river. Uh, they buried them. They burned them. They put fake things. This is, this is right after this probably still happening. Uh, but he said that the very next day on November the fourth, that was his report. He told me he has something to say. And that was what he said. And you go back and see that again or find it somewhere else, but I'm telling you God said that is exactly what I'm going to do. And no one can tell me no. Wow. So good. So good. So good. I'll take a few minutes. Right now there's being papers made out. I can't tell you who's making those papers, but there are people demanding people to, um, leave their positions. So resignation are being written even as I speak. I wouldn't have to tell you who they're for. Cause pretty soon you're going to be C. You're going to see who they're for. But like God said on the fourth of 2020, everyone and everything will be exposed. If you think you've been hiding it really well, you can't hide from God. And you better leave his people alone and not touch his anointed. You may not live very long. I don't mind saying that either. Cause he also said that. So I'm just letting you know, you're about to see the hand of God move. And there are the hearts of heroes in this country, getting together with other people in other countries. And guess what? You don't know who they are. I'm talking to the wicked left right now. You don't know who they are. Staying here everywhere all at the same time. You don't know what's happening. Why don't you check with your leader, the devil and see him cry. Because you're about to lose everything. And so is he. Can't have cake and celebrate right now. Absolutely. Justice is already on the earth waiting to get into action. So you mentioned a minute ago, but let me ask it again. So you, you know, we, we, the classic stories are Ann and IS and Sapphire. Of course they were believers who messed up and they lost their lives. And then there's the unsaved. And then there's probably those in the middle. Have you seen people just suddenly drop dead through this thing? I've never asked you this. So I don't know what you're going to say. Have you seen that? I have in the spirit. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Cause I've already been taken forward to the celebration. And right before that celebration. Well, I saw happening exactly what God said. They were telling on each other. This is the, this is all the, the line left though. So those, it doesn't just have to be the left. There's people even on the other side who are secretly being parts and getting paid off too. You're going to find out who they are too. Okay. Make sure you know who you voted for. Okay. Vote for what is right. What is life. What God would vote for. What would Jesus do people? You know all about that. Yeah. The difference between right and wrong. What's wrong is wrong. And you can't make that right. Yeah. Do it. So yes. I was showing people drop dead. On platforms while they were speaking places and they hauled their bodies off. Wow. Wow. Yeah, I wondered. I've never asked that. I don't think so. Yeah. Very sobering, sobering, sobering. Okay. Are you ready for a few questions? Yes, I'm ready. So illumination works for us. We, does it an amazing, fantastic job. She's asking this. She says, I've heard you talk about. Asking God not to write down the sins of those who have wronged you. Could I ask God not to write down someone's wrong against me that happened. Years ago. So I don't know. You know, there's that time thing. You understand the question. Yes. Yeah. So she happened years ago. Can she still right now choose as God not to. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well, I promise you, he wrote it down back then. I mean, it's written down. I guess you could ask him if, if it works. When you have a prayer like that, illuminate you. You ask God, if it is possible. That's good. This is a pot as if this is possible. You can ask that. And that's how it presented to the father. If this is possible, would you please remove the, the harm. And the, and the, the torment that somebody has. This person has done to me although it was years ago. I want it taken off my record that I held it against them. That would probably work. But this is what God said. Even though I recently have asked God to not write down the harm. I didn't even call it a sin. I said, right now in the harm that someone did against me. It was unjust. God, you know that. But because I have a true forgiveness in my heart. I'm forgiving them for doing it right now. Right after it was done. I forgive them. I'm going to act like they never did it. And also would you please not write it down against them. He didn't write it down. But this is what he said to me. I will not write that down, but I will tell you this. There will be consequences to pay with everybody else against them. Cause they can't say that. I can ask God not to write it down, but everybody is watching that stuff and knows about it. They're angry. They're upset. They don't want relationships with them now. And I'm not even going to say their names because I forgave them, but this is the consequences. He's done in the natural. There are consequences that will happen. Number one, they're still doing it. And number two, that's their choice. They chose to do this. Although God's word says something different. So God himself did not write it down as a wrong. Yeah. Consequences they will face because of what they did. That's up to them. If they stop, if they say, you know, I'm sorry for doing all that stuff. You know, there's that, there's that scripture that says in wrath, remember mercy. Could you say Lord in wrath that this person deserves? I forgiven him. Remember mercy. Here's an example. I know of a person that, you know, not that they would be known out and about, but their son was accidentally killed in an altercation. There was a fight, but he felt the son fell over backwards and hurt himself. And he was in the story. And God said to him, because it was going to, going to go to trial. And God said to him, I won't say his name, but God says, what do you want? And meaning towards the, towards the one who pushed him and he died. Because it was a real fight. And his answer was Lord, I want mercy. Yeah. And so that was a okay prayer to pray then, right? God to show mercy. Well, I don't know what that, the mercy could be many different things Steve. Yeah. The mercy was that it wouldn't be written down in heaven. But on the earth, even the legal consequences of somebody proving that and knowing that they may, that mercy may be, they go lighter on him. But I don't think that that means in the natural, he won't have to pay some kind of a price. I don't know what that price would be. Yeah. But because you're asking that that way, when it happened, when it happened, that probably means that they would get a lighter sentence or maybe let go sooner, sooner. But that would be a big thing that God would have to influence the judges, the jury, all the people involved in the, in the trial and stuff like that. And sometimes he will for certain reasons, but and sometimes most of them, I think they pay some kind of a price for their action. Oh yeah. Okay. That's really helpful. That's going to help a lot of people too. All right. Julie, who does our producing and she helped me get these flowers behind me. Thank you, Julie. Excuse me. She's asking this question. She gave me permission to say her name. So she says, I'm leaving the country next week. I've noticed in the last week, I've seen bright golden orbs or circles in my house. I know these are angels. And what I've noticed is they've gotten bigger than what I've seen them before. Am I being assigned new or bigger angels or hosts? That's a question. I think there's an increase in the authority that she has and the dominion that God has given her because she's been willingly been what he asked of her and has operated really well in forgiving people and seeking up things from God himself. If they've changed in any way, if there's more there, yes, that means that your assignment is about to get something added to it. The fact that they're gold or brighter lights now, that's a whole more authority and dominion thing. That's what that means. Okay. More authority and dominion. Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. So I guess this must have to do with decrees because they're talking about speaking. A few viewers are asking the same question. Is there something or are there things either way we can pray or speak against Halloween displays in neighborhoods or public spaces? Should you speak or decree against those in some way? Yes. We do that ourselves every time we come into our development. There's people that have really horrible displays and yes, I do. I do. In the name of Jesus Christ, that stuff will become like dust. It will be in no one's memory. It will not affect one single person in their spirit or in the flesh at any time whatsoever. And I do nullify any effects and nullify any wicked, evil, sadistic, torture, death, dying, suffering, spirits that have been brought along with that stuff. I evict him from this neighborhood in Jesus name and you will not come back. Good. I do not want to go into the evil spirits attached to these things that people put in front of their houses because they're actually portraying part of health. I mean, it's gotten darker because of the dark people who are trying to run this country. They allow more darkness here because people are standing up and finally becoming filled with God and saying things. They're not having as much of an effect. But if you go by and say nothing, you actually are just allowing them to remain until something comes down. That reminds me of, you know, because I've gone, you know, we're very careful in the movies we go to, but we may be heading down the hall to see a nice family movie passing by some really evil movies. Could you do the same thing about that? Speak against those. I almost make a hobby out of that. If there's anything to see, I actually take authority before I get to the theater people. Before you get there, if you know, like right now, there's almost nothing with seeing. I go by and I wave my hands. I send the anointing that destroys every yoke of darkness, trying to attach people to the evil or the wickedness of the horror. I nullify the effect. I evict those spirits from that place and people will become bored of watching them and they'll have to replace the movie in Jesus name. And you can do that in hotel rooms. You stay in. I'm going to the hotel until I do it. Really? Really? I don't have authority over any darkness. I do. We're of the light. We are here representing God. In Jesus name, I give you power over all the power of the enemy. That really means you have that. So I'm not going into a hotel until I kick everything out into a dry place. I release a life of God to flood every room. I go through and touch the hallway walls and say, I've released an anointing to destroy every yoke of darkness in this place or any attack of the enemy. I just kick the devil out. I release God into that place. That's interesting. It reminds me of this has to be almost probably 15 years ago we were in France and they took us around. I think they were considering a property for the church. It was a some sort of compound almost. There were several buildings and they wanted to know what I was discerning and I was pretty new at that. But I walked around and I said, someone meaning a human being has gone around and peed to mark this territory for the devil. I didn't know now what I know you just said. I just gave him the information. I should have nullified it right there, right? Yes. Do human beings, I mean, any claim or stake that the enemies put out. Yeah. You know, we're here to occupy until Christ comes. Occupy means take authority. That's what that word. Occupy like an army. You occupy. You're over everything that goes on in your area where you live, especially you have a high authority and dominion over the area or the city you live in. You always do. So I will run other drug. It used to be the drug people, all the kind of stuff that will be exposed, brought to justice because this city is becoming a city of light and I will not tolerate darkness in the city of any form whatsoever. I rule with Jesus Christ here. As a king, I make a ruling. You will get out. And you need to do that in any place, you know, that is doing wicked evil things. Don't just walk by some place that's having, you know, nudity shown on stage. Just make sure you take authority over it. That'll become nothing. And guess what? I did that one time and that place is nothing now. Wow. Wow. You have a voice. Use your voice for God. You take authority. Christ says we rule and reign with him now in this earth now. And in the time is to come, we will rule with him. You have rulership. You speak against any of that darkness that has no right to be around you or anywhere that you will not tolerate it. If you're not, if you're not participating with the darkness, you have every right to speak against the darkness and not tolerate it. You know, and one more example, this reminds me of a story. It's a known prophet, not as well known as others, but it's a known prophetess. And she was driving by one of those palm raider tarot card reader places. And she started cursing the place in so many words. I don't know what words she used and God stopped her short. And he said, don't curse the place, curse the money that's keeping it in business. So she said, oh, okay. She was at a stoplight. And so she said, I curse the money that's keeping that in business. And a woman came running out of the place screaming, saying, no. So it had an immediate effect. What do you think about that? I think either it was the person who would be losing the money who ran the place. You know, Satan does give them some sense of what's going on. And sometimes they will hear demons speak to them. I mean, those places really are partnering with demons, even if they don't know what they are and they may start screaming. So if they're screaming other people in there, if they're participating, may not hear that scream, but the person running it will. So it could have been them hearing those spoken. And that's why they ran off with screaming. No, no, I don't want that to happen. But you can't stop a believer who knows what they're doing, taking a story with Jesus Christ, especially with his name. I've never forgotten that because she's sitting inside her car at a stoplight. And she just did that real quick. So that was amazing. All right. Let's see. So Diane asked, she says, I'm wearing an I don't do demon shirt for a Halloween party. And for the 31st, what simple reply would you suggest for those who might ask about the shirt? Now, I don't know if she means Halloween party or harvest party. She's, she's calling it a Halloween party. So I can't, I don't know which kind of secular slash. Some people actually think it's perfectly okay to participate with having candy, having some little refreshments. No, it's not unless God sent you there. If he sent you there to be a witness and share something that might rescue somebody, that's different. You're choosing yourself. I'm going to go to this place and enjoy all the stuff, but I won't participate that it belongs to Satan. You're not doing, you're not doing anything good unless he sent you there. If he did an assignment, but I tell people, if people, this is the thing, it's not a good witness. If people see you there, walk by, they're at this party and they've got images of, of the wicked in the hell and death and dying stuff all over the place. They know what it is and they know that they think you're having a good time. They don't realize you're getting marked by the enemy. So if you go as a believer because you have a good shirt on that says something, don't go there. And unless Jesus Christ tells you, go to the mall and where, go to the mall, where there's not no party going on. And then when people ask you, you can say, I don't participate with hell. I don't approve of anything hell does. I know if I, all of their images, I know if I, all of their actions and Jesus name, because they are not of the light. She should walk around the mall with that or someplace where there's people, but I would not go to something called a Halloween party. Right. And I might as well make a comment about this. A lot of churches, because they don't want kids going to do trick or treating. They will have a harvest or fall fest. I do want to say this. This is the time to celebrate the fall. It is a time to celebrate harvest. I've been to many harvest events and they were fun and people there prayed for everybody else while we were there. They got in hospital. We prayed together against the people who weren't participating in the darkness. Something like that would be perfectly okay. Just don't dress like something of the darkness. Don't go to a church harvest festival, which our church, I don't know if they're having one this year. I don't remember. I asked, I think they're going to do something different. But every year on this day, they would always have powerful big events. They'd have God's music playing amazing music. People would get fellowship. Some people would talk about knowing Christ more. But it was a fun family thing. It had nothing to do that it was part of Halloween. They never called it a Halloween anything. That's the leaders dressed like that. They spoke against that stuff. So that is different. That would be an option you could do in honoring All Saints Day or Reformation Day. I think it would be great if somebody had an All Saints Day event. And then you tell people, but when they did that, people from the neighborhood came, which they wanted to win the Christ. And now no one else would be wearing this, but they would come in dressed as people that look like the darkness. And they looked around and started wearing everything else. And they started asking them, well, what is this? And they would say, we're not celebrating Halloween. We don't participate with celebrating. It's Hell's Day. We bring people with the light and Jesus Christ. So do you want to know about it? And that helped to lead people to Christ. So you can't walk up to someone this year and say, get out of here. You look evil. You never want to come darken your door on your property. So we just want you to know that we love you and care about your family, but we don't dress like that during this time of the year because we don't partner with darkness. So people going to hay rides and corn mazes and all of that. That's just, even if it's on the same day, it's there. It's a substitute because it's a fall. It's not really a substitute. It's a fall. It's not a substitute for Halloween. There are places that have always like 100 years have had fall festivals during this time of the year because it is harvest time in many places. I would go up to Virginia all the time and our grandchildren, our daughter and our son-in-law, they always would do the corn maze fun things. And they would do it on, I don't know if it was church property. I think it was the school property, but everybody who went to the elementary school grown up. The biggest fall festival I've ever seen. There was never any mention of Satan. There was never any of the dressing like for the other thing, the other holiday. That was a fun family day. It was all about fall and harvest time because a lot of the farmers had harvested. And some of them hold them in their barns at the end of the fall season, which would be the end of October. So that's going on. That's a totally different thing. That's a delightful fun harvest thing to do. You know, pick out a pumpkin, you know, make your pumpkin pie. They have pie contest and cake baking contest and jar can stuff contest though. Yeah. It's a fun time for families. So good. Okay. Mary asked, what's the difference between the 90, now we're moving into other guests. What's the difference between the nine gifts of the spirit and the other gifts of the spirit such as charity, generosity, etc. Does every believer get one of the nine? That's a question. I'm sure that you would have one of the nine, but again, that is not your gift. That's totally different. The gifts of the spirit and gifts of how to live your life. That's the others show kindness, give charity and all that stuff. That is identifying you as someone who cares, who loves for God and helping people. I think a lot of people probably has one or two, have one or two of those gifts. But the thing about when you go to heaven, the gift you operate in is not a spiritual gift at all. It's your natural gift you have that you are really good at and people even say you're really good at doing that stuff. Some people go, well, I don't know what it is. You may have more than one. You could have more than one gift and so you probably would operate in both of those in heaven. But most people, you'll find out if you don't even think about it anymore, something you love to do when you were younger, maybe you don't have the opportunity. That doesn't mean what your hobbies are on the earth now would be the hobby or the gift God made you. Every good and perfect gift would be us coming down from the hobby. And on the gifts, there are people who do many, many things because they've got hobbies and many, many things. They're going to be like that in heaven, right? Many, many things that they would do, right? Oh, yeah. There's all kinds of things to participate in heaven and be a part of and joy going and have fun with and exciting things. Yes. There's places of excitement and fun everywhere in heaven. There's also places that are so amazing and so profound. I love that two of the things that are used to describe heaven are wonder and splendor. I would have to say splendor is absolutely things that happen in the throne room and a few other places around heaven that are so filled with splendor. Everybody goes there probably often just to see the demonstrations of the light of God, the fire of God. He makes things even in heaven for us in heaven and gives them out at different places in heaven. So wonder, you're always undone. You are so undone by the goodness and the love of God. What He has blessed you with, what He blesses with everybody in heaven and the fact that He wants to spend time with just you. That is also amazing. That's good. All right. I accidentally skipped this one. Carrie age nine asks this question. My goldfish died a week ago and I can't stop thinking about him. I had him three years and I feel like I failed him, this Carrie saying. My dad tried to help save him and we prayed for him all the time, but he died. I read your book about Chester. Do you think my goldfish will be in my mansion too? Will he forgive me that I failed at making him well and he died? I think Carrie that he doesn't even think about the fact that that he thinks that you didn't take good care of him. I think what he will say to you when you get this, he's so happy you loved him so much and that you missed him. I don't think like past don't even think about the things they went through before their life ended or anything like that. They will remember you. Of course he's going to be in your mansion just like Chester was in Brandon's mansion. Of course, and he will remember you when you get there. But all he'll say is thank you for loving me. Nice. And he will. He will talk. He'll say thank you. All pets talk in heaven. I love it. I love it. I love it. By the way, speaking of animals, Satan is Lord of the Flies. What's the deal with flies and why is Satan the Lord of them? Is that some creature that God didn't choose to make or why are flies going to be in heaven or what's going on with that? I have never seen a fly in heaven. I've seen a lot of other insects never seen a fly. I think because Satan uses them to persecute and he does, I'm quite sure flies are not a good thing for any reason. The only thing they do is they give food to the frogs, the lizards and the snakes. They're feeding people for the reptiles. That's what they are. So I don't know anything further than that is a title given to him that I guess maybe he didn't really have any authority except over that one thing. Yeah, that's an amazing time. He hasn't reached the top of the animal kingdom to try to control. I can almost see, you know, The menial things that don't even really have a soul flies. Yeah, I can almost see. I think he has a big fly swider in hell. It's like, you know, Satan said to Jesus, if you'll do this and this and this and bow down and worship, I'll give you all these things. It's almost as if the Lord said, you know what, you're not Lord of that. You're Lord of the Flies. That's all you're Lord of. So anyway, okay, Chrissy asked this. Is there a difference in your prayer language and in parentheses tongues and the gift of tongues? Are they the same thing? Or are they different? She's talking about the getting filled with the Holy Spirit tongues. People call it many different things. They'll they'll call it, you know, just lay hands. The evidence of receiving Holy Spirit is you speak in tongues. There's a very real reason why that happens. I know this too. When you pray in tongues or speaking tongues, Satan cannot understand you. He does not have the ability to understand tongues. It brings great confusion to him, frustration to him, aggravation to him, because we're praying in a language he has nothing to do with and does not understand. So I think one of the other purposes for having that, of course, you are praying the perfect prayer in the spirit. When you pray in tongues, regardless of what people call it, if you invited Holy Spirit into you, you pray for that gift of tongues. That's the tongues you're talking about has power in them and the enemy cannot understand them. I would advise people it's almost been kind of forgotten or maybe not even forgotten, but just not used in church. But it should be. It's something very powerful in the spirit to pray in the spirit. And you can even say, Father, I'm praying for this person in the spirit. You may not even know if you don't get an interpretation of those tongues. I tell you this, you are praying the perfect prayer for that person, for that situation, and the enemy can't try to do anything about it. He doesn't know what you're saying. So the thing is for tongues, whether it's one or the other, Satan cannot understand those tongues. So it sounds like Chrissie's trying to decide if the terminology, if your prayer language and tongues are the same thing. You're saying it's the same thing, right? In that way, if it is those tongues, but you can pray in the spirit that's not even about tongues. When you pray a prayer in the spirit that is anointed, that God has given you to pray or something you're passionate about praying for, it makes it powerful because it's coming from your heart. So that I also would, that would be another way praying in the spirit or into the influence of the spirit. That would be different than tongues. Okay, so I'm not quite clear. If you pray in the spirit, are you praying in a kind of a tongue? Are you just praying with your own words? But you're, but you're, but you're praying in the spirit. What are you saying? There are two different types. There's two different types. You may not even be filled with the Holy Spirit. You can pray a very powerful prayer and Holy Spirit may be guiding you into praying that. You may hear him say, well, don't forget about praying about this. Don't forget this person and you pray when you're in your prayer time, then that is a powerful prayer. That would still be praying in the spirit. Now praying in tongues that you know for sure that's exactly what that is. Praying in tongues that the Holy Spirit brought to the earth when he was sent to the earth and you speak in those tongues. Those tongues are a spiritual language. Okay, now I'm going to drill down one more time because even I can be dense at times. If I'm praying in the spirit, because God's told me something and I totally am tapping into him. Am I using my own language or am I using what sounds like tongues? You can use your own language. Okay. If he has told you to pray that way. Okay. If it's a special prayer or certain reason why he's asking you to pray, then that could be, it could be. But praying in tongues is that heavenly language that comes down in your tongue as you begin to utter those, its mainly sounds or syllables that you're praying. Yeah. Something that we may not understand. But I remember the day when somebody would say, let's pray and somebody would get a message in tongues. Someone else in that meeting would get an interpretation and they'd actually see what those tongues were because the Holy Spirit gave them that interpretation of that. And either that or just declaring and decreeing yourself. Sometimes when you declare and decree, people will do that in tongues. That doesn't mean it's for an interpretation. That means there's something that's serious, serious that they want to pray about. Okay. Now, John, it was said, John was in the spirit or he said, I was in the spirit on the Lord's day. What was that if you can put that into words? It is a, it's a way that you walk your life out. I'm in the spirit a lot. I walk in the spirit a lot. That means I'm not, I'm not being, I'm not receiving man stuff. I'm not taking man for any answers. I'm not, I'm not, I don't have everything come along and I don't gauge it or see it by the flesh. Because it says if you walk in the spirit, you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. I mean, that means if you stay in that place of always hearing and listening, then you're going to know what to do and say at all times. You won't think, well, I better judge just by the flesh. This is what so and so did about the situation. Or I think this would be the best way to do this, you weren't, you weren't hearing that in the spirit and you have to stay tuned into the spirit. And then you will be letting God, everything that is presented to me, I judge it according to what the spirit of God would say or do about it. I do not judge it by my flesh. Okay. Well, that, okay, that leads me to one more because you know me and my rabbit trails. Okay. 30 years ago ish 30, maybe 32, there was a gentleman and he was one of the elders in a church. This is in Texas and everybody want his first name is Glenn. Everybody wanted Glenn to speak over them because he would prophesy. He would use that we use the term read their mail. He would, he would know things and he would prophesy and everybody wanted it. He was a godly man. I sought counsel from him from time to time during the time that I knew him. He would speak these words over people. He'd call him out from the front. He had never yet spoken in tongues. Talk about how that was possible or what that means. Well, you know, people can prophesy. You can prophesy without speaking in tongues. That's a totally different thing. Everyone can be prophetic. It says so in the Bible. From a prophetic viewpoint, doesn't mean you had to be filled with the spirit. Doesn't mean you had to speak in tongues. And I know friends, I have people that do it a lot and that your personal choice to invite. You have to just like invite Christ to invite Christ to be your savior and then he moves inside of you to get the Holy Spirit. Now, when you get saved, the Holy Spirit comes along side of you and he will guide you from that place. When you invite the Holy Spirit to indwell you, he actually moves in and then you hear him from in here, not out here. But that doesn't mean you can't be prophetic. People can hear prophetic words. You hear God say things about people and then they say them. And then they're being prophetic. That has nothing to do with being filled with the spirit. Okay, I'm going to give you one more cat. You're on a roll and you're doing good. So Paul writes and he says, your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Is it or is it not true that when you receive Christ at that moment, your body becomes the temple of the Holy Spirit? Are you saying he only comes beside you so far? Yeah, I would say he comes beside you. It is where Christ dwells in you. So when you invite Christ as your Savior, he does come inside of you and then he is in there. But he said I will send the Holy Spirit. When Christ went back to heaven, I'll send him to lead you and guide you and show you things to come. He does that. Holy Spirit is up here. Yeah, okay. Once you invite Holy Spirit in, then you become also a temple of the Holy Spirit. You're a carrier. That's what that means. The temple of the Holy Spirit doesn't mean you're a church. It means you're a physical carrier of Holy Spirit who has now come to indwell you and he will show you things to come. He'll give you a revelation on the word of God. He may give you things to say to people also that would be professional. Yeah. Okay, can I give you one more? Sure. These are experience here on the roll. We're in the spirit, walking in the spirit. Okay, when I first, I was baptized at the age of 10, I believe I was saved, although it was in that tradition that didn't know very much about it, but they accepted Christ. Okay, when I had this encounter with the Lord 1981, so 41 years ago, I had an encounter where the spirit, it was walked in the room in the Bible. It was almost as if the word came alive on top of the Bible. It was almost three dimensional. The woman went into slow motion. I knew nothing yet about being filled with the spirit. I never asked for the Holy Spirit because I didn't believe in it. From that moment on, the Bible flipping came alive to me and I couldn't put it down. I was reading and reading. So what was that? I would say he probably came over you. If you had never actually invited him in, I also know this. People who are in services where a lot of people are getting filled with spirit, he just comes in anyway. Okay. If you're attending, back in the day when people really began to get filled with the Holy Spirit, I remember those days. I was born in the 50s. I remember those days, but people began to sincerely seek the Holy Spirit. They would go to meetings where people get filled with the spirit and the Holy Spirit was over everybody in there and all of a sudden they would just get to them. They would start speaking in tongues and then after that, they just continued to speak in tongues. There are ways if the Holy Spirit knows your heart and knows that your soul cries, he'll just come in. If you don't mind, you can always say, I don't receive you. He's done that. I did that very profoundly in years later as I learned about it, but at this one event, that happened to me. I realize the scripture was about to come alive until a few days later, but in the same meeting and a group of us that knew nothing about that, inviting the Holy Spirit, our friend who heard the encounter that I was describing that I had just had, Nils down in prayer and she started speaking in tongues under the anointing of the Holy Spirit at the same meeting because of the same encounter I had. I didn't get that for a few years later. She had it instantly. So it was like, it sounds like what you're describing, like he just came in anyway, almost, although I did invite him years later. So fascinating thing. I think it's the spirit, the spirit does know everything everywhere. I mean, he just, Holy Spirit knows everything everywhere at all the same time. He knows it. He knows what, what, what, what your heart is. He knows what your hunger is. And if he knows that what you're crying out for, even if it's inside, he's just going to come move in. That's good. That's really, really good. Yeah. And I had to contend for tongues years, like I said, a few years, and I kept asking and asking and he kind of like took his good time for the times. But, but, you know, I, but the scripture was like so alive. I had never heard had anything like that in my life. I thought, where did this, where did these birds come from? You know, one, one example is we, I, we, we got invited our group. Okay, we, I was always a part of the father's company, dance company, Christian dance company, very powerful in the spirit. They did a lot of dance intercession and stuff like that. And they were invited to come to a Baptist church. Somebody wanted to know this, how do you use Christianity? How do you preach the gospel? And they invited, but what no one ever said to us was this church had been seeking more of God for six weeks. They were having nightly services seeking God. We want the more, they didn't even know what the more was. They didn't know Holy Spirit. They were seeking, seeking, seeking, seeking. And the day before we came, the whole church got baptized in the Holy Spirit by the Holy Spirit. Wow. And so while we were there, they knew we were spirit-filled people. They knew we were, they called us tongue helpers. They knew we were. So when they got into performing, they came up and said, can we please ask a question of somebody in here? And they started speaking in tongues. And then the whole church started speaking in tongues. They went, we, we need to know what is this? What is this? What is this? We can't stop doing it. What is this? Wow. The whole church of 200 some people, they were seeking more. That was the more they got invaded by Holy Spirit. And, and we, we didn't laugh at them, but we just kind of left at the situation. Yeah. And we said, you have been pursuing more of God, more of God is baptism in the Holy Spirit. Once you receive Christ baptism, the Holy Spirit is what you should ask for next. You were seeking more, more of him, more of Christ, you wanted more. He gave it to you. So what you have now is your prayer language that is from Holy Spirit. And if he's moving on you to pray in those tongues, just keep praying in those tongues. And probably one day I'll come along and somebody will get an interpretation in the church can stand up and tell you what was just said by that person. But you, you started on the journey that your denomination almost never does. Yeah. The whole church got it. They weren't telling anybody. They found out what it was. Well, you know, and I've told the parts of the story on and off, but I was at that meeting to set them straight. I knew they were deceived and off and wrong. And so God knew my heart because I wanted to do right and be right. Yeah. And the way I describe it is God walked in the room by the spirit. The scripture came alive and I, and I never looked back as far as the scripture. It just came alive. But then later I would. So God will do all kinds of funny, crazy things that don't, that don't match anyone else's experience. Well, how did that happen to you? I don't know. Well, all I know is once I was blind now, I see it's like that. You know, so well, Kat, thank you so much. This is really, really, really good. I know a lot of people got help. Would you go ahead and pray for the people and whatever God gives you. Yeah, Father, I just pray for all of your children, God. I pray for those even thinking they don't know you don't know your son yet, God, that their eyes be open. That especially this time of year, open their eyes to the truth about the darkness, but also about you and who you are. Your son gave us life for all of us. Let them live by that truth. I thank you, Father, that the darkness is about to be pushed back, crushed and pushed back in these coming days on the earth when the glory will be seen around the world, when man will be free of evil and darkness for a very long time and that new inventions and creations are coming. Bring hope. I impart hope to those people right now. Hope for life, hope for freedom, hope for joy, hope for celebration, hope for your family. Hope that comes from God alone. Let them feel your presence, begin to invade them, invade their home. Let them know you love, that you care for them very much, that your son would have done it all over again because he loved. I thank you, Father, for the darkness being fully exposed, justice coming and us getting on in acceleration with our lives for all the things you have planned, Father. I just release life and presence of God, his will, his way, the good days coming on this earth. In Jesus' name, receive it. Amen. Amen, amen. So good. It's always, always so good. Today felt even better. It always feels better, but God bless you. Can't talk about. Enjoy your cake. I have one too. I'm going to take a bite. You're going to take a bite. I'm going to take a bite. Oh, yeah. Oh, man, there's nothing like chocolate cake. I said, if there was ever money in heaven, it would be chocolate. Now don't run around knowing people. I said chocolate was money in heaven. I said, if they don't have money, you don't need money. All the chocolate cakes, which are actually the size of your dining room table. You can have all the cake you want. Awesome. Well, thank the Lord for Milton Hershey that God gave him. The American version. The European version of chocolate was not the same. And he made the American version. I even watched some of the specials. It's just amazing. What an annoying he got put on him. Well, talk about just for a moment. You're revealing heaven.com and catcurve.com. So people will know that. Revealing heaven.com is our, it's our number one website is where we share coming events. Where we have our store there, all the products that we have made for people to enjoy and help advertise heaven. Hell has enough things out there, right? I mean, look how long Satan's been pushing all of his garbage and his junk and his darkness. It's about time heaven flooded this earth with things you wear, you walk on, you hang on your wall, you drive on your car. We, we, we reveal heaven on earth, but we also have to create it. So that's where you would find it on revealing heaven.com. There's testimonies there. I think they're just about ready to be finished upgrading that website. Then we have catcurve.com. And the one thing about catcurve is God calls it his spiritual platform to say whatever he wants to whenever he wants to. That's the number one purpose for it. But it's also the only place online that you can give to me online. If you want, there's no other website. There's no other Facebook. There's no other place that I have ways for you to do this only catcurve.com. And I thank you all you guardians who are part of the guardian zone. If you sign up to be a regular member or giver, we love you so much. We couldn't do this without you. We bless you in the name of the Lord. We pray over all the monies that you send in to help reveal heaven to this world. And God will thank you also one day. Being a part of us and look forward to greatness in your life. Great days of glory coming. Your children being redeemed to this country being redeemed. The world being redeemed. It's not time to end everything yet. Only the father knows when that is and he's not ready to give it up people. That was handed over because he isn't going to have any longer. He thinks he does. But remember, yeah, remember, he's an epic failure. That's what he is. God is the glory. He's filled with glory, love, life, and he has power that he will use on your behalf in these coming days on the earth. And you will know that he has been with you all along. He loves you. He will never leave you. His son gave everything for you. So Father, thank you for blessing everybody. Bring us suddenly in their life. They never thought what happened. That's when these things begin. When you see suddenly is one after another happening in your life. Something is happening in the spirit that will never be reversed. It will only be accelerated for you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Kat, thank you so much. Give our love to your staff. We appreciate it. Everybody have a great day. We're going to a quick reminder. Cash Patel. He happens to be a close friend and confident to President Trump. He will be on tomorrow in our profits and Patriots show. So you do not want to miss that at this stage. So God bless you all. Have a great day. Thanks again, Kat. We'll see you later, everybody. Bye-bye. Thank you.

If you know someone in the area of Albany, Oregon, and that could be Lebanon, Oregon Corvallis, Oregon, Kaiser, or Salem. I'm probably missing some things, but anywhere in that area, someone could even be up in Wilsonville and drive down, but we need an in person account to join our other account account on location in Albany, Oregon to, you know, we're continuing to grow and our donations are very generous. We need to help getting getting the paperwork done and the envelopes opened and the things that need to be done legally and all that county wise. Anyway, we're very excited about that. If you know anyone that wants an in person job. And it is an account. We're not talking about a bookkeeper. We're not talking who's kind of learned to do this and that, but this is a full charge accountant. I think they've told us we're going to leave this open for about 10 days and see who is able to respond. We're, we're trying to advertise first within the family of our viewers. And then if for any reason we didn't find the right person then we would advertise locally here but we thought we would. There's a lot of people in the area. So it may be hit someone right between the eyes in a good way that, oh man, I just was looking for a new job based on my accounting job went away, whatever that would be. So, all right, we're going to play now another clip of American Warriors is premiering today right after the show. Let me just tell you about that Bob Sanders trained for the jungles of Vietnam and commanded a platoon in a provisional rifle company on the outskirts of Da Nang. So this is the Vietnam War era, Da Nang. The action he saw in his first week convinced him he was going to be different. You can still see the pain and the regret on his face as he tells the story. I don't think anybody going to any war in history really knows what it's going to be like until they get there. The reality was pretty different. When you're in combat, you're much more affected when you have people you're responsible for wounded, hurt, killed, much more. Staff Sergeant Henry Sparks was my platoon sergeant, first platoon sergeant when I got to Vietnam. He bonded pretty quick and he took good care of me. Sergeant Sparks was killed in Vietnam. So we're producing these American Warrior episodes so we can honor those people who have gone before us and fought for this country in various wars. We've been in World War II, Korean, we've had people that from Vietnam era, from Desert Storm, Desert Shield. Even I think someone from one of the battles of Fallujah, which is one of the great battlegrounds of the Laugh Desert war in Iraq and all of that. There was a city called Fallujah where it was hand-to-hand combat, house-to-house combat, so I think we've had one of those already. I hope you enjoy it and honor the people. Here's how you get to it. In the Rumble, you type American Warriors or American Warriors 22. In the YouTube, you type American Warriors or American Warriors 22. Both Rumble and YouTube are getting a lot of play and the viewers are growing each week. It'll be fun to watch this grow over the period of days, weeks, months, years, whatever. We're going to bring in Mike and Lori Sally and talk about the wells. We haven't had them on for a few weeks, so let's bring in Mike and Lori. My heroes in the faith. We love you guys. People wouldn't notice about it. We've known each other for more than, I think it has to be more than 20 years or very close to 20. My daughter babysat your children. Now, one of them is married and one of them is doing some of the videos that people have seen has been done by the other one, but my daughter babysat them as little girls. You even were with the Elijah list way back when for a short stint here in Albany, I think. It's been quite a while. 97? Yeah, time flies when you're having fun, right? But after we met you and after you started this, doing some work with Elijah List in the marketing area, then you guys started building the village we now know as Field of Dreams and Show Mercy, your organization that you did, but you're not only with Show Mercy full time. If we can state this way, you're also with Elijah Streams full time. You're doing both ministries and getting the wells dug for us. So tell me, I'm just going to throw this to you and bring everybody up and you call for the pictures you want in the video and all that. Okay, so go for it. Yeah, do you want to show the picture of where the wells are located first? Sure, yeah, we'll show that. It's a little hard because it's a distant, oh, there you go. That's Lake Victoria, right in Uganda. I think if you actually zoom out, there's even maybe some other ones that are shown. Is that it? Okay. Yeah, so this doesn't look like much, but actually it does look like a lot, but it's a map. But it represents 59 wells that Elijah Streams has dug in Uganda over the past just less than a year, almost a little bit more than a year. Seven of them were done last year and 50 were done this year and we're on a pace to do 77 this year with Elijah Streams. That group that's up there towards the left, there's a cluster there. Is that by your... That's by the Field of Dreams. How far would it be from the one on the left to the one on the right? How far of a distance is that spread of wells? I don't know the distance, but it's hours. Oh, it's hours? Right, and if you zoom out a little bit, the reason we wanted to show this map is if you see the whole plate of all of Uganda, we wanted people to know that Elijah Streams isn't just funding the drilling by Show Mercy, but reaching different parts of Uganda all the way up into the Northeast, and that's more of an area dry area. There's a lot of things, but that's the area I want to share a story about. Okay, wow. I'm not sure which one of those dots, but it's one of the four at the top. Both of those two wells recently were dug and the stories I got from the pastor we're partnering with up there were incredible. You don't really realize whenever you say you're funding clean water, you're helping... I think we kind of understand like the water's contaminated and we're helping them have clean drinking water, but it is so much more than that. Elijah Streams, by the generous donations of our partners, you are restoring people's lives. Wow. This one community, it's about 1,400 people, they have never had a water well. They've always had to go trek long distances to get water, and it's dirty water that they're getting. There wasn't even an opportunity for them to have unity, have social events, because their whole life, their whole day-to-day was trekking to get water in the morning and then again in the evening. Even the children, they were telling me, don't have time. The parents do not send them to school because water, you can't live without water. You can live without education, but you cannot live without water. I want to show the picture of them sitting under this mango tree. In Uganda, in many places in Africa, trees are a big deal, and that's where they normally socialize. They get under a tree, and so this is an old mango tree. They send me this picture, and you can't see the faces or the beautiful people, but it's a picture of a community able to rest now that they have a clean water well. The water well, you can't see it in this picture, it's right behind them, but now they can come together under this tree. It's one of their first times where their leaders were able to gather everyone and talk together as a community and to socialize. Time has been restored to these people. It's incredible. Rather than walking for hours or miles or however long it takes, they can go to the meeting place where they all get together and the water is right there. It's right there, and they're hanging out while they're waiting in line to get their water, and they're socializing and getting to know one another again. I also heard a story about a mom. She works all day. She has to walk to work. Very few people in the areas where we're serving have cars. They have to pay for transportation, and they don't really have money to pay for transportation, so they walk to work. She would walk a long distance to work, work all day, have to walk all the way home, and then when she gets home, her next task is just to walk for miles to go get water. Well, Elijah Streams has just donated a water well near her house. Now she can come home from a long day at work after walking so many miles to get that home, pick up her jerry cans, and walk not very far to get water, and they were telling me, if you could see the smile on her face, she actually can prepare dinner in time for when her kids get home before. She wouldn't have the energy to walk that far. She'd wait till they would get home. They'd walk for miles together. They were just tired all the time. So it's more than just clean water. It's just restoring souls to be able to live life. It's like giving, and I'd say, you know, I would have said, well, we gave them their life back, but it's like they never had their life in the first place because this is their existence. I don't even know how they congregate all over these, whatever they are, hillsides or whatever, when they don't have water, but I guess they do because they know somehow they were going to walk miles and find some watering hole that the animals also shared. Right. That's crazy. That's just crazy. That's just crazy. Now you had a video that we were going to show. Do you want to talk about that? Yeah, this is one of the wells by that mango tree, and the people were just celebrating. I just wanted to share it with all of the viewers watching because it's, I love it. Okay. Okay. Now there was something about people were, Emily, didn't you have one where people were singing or are we talking about the same one? Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and play that one then. So they sent me that video and I was like, what are they saying? They're like, they are praising the Lord for this miracle that's come to their village. So it was exciting to see that. Oh man. That's just, I mean, I have no words to see, you know, we're changing people's lives and I know we are and I tell people we are and then when you guys come on and then sometimes your daughter will make a new video and we see something that we hadn't seen before. And every, every miracle story, I just cannot, when, when I, when we decided to help with one well, you, you came to us a long time ago, year or two ago and said, how'd you like to sponsor? Well, and I just kind of go, okay. So I did the forest guy thing. Okay, we'll do that. And, and then after I had done that, I began to think, well, wait a minute. God told me in 1987 that I was going to have a well ministry and he also mentioned little orphan children. Now they're not all orphans here. There's probably some, but, but he mentioned the children and wells. And I, I waited, it was like, whatever that is, 87. Is that what that's almost 40 years or 30. I, I don't have my calculator, but anyway, yeah, it's, it's 37 years or 40, close to 40 years, whatever. But I waited until finally it became very clear what God had, that, that the wells God's used an expression with me. That's, that's a known expression, which is home is where the heart is or charity begins at home. And so it had become clear to me over the years that wherever God, whatever God put in your life, that's where you give. So we didn't go looking all over the world to see where we get. We look to see who was in our life that we could give to. So you guys, you guys have said, we were just talking off the air. How much have you, we've been giving to even other things that other than water. Can we just, let's just tell people what you estimated we've given to people this year from Elijah streams. Well, that's a lot of people. I don't think anybody really knows how, how much your donation to Elijah streams are impacting so many groups of people. And so, you know, one of the things we're tasked with doing is helping to find organizations to give to and good causes to give to. And over the past several months, just, just Lori and I, on behalf of Elijah streams has given probably between six and $700,000 to other organizations. And that's not including just the wall of projects. And so I want to encourage people just, you know, Steve is one of the most generous people. And I know you all know this, but he's one of the most generous people that I've ever met, if not the most generous people. It's true. It's true. But when you're sewing into Elijah streams, you don't even have a tip of the iceberg of the impact that you're making for the kingdom of God in thousands and tens of thousands and probably millions of people's lives. And so it really is making a big difference. And Steve's not going to, Steve's not going to brag on himself and on Elijah streams. But I want you to know that you're, you're giving is absolutely unbelievably making a huge impact around the world. Well, very good. Thank you for that. So there was a picture of a church. We didn't show that picture. Let's show you the church that that. Now, go ahead. It's not by where the mango tree was. It's in a different area. But the thing is, is we've shared before, you know, at first I was shocked. I started getting stories of hundreds of people giving their lives to Jesus. And then the next thing I know we are over a thousand. I don't have the exact number, but it's over well over a thousand. And my team sent this picture of a church that the community, they gathered funds and they all pitched in somebody donated this land. Because so many people gave their lives to Jesus after one of the Elijah streams wells was opened. And I think we understand if you have running water all the time, just the miracle that this is to these people. I mean, this week they're commissioning another well that's been drilled and when they do a big commissioning, they do a big party. One area is taking it upon themselves. The the local chairperson, which is like the mayor of the area. They are renting some tents there. They've gathered all of the pastors. They called all the churches to come together as one and they're doing a huge celebration. They're going to be preaching the gospel. I can't even imagine what what kind of reports we're going to hear from them. It's just it's so impactful. And Steve, whenever you say the Lord spoke to you orphans and wells, I'm confident that he knew that the fatherless. Yeah, into the house. That makes sense. Because he called them little orphan children, but look at, you know, yeah, you're right. That's really good, Laurie. Really, really good. Okay, now we today you sent me a report this morning. We're waiting for cats. So we're going to talk for a few minutes. And it reminded me that we had just approved a couple of other projects for your village. Talk about that and maybe the medical clinic a little bit as well. Yeah, so Elijah streams has donated to build a hospital at the show Mercy base and so that is in progress and I'm sure we'll be showing pictures of that soon. It takes a little bit of time to build things. But again, it's it's going to be a hospital where people can come and get treatment. It's right next to a birthing center that Elijah streams is also helped to fund part of it. And you've also donated Elijah streams and ambulance and emergency vehicle for this area that's rural and rural area and they don't have access. We have our clinic now, but we're not able to treat every every sickness like serious things. And so sometimes it'd be challenging to figure out how to get them to the city. And so we have an ambulance to again, this is going to help the people physically. But the thing is, is for every patient that comes in, we pray for them. We share the good news of Jesus with them. And we're located in the middle of a Muslim village. And we've had stories of the Muslims coming to our clinic, not having the funds to pay. We charge a small amount. We also give, you know, services for free to that we charge a small amount. And so some of these Muslim women were hearing that God was showing up at our clinic. And so they would come and say, we don't have money, but would you pray for us? And so our team would pray and of course he would show up and, you know, they would get healed. Anyway, so bring their friends, they bring their friends. And so it's just another way of bringing the fatherless into the house. And so he's doing it through a hospital. And so thank you Elijah streams for me. And then there was you that you would talk with us about the toilet. And I don't know that I don't know how fancy the toilets are, but but you talk about what we just approved and how where that's going to go. Well, so we've been doing these water wells partnering together with Elijah streams and the need is not just clean water, but after you drink the water, what happens? Sanitation and so, you know, as we're discovering things in the United States, it's some of those same things. And it got me thinking, I wonder if Steve would be open to helping the community with some community toilets. And so we haven't started that project yet. We're doing our research. You want to make sure that we do it well. It'll be a place where it can get cleaned and sanitized and and just help present prevent disease again. And it's just going to impact the people in another huge way. It's not something you would typically think of like providing a toilet to the community, but most people don't. They're not nobody in our area has has running water in their house. There's nobody has flush toilets like none. And I mean, when they can, can I just get down dirty to use the expression. So if there's no flush toilets, what are people doing? Do they do they just go out in the bushes somewhere? What do people do? If you don't have a pit latrine, you go in the bushes. And that's very unsanitary. And that's a lot of people do not have pit latrines. And so what this is going to be is a similar to a pit latrine, but bigger, nicer, tiled, you know, something that you could clean. And so it's going to be in an area where several families can use it. So just something simple like having a place to go to the bathroom is not is not common. No, no, yeah, some, some local schools to that don't have proper facilities so that the students can have a place to go. Well, you know, when I was an only, I've only been to Africa once and it was to Nigeria and I'm sure there's many differences, but it sounds like there's some similarities because we were talking about when it's really crowded, traffic wise, it's mainly motorcycles, people who ride motorcycles and then some taxis and things. And it's, it's a crazy thing. But when we were in Nigeria, it was 2000. So that's 22 years ago, we would go by and there were places where there was water, outdoor water, and by a building and it was painted. Someone just spray paint on the building do not pee here because they if you didn't tell them that they would do the same thing, which, which could then hurt the water source. Right. So that's very common. We see those signs all the time. Really? Okay, the same thing. Yeah, and they'll even put a fine on there. Sometimes they'll say, you know, 50,000 chilling fine. If you urinate on this building, you don't think like, wow. Yeah, it's a problem. I didn't realize that how big of a deal it was, but just providing a solid hole in the ground for somebody to use the restroom is a real blessing to them. That's crazy. Well, there's more things you had a term a few weeks back when we were talking about you had a term that had to do with use the word wash or something. What was that term? Yeah, wash, water, something sanitation hygiene. I'm not sure what the aid I think it's water sanitation hygiene. Okay. And then it was so it was kind of like an acronym. And so we had talked about moving from just water to water sanitation and hygiene, which are like, how do you live without that? We were so spoiled and something. Well, they're telling me the cat is here. So we'll go ahead. Thank you so much, Michael. I appreciate you very much. We love you. You're doing such a great job for both show mercy and Elijah streams and getting those wells done. So blessings, blessings, blessings. We'll see you all soon. But okay, so without further delay, let's bring in Wednesdays with cat and Steve. Here we go. I don't care. There she is. I can't tell if that's blue or teal. It kind of likes teal, but it might be. It's teal. Awesome. Yeah, sometimes we match and sometimes we just look good together. Like right now. So I can say, okay, I see you got your don't do demon thing right on the top, but I do. Okay, welcome to the broadcast that we're looking forward to today. So I have a whole list of questions, but you often have something you want to share. If there's anything in your heart before we get into those questions. Um, just staying excited. Mainly, I have to say finishing packing is priority for everything except loving God. Okay. And it's really hard because we're so busy all the time. Yeah, but I never don't take time with God. That's good. Last night I was doing that really late and I love hearing what he has to say about everything right now and he just wants everybody to just continue to trust him. And he said, don't be concerned and do not. This is the main thing he said. Tell everybody do not let fear interfere with what you're going to see over these next couple of weeks. It has nothing to do with what he's going to do whatsoever. That's all he'll tell me, but he was excited when he said that. So I think we're going to be seeing probably a soon ending of all of this. I can't really say any more than that about what he showed me, but I will just say this. The main thing is, even though you go through everyday issues in your life, even we do hear, I know this is a supernatural place. We talk about we live the supernatural. We live heaven culture. We command the host of heaven. You know, we speak to the weather and yet and all of that, just so you all know that we have everyday things that rise up against us also. We always do. We all become them because we go with what God has to say, no matter what it looks like or sounds like, we will always choose. By the spirit and not the flesh. I think that's probably the most important thing I can tell you is sometimes, some days, especially it looks like it's never going to end. Or that it's too hard for you, but I can tell you it's not too hard for Jesus Christ. Well, Kat, you know, I got to ask you this because people would think, even I would think Kat is so close to the Lord. She sees him face to face often. She sits down with the Holy Spirit, your best friend, the way you said it. You know each of the members of the Trinity. So it would be easy for me to say, well, Kat probably just never has a stressful day and nothing ever goes wrong. No, I think that's probably the main thing I have to tell people is you see and hear the power of God from me all the time. But I live on this earth too. And just to remind you, his own son, Jesus Christ, didn't have the easiest life while he was here. But he sure made it exciting for everybody else. And I guess that's kind of what my part is in all this. I still have things to face. I overcome them very quickly because if it's the devil, especially now, there's things that happen in the natural. Just in your everyday life. I'm not saying tragic things. There's things you face every day, how to make decisions about things or maybe something happened. You didn't expect it or you're still waiting for something to happen. We face every one of those. But what are you talking about yourself? I choose to talk about what God has said. I choose to tell about God's plan. It doesn't mean I'm ignorant of what's going on. It means I am innocent of all the wickedness. I'm innocent of fear. I'm innocent of struggles against God actually saying something to me. I'm totally innocent against any of that because I don't do that. I would rather give people the power and the life of God always, even from myself. And just leap over the things that are in my way. And you do that by saying what God says. You have to understand. A man is, as you think in your heart, a man is as he says. And people will see what you do and what you say more than anything else. Even in your everyday life. I'm not talking about a platform right now. In your everyday life, how are you responding to what's going on around the world? Do you have a powerful word? I'm not talking about a prophetic word. A powerful word, God does know what he's doing. He does have a plan and he's being covert right now. But right now he's going to have to bust through. And you're going to see everything change for you and your family. That's so much better than saying, did you hear what someone so did in the White House? Did you hear what the fake news said today? Did you hear this? Why are you saying that? Because what you're putting in now, the same thing you're carrying, what's in your soul will come out of your mouth. So change what's in your soul. Change what you think about, what you say, what you look at, what you say to other people. Your soul is active 24 hours a day, even when you're sleeping. You're putting that soul to good use. You're supposed to make it better for people, happier for people. You're supposed to give them something they can trust by hearing God and understanding God. But what kind of report are you giving? So I'd have to say the number one thing today to say to people is, I'm giving a God report. I have to tell people, I am excited about what he's going to do. I do trust him. This earth is his. It doesn't belong to the darkness, the evil, or anyone else. You're about to see his hand displayed like you never have before. And your lives will never, ever, ever be the same. You're living a powerful generation right now. Some of the greatest things are about to happen. Why do you think Satan is fighting so hard to keep people in that destiny? Kick his butt out, give God's words everywhere you go. Staying excited and guess what? People will want to hear what you have to say because we're here to bring hope in this world. So, so, so good. Now, can I ask you one more question along the line about what you see and all that? Because people would also assume that because you see more than most people see, you're not only a seer by calling from birth, you are a seer. But God is constantly with that gift or maybe even without that gift is taking you to heaven and showing you things. So they would assume that cat must know everything that's about to happen and when it's going to happen. And she's one of the lucky few that God just tells everything to. I will take two of those as a yes. Okay. Which two? One thing I don't know for sure is what time. Okay. I don't know that. I do know about everything that's about to happen. I don't know that. I'm not bragging. I'm just saying that's what he called me to do. I'm a revelator. We reveal truth from the heart of the Father, not from man. That's why what I always say to you will be something the Father would say. Yes, he does show me all the time, everywhere. And I've been taking 150 years into the future just so you know that right now. We're not going to talk about that 150 years. But I'm telling you, I've seen that far into the future. This is like we're at a big entrance to step into something that is so powerful. It's called acceleration. It's called habitation of heaven. It's called baptism in fire. It's called the glory being imparted everywhere. It's called the manifested sons of God are standing up and speaking to the land, the sea and the air and it obeys. That's the entrance we're going into. And the devil is trying everything he can in his little self to stop that from happening. But he is going to fail and fail miserably. And everyone who's a part of that is going to fail miserably. I got to ask you this now. I, I, I'm with you. I 100 percent believe you were, you know, you've even said, even gave me a word that I would live more than 50 years from now. And that takes me to at least 117 years old. So I, I plan to do that. But there are people who are saying, Steve, you guys are crazy or you're just not hearing right. Because everything that is, that is in scripture about the one world government, they're trying to take over. They're trying to kill us. They have this is all they are so close to succeeding. And as you're not in any fear about that at all, there is no chance they're succeeding. Steve, they keep trying to come up with new lies and plans every day to work it as long as they can. There's already some that know this foundation is crumbled. And the word says these certain things must happen before the end comes. God is sitting on his throne shaking his head. You all saying there's no way I'm giving up you doing the greater works when you haven't started the greater work. There's no way I'm giving up my son knowing and understanding that you rule and reign with him in this world. There's no way I'm giving up the manifested sons and daughters of God. The earth is shaking not because of the evil is shaking wanting us to stand up and begin to do things that will so blow the mind of not just the left, but all the wicked and evil out there. We are about to make major changes in the spirit realm, which will then fall into the physical realm. So if you read your Bible, I hope you do. You're leaving a whole lot out if you think it's going to wrap up right now. Stick your rapture rug in the closet, get your crown on honey, because you're about to rule and win with Christ. That is what is next. Next is not fail, crash and burn. That would be for hell. Fail, crash and burn. But not for those who believe and trust him and he's already got your name written in a book saying you'll do these things. Why would he pull the rug up from underneath you and go rapture you with it? Yeah, that's good. Can you talk any more about because we know you've talked a lot about justice that's coming. God, we are in a time of justice. Can you give any more detail about what justice you've seen? There are people that are so wicked that some of them were leaders of this nation and their cohorts. I mean, what to what kind of detail has God shown you how severe this justice is about to be towards those that have done wickedly? Some are going to die. That's not me killing him, by the way. Yeah, Supreme Court doing it. It's not the government doing it. I can tell you right now, you better look at the hand of God because there's times in the Bible when he personally intervened himself. There will be natural man to help this happen, but don't look to the Supreme Court to be your answer. Don't look for these elections to be your answer. I'm telling you right now, God is going to have his hand in this. Yes, like I said, natural man will be involved because they do govern here, but a lot of them are about to be removed. And a lot of the other side trying to take over will be removed. This is as simple as I can tell you. Many will live in prison for the rest of their life. How do you like that one? Some are just going to, they're really going to crash and burn literally, literally. God said, I will take them off the face of the earth. Some, I said some. God said some. He made me say it again. Some will not live until this is over. Wow. God is about to establish, not him down here on the earth personally, but what will be established after this will be a just government that will want this country and even the world to succeed. That's what you can look forward to. That is for sure. Write it down right now. That's what's going to happen. Justice is going to be served like never before at a degree never given before. He made me say it twice. You will see people haul up in handcuffs. You never thought they would do that to them. But I'm telling you, don't worry. It will be seen and it will be known. The next part people will not be hidden. Okay. That's good because there's been so much that's been hidden that we didn't get to see. There must be justice going on behind the scenes that we're not seeing. And I'm kind of anxious to see some of the results with my own eyes and be, you know, I'm not saying a court will not be used. Yeah. We'll just say this. We don't have to depend if you're always looking at man. Yeah. What man has said and what man is saying will happen. If it doesn't line up with what God has happened, then what they're going to say is not what there's won't happen. It goes between a man and God who carried you in him for eternity before he stopped to make time for a while. Yeah. You better know who who is. I don't care if people don't know God's not in charge. Oh, make me laugh. Go stand before he's done that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we just laugh if you said that because let me tell you what, when he feels like it and when he has to, he will come in person. Yeah. And you said so a minute ago about, I don't remember exactly how you word it, but basically don't, don't look to the election to solve. What did you say about the election and what, how that was not. I do not think that these midterm elections are the thing that's going to solve everything. Because people are thinking, yay, it looks good for this party. That looks so good for that party. This person's getting in this person's not in. When God is done with all this mess, he's going to have it. They're who he wants in and I can tell you that's who you trust. You have to trust him. I'm not saying some good won't come out of it. I'm just saying it will not be the answer to everything. Why would we need God? Yeah. Good stuff. Kat, really, really good stuff. You know, I can tell, you know, that that was like, we didn't know that was coming, but it came with a, with the flash. That's good. I'm very encouraged. All right. You ready for this? Yes, that's good. I'm very encouraged. All right. You ready for a few questions? Yes, I am. These questions, you know, we technically, they're supposed to be about having, but people have all kinds of questions for you. So I'm going to just start at number one. Okay. Jack, Jack says, I know that there's theaters in heaven because you talked about that and lots of entertainment heaven, but are there. Are there any organizations with fun programs or a TV set in our mansions? That's an interesting question. I never, I never heard that one asked before. I never saw a TV in anyone's mansion. That doesn't mean that you can't do programs in different places. They just have different ways to do it. It would probably just be, I don't know. I'm not brilliant enough. I don't have a degree of great genius. I do have in heaven with revelation, but not stuff. I never saw a, most people I think, I know a lot of people go out to watch things, attend things and do things. I'm not saying they don't have a way that you can't see something. It's not like any of the televisions we have today. It isn't. Like if you want, I do know this, I can tell you this much, you know, to play music, you have, what is the name of that thing that you can play? Oh, the, I, well, it's on your phone board. It used to be the iPod, but now it's used to be iPod, but now your phones will play music. I mean, it's streaming. So yeah, I don't even know how it operates. There's a dot they give you. I can't even tell you what it is. Oh, I don't know that. And you put it on like here and played all the different music you always loved. I do know there'll be some stuff from the earth. If it's good and decent and exciting, those kind of things still remain, but, and I'm not talking about just heavily choir singing. I mean, powerful people who are highly anointed, who were caught up to heaven, they still play music up there. They still have concerts up there. And you can have that. I guess it's like streaming on this little tiny dot, but you hear all around you. That's interesting. It is very interesting, but this, there's some technology so high and me with my 12th grade education people not explain all of that. Okay. I can tell you what tastes good and what doesn't. I just have seen the way things are done. Like I've told people before you travel on air, on light, on bands of the rainbow. You tap into these places you step into really and beams are like shoot out and grab you and take you to the other side of heaven. Like almost instantly. There's all kinds of ways to travel. Travel. Thank you, Holy Spirit. He said you're talking about travel. It's completely different than any way you travel on this earth is so beyond your imagination. But I'm telling you where you're going to really enjoy it when you get there. So there's things like that. They still have transportation. They still have a fellow shipping. They have dinner parties. I can call it a party. There's nothing wrong with the party. I probably doesn't mean you're going to have liquor and get drunk. So forget that stuff. You need to change the way you think, but everything in heaven is exciting is sometimes it's filled with adventure. You go on the adventure thing. And boy, they're adventures. I won't say anything, but they have different ways to do it in heaven. It doesn't mean you don't get to do some things. It's just done differently. Well, you know, you talk about music. I think a lot of times about my friend, Kim Clement, who's now got with the Lord, he was a violent in the spirit. Worshiping keyboardist. I mean, he could do that. And if he watched his fingers, you wondered, how does a man do that? You know, he, even when he was older, you know, 50 some 60, he probably was close to 60. It must have been when he passed, but his fingers would move like I've never seen. So does Kim, is he likely in heaven performing some of that warfare type music? If you know what I mean. I've already seen him in heaven. Say again. I've already seen him in heaven. You have you talking to him playing a keyboard that was not flat. Oh, really? Not like this. It was round like this, but it moved. Really fingers. Yeah, it was. It was that's what it was. And he was playing. He had his eyes shut. Of course, he's playing this instrument, but it was a keyboard. That's what they told me. This is a keyboard in heaven. And he was playing it with sounds I never heard before, but it was so powerful. Wow. I think I even wrote and told his daughter about it and they about what I saw him doing. Is that is when he's doing it? Is it not just gorgeous and beautiful and worshipful, but is it is it performing prayer in heaven? Is it like the creaking things on the earth from heaven when he's doing that? I, some of it, I don't understand because some of it wasn't in a language that I spoke. Okay. The sound part, the song part that he was singing. I just know that it was extremely amazing and powerful. It was very powerful. Okay. So whatever he was playing about at that time when I saw him, it was powerful. Yeah. Very good. And I want to come back to the movie for a minute. You said this before and I thought, I need to ask her this because she said, John Wayne's in heaven. And she said, you know, you don't, it's not on film. It's like it's live. It's captured live and that type of thing. But you said there's no violence. There's no evil. But how, how could you have, for instance, a, an, on the edge of your seat Western with John Wayne, and if there wasn't a bad person that had to be fought, which Western's always had, what? I think you'll have a whole new way to do that too. I'm not going to give that one away. Oh, you're not going to give that away? It was exciting. I saw a part of one with him and then it was really, it was very powerful. The thing that's different is you get to be in it with him if you want to. Oh, okay. I've never, I don't usually press you on this when you say, I'm not going to give that boy, but why couldn't you give that away? Is it just, we wouldn't get it. We wouldn't understand. It's something that would ruin. Okay. You'll ruin the surprise. Take away the excitement and this quite big surprise of what you will see up there, but they do have adventures filled with even, even sitting on the edge of your seat kind of adventures and stuff like that. You, they do have them. Wow. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I believe I just wanted that one. Okay. Let's see. Rose asks how she says, can you please explain how to seal a room? How to seal a room from enemy forces when you're away from home, home or away from home, when you, when you are home or away from home, I guess. So she's saying, I, I guess she must mean that the room she's in, she wants it sealed away so enemy forces can't get in. I assume that's what she's saying. Well, a room or a building. Yeah. Yeah. But her room, if it's just your room, you would have to post host outside those doors because that is what their, that's what their, that's what their job is. That's what they're there for there to protect you and keep you in all of your ways. They need to say that and say, I'm leaving you here as sentinels to guard and protect everything of all of my property, this place where I live and all of this and nothing by any means shall harm it. You would say something and the host would stand, they'd stand there like sentinels right there and nothing would be allowed to come. Nothing that would hurt your place, right? Yeah. Or in your place would be allowed to come through those doors or any other entrance in that place. Oh, okay. That would be the number one way to do it. Awesome. All right. Regina asks, she says, I don't totally understand what it means to be to quote, be in the spirit or to pray in the spirit. Can Kat explain what that is? Is that a special gift or can anyone learn to do that? Did anyone learn to be in the spirit? So she may be thinking about John, the revelator said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day, I suppose that would be one example. Well, that's because he actually was in a place. Okay. He was in a spiritual place. It's almost like, I don't want to say a level of prayer is not like that. It's your focus. You always want to hear what the father is saying or what the right thing to do with. And you can even in the beginning say, I would like to have an answer from the spirit, the spirit, like Holy Spirit. I don't want to think in the flesh what that is unless it's a decision you have to make in the flesh. So there's a, there's a line right there that you have to decide are these things that I can get received information from revelation from about what I need to do about something that's a little bit different. But what John, John had just had reached a place where he was in the spirit. That means all around him is almost like a cloud of the spirit of God, not Holy Spirit, but it's a place and area that your prayers are always received. Your conversations with God are always received. And you get to a place like every decision I personally make is not made with my flesh mind. It is made with a, with a renewed spirit that God gave me when I got born again that I decided to go and say what God would do, do what God would do. And you begin to actually develop that. So John, even John the beloved on the Isle of Patmos had to develop that relationship where he was always going to be hearing what God had to say if there was something he had to say or something John had to say to him and he was actually in that place right there. In the atmosphere of the spirit, when, when the door opened up in heaven and he heard the voice saying, come up. He did. Cause that's because his relationship was to that place and anybody can do it. No, anybody, God said he would rather have you walk in the spirit so you don't fulfill the lust of the flesh. It says it in the Bible. It does say that. It does say that. Are you saying that does that scripture mean cause Paul said that walk, therefore walk in the spirit so you won't gratify the less of the flesh. That's what you said that are you saying that anybody can get to that place has the possibility of getting to the place like John, where you're walking in that spirit where it's the spirit realms all around you. And therefore when you're in that, you simply don't gratify less of flesh. Is that, is that what you're saying? So giving itself over to God, you would not even consider sin is not even a kind of sin. Consideration is not in your vocabulary, it's not in your lifestyle. There's no thought. There's no desire for that because you have on purpose developed relationship with the father or the son or Holy spirit that you would rather have what they want, what you, how they need it. God's will, God's way. That's a good thing to start focusing on. I can do God's will, but do I want to do it my way or do it even mad? Does it matter to me that I find out what his way would be? And that's like a place in that space where you begin to walk in your life. The walk in the spirit doesn't mean you have to be in the spirit realm. It means it is wrapped itself around part of you, especially this upper part where you're always thinking and acknowledging who God is. And it actually does become a way of life. And that's what John had developed, that way of life. And that's why he got caught up to heaven and shown those things. He, God knew he wouldn't reject that. He wouldn't laugh at that. You have to watch out what your conversation is all the time concerning God. You really care what he thinks. You really care what you want to know him. I mean, not that everybody has 20 more years of their life, but for 20 years I personally pursued to know Jesus Christ in a greater way. And I would not purpose find time just to go sit in a room with him and just talk to him before he even started to appear to me. I could still see angels and stuff at that time that it came like, I really wanted it's not like I shut out eating, I shut out sleeping, I'm not saying something weird like that. It's a heart desire to know him. And you go from level to level on everything, on dominion, on authority, on even understanding of the word, declaring and decreeing, ruling and reigning. You reach different, you reach different levels of all of that, but you have to start somewhere and the number one thing is don't sin. That's good. Don't look at sin. Don't look at the darkness. Don't be tempted by the darkness. And when it comes to tempt you, you say, I will serve the living God and him alone will I serve. I don't do that stuff anymore. I've given myself to God. I will run after his things. That's so good. Now, Kat, you said and you said it many times on the program that the Holy Spirit is your best friend. I think Catherine Kuhlman used to say the same thing. But one time you were pursuing Jesus, were there times when you pursued the Holy Spirit and other times now you're pursuing Jesus and other times now you're pursuing the Father? How do you decide who to pursue on a given day? It was always Jesus first. Okay. It was always Jesus first. He's the one who came and died for us. You know, I think if you have to know one time or wherever, I don't know in your life, I would say you always focus on Jesus first. He should be your first love. I mean like the person that you love the most. I'm not saying like a romantic love, the person you love the most. The fear of the Lord, by the way, is not being afraid of him. That's not what that is. The fear of the Lord is you would not want to be concerned to do something that might hurt him or might think negatively of something that you said or did. So that's you saying that. I would never do anything to turn away from the light or from Christ or his plans or anything and you have to have that mindset and some people say it's impossible and though it's not, I was just a normal everyday person, well, except for seeing the Spirit, but I still had to make decisions on my own or who I would choose. My friends would choose, where would I go even? I think probably because of my relationship so young with Christ, maybe that was a little bit more believable for me that I actually saw him and I saw angels, but you know what? You can make that same decision without seeing him at all. You can say I'm choosing this day to follow. Okay, you can be saved by Jesus Christ, but are you following what he's saying in the Word of God? Do you believe the way he says to believe? And I said, once you start looking at that, assist and meditate on those things or think about those things. So what are you thinking about? What are you spending your time doing? It's very important how you set aside time, even if it's 10 minutes a night saying this is for you Jesus, I'm going to sit over here and just talk to you, find a place to be quiet and just talk to you, tell you not all your problems. Hello, you're making a friendship, say hi, I want to tell you Jesus how much I love you, what you've done for me. I'm so excited about what you said in your Word, the plans you have for us, your home called heaven. I'm so excited about that. I'd like to know you more, say those words to me. So you're going to say, yeah, okay, you said that really quick, so don't, by pursuing, you don't mean, well, I'm just going to tell him all that's bothering me. So then he'll know that all that's bothering me, you're saying, no, no, no, that's a different time. Okay. Okay. Let's just say you're going to find somebody, you found someone to marry is every time you met with him, are you talking about what's all the problems and issues you had with him, they'd be interested, but there's a time you can always go for us to take all of your things to him and prayer, it says that cast all your chair on him, he cares for you. He's the one who restores your soul by his stripes. We are healed. I mean, there's so many things he's already done for us, right? Yeah. Nice to just give him thanks for some of those things, but really you can have a conversation with him. I would say prayer is an extended form of conversation. You know, when Jesus comes in to present himself to Thomas, who said, I'm not going to believe unless I put my hand in his wound, you know, and the side in his hand. So Jesus says to him, you know, bless that you Thomas, because you believe when you see I'm paraphrasing. And then he said, more blessed are those who believe, believe having not seen that that's a paraphrase, but that's what he was saying. He even said more blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe. So can you have any revelation on that scripture? Because some people don't see nearly the things you get to see. And yet God would like them to believe the very things that you believe, but you believe because you're seeing it. Or at least it seems that way. I believed it before I really saw a lot. Okay. I believe what he said to me when I was age four. And I repent to my sins, ask him to come and live inside of me as my savior. And then he appeared and goes, I will. I knew when he said those words, I will, he meant that his word is true. The truth will make you free people, not things you might assume or you may think someone else is sad. Maybe that's important. What's important is what's in his word. And I know people who live, even though they're seers, they live strictly by the word of God and I know I'm a bus person, but there's a lot of accountability in my life. And I can just tell you this, to carry something like this, you would have to have a huge amount of accountability. I'm accountable to him, but I'm still accountable to my husband as my husband, but as my God, I'm fully accountable to him for my life and what he has asked me to do and how to do it, how to say it. He won't let me step beyond bounds, he has made for me to stay within this limits like he would tell me all the time, don't let somebody make you a Billy Graham, you're not, don't let somebody make you a revivalist, you're not, you are a prophet, will speak for me what I say when I say to say it and I'll share, let you share what heaven is, the future is because this is what I've assigned for you. And I said, yes. Now, if he asked you something, even something smaller than that. Make sure you do what he's asked you to do. Like this cup of milk to your neighbor, they're trying to make something and they need the milk. Now, are you going to be willing to step out and maybe embarrass yourself by going next door and say, I thought you might use this cup, might need to use this cup of milk. Wow. Small thing. I do small things like that all the time. And I did it every time. Every time he said it, I would do it, that build your trust in him. He already knows he can trust me, but I have to see, I have to see that I can. And so he started with small things with me too. And he would ask me, and I didn't know those things, you know, I didn't always know they needed the cup of milk. He would just say, go over here and take this to this person, go over here, fly here and take this to this note to this person in the airport, fly over here and I would do it. I didn't always know all the answers. It's called willingness, willingness to obey. I do remember you telling a story once about going and flying the airport and handing someone a note. Is that a story you can recount? Yes. It was one of those times for three years, he kind of trained me by, at the spur of the moment, sending me all these strange places with strange reasons to go to them. And now you have to understand when I first started doing all this, he had me go to my husband and explain to my husband, this is what God has me doing. He needs to know that you're okay with that. And he turned right around and said, oh God, you can do anything with her you want to do. That's fine. And so I didn't just bypass the fact that I had a husband. My husband gave me permission and I could have said, I don't need you. That would have been so wrong. God would not have been happy with me if I'd have done that. He didn't want to separate us. He wanted us to be together, so I had to be willing on both sides to get to do what he asked me to do. And so, oh yeah, there was this one time, he said, you're going to fly to Minneapolis. And he said, I'll tell you why when you get on the plane. And I need you to go to the airport and you're going to walk in the airport. And I'm going to try to remember what you call the place where you go and buy all the food in the airport. The food court. I need you to go to the food court and he said, I'll tell you who to say something to when you get there. And my trip, I took, the flight gave me 45 minutes in the airport before my return flight that he told me to plan. I just flew the Minneapolis airport and then I flew back here and I had 45 minutes in between the flight. And that time you fly, he was going to make sure I guess I did it. I don't know. But that's my time frame that I had to fly back. And the enemy will fly everywhere in something like that to stop you from doing it or delay you doing it. And I already said, I'll do it. I will do it. I will do it. So I went, got the tickets. My husband, we got the tickets and he came to me, took me to the airport and we took off. I took off. He didn't go with me. I took off. Arrived in Minneapolis airport. But right before I got there, God said, there's a man in the airport who's got a new invention that will help change a lot of the lives in this world. He's trying to find the right buyer to help him invest in it. And I'm giving him my answer because he's asked me and I told him to go to the Minneapolis airport. And I was giving him my answer. Now I don't know this man's name at all. He said, so you're going to write down in the scratch of paper. This is what you're going to say in the scratch of paper going to hand him. Yes. My answer is New York. That is where you will go to find your investor, God. And he said, that's it. That's the message. Yes. My answer is New York. Yeah. That's it. That's what God had me write on the scrap piece of paper. He said, now you go to the food court and this guy will be marrying like a mechanic's one piece outfit. And you can't approach until he sits down to buy his head for prayer 45 minutes. I knew I had 45 minutes and on the way to the airport on the way in the in the airport on the way to the food court, this is how the devil tries to do things. My daughter calls grandson is drinking a bottle of Elvira. Oh my goodness. Now this is where my faith is. I started praying out loud at the top of my lungs running through the airport to get to the food court. I'm going to knock on the food court people. I was praying all the way there that it would be the stuff would be, I would nullify all the effects of the stuff that he drank that they would be able to find a bottle that they would get him to the medical care place so they could check him out. And I mean, I'm yelling running through the airport to get there. So I finally get to the food court and I said, amen. I was praying this on the phone with my daughter and we get to the food court and I turn the phone off and I waited, it was probably about 10 minutes and here he comes, he had like dark hair, had like a blue kind of a mechanic's outfit but a nice one and he went over and he was taking his time. I'm going to go help him pick the food because he was taking it off. And so he finally gets down and he gets his train and I'm like, you know, I'm waiting, I'm just waiting to get out of there and get my other flight. And so he comes up and he sits down and he bows his head like this, now I'm not a very quiet person. I ran up and I went, wait a minute, God, he lifts his head up and looks at me and I go, here's a note from God and I didn't even look, I didn't even watch him read it. I knew what it said. I turn, I'm running out of the food court and I hear this, praise God forevermore. And this funny and it's the guy in the suit. He got God's answer. Wow. Now I did not sign that piece of paper. He did not know who I was or anything about me and God said he doesn't need to know. He'll just know I answered him. That's amazing. What a couple. I just caught the flight just in time to get on the flight and come back. I was just shaken from head to toe. I was so excited that the devil didn't get to keep me. My daughter called me back. She said they can't believe they got the bottle, like on the little bottle and their child's really smart. It was something he was taking for something. It wasn't the kind you put in a lighter float or something like that, but it was some kind of thing he had to have so often for about three days. And he was like, not very old, I think it was like three or four genius level. He got the, what do you call that thing on a lock? The combination thing? He had that combination lock on the thing that the doctor gave to him, put it in the refrigerator. He got it out and then lost it. Oh my goodness. Now the good news, she finished telling me, the good news was she said when he found the bottle, it was empty. And this is my daughter and her husband talking to their son. I said, did you drink that? Why didn't you drink it? We have to pray right now. What are you doing? You're such an extreme person. This is my oldest daughter. Now honey, did you open this bottle? You know you weren't supposed to do it without mommy and daddy. And I can hear them. I can hear that part before I hung up. And then here comes your husband. Now son. I don't know. And I'm like, dear Lord in heaven, I'd have been shaking that kid upside down. I'd have been praying for him at the same time, but the kids are very calm until they have fun and they go wild. And so they call me back and say, we have to let you know everything's all fine. They said they could not believe they found traces of it in him, but we found most of it on his clothing. Gee. Wow. What a story too. I mean, that could have been probably, I mean, the reality is he's probably got people all over the United States and the earth that he's giving such tests to, or if that for lack of a better word, I don't know if test is the word or assignments, but I don't know. Did you consider that kind of like a test was God testing it was training, training. Okay. Training me. Okay. And so I didn't let the enemy stop me. And yet my grandson was perfectly fine. And that man got what he needed that day because he was flying from that place to one of the places that wherever God said to go to, we had three places picked out. And he was going to go to one of them from his answer. He got in food court. Yeah. That is so amazing. Yeah. I love it. Awesome. Awesome. All right. That was my life nonstop for three years. Well, no wonder you guys can trust you now, Kat. So, all right. So here's a question. Kobe asks, can people, I think this is a heaven question. Can people in the past, like in heaven do something like we do for instance, Kat mentioned she saw King David writing in his chariot in heaven. My question is, can King David, can David write in a convertible in heaven if he wants to? I think David can write in anything he wants to. He loves the chariot because it doesn't ride on the ground. It's flies in the air with chariot flies. Yeah. So, okay. So yeah, that was good. That was easy. All right. But Linda asked, when Jesus died and went into hell and took the keys from Satan and death, death, hell and the grave, why, there's a question, why didn't things revert back to the way they were before he was deceived by the serpent? So it's a why question, which God probably never answers, but why didn't he at that time, why didn't that change everything back? That's what, that's what her question is. That's not how it happens, people. He's not going to go back and change every little thing that you went through or things that you, choices you made and stuff like that. Now, there'll come a time in your life where, let's say, I don't know, you're upset about what you did or the choice you made, Adam certainly didn't make the best choice in the world, but I will tell you this, they are both in heaven, Adam and Eve are both in heaven. At one point, they did repent for doing that, or especially Adam repented for doing that, but he did make it into heaven, which is what you really want to make sure you do. But God, Jesus Christ did fix part of it, people. Then Adam gave away his authority to Satan, which is what he did in that garden, Satan said over what God had said, and that's when he remember after that that he couldn't see God. And remember people, he had to leave the garden because of what he did. Well, Jesus Christ redeemed the fact that Adam gave our rights away to rule and reign to have authority and power and be creators, Jesus Christ took that back. Yeah, when he went into hell and he took back the keys of hell, death and the grave, beat the devil to pieces, left him in the dirt and fire of hell, stripped every gemstone off of him, and even messed up the faces of the principalities and powers while he did that. That was his second part of the cross. The first part, of course, was to pay for the sins. He had to do that first when he died for our sins. Remember, he nailed to the cross all the wicked evil stuff. It's the only reason why Jesus Christ can cleanse you from your sins. But this other part of that, it was finished on the cross for that. But if he was totally finished, he'd have just gone back to heaven when he died on the cross. He didn't do that. He descended so he could have a face off with Satan to show him, you have no right to keep a righteous man in hell. You have no right over them. And then he showed him he didn't have any power over him by beating them and taking back the keys to hell, death and the grave. That didn't change everything in back. It didn't actually literally take you up to where Adam and Eve were and change that time. It changed our right as a believer to have authority over the enemy, which Christ made that perfectly known when he said, I give you power over all the power of the enemy. And then the rest of the scripture, he could say that because he got that right to do that. That's good. All right. So Jody's asked this question. How do our guardian angels interact with each other when we fight? Like if two, two believers are fighting, they each have guardian angels and they're fighting with each other. The people are, she's saying, what, what are the guardian angels doing? If you know, you mean fighting physically or say that I'm arguing with somebody that's a believer and we're just fighting about something. We're not doing good. The question is behind you, we're shaking their head. That's what they're doing. They're shaking their head. They're not saying stop it, cut it out. Oh, they'd be doing a lot more than that. They had their foot raised. How so? Well, their foot. Kick you in the butt. Oh, really? Really? I'm not kidding at all. I had a friends, close friends who did ministry really young. They were, they ministered in the like the, well, I think the early 80s, they're still ministering right now, but this is kind of at the end of the hippie era. And they would go out and they, boy, the mission field was ripe with harvest back then. And I worked on that side. I went on the side of the celebrating and the gugs and all that garbage. I was on the rescuer side, but I wasn't quite as, I wasn't quite as verbal back then. I would like help sew the carpets together in the, in the, I think a congressman or somebody gave us a, an old church and we would have music playing Jesus and give food and coffee to the, to the drug people so we could help them find Jesus. And that's what we were doing. And then they would minister out in the streets later. I'd stay there and help keep hot coffee, hot and stuff like that. But anyway, she was a seer. His wife is a seer. And they'd always, she'd see the angels going with them and they were there ministering and there was these two guys were having an argument, not her husband. So he walks up to them wants to start ministering to them, but he's not really pushing the fact. He's just trying to be polite. And she said all of a sudden she saw his angel with his foot raised. She wanted him, he wanted him, the angel wanted him to hurry up and get to business about Jesus Christ. So they stopped fighting and I'll never forget that you never did kick him. Okay. Because he finally was the angel saying something to him like, you got to talk about Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. And so finally he put his leg down, but I never forget when my friend told me that story that he was getting a little humor, he wanted to rush him along in his mission stuff. Well, yeah, you know, that, that my story about being knocked by an angel a couple of times to sit in the chair. I wasn't fighting with anybody, but I was just kind of probably being a little bit lazy in an afternoon. And he just got knocked me on the arm. Yeah. I felt this nice big knock. And then it happened again. I thought, what's going on is someone coming to the door and there's a crisis that I'm supposed to have heard and it was nothing. It was like, wait, that was your angel doing that for sure. That was your angel as a few years ago. So, all right. So Dee's asking this question, we got time for a few more questions. Dee's asked, what does it mean to seek the face of God? Scripture says seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his face. 1st Chronicles 16 20 and quote, when you said, seek my face, my heart said to you, your face thought I will see. So she's wondering now, what does that mean? Seek his face. That means that you're, you're, you are really focusing on really talking to him. Doesn't mean you have to see him face to face. You want to be near him. You want to know him in a greater depth is what you're saying to him. And when he said, yes, seek my face, that man, he was inviting them to pursue him, you know, in a greater way in the relationship. That's what that's about. That's what I was saying, just find him behind, just spend alone and just talk to him like he was right there next to you because I promise you, he probably is right next to you. Talk like he's there. And one day he'll probably just appear next to you and then you'll really get undone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Kara, let's see. I don't know. I haven't pre read this. I would like to know if we will be able to talk to the actual animals that were on Noah's Ark and hear their stories. Are those animals like the rock stars of the animal world, for example, to the other creature's point and say, look, that's Leo and Bernadette, the lions on the Ark with Noah. So let's go here. I wouldn't be surprised if they did. That's a very creative question. You know, I wouldn't have thought of that question, but wow. So they would be. I mean, they were the ones that were protected for all of animal, all of their animals. I'm quite sure that they have conversations with all the other creatures. I'm sure they do. Yeah. I'd love to know the whole thing. They probably want to hear the whole story from them, you know, give us your point of view. What happened? What did you think was going on? And actually a lot of people want to know that period, no matter who it is that was in the Bible, you know, if it was somebody for God or one of God's own creatures, everybody wants to talk to them when they get to heaven. Very cool. The funniest thing is they want to talk to you because you just arrived. What's been going on? You know, what's been going on? I'm talking about people who've been living there for 40, 50 years. Anything important going on? What can you say? Well, I was going to ask you that question one day, and I think it's set my mind. I wanted to know, do people want news from home when you arrive? They do. You sound like you're saying they do. Oh yeah. They love to hear. They know. They know something is going on, but they want to hear in their own, in their own person's life. What has been going on around you? What needs to be seen? What has God done? Wow. You can be pretty busy in heaven too, even just enjoying yourself, but there's other things to learn and do there, too, in heaven. But yeah, when somebody new arrives, they actually have big meetings, events set up, and it's not like you're going in a conference room. Don't go there. Most of it's outside, and you sit on all kinds of things to get relaxed and everything, and someone gets up there and tells their stories, and they're very animated, but something new has been added to their stories. It's what was going on in the spirit realm the whole entire time. They were doing things in the physical realm. So they have a new part of their story. Let's say they did miraculous things happen to them, or they got to do something miraculous for God, and people, all the attention was on that person. They haven't even got to tell the other side of the story, because you've already found that out on your way up to heaven. Okay. So by the time you got there, you now know the whole in the spirit side of things. Yeah, you know a lot of, especially important things, important or powerful things that happen. Yeah. You know, and you feel like, wow, I never saw this before, this is going to be awesome. So when people go, okay, tell us, tell us, you want to hear what's going on, they will tell that kind of a story is what God showed them. He was doing, when he couldn't see what they were doing, but what happened, it's really awesome. Do you have either, is there anything happening like when you're on your way to heaven or whatever, where your guardian angel is saying to you, what were you thinking when you did blah, blah, blah, is any of that going on? You know, I think they would be the only one. I think nobody else would say anything to them at all about it, but your guardian angel who was there all the time, I always tell people, they'd have questions. I always have said that, be careful how you treat and talk around your angel, they'll have questions for you. I'm not talking, we're not talking about sins, we're talking about maybe some decisions that weren't the smartest or the best thing they ever did, and their angel gets me with them. Okay, what was going on here? Yeah. Fascinating. Fascinating. Okay. Jamelia, Jamelia or Jamelia says, you have mentioned that summer, fall, winter, and spring are four of the Father's favorite seasons. Do you know what any other of the seasons are in heaven? Well, they're not seasons in heaven. What I actually said was God told me he took four of his favorite places in heaven. Okay, places. Yeah, there's too many new, I mean, I can't even, there's no way, thousands of places in heaven people, there's no way I can number that places. Yeah. But what he did when he made the earth, he decided to do something special that would be a little bit of heaven on the earth. And this is what he was telling me, and he said, when I went and I took four of my favorite places in heaven, I took a shadow of them and made them a season on the earth. Well, that's really good. That's really good. So there would be a place where there would be brightly colored fall leaves, I would think. The mountain of spices. Mountain of spices. Oh, really? Mountain of spices. And that became our fall. Is that what you're saying? Our fall. Yeah. Very cool. Okay. Christmas town would be our winter. I love that. I love that. The fall would be our spring. And the surf park would be our summer. The which part? The surf park. Okay. Oh, I love that. Those four places in heaven, which everyone loves to go to, and there's so many, there's so many other places. I know the names of a lot of them, but I probably have to include a lot of those in my third book. But I'm just saying, that's what he did, and I thought, what a wonderful, beautiful way it is. Give us a real piece of him. Now, people are going to say, but some of them are destructive. He didn't make them destructive people. Yeah. They're not destructive in heaven. Nobody burns to a cinder in the summertime. Nobody's going to get sunburn in the summertime. No one's going to freeze in the winter up there because, you know, and he even kind of proves it proves that there is a place where winter isn't heaven because the winter we have is only a shadow of that place in heaven that does exist. That's good. The mountain of spices where everybody loves to go for trail rides. The leaves are probably huge. The leaves are about this big. The leaves never fall off the trees. They're always those different colors, but there's some purples and other colors, you know, on the leaves and you ascend every level in the mountain of spices. You smell another aroma like it was Thanksgiving or like the things in pumpkin pie. Yeah, totally. Every level you go up, you go, oh, wow, this is amazing. You go to another level. The best part is when you get to the top of this mountain range, it's not the biggest mountain range in heaven, but it's one of the most beautiful. You look down into this valley that goes forever. It's called the Valley of the Falls. And in that valley, it is always like spring. Really? There's flowers so huge you dive off of the waterfalls. You dive up in heaven. You can do that. It's for fun and you dive inside of this massive flower that goes like eight people and you roll around this flower and then flop back out into the river and then you go back up and climb back up and jump again. Very cool. Flowers are everywhere in the Valley of the Falls. It's absolutely beautiful. On the spices smells like this. I'm one of those that loves that whole Thanksgiving cinnamon vanilla probably in there and what's the other one? There's another flavor. Cinnamon, vanilla. Yeah. Well, it's all run together and you smell it and you go, oh, it's that Thanksgiving in Rome. So is there any kind of like when you smell that in heaven, does it cause you in heaven to think of Thanksgiving because that's where you first smelled it? I'm just curious if you would have any reminiscent. I think probably my favorite thing out of the entire Thanksgiving would be the pumpkin pie. So when I think about pumpkin pie, that's Thanksgiving to me, of course, thanking God. Of course, that's number one. Right. Yes, but in heaven, you can have Thanksgiving all the time. No turkey is killed for it. Just so you know, no harm is called to any animal, human or spiritual, all the stuff is made. They just, it's just made. Okay. You'd say turkey and it'd be made, but nothing would die for you. Yeah. Yeah. You're not eating. They would not be very happy if you're trying to kill them. What do you think you're doing? I'm getting one feather from my body. Now, this is what a turkey would say to you in heaven, right? Just go on home to your home and, and, or, and just order it. Just order it. So my question back to the other one, let's say that the pumpkin pie, because pumpkin pie is one of my favorites too. It sounds like you and I are a lot of like, we're photographers, we like chocolate cake, we like pumpkin pie, we like the spices. If you're having pumpkin pie in heaven, would you feel reminiscent of the Thanksgiving on earth? Would it, would there be something in that that you would remember that? Yeah. The thing I would remember that would be my family gathered around the table, okay, praying and thanking God for our food. Okay. So you're eating that. Yeah. Okay. Cool. All right. I'm going to give the clock. We got time for one more. Well, I'll just, I'll just, Gary's asking this question. It's a general one. I don't know because you're always revelating, but he's saying, what is the latest thing the father's revealed to you about heaven that he wants to reveal to us? Is there anything that's been recent that you learned that? You may have to re-mention that because I was laughing at Jen, sorry people. Oh, well, Jen. Okay. Yeah. So Gary's asking, what's the latest thing the father has revealed to you about heaven that he wants to reveal now to us? Something new you mean? Yeah. Something new that you've seen. If there is something. There's so many. There's just so many. We'd have a list a long, mile long. Yeah. I'll just tell you probably one of the funnest things people get to do, and I know I mentioned it a little bit about it, but there's a place where you do learn to fly. Yeah. It is, it is like a fun thing to do, right? Yeah. I already told you all, well, this got me, some people saying, well, I don't like you anymore. It's okay if you don't like me. You don't have to let me. You don't have to let me. You don't really want to put like heaven. I will. I will. I'll be okay. I'm not sure why they got so I'll put like where they offended because they thought you should automatically know how to fly. Therefore it makes no sense. No one explained and teaches you how to do it. Steve. Oh, that's what it was. And they got it. And they made it happen. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't not wear just so you know, let's get this clear. He does not wear his superman costume. He does not do that. It's just Christopher Reed. It's Christopher Reeves who teaches you how to fly. Of course, God thought that would be quite fun. Yeah. Our God does have a sense of humor and it is funny watching people how to learn and all your friends come to watch you when you start because sometimes you twirl around. You don't do so well. You need some practice like anything else even in heaven. And so that I think to me is one of the most fun things I have shown when I was up there. I was quite blessed that it was Christopher Reeves though. I even went to contact his son to tell him. Yeah. And but that's what he does. That's what he does. It's called fly by. That's the name of it because God names everything. Every place in heaven has its own name. That's very cool. I like that. And so by the way, you mentioned Adam and Eve in heaven. Yeah. Is there anything that you've seen them do or they do they hang around together because they were husband and wife and and now they're not but they're best friends. They hang around together and everybody wants to meet them because they're Adam and Eve. Right. People go well there's no stars there. We're all stars. God said so. Okay. We're all stars in his hand. That's what we are. We all have light and everybody has their own specific thing. They were chosen by God and they did a really good job with it. I mean, even though they fell, you know, from where they were supposed to be with him. They still talked to not just their sons, but they taught a lot of the other people there about God himself. They talked about it a lot about him and how much they loved him and then what happened with them in the garden and everything. So people want to meet him because they actually are Adam and Eve and don't be too quick to judge. Okay. We all had something we went through somewhere in our life and and made it better, but they're very happy. They're very happy there to know God and to be there with him. They love him very much. And so people do want to meet them and talk to them about what happened. I do think in back to the father thinking of the laughter and we're talking about all of this stuff. One of the greatest revelations to me in this last few years that I've known you is that God loves to have fun and likes to laugh as a real dad to his kids. I mean, he's a judge too, but he's a dad, you know, and he's got dad like qualities that sounds like and he, he likes to laugh and do fun things with his kids. He does. And you know, my father was the greatest example to me as the father and my dad also knew the father and the son and Holy Spirit. I learned a lot from him personally because he has such a humble spirit and he loved everybody. He literally did love his enemies and you talk about the father all the time, but he had talked to the father. This is what the father had said to him about things and not, not, not like seeing him like I see him that way, but hear him very clearly. And I can tell you that he is your heavenly father. He is your real true father. It says that he is our father and we are his offspring in the Bible. It says that he carried us inside of him and then he timed your birth on the earth so he could send you and how did he send you? He sent you through the spirit because you know what, man can't make a spirit. They can't make a spirit or soul at the time of conception, whether it's the Holy Spirit or Holy Spirit, of course, whoever brings you brought you down at one time at the time of conception, brought you down in their hand, your little spiritual being and knit that together in the mother's womb at the time of conception, this would be together yet to touch your spirit to that. So that actually would be a real living human being. And so that's how he did that and he loved you and had been with you all that time. And he would dance with you inside of himself because he's God and he can do it. He'd sing over you. The Bible says that he'd show you some things to come. He wrote something on the on the will of your will, on your will, on the wall of your will when he put it inside of you. And he loved very much this moment right now and all fathers can forgive. They can train you. They can advise you. They can love you. They can play with you. He does all of that. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Karen, do you feel like just praying for the people real quick and as we close out just whatever you feel? Father, I thank you for this day today, God, that you have made and we will rejoice in it because we trust you. We know that you have your hand on all of this. You know everything that ever was is or will be and you know the perfect time to do something in this earth. You are not done yet with any of us. You still have great plans, great inventions, great revelations and great miraculous things to happen and I am excited. So thank you, Father, for drawing them all closer to you, open their hearing. Give them clarity that they can hear you. They can hear Jesus. They can hear Holy Spirit, Father, because you love us. You all love us. And I thank you for sending us here to this earth that we can be a light, you're a blinding light, but we're a light also in this darkness and I thank you for increasing that, increasing the sudden leaves, the help, the protection, the joy, the celebration right now that's in heaven is coming to this earth. Be a habitation of heaven to this earth is what we're looking for. The evil will be crushed down, pushed back for generations to come and we who are on the earth now that you have purpose will do these great things for you and with you and because of you. In Jesus name, amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now Kat, at revealingheaven.com below, I know that people can get their products there. I don't do demons. I, they give the cups and the different things. And then talk about Kat Kerr. What Kat Kerr.com, what can they get there? Oh, that is a spiritual platform that Father says whatever he wants to do. Right there. There's a gallery in it that shows you a lot of places in heaven, things in the spirit, what they look like. There's testimonies, I think, in there. There's interviews there. There's a lot of revelation that teaches you how to do things like pray for your family, loosens from your soul. It's a very powerful site. It's also the only site in the world that I have that you can give to me online if you want to. And I appreciate that very much and may God bless you totally, give you sudden leaves, hold you in his hand, that you feel his presence awake and while you sleep and may the host go with you. We can't, we love you, love your staff and everything and we'll, we will see you again very, very soon. A quick reminder that Nathan French will be on tomorrow. Same time tomorrow is Thursday. Just double checking. I have one little thing to say, go ahead and just get him, you know, this is Benjamin Netanyahu has won. Okay. He has won. He won. Yep. He's like his third time back, he's either third or fourth time when he's won this thing. So interesting. He was going to come back, God said he was going to put him back. So I expected that to happen. Just like I do. Another number 45 is going to come back people. That's good. And just to let you all know, I do have one meeting in December, December 20th at Elm Hunters in Tom Ball, Texas. Okay. Yeah. That's in the Houston area. Tom Ball, Texas with Joan Hunters Place. So that's December, what 15th through the 18th of December. Okay. Yeah. So they can just go to, I think it's johunter.com or something. Yeah. Or so you sign up for that. So I hope you'll go sign up for that right now. So thanks, Kat. God bless you. Thank you everybody. We will see you again tomorrow. Okay. Bye.

Well, welcome to Elijah's Streams. It is Wednesday, February 1, but we are recording this the day before, so I'm recording this in the clock behind us. We'll say Tuesday, January 31, but you will see this in the morrow on Wednesday, so we're very excited to bring you Kat again today. She has a shorter schedule because they're in the middle of a move, so we're going to do 35 minutes and fast and furious and we'll have a good time. I had to hook myself up today and all the things are dragging in. Anyway, hope the dog doesn't bark because I didn't take care of that ahead of time, so we'll see how this goes. So pretty short show, but we'll enjoy every minute of it, so we're not going to run any spots or any other announcements. Tomorrow, by the way, is Robin Bullock, so don't miss that. So you're hearing this on Wednesday, so Thursday will be Robin Bullock. So all right, without further delay, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go. Hi, Kat. So you're in the middle of a move this week, huh? Yes, and we are so excited. I'm really excited. Awesome. Well, it's good to see you. We've got questions. We were going to jump right into questions today. Anything you wanted to say before we do that? I just want to say how much I love everybody and thank you for all the prayers you've given us over the years and even for this move, which sometimes seems almost impossible. Here we are moving tonight and tomorrow night. So we seriously are moving and we are all very excited. You know, it's a beautiful place. We know people there. We're going to meet a lot more people. I know God's going to be there too, of course. And so, yeah, we're trying to use our time as wisely as we can and our staff is actually going to come tomorrow to help. They have been bugging us forever. Please, let us help. Let us help. Yeah, we've got to take that, man. It's more talking than moving, but we're all very excited about how God has blessed us. So, yeah. And I feel that you're paying on the moving too. You know, you can have fun with friends and everything, but man, every time I've ever moved, we moved about something like 17 times in our married life. It's crazy. Wow. One time a year for the first half of the year. And then this place we've been at for 23 years now. Yeah. Yeah, so amazing. Well, listen, Kat, so you're pretty excited about the future still. Are you optimistic about how things are going? I am optimistic about everything God has said or told me and still intend to do. So, absolutely, yes, we all are. We're all very optimistic. By the way, once again, not intentionally, but we wore them. You got your teal on your hat and I got my teal on my tie and you're... Yeah. And that is heaven's color, you said, or heaven's favorite color. So, if I'm saying that right. Okay, so Kat, let me just jump in and ask you one question that I may have asked you a variant of this from time to time, but when people go to heaven, they've died and now they've graduated to heaven and you've said people, when they get to heaven, don't start comparing, don't say, how did you die? No, how did you die? They don't do that. But do... Would someone show up? Let's say they meet their parents and their parents are young like they are. They're everybody's in their 20s and 30s, I guess, looking at them. Does that... When they sit down and have coffee or whatever it is you do in heaven, do the parents say, well, tell me what happened last time we were there, you didn't even know the Lord, what happened? Do they tell that kind of story? And some say... Sometimes they do, if something's really on their heart, sure. And nobody minds at all if they ask some questions like that. I would have thought, you know, in my P-brain, I would have thought that that would be almost a sure thing that everybody would want to hear that story. But you... It sounds a little bit like it's more of an exception to the rule. Well, they actually hold meetings already when they come. Every time somebody comes new from earth, they always have huge events and everybody wants to come so they can hear what's been going on. Oh, okay. It's not gonna be any really good news, anything that's changed or maybe major things have happened that they would want to know about. That's an automatic, that part is automatic. So everybody will attend me somewhere. And then that person will be invited over and over and over again to visit people, speak places. And so, yeah, it's very exciting. Okay, very cool. So let's see, I wanted to go with this one. This one was... I've had this... Somehow I came across my desk I've had since December. It says, okay, I love Kat. I purchased and read her wonderful books. I find them very encouraging. I would like to ask her this question. The Bible says, when you try to approach the throne of God or God himself, you become very, very fearful. I have not heard Kat talking about the reverential fear of the, fear the Bible speaks of when it went in the presence of the great and almighty God. So I guess they're asking once you go to be with the Lord or once you visit heaven. I'm not quite sure where the reverential fear is that she's wanting to address. What would you say about that? I think it would probably depend on what was going on in its own home at the time. Of course, I've always, always had such holy reverence and love for the Father, for the Son, for the Holy Spirit that never changes. You never, ever get familiar with all that and not any of it. It's just overwhelming sometimes, the peace and the love that you experience when you're there. And of course, when I go many times, I'm like eight. Yeah, that's what you said. Not all viewpoint would be entirely different than most people who are already adults. So I think about what kind of fun will I have? Where will we take me? What will we do? I love him so much. I'm so excited to be here. So that would be the way that I would look at things and he wants me to. He wants me to see him that way. And there's other people who feel that way also. Well, yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. But you talked about how you've gone as an eight year old and that you usually go as an eight year old. So God sees you and you interact, I guess, as an eight year old. And you have said many times that heaven is like 50 percent worship, serious worshiping the Lord and 50 percent fun. Am I quoting you right? Is that about right? I would have to say yes. And he even says sometimes it's 50 percent fun. I'd have to make it fun. You come like a child. It makes sense. And so if you tell a story about this, I saw this or I saw that. And it makes the children or you at eight years old, when you go, giggle and laugh to see something funny, that's something that's in the heart of God to provide. Giggles and laughter and even goofiness when you're having fun, right? Yeah, you know, most everyone who comes says you must come like a child, right? And he wants us to feel that, you know, you're really all that innocent and excited and you know, you're going to have a good time. I mean, he is our father. That's who he is. That doesn't take anything away from his sovereignty, you know, his holiness, his power, the life he gives people. It doesn't change that. It's just that from my perspective and the way he's always taught me, he taught me as his daughter, he taught me as a child. So I see from their perspective. Okay, okay, cool. All right, Isaac is age 15. And he's asking this, are the world's wonders in heaven? For example, the hanging guards of Babylon, the Colosseum and so on, because we think of the seven wonders of the world, he's like, no, are those wonders in heaven? There are wonders, it says of course, those wonders in heaven. But I think it is the famous ones that we know, like, no, not those. Okay, not those. It would be like, you know, like the Valley of the Valley of the Falls would be definitely one the throne room, of course, absolutely the streets of gold, his rainbow. I mean, there's so many different things you would want to see the crystal sea, where you can swim under the water and breathe and talk and meet all the creatures there. So of course, they do actually have their list on quite sure of amazing places. Oh, yeah, the city is there. So there's so many things to do, see and learn about people have their favorites once they've been there for a while. So I would say, yes, it is sort of like, maybe more than eight. Yeah, well, you know, all right. And so if someone said, well, I will always hope that I never could go to see the Grand Canyon, I hope that I could see it in heaven. It's not like God needs to give you the Grand Canyon, he's got the grand everything. He absolutely has the grand, the grand of everything, you're right. So it's not like you missed that anymore. Won't you see what he's got there? Yeah, so good. Okay. Pam is asking this, can't you taught us that our level of spiritual authority grows as we mature in Christ? Can you tell us what a brand new Christians authority looks like? I don't, I guess, I have to interpret what she means. What does it look like? What, what would you say a brand new Christians authority like? I think maybe she's asking the moment you're saved and you're brand new. Do you walk out and possess certain authority that you didn't have? Or what does it look like if you're brand new? I think that no one can really maybe even think about that ahead of time. I think you are so undone by the glory that, you know, the glory we create for him, the splendors and the wonders that are there. You're so overwhelmed by his goodness that he gives us. But I'm brand new believer especially. They're overwhelmed really at what has been given to what Christ actually did give you, what you can operate in, how to do that, and what difference it would make here in the earth if everybody did. So yeah, there's a lot of things that there's so many things that we could talk about and discuss, but always those feelings of a new believer realize what has been paid for for them and what it's like to operate. There's like nothing is, you know, I don't think as much as I've been excited in all the years afterwards, I think the cream of the crop was the first week days and weeks after I encountered God and everything. It's hard to find that level of first love very many times. Don't get me wrong. I seek it and I do discover major encounters, but you're overwhelmed by that love. Absolutely yes. Yeah. I mean the Old Testament when I had the encounter with God 81, even the Old Testament screamed grace, grace, grace. I read it and I said, there's grace all over this thing and I had only seen bad news and that's them. All right. So Jan is asking this, when people first get to meet Jesus in heaven, what is the first most common response? Is it a joyful celebration kind of moment or a holy worship kind of moment? So what is that? I mean, yeah, so like, go ahead. Yeah, I think most of the time it's probably more of a holy thing. You are so undone knowing you're meeting actually the risen Savior, the one who gave everything for you. So I have seen most of the people probably would have that holy reverential thing that we talked about. Yeah. Unless you're a kid, then you're going to be like, yeah, besides yourself excited. Yeah. Well, you know, I, when I picture it for myself, I think, I think I'd fall on my knees or I would be, I would feel like falling and I feel like tears would come, but they would be tears of absolute unbelievable joy that we made it and he did this for me. And are there tears of joy? You know, there are tears of joy. I don't people think you never cry again in heaven. At the end of the Bible, it says every tear will be wiped away. You know, the former things, you know, more. That's the end of everything when it says, you don't cry, but crying for joy, excitement, gratefulness. Yeah, that's, it's a wonderful feeling anyway. And you absolutely love it. So yes, people still do that. Cool. Very cool. All right. Reggie's asking this, will teams of people work together or collaborate together to create things in heaven or on the new earth, like in these say, it's like groups work together on earth now to create or will, but we only create individually using our individual gifts and talents. So I guess he's likes doing things together as a group. And will we collaborate and do things together? That's the answer. We do collaborate and do things together. Of course we do. And you do learn how to create, not people, but there's creation lab where you think that's for in heaven. Okay. All kinds of things, places that we can make for each other, not talking about like our mansions or anything like that, but there we all have a creative ability because of who they are and so absolutely people get excited. Yes. And actually people say, well, what do people do? There's nothing to do there. You don't have a job or you create stuff. You hold events everywhere and everybody wants to be a part of your event. So yes, those things do happen a lot. That's good. Good. Okay. I have so many rabbit trails that I want to go to, but I'm going to jump to the next question. Elizabeth asks, how do I know if my child goes to heaven? If my child goes to heaven in her sleep, I asked this because she has a dear friend and recently that recently moved to heaven twice this week. She said she had a dream about them playing together and running. I'm not sure if I understand the question. How do I know if my child goes to heaven in her sleep? I asked this because she has a dear friend. Oh, she's saying when my child is sleeping, did she go to heaven and visit? That's what she's asking. That is a great possibility. Sure. Yeah, he takes people while they're sleeping. Okay. So they may, they say, Mom, I had this dream and I was playing. Yeah, my green kids have actually had that happen to them quite often. Okay. And those five places in heaven, like when they were four years old and they went, they didn't even know those places were there. But I mean, they have been that they ride, they rode, I think I mentioned before, you would ride lava out of a volcano. Yeah. My grandfather, my dad. Yeah, there are some of those giggles, by the way. I love the giggles. Giggles of God. Someone needs to write that book because we serve a happy, joyful, funny. By the way, of all the three, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Who's funniest if you could, if you, who's clever with their wit if you, if you had. I would have to say there's either Holy Spirit, probably or Jesus. I think Jesus definitely has the wit. I think they call Holy, well, I know they call Holy Spirit the drama king. Yeah. Right there. He loves a good joke. He really does. He loves like all kinds of drama and exciting things going on up there. So I would have to say probably more of those. The father is definitely for love. Yeah. Just dad, father, you know, I think Kim Robinson has had multiple trips together. She calls him daddy, God. You've had, I'm not asking you to say the names, your private names for God, but God has given you different names that you call him. Is that right? Yes, he had. That's a real interesting thing. And I've known several others that were like that. They say I've called them such and such and it would be something I'd never heard. But God gave, I don't know, maybe he gives different people the same ones, but that's pretty special. All right. He's just asking, how do you pray when asking God to relocate? How do you pinpoint where God wants you? I guess that means to move. I do not want to move to a place out of his will. So he's saying, she's saying, how do you pray when you're asking God to relocate you? I mean, I guess you, you want to tell him, I guess you want to ask, okay, I don't even know how to interpret that more than the question. So yeah. So what's your thoughts on that? So I think she wants to move, but she doesn't want to move to the wrong place because God didn't tell her to do or something like that. She's, she's going, you know, how do I pray? I would say, you know, you want his will done more than anything else and asked him to please give him permission to let you know. It's a good way to do that. You get, you get him permission to let you know if it's not the place he wants or maybe something different like that. I think most of the time, if it's, if it's about him and you've heard him maybe say things like that in his will towards you, I think people are so centered on pleasing him and making sure they don't step out of what he wants. So they don't mess up their life. I don't think he'd let them mess their life up if maybe they did choose something differently, but, but telling him that certainly is going to help you stay focused. And for the people that, that are not seers and they don't see all the things in the spirit like you do. I mean, can they say, Lord, I think you're telling me to go here, but if I'm wrong, would you close the door before I absolutely ask you to do that. You absolutely could do that. It's a good idea. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. All right. Shonda, Shonda, I must be Shonda. How do you release the anointing when you're on a telephone call? How would you do it if they, if they call you and you want to release the anointing? I'm sure she's meeting on the other person on the other end. So yeah, I would just hold my phone and I would just say it, or I would do it before I call them or he knew that I was going to call their number. I would say I released this, the anointing into this phone call when they pick it up, it'll go right into them. Okay. Okay. All right. Jill, let's see. This is partially cut off. Let me make sure I can read the whole thing. Okay. Jill says, as a seer, when I'm in church, I often see huge angels that stand between the first front, front seats and rows in front of the podium where the pastor preaches. It is always in the same position no matter what church. The angel is so big that his head is outside the roof. I didn't, I didn't notice an angel where we were going to church now until the last couple of weeks. Can you speak of what you know about those angels? I guess she's wanted to know if, if that's identifiable or something you've seen? I've seen angels 2,000 feet high, probably even higher than that in heaven. So just to what every side imagine is there. And I don't know that typically it's certain, you know, a tribe of angels or something like that. I just know that they do have many different sizes of angels. Do you, this is never a question that has never been popped to my head, but if you've seen 2,000 foot angels and you've seen angels that are probably roughly your size. Yes. So are massively tall angels by definition massively more powerful? Is that what the big means or what would you say? Possibly, but maybe possibly not. It's just that God loved making different types of angels or the hosts and he practiced well at doing that. Okay. Cool. All right. Cheryl is asking this question. She goes, I've heard you speak about how our loved ones in heaven can go to a portal on special days for us and sing happy birthday. For example, is the reverse true? My husband went to heaven less than two years ago. Can I sing happy birthday to him on his special day and have him hear me singing it? I'm sure that you could. I know that I have sung different things like to my father, like on Father's Day or something like that. I know that sounds odd, but I do really love my dad and a great relationship with him. And yes, and I know for a fact that Father has said you can sing what you'd like to them and he'll make sure they hear it. Yeah. Now I've said, this is maybe years past, but I've, you know, before I heard that you maybe can speak directly in there. They hear it in the spirit realm or something. However, but I've said, Lord, would you give my dad this message to tell him like, and I've said, like one time I said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I don't even know that if that's appropriate thing because he's in bliss. Why would he need to hear that? But that's, that would be my question. What kind of things can you send as a messenger or ask God to set an angel and tell your dad, you know, can you say something like that? Tell him I forgive him. You mean on earth or in heaven? No, I'm saying, you know, he's in heaven now and you know that when he left, he left a mess like that was the case with my dad. And if I would have said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I mean, that was years past, but what do you think about that? You just say, no, no, don't go there because he's already happy. He doesn't need that. I think that I don't think I would mind you saying that and all of somebody. I think it would be all right to say that. Even though they wouldn't still have to hear it. Yeah, because they already, yeah, I hear you. It's not like his soul needs to be unburdened for what he did. So it's just words of love, I think. Yeah. Okay. Dolores is asking this, do regular common people from different generations mingle with one another? For example, would an auto executive that went to heaven in 2022 mingle with the poor widow from Elijah's days, would they have things of interest to talk to? I think anyone who you would meet there would have, there's almost everybody's going to have something that they would love to talk to about you to you or with you. And you would find it very fascinating. So people still love to have conversations. They like to reason together, talk together. They love to share things. I mean, that never stops happening. Not here on earth or in heaven. Well, and then is there the sense that throughout eternity or as long as you're on heaven, one day, it's everyone's going to be on new earth. But as long as you're in heaven, are people making new friends all the time? Or do they kind of establish their friendship thing and their friends hang? Oh, they make new friendships all the time, no matter where they go. They do. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, Tracy. Oh, this, this does occur to me to ask this question because you've talked because we said a minute ago about the portals in heaven. And you know, your loved ones can look down on special occasions. Can't with that being possible, could someone, this is probably a dorky question, but because someone say, hey, they should do her girlfriend from earth and now they're all both in heaven together. And he says, come on to the portal. I want to, it's my daughter's birthday. I want to say, I want to see them and come and see where my daughter, what my daughter's up to. Could they do something like that? Or is it only for personal family? You know what I mean? I think a lot is for family, but I think you could, there's people who would push doing anything or talking about anything to anybody if they could there. So yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of these questions are questions that you don't, it's not like you walk around knowing the answers to all these deep questions, but yeah. Yeah. Okay. Tracy's asking this, I'm a worship dancer. Can you elaborate a little more on what happens when we minister and dance? And this seems like it's a common question. People want to know when I do this on earth, what's it, what's happening? What is it accomplishing is, I think, is what she's saying. What happens when I dance? I mean, that could go a bunch of directions. What is the Lord doing? What's happening in the spirit realm? I mean, is, would you have any thoughts? Because you're a seer. Do you see people dance and then see things happening because of it? I see a lot of mostly music. Of course, I do see some dance. And sometimes you dance, you're not even on the floor, like in the throne room, they have a lot of dance and pageantry and stuff in there going on. It's absolutely beautiful. And of course, there's ways that you collect things as you dance. And then it's represented in some other way in heaven, like you create artwork or paintings by your dance. Even though it is with dance, not with your paintings, it's just something that's created as something to remember that about. Okay. And back for those that are dancing on earth, when you've seen people with the pageantry that God loves on the earth and they're waving their flags and they're dancing, does it affect the angels around them when they do that? Is something being triggered in a good way when they dance? And I think that's what she's trying to get at. Do angels respond? Does our blessings drop down that we don't see? What is the dance accomplished? Or is it just dance? I know dance is considered a high praise. It even says that it's in the Bible. And so yes, even some of the hosts are absolutely amazed and really love the warfare that takes place as a dancer. When you dance, like in the spirit about things, so that is definitely something that takes place. And all three of my daughters are dancers. They would have to be wore in dance in the spirit for people to be healed, for messages to be sent to be received. And so I would definitely know whether it's dance, whether it's music. A lot of things are created in the spirit. Okay, awesome. Sarah is asking this, are there, you've seen gemstones in heaven, and I think I've heard you talk about the crystal sea and stuff. She says, is there gemstone art in heaven that resembles stained glass? Have you seen? Absolutely, yes. A lot of people have those in their home there. Really? Especially if people were artisans in that. My grandfather made stained glass wonders. Okay. He's got some he's made in heaven. Wow, very cool. And I mean, you know, it makes me wonder, because you said that guy will put favorite pictures of yours that are on earth, or you'll show up at your mansion and there it's hanging. And I'm curious if God would do the same thing. Not that you would know the answer to this, but that if you if someone made stained glass on earth, they show up and God said, this is one that you made. I really, especially loved, I kept it. And here's it. That was that sound like something he might do just because that's who he is. I think he probably would. If people gave him any high gifts, he's going to love him anyway. Yeah. And even he has some favorite things that he likes, anything he may with life with colors, things like that. Whether you're young or not young, he loves people when they give him gifts. Cool. All right. Let me see. We're five minutes out here. We got time for a few more questions here. George is asking, when some people are dying, they reach out or call for their family members who have died before them. They act as though their family members are right there in the room with them. Do you know, do they really see their loved ones and do they come? I guess they're asking, do their loved ones come to help with their transition to heaven? Can you share about that? I mean, I have no idea. I think sometimes they do. I do know for a fact that some people have seen their family members, like maybe within a week of passing or something. I think it's something that God just does to encourage people. And so I just know that it does happen. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Rachel's saying, when we are reunited with our loved ones that are already in heaven, to them, will it feel like it's been a long time since they've seen this? Or will it only feel like seconds or days since they've seen us? I think it's just seconds. Really? Oh, yeah. They don't miss someone being gone 30 years or something like that. All they can think about is can't wait to see them again when they see them. And so for them, you've only been gone for a short time. Okay. Wow. Okay. And Andrew's asking, when and why were the host, Michael's army created, was it after Satan's treason, specifically to deal with him or was it actually before Satan's treason? In other words, you've made it very clear that the only reason there's an army is not to protect heaven. God doesn't need an army to protect heaven. So when do you know when the army was created? Was it after the fall of Satan? I think the army was been around a very long time. They even wondered why they were created one time. Really? To fight. Yeah, they were there for the enemy, for who became an enemy. So maybe they only understood what they were being trained up for when that fall happened. Yeah. They were taught war and they had to run maneuvers and do all kinds of stuff like that. Really? And that one was how loose for a fallen heaven. They knew who their enemy was. Interesting. All right. Here's another question about the Michael, the captain of the warrior angels. Is it Martha's asking, I believe the angel Michael is the captain of the warrior angels and Gabriel is the messenger angels. Are there other types of angels with specific purposes? I'm guessing there'd be lots of them with specific purposes. There are so many, I cannot number them. There's many, many, many, many. There's ones who are couriers, of course, the scribes, the Bible talks about them, helper angels that help all over heaven doing things like that. Of course, there are the hosts of heaven. There's ones who serve in different places and who keep the treasures shined up and all kinds of things like that. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It makes sense that he might even have thousands of different kinds of angels, right? For categories that we've never even thought about. So, yeah. Man, just that's right. Me, A, N, G, S. Does God really cast out your sins into the sea of forgetfulness? If you brought up your past, would he not know of it? I think most of the time he wouldn't because he does cast it there and he's not going to think about it. I tell people, stop reminding him of your sins. He won't know what you're talking about if you've repented. Yeah, boy. I could have used that understanding years ago when I kept repending over and over and over and over to make sure I got it right. He's probably saying, would you stop repending? Okay. Jamelia, lots of interesting names today. Jamelia, have you seen inside of the courtrooms in heaven? What's happening in there? What do they look like? Do they look like a courtroom on earth? The judge sits on the bench up there high and then there's a defense in both sides? I have absolutely been to the courtroom in heaven. Actually, there's more than one. I guess outside, not outside of heaven, but in the atmosphere of heaven, it's invisible. I know this sounds crazy. You can actually see to it. You can see that it's there. Then of course, it's a courtroom that's actually in heaven. Yes, I've seen both. Like anything else, God sits as judge. Jesus is our lawyer and Satan gets hauled up there about different things sometimes. Other things get harder, but justice does take place in those courtrooms. So it does look like a courtroom as we would know it. Well, they have one that looks very supernatural. They do have one that looks like what you would call a courtroom, maybe not exactly like that. So they're both different than I've seen. Okay. All right. Here's the last question here. Natalie is asking, what is your favorite thing about Jesus that you would like to describe? What's your favorite thing about? Of course, you'd have thousands of things, but what stands out to you? I think his eyes. I think his eyes are so amazing. I never get tired of whenever I'm around him. I always want to look at his eyes. They're beautiful, very beautiful. But he also does have a, I almost want to say a cynic sense of humor. I mean, he was very bold about the things he said on the earth to those who were not doing right. Like one of my favorite ones is, are you you're a white and sepulchral school of dead men's bones? Yeah. You thought of the religious hierarchy. I think both of those probably, those two things are probably my very favorite thing about it. And he holds both of those at the same time. He, you know, he's got that serious side and then the clever fun side. Yeah. So good. So good. Well, Kat, that's our time. We need to let you get to your moving and rest in between and all of that. So I appreciate it very much. We'll spend more time the next time talking about revealing heaven.com, but we're going to revealing the heaven.com to see her, to get her books and all that. And there it is. Katcur.com is where you can support her. The only place you can support her is online because she doesn't ask for money in any other way. A lot of people keep trying to pretend to be her. So all right. Thanks so much, Kat. Tomorrow, everybody is Robin Bullock. We're looking very much forward to that. When you see Robin Bullock, he almost, I think he always has that pin that you created. It says, I don't do demons. He wears that on his coat and everywhere he goes. So it's a, so that that'll be him right there after people see this. Yeah. Thank you very much. We love you. Bless you. Have a good time with your staffs. We'll see you again soon. Okay. See you later then. Bye.

Happy, I started to say Tuesday because we're recording this on Tuesday. Happy Wednesday for those of you watching this live for you. It is Wednesday, February 8. We're recording this at 3.20 in the afternoon on February 7 to get the sense we're recording Cat. Sometimes her schedule works better for us to record in the afternoon before. Most of the time these days that helps it work out better for everyone. So all right, well, welcome to the broadcast and a quick reminder that we tomorrow's for you tomorrow Thursday is Mel Kay. We haven't had her on for a while and she's going to give us an update on what's going on out there. So I love her very much. She's a great patriot in the patriot movement. She's that all the reawakened American thing. She's an absolute God of fear and she loves us and we love her. So that is Thursday tomorrow for you. We'll ask you some of the latest updates. So we're going to bring in Cat here in just a moment, but before we do that, here's a quick reminder about the wells we're digging. Thank you. I love that music, I like the beat to it too, and plus the whole Irish feeling of it, it's a great, here's a big word juxtaposition with the music and you're seeing the, I don't know whether it's called the bush or whatever you call it in the villages of Uganda, very primitive, poverty-stricken by any standard that we have, and they may not consider themselves poverty-stricken at all, I don't know how that is, and I'll have to learn more about that one day, but they sure need the water, they surely need the water, so we thank you for your help on that. Alright, time to watch for Kat and Steve on Wednesday, so here we go with Kat. Well good afternoon, I guess it is afternoon, it's actually like, we're taping this, so it's like 6.20 in the evening, your time isn't it? I think so. Yeah, you'll have to ask Jen that, I never know what time it is. You went to bed, you went to bed at, usually you go to bed at 6, right, because you're up all night, are you still up all night? I haven't been up since 4am. Oh, you've been up since 4, that's really unlike you, you don't get up that early. Not really, I'm really involved in doing something, you know, than I am. Well good to see you, well we've got some questions, oh I forgot to check with you before the program, if there's anything you had to share before we got into questions. I think Robin shared so much the other day, probably not except that we are still busy moving and we're very excited about it, but I really wanted to give the time since I didn't have a whole hour today to let people ask questions. Okay, alright, the first one is going to come from me, in fact we were talking about that. I won't bless the people though, let me go ahead and blow it up. Okay, are we on? Okay, yeah, so this is from me and so our staff was talking about prayer in one of them, so why don't you ask Kat what it's like for you. I think we asked you one time, in this big recollection we said, what's prayer like for you and I think you said, in the recesses of my memory here, something about yours was more about decrees, but don't let me put words in it, what is prayer like for you? Yeah, well there's many different types of things you can call prayer or that is called prayer even in heaven. Ruling is something, ruling is what's in the spirit realm, it's you taking authority and dominion and by the things that you either say that God is doing because He's told you or things that you have wanted yourself to release into the spirit realm to make a difference in people's lives. The other thing is called declaring and decreeing which a lot of people I've heard, you know what you dare to declare and decree shall be established unto you, that is my number one way I pray because I'm trying to establish usually something very specific, something God had asked me to take authority over, something He's asked me to make decrees about and so that is my favorite way to pray. And I still, another thing is talking to God, just having a language with Him is also partly prayer and I know God had said, you know, you pray all the time because you talk to me all the time, that's what He says to me, that's what the Bible says to me. Oh really? Yeah. He said, you pray all the time because you talk to me all the time, that's really instructive right there. Yes, it is and we should all have that much time and attention to give to Him but absolutely declaring and decreeing is the number one way I pray. Taking authority, taking great authority, having spent time with the Father or the Son, discussing things that they have going on on the earth right now, what is about to happen on the earth, things like that and then He'll say go make decrees over that and so that's what they do, I do a lot of that. Also for family members, I'll declare and decree over their lives things that they need either from heaven or that they're involved in working on this earth, you know, for the Father. I wanted to ask you a question about, you know, there's a scripture that says resist the devil, it's right in there, agree with God and there was that phrase, agree with God, there's so many things we could agree with God and I had something happen to me the other day and I'll give you an example, it's like I'm praying for this person that's in need so I said Lord, and this is not the exact one but it's kind of close to Lord and I know He's like your beloved Son, this one I'm praying that I have in my heart and I know you and Him are friends and I agree with you that you would never, ever cause harm to Him and I know you and I agree on this and I know that if anyone feels empathy for what he's going through, it would be you and I just want you to know I agree with you and that was kind of like a non-prayer prayer because I was explaining the need, He knew the need I was talking about but I was explaining it in agreement, what are your thoughts about something like that? I think for sure that would be a conversation, you know, God does take the time to even meet even myself about things that people are going through and things to let them know that I care about, He cares about, things like that so there are other types of conversation that you wouldn't necessarily specifically call prayer and I think that's because we show that we love people, we really care about people and our empathy goes along with them and whatever they're going through and the Father absolutely adores and loves people who, you know, it's not His plan to put us through things no matter what it looks like sometimes especially these last couple years that He is delighted to see the heart of people that care and I think it's so important for us to have kindness and care about people, you know, sometimes we get so caught up in our own world or our own life, we forget sometimes there are others out there who do need a kind word, an encouraging word, maybe a letter written to them or something letting them know someone is here with you, we've got your back, you know, we care about you so certainly there's all different kinds of conversation you could have in any way that some people may say well I didn't even think of that as prayer but anytime we love people it's going to touch the heart of the Father. Wow, yeah, you know our old school thinking for lack of a better description our old school thinking would be they would say and there's nothing wrong with this but they'd say what did you do in your quiet time or did you have your quiet time because if you don't put in time and I understand that very much but it kind of came off as a legalistic thing from time to time if someone would say did you have your quiet time it's a little bit freeing to me to have you say even if you're showing kindness even if you're talking to the Lord I was trying to figure out who, remind, be reminded who was this famous person of prayer that said I have hardly ever prayed for more than five minutes maybe he said fifteen minutes I don't know it's fine it was like either five or fifteen so I'll say five I've never prayed longer than five minutes but I've never gotten more than five minutes without praying it was something like that it was probably fifteen can let me ask you so some people have been taught now there's the scripture this is you know we're supposed to give him our our petitions with thanksgiving let your let your petitions or prayers be known to God in the in the prayer of thanksgiving all that so are there people who do who you would say get too much into petition and not enough in other things what would you say how would you exhort someone to pray I like do some people say Lord I need this and Lord help me with that or help my family is it too much is too much petition I think it depends on the person himself I guess most people would would would some people just gonna ask for I guess whatever they're having issues with or whatever they're thinking about or wondering if something will work some people can't kind of not sure about making up their minds I think and so sometimes they may ask more than other people would but I just I love people who declare declare and decree us that you really are serious about getting something done for God and making sure that petitions petitions are being heard maybe not even just your petitions it might be others petitions you know they're going to something like we were kind of just talking about a minute ago I don't think God ever gets tired of hearing anybody's petitions at all if you ask me personally I don't think you know I totally was asking that so I so yeah I totally was so if that if that if too much is you're not worried about too many petitions then oh no I don't think so no no no sometimes you wish people would ask more well that's true too doesn't he says you have not because you ask not your life be that side of that okay so all right well I'm gonna ask you a question from Benny age 12 so he says are the skill levels of all people the same in heaven like are they all the same strong they're just as strong they're just as fast speed he seems to be asking about athletic by the question he mentioned strength and speed is everybody the same or some stronger and some faster I don't think everybody is the same at all I think everybody is still at different levels you know if you pursue something of course you're gonna know more than someone who never had before you do have the ability to learn new skills all the time in heaven or improve the skills that you have in heaven but no I don't think everybody is at the same level that's good to hear yeah in fact that the way you answer boring to say why bother to go to something if everybody is the same right well that's true oh I lost I was gonna ask a follow-up but I lost it okay Jack age nine okay he he wants to know can I transform into things in heaven like an animal or a character he wants to know if he can transform it I assume this is like when they're playing around or something there are places in heaven they can go that is for a play area that yes you can actually change you can be smaller can be larger I think that you can become a cartoon in certain areas and then you play out cartoons with your friends you actually are in the cartoon so he's absolutely right and I you said in certain places are there because it sounds like a what would be a term it sounds like a fun zone or a fun village or or something there are places that usually in the amusement park there's a lot of things going on similar to that they have all kinds of things that you can do you can travel different ways like in bubbles you can go up to different places where is it the play places in the sky I know it sounds crazy but it's heaven yeah yeah it's very different and when you go there you expect some of those things to happen well I gotta ask you when a lady wrote to me I didn't respond to her today because I didn't know how to respond because I don't have an answer for everybody's question but she wrote she's very nice about it but she says but I'm quite certain there's no cotton candy in heaven so apparently she heard that you had said there was cotton candy in heaven and I might my thing would have been if I'd written there what what would prevent God from giving a delicious cotton candy that would be nothing yeah so I'm talking to people about the funness the giddiness the laughter the hilarity of God because we got the holy thing we've been taught I don't know we don't have it down but we've been taught the holy side we have not been taught the fun side I mean what would you like to tell people to say there for the first time I would say the same thing that the father said to me if he didn't make fun places in heaven he'd be in trouble with all those kids coming home I mean that's a perfect like a little child the Bible is clear about that you come with the heart of a child because you're going to have adventures you're going to have fun and the father wants you to have that why wouldn't he he is your father so of course he planned different things to do even adventures for you to do things to learn different places to go to learn them you can visit rodeos you already know about the amusement park there's so many places in heaven you go even beautiful places out outside parks all kinds of things dinosaur park you know people get up get off on that but you know you're not God and I can tell you when he is a father a loving father he's going to give everything he can do bless his children and that's why he's he wants you to expect it yes why what do you think if you do with all these millions of children coming home to heaven that's really really good and you know the the the thing about it is not only millions maybe there's even billions because from the beginning of time billions well because from the beginning of time children have been have lost their lives when they were little you know I have never asked you this question but I want to ask you this question there were people that perished in the flood and some among those cats surely there would have been children throughout whatever the earth was in those days when when those children perish in the flood and they were almost babies or very very young children do you expect to see those children in heaven one day of course I do absolutely I would they were innocent children why would they not go to heaven the father's been adamant about that from the from the very beginning he would talk to me about that I expected all children to go to heaven yeah they didn't do anything wrong right they do have an opportunity to receive Christ in heaven if they want to and they'll actually come to his throne and bring him flowers and say they receive him they don't necessarily have to do that to be in heaven but they want to do it well it wouldn't that almost by default if they went to heaven wouldn't they I can't imagine someone saying as a child no I don't want to receive Christ right anybody they love him they so fall in love yeah so I think it's such a blessing for the father to allow them to do that so they do have they have a big event where they're invited to sit on usually on the throne of the father and then Jesus will come and he will present himself there and Jesus and he will ask Jesus to be received as his savior okay good good good good okay say that we've got three children's questions today say love my granddaughter my granddaughter's name is say that but that's what he said they may say pronounce a seal that but say that or see the age eight is asking cat are there singing squirrels and talking flowers in heaven that she's eight years old she wants another singing squirrels and talking flowers I have seen both while I was in heaven so I can adamantly tell you absolutely yes the flowers have faces yes they sing home meadows sing sometimes and yes squirrels do not just squirrels most of the creatures are most of the what you would call an animal especially all your pets they all talk they talk and then there is some there's a whole group of squirrels that I know and I don't know why and I haven't laughed out for the so many times I don't care people love it there are a group of squirrels that actually are called greeters GR TERS and when someone comes home to heaven they will actually go in this group and they will actually sing and dance for the people welcoming them to heaven I can imagine some maybe some older type stuffy person and here they are opening the door and here's this group of squirrels ready to sing and dance they have to stop having pain I'm not kidding the Holy Spirit does does make sure it all happens and so if there's something you don't like you'll change when you get there that's you know that's actually the mouthful right there and he said because I know but you know what because when I if you had the further okay I'm 67 for the first 50 years of my life I could never have received most of that that you're saying because I would have I don't know what I would have thought would be wrong with that I was just taught that heaven is holy and we're going to worship him and no I would have said no we're probably not going to just sit on the cloud but I didn't have a replacement for that activity I just didn't believe it I had someone wrote I saw it written and someone said there won't be the reason we know that there won't be this is a kind of a quote the reason we know there won't be amusement parks and heaven that there are none is because the elements it's because that's on earth and the elements on the earth will be burned up with fervent heat so therefore we know amusement parks won't be in heaven they were there first before the earth was even made about time or what's going on earth are you kidding it's on the earth because it is in heaven see I want you to say that because I knew that was your answer because I've come to learn that and it makes sense it's logical you know everything about the river of life well we're on the earth so why did they burn I mean the thing about is when I saw that I thought well that would mean if you followed that logic then that would mean since we have mansions on the earth and that earth is going to burn up there can be no mansions in heaven and since we have roads on the earth to drive vehicles there can be no roads or vehicles of any kind in heaven and you pretty soon you you have God with his hands up say what can I do you you've made all these things illegal for me to have in heaven it's kind of crazy all right well that's good news cat I'm glad you're here to bring the good news all right I like this question K I don't know how old but she says does God have any particular reason reason when he sends twins triplets or whatever to be born does he have a reason I'm not quite sure what she means I don't know that he has a reason other than he just he loves seeing all three of them I guess or both of them or whatever but I don't know of any certain reason that he would send since he sends those from heaven and he tells them this is your assignment which we you know we don't know now but he he gives an assignment if he's gonna send triplets he would probably does this make sense he would probably get these three children together and say you're gonna be triplets in about a minute from now what does he he tells them about their life is going to be and then he sends them or what I think there's a whole lot of stuff that goes on with all that there are times sometimes he'll actually mention it to people before they before they're born you know while they're still living in him in him he'll let them know the their purpose even he'll let them know sometimes who he's chosen for them all kinds of things go on so they'll be really hard to say but he does share with them most of the time not necessarily whenever when they'll be born but that they will be born together as a family sometimes he does do that okay all right now Matt is asking this this is it sounds like my kind of questions I would be asking you says do people look back on their earthly life fondly from heaven so they've gone to heaven do they look back and think of you know I you could say not like the good old days because they're in the good old days now in heaven but do they look back and say remember when we did this to their friend remember when we went to the creek and we all went so visit that kind of fond memories from heaven I think sometimes that they can kind of remember being with certain people maybe not younger maybe a little older they do I think depending on how close also that you got to the Lord he himself may actually show you oh really oh yeah yeah he'll show you he's shown me different people he's shown me different people that I knew before I came to the earth and I've seen myself sitting in his hand quite a few times explaining to me some of the things I would be doing of course I didn't remember them until much later on so sometimes he does do that but it really depends on the relationship you pursue with him especially the Lord that he will share things with you from your past past meaning before time yeah okay BT BT before time BT BT alright here is okay I don't know how specifically the answer you'd answer this but I'll throw you the question Sarah is asking in light of all the exposures coming from those caught up in sex trafficking how do we pray for all the victims being delivered in this horrendous experience so I don't know how would you tell them to pray for the victims that are being delivered is that that's what their question is well there is something they can do if they knew about it and that was the losing of their soul oh you can you can because God has not disordained it that way but he created that way and it was a soul checkup it's all about your soul the keys to the kingdom which you bind others will be bound in heaven which you loose and it will be loose in heaven meaning if let's say it was a horrible encounter like we're talking about something like that and then someone they met who was adapted being a soul doctor they could share with them if they lose those things and named him by name and then they lose them out of their soul and Jesus name Jesus will come and take them like they were never there and I teach that actually haven't done it well but I actually would teach that to different leaders of different groups that want to do that especially for young people who are rescued from drugs and those things like that and they cried it they were so rejoiced because they said it would take them a year to work with a group or a person and in this way in three minutes they have loose everything in their soul that ever was there that the devil put there and I you know let's camp there for a minute we've got about ten minutes left here but let's see we're going to keep it to 40 minutes or so today so someone is rescued and if you could see their soul and I don't know as a seer if you can see that cap but but let's say that you just know okay so you see their soul and let's say it's full what do you see because that was one of the questions what do you see first of all it depends on which person or type of person you're talking about I see all kinds of things I can see people who have gone to suffering I can see people who have been abused if someone is abused they'll have like you know you've heard people say we're gonna tie the knot these are all about relationships this is not like the twisted rope hanging out of you somewhere I'm not saying that this sort of right you knew that they had some kind of negative relationship in their life somewhere because that's what I see therefore I know they need healing for that and in the past I would just pray and declare over them now I actually will go up to them and talk to them and I'll teach them how they can be free from that in Jesus name the God never intended you to go through those things that was not his purpose there's a devil in this world I hate everybody and whatever you can steal from your destiny the point of the devil to mess with people in that is he wants to steal their destiny and that's one of the ways that he does it is by the abuse no matter what kind of abuse that is that they have to go through but I remember the the time that the father showed up and showed up in my room he said I'm going to show you and he said I will show you he said after I show you this people will know how in minutes to lose everything out of their soul and they'll never suffer from it again wow this will help every single believer accelerate their life into victory because I don't have someone you have three months three years ten years trying to get healed from stuff that was done to them wrongfully he said if they follow these instructions it's simply the keys to the kingdom which everybody doesn't always understand none of those different ways people can use those keys to the kingdom he said but I'm talking about what you lose on earth you lose from heaven you lose from heaven so what you lose from your soul that was done to you on earth that was wrong heaven will come and lose it from your soul completely and it will be like it never existed if you want to bind the things of god and then we were growing up we were always hot to bind the devil yeah are you uh there's something much better than binding that it's binding the love of god the life of god the plans of god the will of god his joy his celebration his expectation you can choose with your will to bind those things to your soul and no one can ever take them away from you and you will feel completely different so these are things taught to me by the father and I remember it was out it was ours earth time because I remember glancing at my clock and then he took me and he would be taking me back and forth showing me things on the earth and showing me how people got healed it was really uh quite a drawn-up process and I have helped so many people and we actually help people become soul doctors that's what god calls me a soul doctor I heard you use that a minute ago I hadn't heard that term before but in other words it it would be like you don't have to become a licensed uh professional counselor you can become a soul doctor you're right practice what god says took me into the future and I saw down the hallways of businesses athletic places um it didn't matter where it was churches churches and I would see a doorway that said soul doctrine it had a little sign up outside and people would go in the air to get like sort of like counseling or healing or being made whole when they're sold it was quite fascinating so yes there are things that you can do to help one another how to be free from all that garbage and I mean the list was like so long and it didn't matter what it was that the people had wanted to lose from their soul if they were involved in it if their family was involved in it if situations that happened to them every one of those could be lose from your soul drugs you know all kinds of all kinds of things you would choose to lose them from your soul can use uh I felt to ask you this while you were talking because you were talking about a person could lose it from their own soul by by doing what you've taught them to do so this is what this is kind of the yucky question so there's women watching right now who have been raped and they never got delivered from the trauma of that rape or the or the horrible memories of it men too because a man can be raped because he has a child okay how would you walk a woman right through what would she say right now in her prayer time how would she use her words to to be her own soul doctor if I could put that right I would just say to her that God actually I think even better than that is I should tell you a real situation that happened okay okay um one of the first times I ever got to use that I had just been with a father maybe weeks later I was in New Jersey I was invited by a pastor and his wife and her two sons and he went in the grocery store to get some things from my room your snacks and stuff and she said I've got it you were sent here for me this is a real story you were sent here for me and I know in the next couple minutes you can help me be free because I knew that the Lord would help me get free she said I have been been through some of the worst torments of um violence violent torments night and day before I was married three times and and to the wrong same person not the same person same kind of person and she said I can't stand it anymore I thought God I've got to be free of this I don't want the nightmares I don't want the torments my kids were present with some of these happened and so they've gone through these same things what can we do to be free right now and in three minutes I told her do you know what the word says about binding and losing she said well binding and losing you know you mean yes I said yes that what you choose to lose from your soul that was done to you will be loosed from heaven itself heaven will come down pull it out of your soul completely and it will be like you never experienced it before she said show me right now my husband's still in there show me now right now and so I let her through it you know um and she she gave her name she said uh father in Jesus name I'm choosing to lose from my soul all the violent activities the violent things I've been that I was hurt with that I had to stand and see that my kids had to stand and see I'm fed up with it I'm tired of the devil abusing me and I'm not going through this life anymore so I choose with my own will to lose it in Jesus name right now forever and ever amen and then this light came on her face really I have never ever seen and this light came I mean I was overwhelmed I mean I knew it would work she sat there and she started crying a laugh and she goes she said some minute she goes it's gone I mean it's gone I mean in three minutes it's gone it's literally gone it's like I never had it before I I can't even remember some of the actions she goes I I've got to do this with my two boys before you even go back can you please do the same thing with them they were like the like 10 and uh 15 something like that or 17 something like that I said of course of course she said all I can do is laugh now before I couldn't even stand to think about going to bed at night her husband knows that was sort of goes what's wrong she goes I'm the happiest person in the world wow she worked and so yeah the third night she brought them and I led them to the same thing and I saw her 10 years later she said do you know what that stuff has never come back you're still filled with joy because after that I taught her how to bind the joy the Lord God's love his his his presence you know his purposes for your life his celebration and she said we're still filled with that stuff she said I am so grateful and you should I've helped so many people through that out of their life it is really really that's and they have lose they have people have lose some drug addiction alcohol all kinds of things some things they're like even witchcraft they have lose that from their soul and and because they were repentant first and then they lose it from the soul so I have to say one of the great and the father said this may be one of the greatest things I ever show you and he was right so he calls me soul doctor all the time I love that term too I this first time I heard you use it but wow that's so powerful yeah I mean his body can people can be sick in their body and still be happy if you're sick in your soul you have no life at all wow this may be the most this is the most important thing we did today and we've even like kids we've let kids do that too that have been abused but the teenager place in Orlando that camp that they have to go to for a year they have me come down and I taught every single one of the leaders and the teachers how to do that and he said they'd never been the same again and now instead of having all those weeks and months to trust the person who used to be with that person it takes a few minutes and they're free wow wow cat that is simply amazing and I've heard you talk on this a lot this was especially poignant if I guess you know uh because people you know I've heard it and I I've done lots and lots and lots of self you know losing yeah I feel like I got it at a new level today of understanding even though I heard these words before I feel like it went even deeper this time so personally I think I've received benefit from this but I know that people watching this is very important I'm sure there will be many many many people Steve they will never be the same again after this broadcast we are going to print mini booklets we actually are going to print mini booklets m-i-n-i mini booklets that people can order in bunches and stuff like that they can even hand out to people and then eventually we'll probably print a book and give the whole story about how the father came how he taught me all the places he took me and my daughter finally came to the door I think it had been almost four hours I had locked myself in my room my older daughter and she goes mom can I please come in I went I've just been with the father she goes can I please come in come down my bed and I showed she was the first one I told her all about that and she she now of course she's married she's got kids and she helps people by being a soul doctor wow amazing cat wow cat thank you so much very very very important broadcast today so good so good okay uh while you have it here uh let's point out revealing heaven.com is on the screen uh people can buy your books there and other materials right yes but I want to share one more thing the Holy Spirit oh please oh go for it yes one more story okay that my one sister who has had a wildlife I'm telling you she was um my one sister not Jen one of my other sisters you know I have like seven and one of them had gone through a lot of stuff in her life and she was younger she was kidnapped she was found back she went through all kinds of things and then God God got so ahold of her and uh she's a smart person she tells me if you know anything or think of anything or God wants me to have something you call me grow up and make sure I get it and so uh she called me one time and I think this is one of the times when she was going through stuff she goes I've I've had someone call me on the phone wanting to commit suicide because the rotten boyfriend that's what she called him broke up with her and ditched her and she said she was so heartbroken she couldn't stand to live and her her friend was right her friend was not a Christian this is a while uh and I and I said so what is she goes I've heard you talk about a soul doctor before would you mind if I call my friend to get her on the phone and you lead her through that because I don't want to see her take her life and I said you know I well so she did I told her about Jesus Christ and she said she knew that she had knew who the Lord was I said did you know he can make you completely whole so you don't need your boyfriend you don't really need that person if somebody loved you they wouldn't have dumped you ditched you and used you like that and she said I'm willing because if I don't do something I'm I'm not gonna live and so I told her about the love of God his sacrifice you know the full story of it and so she received crisis or savior and then she lose that guy out of her soul by name never to run after him again never to be heartbroken again and the Lord came and took that whole grief suicidal thoughts out of out of her mind and she never committed suicide wow amazing wow wow I didn't know it's gonna be this good and this important okay I was starting to mention revealing heaven.com so please go to there to see what materials in the books that cat has talk without folks about what's that cat cur.com but cat cur.com is what I think the
