This is the end of this video. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. Happy Wednesday, August 17, 2022. Welcome to the broadcast. It's going to be a great show today. We have Kat Kerr as always. It's going to be right an hour show starting now. She's got some other things she needs to do. This is the day before Eric Trump comes. So Eric Trump will be here tomorrow. Do not miss this. Be sure and text your friends. Call your friends and let them know. We've got some great questions for Eric. It's going to be great. Oh, by the way, yes. Thank you, Julie. It is 8 a.m. tomorrow. I would have forgotten that. It's 8 a.m. Pacific time. If you're on the East Coast, it will be 11. It's 8 a.m. in the morning. That's when we could get him. We're happy to do that. We did that one other time with General Flynn. It is 8 o'clock in the morning Pacific time. So there you have it. I'm just making sure I'm not missing any notes here. Before we bring Kat on, let's bring Mike and Lori Sally on. Let's talk about the wells. They are spearheading the whole thing, the whole project. I can't wait to hear all about it. So Mike and Lori Sally, take it away. Yeah, go ahead, Lori. We are so excited to update you specifically about the water wells in Uganda. I think one of your shows you shared about that we had had 300 salvations. Well, now it's up to over 800 people who have given their lives to Jesus because of these water wells. I was just in shock. Who knew that Jesus, we know he can turn water into wine, but who knew he was going to make these water wells and share the gospel in such an impactful way. People just be... I had always hoped that maybe a person or two would come to Jesus because of this, but I had no idea that this would be an evangelism tool where hundreds and hundreds, and we just think we're just getting started. We're just getting started. We're now doing a well a week. Every week, one well. So, wow. So we're up to 47 new wells that Elijah Streams has provided. 47. I was looking at the big organization that does work in Uganda and all of last year and then all they do is water. All they do. And they did 42 water projects, not even wells in the entire year. Really? Yeah. It's incredible the pace and the excitement of the people and I was surprised as well as how many people are coming to know Jesus because of this. It's crazy. It's not normal, actually. It's something God's doing. The anointing is all over this project and just the investment that people are making. It's incredible. I wanted to share one of the stories. So I was asking my team, like, tell me what does it look like? I mean, how is this happening? How are they sharing the gospel? Because, normally, I mean, pastors are out there sharing all the time and in this one particular area, so Elijah Streams, we are drilling wells in different parts of Uganda, not all in the same exact spot. So it's in different areas. One area that is really, really dry, it's a drought area and so it's kind of like the forgotten people. It's drought. They don't have a lot of government assistance. They don't have many organizations that are coming there to help and so what they've been doing is as the water company is coming out with their equipment, they're renting a speaker and hooking it up to a car and they're driving through the village and they're kind of announcing, hey, we want you to know what Jesus is doing. There's people that love Jesus, that are responding to him and they care about you and he cares about you and they want you to know about him and so then they start sharing the gospel and then right behind them, not very far, there's these huge, massive trucks that have these huge drilling implements and things and my team is telling me that not only are the water wells an amazing thing, but the fact that we're using this equipment, the technology that we're using to drill these wells is abnormal for them because normally when people come and drill a well, they do it by hand and we're thankful for those that are able to do that, but it's not as efficient because you can't go as deep, it's actually dangerous to do it like that, but people are in awe and imagine if it's not every day you see massive trucks coming in, you know, whenever they're in these villages, when strangers come, everybody stops what they're doing and they run and they want to know what's going on so they're using that first introduction of here's why we're doing this and then they're watching the process the entire time and then when they hit water, then when they hit water, they do a big commissioning and they gather everybody together and that's when their hearts are touched and they were telling me this story about this one woman, she's 71 years old and to me when I hear 71, that doesn't seem that old because I'm, you know, I'm in my 50s so 70 doesn't seem like it's that old but in Uganda that is old the life expectancy isn't that long, we know Jesus can do it 120 years more than that, but 71 she's considered an elder in her community and my team is telling me that she has zero faith, normally in Uganda you find people that are either, they adopt something, whether they're really born again or not and they say born again, we say Christians in the states but they always say born again and that means you're really born again she didn't believe in anything or she didn't really ascribe to any particular thing, she must have believed in a higher being because she testified that she used to say to whatever higher being she was talking to if somebody would come and solve this water crisis because I've been suffering, my parents were suffering my children are suffering, now my grandchildren are suffering and then whenever we came in and drilled this water and she saw the water coming she just started yelling God is alive, God is alive God is alive that's amazing she was so excited she truly was like the woman at the well because she then gave her life to Jesus people followed suit, they followed her, they thought if she believes in Jesus, I want the same Jesus and it was remarkable so Steve, over 800 people I can't I mean I do but it's like I mean I thought maybe a person or two would come to the Lord because of these wells, I had, I never saw this coming, not even close and we're just getting started one well a week it'll probably increase unless you run out of land to drill wells I don't think we'll run out of land there's a lot of people who contact us all the time really? oh yeah, all the time tell me about that for a minute do other people call and say bring a well here or what? I get emails every week from people that hear about what's going on with Elijah's streams and how we're providing this water can you do one for me here's somebody I know in this village that needs help here's a school that needs help I don't think we've gotten close to tapping out the potential yet and so it's pretty exciting just let those that are watching know it's not as easy as just people contacting and saying hey I need a water well here because we're trying to work with reputable well drillers that we can make sure that we're going to go deep enough and the water is going to be sustainable because you hear stories of water wells that were drilled by different organizations and maybe they're drilling it and go deep enough and then it ends up running dry and that's what we don't want that to happen so we're trying to do it through relations I know you brought a video your daughter Caitlin made this video so let's watch that video about it's kind of the latest I laughed because he said we're emptying hell and we're populating hell but you can populate but we understand what he means he said we're doing damage big time to hell I mean we are literally coming against hell so let's watch that video this year 2022 the recharge plants have been started so your denerasty is not only providing clean water but is emptying hell and populating heaven by souls coming to the kingdom and we talk about your Elijah's things so everyone prays for you and God bless you so very much Mike and Lorde Salle this is amazing before the launch of this power hall Moscow has been preached and about 15 people have accepted in Christ as Lord and Savior and even land has been donated to start a church in this place this is a testimony this is amazing these are 15 souls they have come to the kingdom of God today because of the donation of the power hall thank you very much it's so exciting he's like a kid isn't he well I'm like a kid you know I'm sitting here you guys are the same thing look what's going on I mean I can't believe it I do believe it but we are above and beyond anything I think any of us expected to happen wait to see what God is doing for sure well thank you both for coming I see Kat is now here so blessings to you both I appreciate it Mike and Lorde you're working with us very strongly to look into water situations that we will be talking about very very soon here in the states you are here and we're looking at a lot of different things related to the water so we'll be reporting that and a lot of people don't know we're helping a lot of other people even not related to the water but everyone who sows into this ministry receives a reward from him I mean without you know he says even if you give so much as a cup of cold water to one of these you will not lose your reward can you imagine the rewards God's passing out in heaven and on earth thank you to all of our viewers we appreciate it very much so thank you Mike and Lorde we'll see you soon and we'll bring on Kat bless you guys okay so without further ado let's do Wednesdays with Kat and Steve music and there she is hey Kat how are you I'm great thank you so good to have you back I got my Disneyland tie on and tell people why it's okay to still love Disneyland even though we hear some of these bad things you know I always look at the roots of something or the foundation of something and well we can even look at the throne of God Satan has taken many things that are actually some of the father's images the way he operates and he is on the earth polluted them and made them not good but that doesn't mean it's okay to partake of Satan stuff I'm just making an example Walt Disney was put on the earth by God at the time he was put on here and he was put here to create fun in family entertainment that's why people think well he doesn't care about entertainment well they have it in heaven people movies in heaven is all kinds of roller coasters because God knows we need fun and heaven I say is a good bit fun it is holy is pure there's nothing defiling there's no profanity there's no wickedness anywhere in heaven not in anything to create or make there but Walt had this passion in his heart to make a place that families could come and bring their children because even in those days there was a lot of craziness going on in the 60s and things weren't turning in the best direction in that time and so many things were going on that were not good he was determined and he really fought hard well in Orlando especially to get the land for Disney World but the reason he created that in those characters was so we could have something to laugh at and have fun and he is not happy himself right now with stuff that's going on but it is going to change and the father has adamantly told me it's going to change so a lot of maybe people might end up being removed and have this replaced there because I know when Walt was on the earth he was adamant about keeping it at a level that what was produced and the content that was produced not just at that time but for years to come could be enjoyed by family, by children and know that they were going to see something safe and when Disney World was open I actually went to the park here in Florida the first year they were open it was so many masses of people were coming to enjoy and talking about Disney I always appreciated was he always showed in his movies or any of the other things he created you knew the difference between good and evil and every time good would be the victor in the movies and any of the sets he made and he made sure that you knew that this was evil and it was dark and it was not good and yet this was filled with life and light and so I loved it the heroes always saved the day and it overcame every evil obstacle or thing that was in any of the movies or things he produced and so I always appreciated that with Walt and if he was here today that's exactly what would still be happening instead of compromise and darkness invading parts of that there are going to be some covert activities going on in there and no one's going to know anything about it except God himself but things are about to start changing in Disneyland and in Disney World and I don't know if that means something might close for a while or things are being changed or things there's going to be so many things accelerated in these days where darkness is going to be pushed back and that doesn't mean it might close completely but what it'll mean is darkness will be pushed out of places and out of entertainment especially and those who make wicked movies will bomb and they'll lose their shirt if they keep doing it when this whole thing shifts so I do appreciate Walt and all that he created for families if you ever go to either one of those places you can see his own personal comments on the walls in the place and he was so appreciated the people who helped to build the place and the ones who work there now his own comments about how he feels about them he appreciates all of their efforts to help everyone have the time to make it safe and he called them a team he never took direct credit for everything he always gave credit to everyone who was a part of what he did which I also admired in him that he considered everybody involved and he wasn't just the only one that was doing anything and then of course we know there's other people involved in that place now that is not Walt's plans or his ideas some of them that are being put out there now and even in the new things that are being made there's a whole entire different content in it that most believers or even good moral people would not appreciate but just wait and see that will also change I'm glad you see your Donald Duck it's such a special place they opened the doors the year I was born 1955 I met my wife across the street from Disneyland at the convention center on our honeymoon it's just a real special place and yeah there'll be some bad apples that'll get gone and it's interesting to hear what you just said but some people think well then this must be an evil place don't think that Walt Disney's DNA is still in that thing I remember hearing a story that that he and his brother Roy eventually ran the place after he passed but Roy didn't want to spend the money he didn't want to put gold on the top of the castle there's a point or something and so Walt waited until he was got a vacation or something and he went up there and had the people put gold up there I mean I assume it was gold paint but anyway he spent the money he wanted top notch anyway so fun listen I know we have to stop at the top of the hour because of things that people have to do but anything else you want to share before we get into questions I was thinking of something just a minute ago I did want to say one more thing about Disney World I think when you're prayed up when you go there you may have opportunities to minister to people I'm not saying everybody there is bad or wicked some stuff going on or being controlled by certain people who are not very good people and I'm not going to name names or anything I'm just saying keep it in your prayers I know Walt is declaring from heaven over it absolutely and that is something God gave him to create and he was very pleased with it he's not so pleased now but it's going to change I just want to encourage people to make sure and no matter where you go this is just for parents of young children make sure you always keep your kids with you make sure you see them and know who they're with please don't just drop them off at some friends house that you don't even know the friends or the family I would do that anyway I always was like that anyway I was always very careful with my children who babysat them but if we went to a big place we made sure we made rules to go in there to make sure we all knew where everybody was if a child was always with an adult that went with us and these days right now with all the stuff going on that would be a good tip for everybody really really really good alright well I have questions for you a whole list of questions here so let me just start with the first one Nathaniel asks and I hadn't heard of this before but here he goes he says I've heard that there are angels that stand at the four corners of our home is this true or are the angels all over our home in and out so that's his question I think it depends on where you put them where you post them you are allowed to say to the angels who are sent to protect you all the time you and your family they're sentries and they're posted here by your home and they pretty much stay around your home you have others that leave and go with you when you go places and I just tell them I'm going to post a sentry at each corner of my home I'm going to post so many over the home and even down the road and they actually go there and that's what they do they watch for anything of darkness coming they pull down strongholds they shred platforms trying to control us spirits of wickedness or whatever of darkness that want to control us or take things from us so they do both they will even march around on your property and watch it all the time or you can post them as sentries in certain places and if you have a second place you can also post sentries there and that is their number one job which will protect that area that they're assigned to that's really good you know I live on acreage that's not all my acreage there's actually a few hundred acres it belongs to the neighbors but in order to keep the dare out I'm involved inside the fence so they put a fence around it I didn't realize this about sentries this is the first time I've heard you say that that I can recall but I felt I was supposed to post sentries and I used that word at every post on the fence around all the property my neighbors as well I said if anyone gets anywhere near us to try to do harm I want them to see these sentries as and I said let them think they're police officers let them whatever if they try to do harm so I don't know what you think about that well you can actually also tell them to expose anyone who's coming, why they're coming and they actually can stop them from coming they'll actually stop them they'll actually interfere with someone trying to come in on the property and that might be appearing them that might be them saying something and even if they can't see them they would hear that so that's what sentries do is keep things away from you and to make sure that your life and your property is safe so you did the right thing by posting sentries that's really good I got really serious one day because there had been evidence of an invasion and I thought I'm not having this I went to town I took off after that alright Star is asking this question she says some of us write letters to God just simply write things down to Him, to God does the Father receive those letters and if He does how does He receive them there's several different ways that can happen I would encourage you if you wrote one read it out loud to Him you can do that when you're just by yourself in your prayer time or just in the time when you're walking or just doing something you can actually read it to Him say Father I have written this letter to you and read it to Him and it's going to hear you read that letter and they probably record it it's probably recorded in heaven they do a lot of recording there's angels that's what they do and they're sent for that they actually record things there's couriers, there's scribes who write things down or else they write things down and you say or they bring messages from heaven that are written I've had both of those happen to me before but absolutely I'm just standing in a spot and just say to your family member I love you, I just want you to know I haven't forgotten you I'm excited about one day being there with you then He'll make sure they hear that people think everything's so far away but especially the Father, the Son of the Holy Spirit if you wanted to really say something to them He loves, by the way writing that thing down is an MO it's a motive operations of the Father He does have we know He has the lamest book of life we know that He has a book of remembrance He actually has many and they're real books they're huge books and He does actually write in them, He likes to write things out Christ would rather say it but the Father writes things down you know He wrote a book about your life before you were even born so I would say you writing things down maybe a good thing would be to get a journal and if you think of something each day to say something to Him then you write down the date and what you wanted to say to Him and make sure He hears that and the other thing you can do with that journal is when He begins to answer you it may be that still small voice inside but you know it's Him answering because He's answering what you just said to Him so that way you can have a two-way conversation and you can record it in a journal and then you can enjoy looking at it later on or maybe leave that for your children one day and they might be surprised if that's said to you or what you said to Him so authorship is a really big thing in heaven everyone has written a book that represents God or heaven or just something really fun but decent they're already on library shelves and your books are already in heaven do you mean everyone's written a book whether they've written it here or not what do you mean by that you said everyone some people still write books in heaven do you but are you saying people that don't write here are actually in effect authoring a book there I'm not quite sure what you're saying what I'm saying is those who have authored a book here those books I saw my own books in a library in heaven so I do know and I was told those who become authors is so important because even when you're gone that book remains here and those words will still be read by people and it may be something spiritual or it could be something just a help book or just something funny that's really decent and people love to read and there's still people who read books at all so you can go get them out of the library or you can just request to have one yourself there in heaven and you have a place for a library in your own mansion so people still still love to read well I thought it was cool when Bill Johnson had my book in his library if my book is in heaven that's way cooler yeah that's very very cool okay let me come back for a moment to this just popped into my head I think I'm supposed to share it like so it's almost 15 years ago I didn't know you yet I hadn't heard about either sentries or hosts but I was a praying man and my oldest daughter got in trouble she gave her phone number to a guy in the market and I was furious not at her but that this would happen that he would have it and he started calling and I ripped into the spirit realm and I prayed every prayer every kind of emotion about I wanted God to take it take notice and take action and protect her does God pay attention to the the amount to me there was faith behind that emotion because I knew God would act does God pay attention to our how do I say this angry faith if I can put it that way angry against the devil is what I mean I would say that's called passionate you're fierce against what the enemy is doing of course the fathers can hear you I'm absolutely sure many times he's going to answer that prayer and it may not be the way you think it will happen but it will happen and I've also seen that but you know passionate people God those people who have a passion and you're expressing what you're feeling and what you're thinking especially if it's something that lines up with what God wants and he speaks in this word about protecting and guarding your words and keeping certain people away from you because he doesn't want your family life infiltrated by the enemy or a thing that the enemy could use against you so absolutely especially the words of a parent for the child he's absolutely going to pay attention to that that's kind of like you hear about mama bear I became papa bear I can't remember any time in all of my life I prayed that intensely for my daughter but I felt there was an urgency so I let it rip alright Margaret asked is God the father and or heaven going through time with us on the earth even though the father can move back and forth in and out of time is there a sense of past present and future to Jesus Holy Spirit and the people in heaven so I think I understand where they're coming from do they get a sense of time because we're in time I'm quite sure heaven is very much aware of what's going on in any time actually the father's omnipresent he knows exactly what's going on where's going on and everything so he he has to be aware of what's going on so he can send help or send words or scribes or couriers for whatever purpose so yes he is very much aware even though he's not held by time or bound by time and doesn't operate like the way we operate here in time we have hours we're awake and hours we're sleep they don't sleep in heaven they don't have to but he's still very much aware of what's going on and all over the earth at different times on the earth so yes he's like he's present all the time no matter where we are what's going on and of course he can still go into the past and see things he can go into the future and see things the Bible says he's been from the beginning there would be time from the beginning to the end there is a beginning of time that was right when he first made the earth the end of time is when he wraps it all up and then he makes the new earth and then we're just in eternity we'll be in eternity but during this time I said time during this seasons of our life where time is very much involved with us with heaven then they are seeing things all the time as it's going by but he also knows the end of things at the same time so it's like if we're agonizing in prayer for something to happen that we want or think we need or we do need and there is a sense where God will say it's not time yet for that he'll know that it's three months in the future so he does operate within that framework he knows that this is for three months from now that kind of thing he already knows that he already knows when things are going to happen and even what's going to happen even though people have wills of their own he's already actually been through all of time he's seen all of time already but right now as we're speaking he is watching and he's listening so he can be anywhere at the same time that's one of the great things about him so he's very much involved in our lives at the same time and even does know what that end looks like and I've already told people that he actually did show me when the end of time would be and it's not really a date it's an event and I've learned that about him most of the things he plans and things for on the earth he goes by those events that he has planned and those are things that will happen in the earth that he has planned are going to happen but he did tell me one time he said there will be a day that will come when time will be no more because I won't need time and you won't need time on the earth on the new earth we won't have a clock we won't have things like that going on we will be living forever and we will also plan things by events at that time on the new earth but when everything ends is when time will be no more because he doesn't need time on this earth the reason he needs time now is because he's sending those little spirits from him, that's where everybody came from you lived in him but this is what he said time will be no more when I have sent the last one from myself I won't need time that's good I have a question about time now that we're on the subject Manuel Johnson talks about he's been transported in the future and the past so have you well God took him in the past he transported him in the past he showed him what happened he was there and it brought healing to his soul because God showed him this and that I don't know the whole story because I'm probably not doing it justice but great healing came to him by God taking him back in time does God do that sometimes does he see a need to bring someone back in time I think that he probably does because I know several other people who have encounters like that and I have been taken back in time quite a few times it was all related to things that happened in the Word of God or the way he made heaven the way he made the earth it was always related to revelation when he takes me back in time like he showed me his son on the cross and what happened when he had his spirit leave he took me back and I saw paradise or Abraham's bosom while he was there with the thief I saw him also when he was in hell approached the gates of hell and they were taking him and I saw what happened on the third day I was taken back back in the book of Acts when the Holy Spirit came and invaded in the upper room I mean there's many times he's taken me back I was taken back to the tomb the very day that he came out of that tomb I was taken that day back in time and I actually felt myself traveling it was the one time I felt myself traveling through time and I told people it was like on Star Trek or Star Wars when you go warp speed and those like shoot past you it is exactly like that I know they probably got that idea from the idea zone in heaven about how it looks like when you travel but it actually did and I actually could feel myself moving whenever we got to the part of time God wanted me to see we stopped and my feet just touched the ground crazy and it's like a portal open and I was there I was literally there in that time and I saw Mary go into the tomb looking for him and she saw the person in the garden and she came out and she thought he was the gardener because Christ was actually standing in the flowerbed smelling the flowers when these things happen both that and all the other back in time to be very very clear you went in that time this wasn't a vision a 3D experience you actually were there during the time it actually I was actually there I was wide awake I don't sleep long enough to dream I almost never dream and I have sometimes visions but this is called an encounter an encounter is you are actually there he's not showing me a film my feet touched the ground outside the tomb I saw the stone had been rolled away it was actually quite a ways down thing I also saw Christ standing he has a back turn to where the tomb was and he was literally looking at the flowers because he loves flowers and he had just been through 3 days of you know what and so when he came out of there after thanking his father for all that he had done for him he wanted to be in the midst of the flowers and I actually say Mary surmised or thought he was the gardener and she spoke to him she said her name she knew instantly when she heard him speak that it was him and then he turned around and of course she saw him then and I saw that in person, in that time that's how it happens people and instead of bashing people saying why not ask God to give you an encounter and show you something powerful I've been taking it up many many times for me and I didn't take myself I have to make it clear I didn't take myself that God had purpose for me and he'd already told me we're going to take you back in time, forward in time we're going to give you revelation on the word revelation on the times you're in and show you things to come and if you remember in Revelation 4 he actually said that to John I will show you things to come and so that's one of the things that God does with his prophets and so I was literally there in person remember the feeling of the ground the smell of the flowers everything about that place amazing Bobby Connor tells a story about going to the crucifixion not a vision not a 3D idea he was actually there and he said the smells the sights, the sounds you know have you been to the crucifixion as well? I saw a part of the crucifixion it was more what I heard him saying and they were of course very upset that he had died but we know that he actually the thing about Christ was he was such a powerful being he had to lose his soul from his body he actually had to tell it to leave he knew he had to die and so they probably were wondering why in the world hasn't that guy died they even put the sword inside and everything but he finally knew that it was time so he just lost his soul from his body and his spirit man left his body and then of course he was there his body remained on the cross until they took it down they were wrapping it the women were crying John was but John remembered also the words Christ said that he would rise again and so it was a very powerful thing people in the city people I could hear crying in the whole area there that he had died because they loved him so much he had helped so many people and did so many miracles they said you couldn't even put him in a book there were so many people count the miracles it says if the books were written of all the things he did the books would go around the world like the planet people so he was non-stop all the time doing his work that God gave him to do and so it was an emotional time but of course I already knew that he was going to raise from the dead but I had visited that place and then of course I was taken back when he came out of the tomb and then I was taken back when he was down in hell and then I was taken back I was taken back in time when he actually was sent into heaven and one of the angels had this urn with his blood because he had to pour that out on the mercy seat in heaven and so he showed me these things and he showed me the reality of the word of God it was so powerful but yes I have encounters he clearly comes and takes me just takes me like in a second and it doesn't matter where I am really and I gave him permission so it might be better if you say I give you permission to take me whenever you want to or speak to me whenever you want to that encourages him to do it actually and I don't even say that to him when he told me this is what we're going to have you do commission on the earth as a revelator this is what you're going to do and I said I'd give you permission whenever you want to and I guess while we're talking about time okay now you got me I have heard you and others talk about okay he said to the thief that was saved that became saved he said I'm telling you this day today you will be with me in paradise he didn't say in hell he said in paradise I have not heard anyone say during those three days what did he do in paradise no one's ever really related that to me at least well the first thing he did was preach the gospel to all of them it said he it said that he took captivity captive the captivity that was it was called Abraham's wisdom and paradise it is the same place where the dead we died if you were faithful and knew God and believed in God himself this is before the Messiah came God counted that your faith as being you know you were just and you were faithful so he didn't send them to hell they couldn't ascend to heaven though because Christ hadn't gone back to heaven pour out the blood except of course we know Elijah and Enoch literally were taken to heaven in their bodies and they're still there in the physical bodies I believe that they were glorified when he took them up to heaven already because they didn't have to die and that was the Father's choice to do that but but it is quite a thing for God to trust you to do things and share things for him but yes but that's his choice to take me I don't take myself but he actually entered into paradise because he had to keep his word to the thief thank you Holy Spirit said the XT he had to keep his word and he didn't say I'll see you tomorrow he said this day that day that day and so when he died they actually I think he died before the thieves didn't they have to come break their legs so they would die I think so because they had to break the legs and all that with the thieves so Christ descended into paradise paradise was not a place with rocks and you think well it's in the earth there's a bunch of rocks sitting around it was a city it was a beautiful city God made faithful and that's where his friends he called Abraham you know that was his friend many others of back in the Old Testament were friends of God because they chose to be friends of God and he didn't send them to hell they still had to they had to descend though when you believe in Christ now and you die you don't descend at all you ascend into heaven that's where he does the big difference because Christ has been there he made the way back he cleansed it he put the blood on the altar showing that he had died for everyone's sins and so that changed everything about for those who died that believed in Christ it changed some things happen that change everything and so yes he did go down there he was talking to Abraham he was talking to Joseph who raised him he was talking to all those people the faith of David all of those were in paradise and at one point they all exited and left paradise is empty now there's nothing there it's still there people actually asked me would Satan take it over he doesn't have the ability to take paradise over that's like a holy place that God made for those who loved him and believed in him and no hell can't take paradise and use it people he's never going to get paradise so he would have taken Joseph the one who was sold in Egypt he would have taken David Solomon and he would have preached the gospel and said this is what it means to be saved this is what I had to do that kind of thing he would have told the whole story he literally changed the gospel as if you tell people that Jesus Christ gave his life that he gave his life so that we might have a way to go back to heaven where we all came from there had to be a prize paid there had to be a sacrifice made and he actually told all of them they had like a gathering and he just preached the gospel to everybody there and everyone there received him as their Messiah they had to receive him as their Messiah because that's what makes it possible for you to go you know to go into heaven and so he did he preached the gospel he said he preached the gospel and so then he took captivity he captivated them with his love and his sacrifice for all for all those who choose him and so they then eventually they did exit Abraham's bosom or paradise and they are all now in heaven they don't use that anymore it's not used but it is still there it had golden buildings it actually had a river now these are spiritual places because you're there in your spiritual body I will explain to people the difference of being in the flesh and being in the spirit you have a spiritual body and it looks like you but it looks a lot better you look young you're full of energy and life and so when you died you entered into this spiritual round place that was paradise or if you were wicked there's a great gulf that separates those places I think the people in paradise can see the gates of hell and they know hell if they come up to the gates can see like it's like I can't think of what you call it a balcony they see like this big balcony that they can see in a far distance because remember the dream that the wicked man had and he wanted the beggar to bring a drop of water and put it on his tongue burning in hell that dream was real that was real and that's a good way to explain you read that dream and see what happened there was a hell he was burning in hell and he was telling God please send someone to earth to tell them about this place it's horrible I don't want my family to come here and of course God's answer to him was it wouldn't matter who came they're wicked in their heart and they don't want it and he said so that but he would not send Lazarus who was a beggar who was a beggar on the earth and he was they could see that he's eating he knew they were eating there's like a king's table a feast set there you still eat in your spiritual body people in heaven and these people in paradise were eating they had buildings that they stayed in they had a beautiful river they even had a sky because it was a spiritual place oh wow okay of the year he wouldn't take his friends who actually believed in him and lived right he wouldn't send them to place it was a dark money place here you are in the middle of the earth sitting next to the lava that wasn't going to happen God made this place beautiful and it and it was beautiful let me ask this one last question because I know we have to stop at the top of the hour there was a great earthquake when Jesus was crucified and graves were open what have you seen if anything as far as that have you seen that event graves open the earthquake I know it didn't happen I know that the earthquake was shook and graves open and people saw I'm trying to remember I don't know if they gave a number or something but it was quite a few it was quite a few hundred I believe they were actually noted it was noted and written somewhere I don't know maybe Josephus or somebody wrote that down but it does mention in the Bible that they had an earthquake and the graves were opened and they saw people walk it was just another testimony that that was the son of God I mean a lot of people began to believe that was the son of God cross that was the son of God because he knows that couldn't have happened any other way so that really did happen people came up out of the graves and they walked around it was fascinating it was fascinating but you know it's interesting because you know it shows integrity on your part because you're not making it up if God didn't show you you're not saying God showed me you're saying I didn't see people walking out of the grave people walking out of the graves when there was an earthquake so that to me that adds credibility to you because you could make something out of it I wasn't taking and showing those people walking but I do know that did happen I do know that did happen they still talk about it in heaven sometimes wow I'd love to see a video of that and I guess in heaven we get to see replays that we want right if we want to see what that looks like absolutely can see replays awesome I like those are the kind of re-runs I want to see that if you will pray for the people before we go and just bless them if you will Father I thank you for this beautiful day I thank you for your holy son our king of kings I thank you for Holy Spirit who can be our best friend but is still God he was sent to come alongside us and then when we choose to invite him to indwell us he actually moves on the inside of us and then he'll never stop talking to us but I thank you for that that you are very much involved in our lives and you do care for everyone and I pray Father that people have to understand they need to understand that when they have someone who belongs to Jesus Christ and they receive Jesus Christ when they move to heaven it is a good thing it is a good thing for them that's why they celebrate in heaven they don't weep and cry when someone comes home they celebrate because God loves it when one of his children come home one of his sons or his daughters they come home to heaven they actually have a huge celebration rewards are given from the throne at that time and then all their family and friends go to see this person's mansion and then they get undone by how beautiful and amazing or adventurous even these mansions are so powerful thank you Father for thinking of us in the past now in this time and in the future you know where we are you know that we love you I thank you in these days set a table and the presence of everyone's enemies that would be the left that would be the liberals all those evil people colluding and flaming together to take over this world which makes me laugh ha ha ha because this earth was made by you and your son and it says the earth and the focus now belongs to Jesus Christ the earth is your footstool because you're ever watching us thank you for intervening in lives people have lost things like their property or their money is running low I thank you right now you take out of your own stock and you give to those people Father because they're trusting you they're believing you and they're staying excited I thank you for showing yourself strong on their path in these days right now in Jesus name so be it and everyone said amen and amen I just want to encourage people to go to revealingheaven.com cats two books are there and other products go to catcur.com that's the only place

You Welcome to Elijah streams. It happens to be Tuesday, August 16, but we're recording this for a week from Wednesday So whatever that date is someone can put that on the screen for me. I forgot to look that up, but August this is for August 24 Even though we're recording it on August 16. So we're on with cat. It's going to be good. So if anything she says happens to be Historically incorrect because more things have happened. You'll understand why so it's going to be a great show There's no I have no other announcement. So let's If you all are ready, I'm ready. So let's watch Wednesdays with cat and Steve. Here we go Well, hello, I don't know which to say happy Wednesday. I can't say that because it's not How are you doing cat you just I'm doing great. That's always gonna be my answer You got your you were just telling me got a brand new scarf and shirt. Is that we were saying I have everything new. Okay, the jacket which is really cool You can't see. There you go. You can see powers really beautifully engraved. I just got that yesterday in the shirt which I would have worn on the platform And my scarf and yeah I was going to the salon today and the Holy Spirit said you were in that brand new black shirt looks really nice and you wear the new jacket and I'm thinking I think it could get wet. You never know when you're going to go to salon was going to happen. He said no, go ahead and wear it. Not telling me why and I'm sitting in there in the chair at the salon and she's almost done with me When I get it when I get a call and say did you remember that you had to record something with Steve Schultz? No, I didn't but now I know why he told me to wear this. I walked in the door literally walked in the door and just sat in the chair so Holy Spirit needs to be your best friend. Let me tell you he'll let you know all kinds of things you wouldn't expect that he would And so here I am today and that's very cool. You know lately Darin and I have been practicing that every not I was I was about to say every once in a while very often now all of a sudden I'll remember something We went to bed and it gets cold in a certain part of our house even though it's summer and she went to bed and she and she said I think I might have left the heater on that little portable heater so she went out there and she said the Holy Spirit keeps telling me stuff but it's not like a voice necessarily she just all of a sudden she thinks about inside that's what yeah exactly so I keep saying thank you thank you Holy Spirit thank you, you know, I think him today. That's awesome. So, so it's I would encourage people when you suddenly remember something and it was important, say thank you Holy Spirit right. Yes, absolutely say thank you. You're so so good and he likes gratitude I found that out so. Yes, he does that that that will intensify the actual friendship one if you're thanking him all the time. Oh yeah, I do thank him all the time I think him the father of something I think I think I think them I think the Trinity. Sometimes it's the father of the Lord, most of the time the Holy Spirit is when he talks to me about every day stuff, or even reminds me of things and like I can't lose anything no matter what I can't find. He either shows me where it's at literally a picture of where it's at, or it just comes back. It just comes back. What do you mean it comes back what do you mean. If I found if I've misplaced something really important and I really need it. And I've looked a little bit for it. Well there's something I always say you all need to just learn this. If I can't find something I always say these words, and they always work. It's not the word is what you're saying. And I say Holy Spirit you know where everything is it was ever made that is made right now and never will be made. Please show me where and I say what it is where it is now. And in that moment he literally shows me like a vision of where it's sitting laying or even underneath something. He does it immediately and I say thank you so much for showing me where that is. Because I give him an opportunity to do something for me by saying that. So that's asking you have not because you asked not so I'm literally asking him. But first I'm telling them who I tell him who he is. And what he does know he knows everything that was ever made. No matter where it is in time he knows he knows what's made right now and he knows what's going to be made in the whole. The best person to ask first before you run around an hour looking say that first and just say I ask you to show to me right now. And he'll either show me or someone will yell I found whatever. Oh wow. But it's like it's something that's very quickly done immediately when I when I honor him for who he is and then I ask. I think that's that's one of the meanings where it says in the scriptures before you call I will answer. It's like he knows you're about to call he knows your words are forming and he already starts forming this picture. Lord show me that years ago and I and so when I ask him something I don't try to wait for a long time I try to listen to what the very first thought because before I call him he's going to answer so that's very very cool so awesome. Well you've got some thought maybe a few thoughts on your heart for when people will watch this so share that before we get into questions if you want to. I do actually. My husband was driving me to the salon and you know the traffic's backed up like crazy everywhere around here. They're building a few new things so the streets are backed up. And also if it's the time like when school lets out there's always going to be traffic somewhere in this city. And so we had a lot of time in line we were sitting in line in the traffic but I never complain when that happened. And so the father starts speaking to me immediately and then he took me from. I wasn't in the truck. I was taken to this place and shown something he wants me to share so I'm going to share it with everybody first time ever like just happened to me maybe an hour ago or so. He took me he caught me up and put me on this long winding road I didn't even know where I was at and in front of me was where I had been he said I want you to see where you've come from he said I'm going to show you a journey. And so I saw this long road in front of me and then all the way up where these red streaks he said that's the blood of Christ that never leaves you all the way up to my feet they came and then he said now you may turn and see where you're headed. And when I turned I saw still some more road because this is my journey remember I saw more road in front of me but it got more and more transparent and then I could see shortly in the distance the city of God which would be the throne room or all the beauty and splendor is in heaven I saw that and he said everyone who belongs to me needs to know that this is your destination he was saying not just mine everyone is a believer that is your destination this is what he said to me. Everyone should love one another now because I actually say the world will know you by your love for each other stop fighting. Stop arguing stop picking on each other stop saying things aren't even true about each other. He said you spend your time loving. So when you reach that destination, there will be an even greater celebration that you chose to love on another and be a testimony to who I am. And I was so undone because the splendor that looked just like the city of God that's what I call heaven city in heaven. It was like the city of God I saw all the time I could see streets of gold I could see the glorious buildings that were in the air they're not even on the ground I clearly knew where that was but that's what he was saying. Anyone who's a believer that's our destination we're all going to the same place. Okay this is what else he said your body may die but that's not you. That's part of your covering. He said your spirit man and your soul never dies so all those if you recently had someone passed to heaven I've had three really good friends recently like even in the last week somebody met passed on to heaven. And you know she was like in her fifties and yet she was not just ready her mansion was done and she went and I was celebrating I always celebrate when somebody goes to heaven so I have that I understand that is our home we will go there until he makes the way we were but this is our destination we're on a journey together that's what he's trying to say to me he was very adamant this is a journey you're doing together where you've been and then where you're going your destiny where you're going your destination is all the same destination. But what you do now matters it doesn't matter and having a matters how we treat each other matters if you if you know accomplish the mission he has given you but honestly part of our mission is to care about each other the Bible says to. You know to consider those are the household of faith or God first that means we should consider our fellow Christian members first we need to help them we need to honor them bless them and that is our goal that and let the world know us by our love how big of a deal that because right now I don't think they think the body of Christ or Christians are known because of our love for each other but it's going to happen and I will say this Jesus won't come back several years many years away actually before that happens but he's not coming back until we are loving one another because the Bible says the world will know us by our love for each other is one of the signs that that you know that we're getting close to him coming so we have some work left to do so people just forgive people just let it go loose out of your soul somebody wrong you and just love them anyway and the other thing you're doing is you're piercing Satan he does not want you to forgive people and love one he doesn't want us to love one another if we keep fighting whenever they even know who we are how can you operate in the power of God and speak for him on his behalf if you're trashing people who are the household of faith so this is a good time for you to just say I'm sorry father from this day forward I'm going to I'm going to do the very best I can and ask for more grace and get filled with your love and let this world see me love other believers and so that was the encounter I just have literally speaking to me I was gone in the second I was right back in the seat of the truck well of course I told my husband what just happened and he goes oh that's awesome he's not a man of many words but he was thought he thought it was a great thing and I said I'm supposed to share that I'm supposed to share that the next time not remembering even at that moment that it would be just a couple hours from them when I would do that so that is a word from the father if we are supposed to love one another care about each other help one another don't pick people's you know even if you don't have maybe you don't have a vision for what you're doing right now you don't pick other people's visions apart that's okay somebody happy and can I ask you a question so almost everyone has people that are I guess we would say they're in the body of Christ but they are so different than what we are there even some of them are off base but we know they accepted Christ but and then some are detractors and some are almost enemies and yet and yet they serve the Lord and what happens when we decide to just in our heart I guess it happens in our heart first just decide you know what I'm going to love them whether they ever know this or not I'm going to choose to love them what does something happen in the spirit when we do that. Yes, but I have to have to make clear what what what you're saying I understand what you're saying you make a decision with your soul, because your natural emotions aren't going to do it. You can even say, I make a choice with my will, no matter how you're feeling about it, you can actually do that that's actually something that is possible. You don't have to feel it for you don't have to feel it then you don't have to feel you don't have to feel you do not have to feel it. You're making what you declare and decree shall be established unto you and it is going to happen. I've had to do that several times actually, depending on what people had said have done done done to me or said to me. I say I choose as an act of my will to forgive them and my emotions certainly in that moment of time probably don't want that but you overrode your emotions. That's not like you're not being you that's using a part of you maybe you didn't use very often. Your will is the most powerful part of you. It's what it's what you display. I mean, know your will is what you choose to do your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you actually choose. And my husband has always said what you choose to do you will do. That's his famous quote. And he's very right about that so why not choose with your will the way the father decided to make it and say I choose as an act of my will not my emotions to forgive and say their name. And guess what the father he will write that down and he will immediately start working on the heart of the other person because you have forgiven them. That actually gives the father and Holy Spirit freedom to pursue that person for them to change no matter they're probably you're probably not the only one they're doing things to. If people are in fear or if they're in pain or if they're angry it makes them lash out I'm not giving an excuse for them I'm just telling you that's how it operates in your soul. As a man think it then his soul. So are you that's the heart of your being your soul. I had I had a situation. I don't know if I ever brought this up but there was a guy who went home to be with the Lord years and years ago. Okay so this is nothing current years and years ago but before he did that he tried really hard to destroy this ministry that I mean so it was a long time ago but it was this ministry. And I think or I feel like or I think I, I tried to forgive him okay I don't know which words to put, and I went to, you know, I had been really really sick many people know I was bed ridden my pastor. At that time thought maybe I was, I was depressed while I wasn't, but he said I want you to go to counseling so in deference to him I went to counseling for a few times. And I told this counselor a woman counselor and I told her about this guy that tried to destroy us because she was digging deep for anything that might be bothering me. And I said this happened this happened this happened and the guy's book was on her shelf so I knew she knew who he was. And so she said I want you to go up these stairs see yourself going up these stairs and open the door and it's the Lord, and you and him are going up there together, you're walking side by side up these areas. And I want you to tell the Lord what you think about him. You can imagine that was kind of, and all of a sudden now these emotions are coming up and all of a sudden I'm balling. And I said, it was like the Lord said what do you think about and he named the name and all of a sudden tears are just flowing. And I said he did the best he knew how to do he served you with, and that was sort of a combination cat of soul and emotion all mixed in there because I choose. I chose to do that talk about forgiving someone after they're gone, after it's too late to say it to them. You can. Well, number one, I do want to say the person who passed on. Yeah, they're immediately sorry for everything ever said or did you it just is a part of what happens. So when you die and step out of this body and your spirit man steps out, you know immediately what you did that, even if we're seeing, let's say I'm not saying murder or stuff like that. Maybe you were rude, maybe you were harsh to people, maybe you did something wrong against them. You know, immediately at that moment you're flooded with the life of God and you go, wow, I should have said I was sorry, you know, I should have said I was sorry for them what I did was wrong. I should have told them one day they feel still in need to tell you that. So they're basically at that moment saying they were sorry or repenting for doing it, even though you never heard it. Yeah, there is absolute forgiveness or actually a recompense for when at the moment someone dies and he's in heaven right now can't wait to see you and hug you when you get to heaven and say man, I should have been better to you. And you're probably saying these words, it doesn't matter anymore. But it would feel I can imagine it feeling good, really, really good to hear it. And also at the same time saying it doesn't matter anymore, you know, all at the same time all mixed in the same time you're really you're kind of happy. Yeah, they did it. They did understand. No, you can't you can't try to hide from truth when you're in the presence when you're in the presence there's no there's no hiding from what is true, you know what is true. And especially leaders in the body of Christ have a double accountability might as well bring this in your double accountability is leaders in the body of Christ and I'm sure the Lord may have something to say to you when you get in heaven he won't keep you from heaven. But I'm sure he may have something to say to you because the word does say that you'll be held calm for every wasteful word. It actually says that in the Bible. Can you clarify that you said that the other day in heaven, huh? You said that last time we were on the program about someone else you said he'll have something to say. Yeah. Can you postulate or even relate what type of thing he might say to someone like that? What do you mean he'll have something to say? I think that is done at a special appearance. I'm not saying that is necessarily done when you first arrive in heaven. Okay. Unless it was a special case, as was the case I saw the other day. Most of the time you'll be in heaven and you're rejoicing you're celebrating you're so happy the presence so powerful, but the more the presence begins to just invade your soul. You kind of know I probably should have handled this better. You don't feel guilty. There's no guilt. There is no guilt in heaven. Even when you come before the judgment seat of Christ and he will say things to you like, you know, I did ask you to do this. Like he asked, let's say he asked you to be a preacher. You decided to be a rodeo. Whatever. I'm just making a crazy. Yeah. And he did great at being in the rodeo, but you didn't ever pick up the call that he's dad. He will mention that to you. You'll have a conversation that doesn't mean he's going to kick you out or anything. But because in the Bible it says you'll be held accountable. So don't use waste wasteful words would be like bashing people being unkind to people saying rude remarks. And you're you're a believer, but you're still doing this stuff up into the day you go. You will realize, yeah, man, I should have not done that because truth begins to invade you. And when you kind of hear from that truth or you ignore that truth, that doesn't mean you won't go to heaven. That just means you are going to have a time to be talked to. Well, you know, I'll just end with this because I know you have the first question about something else or anything else to say. But I've talked about my father many times and he was in fact, he's with the Lord. He was in fact a major serial child abuser. He was OK. Then he got his heart right. And I know he's with the Lord. You said he's felt really good when I talked about he's with the Lord. You said that makes him happy when he hears that. So that was a major, major, major, major sin or set of sins or years of sin. So talk about the talking to that he might receive one day. I mean, how does that work? What would he say to my dad? Because he already knew he was wrong. I'm not even talking about actual sin. I'm not even talking about sin. Oh, that was sin. No, that was sin. His repentance of all that wiped it away. Oh, OK. So he's not talking about that. And he's not up there thinking about that anymore. He's thinking about how much he loves you and he's excited for you. And he knows that you're doing great things for God. Now, what I'm talking about are people who are like, even though they're believers, it's not really a sin to be rude. It's not nice. But those are wasteful words you're speaking. They are not necessary and you shouldn't be speaking on those things. He will talk to you. He will. He will talk to you about that, those kind of things. Sin is forgotten into the sea. No, there's no more remembrance of that. Like, no matter who's out there, if you sin and you're repented, don't bring that up to the Father again. If you're repented, he won't remember it. He won't remember it. But after you've been born again and repented, maybe you sin later, repent again, please. The God is not into freely sin at all. He is not in agreement with you to freely sin when you're a believer. That's not any kind of testimony or witness for him. And you just don't want to do it because people can see you acting like that and they'll think, why should I get saved? You act just like me. If you're sinning, if you have a lifestyle of sin, that's not a good thing at all. But what I'm talking about is just people's attitudes and the way they treat people. Those things, he will probably say something to them about because it does say, you will be held accountable for every wasteful word, words that shouldn't have been spoken, that were not necessary, that maybe hurt people or, you know, interfere with things in their life. Those kind of things. Because he said that in the word, he will talk to you about those things. But you're sin. I always thought, I guess I'm wrong on my thinking. I always thought those wasteful words and things you're speaking against people were, in fact, sins. Really? Wasteful is not sinful. There's a clear definition here. No, sins, the sins, the sins that you did in the earth, you have to repent, even if it's at the moment you die and Christ comes to you and says something. At that moment, you would have to say, I do truly repent because of the keys of hell, death and the grave. But the wasteful words have nothing to do with you getting into heaven or not. It's the attitude you have. It's maybe the witness that you're being. It won't keep you from being in heaven, but you could have probably had a lot more or done more for him because if you had treated somebody different. He's clearly saying that even when you're born again, watch how you treat people, how you handle people. He doesn't want people getting crushed or falsely or wrongfully accused. He wants that to not happen from a believer because you're actually messing with the testimony of what a believer is. Let's say sinners know you and they see you acting or mistreating people. They're like, why should I bother? You're almost interfering in more than just that. So those wasteful words that you shredded people with your mouth, that's not a sin. That's just a wasteful words that should not have been done. It's a waste of time to speak them. In other words, those he will hold you accountable. That doesn't mean you're going to be kicked out of heaven and he will let you know what that means when you get there. So no, he's not talking about sins. That doesn't mean sin. That's amazing. Well, what else do you have before we get into questions? Any other thing about current events or anything like that? I'm just excited about all the fraud exposure that's coming forth, which I'm sure everybody else is also. The legitimate many has meant other people coming forward to testify against the left who were a part of that. And I'm telling people to be the biggest, probably the biggest exposure ever in the history of the earth. Because of the exposure will be so deep and so wide and so complete. That everyone is doing anything to try to take over the world to stop our lives, steal what we have, or just stop the word of God from going forth. Anything that has an evil agenda on the left or the liberals, whatever they're doing, they are all going to be exposed and justice is going to be brought against them. And that's why I keep telling them that are doing that you better go. You better go be a witness and testify against what they're doing, because the day is going to come when the window will close and they won't need people's witness. They'll have so many witnesses that have been proven to be right that will legally cause legal action to take forth, come forth, whether it's from heaven or from the earth, but they're going to be exposed. And so that's just happened again. There are eyewitnesses that have come forth from all places. I may as well tell you because it's all over the place. It's FBI agents. I'm not saying to them to went into Mar-Lago or I can't even say the name. Trump's home to steal things or mess up things, which was what their agenda was. I don't know about them. I'm talking about ones who were a part of that and are no longer a part of that. They have got some of them who've come forward and are testifying, literally testifying, which God said on November the 4th, 2020, it would happen. So those things are beginning to happen and more and more people, you're not going to hear about it until it all breaks loose. And they have to say those famous words that the 2020 election was stolen. And it will be said on regular news and they won't want to say it because of the testimony and the witness and the evidence. They are going to have to say that people. And I can tell you those things are starting to come in. They're compiling up against the left and the liberals. I'm not doing it. It's happening because God said it would happen. And we just, they just had some more come forward and do that. So I'm always excited when truth is being told because it helps people. The truth makes you free. Are there people cat-like news anchors that we would recognize? Many of them who were told, you will not report. You will not say this because you will not say it was stolen that, that are going to come forward and say, they told me I couldn't talk about it. And commentators who wanted to tell the truth and they'll say they were, they told me I was not allowed to, well, that kind of thing all over the place. Definitely. Well, we're going to have all kinds of from every area from the business arena and the medical arena. I mean, everywhere from the financial arena, the media arena, there are going to be some from every one of those different areas because that's how far reaching the lie is and the deception is. And therefore people will come from each one of those arenas and they will testify because probably most likely they're not working. I mean, I didn't be working at those places right now because they were threatened with death. Most likely that that seems to be like, well, if we can't badger them or force them, then we'll just tell them we'll kill them. And I mean, again, this is truth. What I'm speaking is the truth that has already happened. And if they can't get these people who are in these positions to go along with them, they just take them, they just take them out. They threaten them. Truly they do. And some people won't talk about it because they're afraid for their own life. But there's going to come a time when they realize if they don't come forward and say something, this thing is going to come to an end where the people believe it or is or not. And you can't, no one can stop it from happening. It is coming to an end. And that whole foundation has already started crumbling under those people of the left and the liberals. It's already crumbling and they know it's crumbling. That's why they're being desperate, like, you know, raiding Trump's home and other things and saying, what else can we find or make up or lie about that will keep this thing going because it's failing. And it's failing big. So I just spoke the truth again. There are all these people from all those arenas and some people who are very high up in them, which is the testimony they really need. They need them to come forward and say that there's going to be a big witness protection program somewhere. But I can tell you right now it is going to happen. And so some of that just happened the other day and it's already being spread everywhere and it's true. They have had some come forward to that want to testify on behalf of what is right. So good. So good. I love it. I love it. Okay. Anything else before questions? I don't think anything else right now. I do have a question here that we can kind of start with. Yeah, start with that one. That'd be good. This is I love getting I love getting and let me tell you, I get so much mail. It's wonderfully outrageous. It takes me weeks and sometimes even months to go. If it's sent to me for me personally, I do go through it and look at it. And I do pray for a lot of people at that time. If it's something that's urgent, I will pray for them. But this little child who's nine years old, I'm just going to say her name is Andrea. And I'm not saying anything else about where it came from or what. Since God is making a new heaven and a new earth. And if you didn't know that, guess what he's going to. And the word does say that he is. So she is correct. Do you know what he's going to do with the moon? And I just love these children's questions. You know, they don't they don't hold anything back when they want to know something. They just ask what people think about what they say. Well, I'll tell you, Andrea, you can probably have it in your own yard on the new earth. I am quite sure the father can make you one. And so you will not miss the moon. And you know, he did make the sun and the moon. He made them himself. It says so in the Bible. Now, when he originally in the beginning, Genesis one, one in the beginning, when he made the earth, he lit it with his glory. There was no sun or moon lighting this earth when he made it the first time. And then in verse two, something has happened because he made it the first time and it was finished. It was done. He was done with the first time he made it. In verse two, it says that darkness is on the face of the deep and the water is covering the whole earth. Well, he didn't make it that way. He would have never made it that way. He made it the way it should have been. But then Saint was kicked out of heaven, fell to earth. He began to make the earth a wilderness. It says that in Jeremiah. And so God turned the light out. It also says that. He turned out the light. He took his glory off the earth and he broke the water vapor shield around the earth, which brought mist on it because it never rained in the very beginning. You need to know that too. Even scientists know that. And so it flooded the whole earth and then he made it darkness come upon it because he took the light out. So here's the earth sitting in verse two, right? It says he made it in verse one in the beginning. He made that means made means done, made the heavens and the earth. And then in the second verse, it's a mess. There's, there's, there's water covering the sky. That's the firmament. And it says in the Bible that he took the water off the firmament. He took it off of the land and began to redo the earth. It says that clear in the Bible. So then when he began to redo it in verse two, he starts that and he even says what he does. Okay. He replenishes the plans and brings them back. He puts the sun in the sky to light the day and the moon at night to light the night. It didn't say that in one one. And people go, well, how could this be millions of years people between verse one one, right? And Genesis one, two, there are millions of years. Oh, that's the first time I've heard you put it. No, there really is because it, there was no kind of time on the earth, right? The sun and the moon counted the days and the nights. When he started redoing the earth, replenishing is the correct word. The Holy Spirit just told me, we began to replenish the earth. Well, you can't read something. If you didn't do it before modeling your home unless you built it before. So you need to look at the words that are spoken unless people have written a new Bible and wiped them out and then just forget about it. Find one that isn't. It has not been changed. But so he made the earth in the beginning and it was done. It was finished. Beautiful. And it had a water vapor shield. He put around the whole earth that brought mist onto the trees, the flowers, but the light of God came from everyone who goes to heaven gets to see this. They go to this place and he lets you see him making the heavens and the earth light of God came from the ground and it would hit this water vapor mist. And part of that was part of what the rainbow. But the sky back then in Genesis one, one was a peachy pink. It wasn't blue because the sun wasn't present. They created that needed that to make the sky blue. So in verse two, it all changes when he takes the water off of the firmament. That's the sky. It takes the water off the land and starts to be replenished the earth replenish that the creatures, the plant life. I probably didn't say it in the right order, but he did. Then we know eventually on day 16, he made man. But that's this was a whole different sky. Same earth foundation. Everything sound glow was there, but he was replenishing it so man could live on the earth. Okay, so they could live there. And then he put the sun in the sky and it brought life by the day and then the moon at night. And it even says that so you could see at night. And so now we have the sun and the moon. The sky is beautiful blue normally in the daytime. And then the sky at night is dark and except the light from the stars and the sun. I mean, the moon, you can see it clearly. But my answer to Andrea's, I'm quite sure that he would be happy to make you a moon to be over your mansion or in your mansion. That's how cool God is. I could clearly see him doing that for you, Andrea. Very cool. Hey, on and creation, I've been asked this before. I don't, don't recall if I've asked you people have asked many times on the seven days of creation, were they 24 hour days? Yes. That's what I thought, but I wanted to double check. Because the Bible says it was today in the night. And then it was another day. It actually says that it says evening in morning, right? Evening in morning. 24 hour day. Yeah. Six. Because he's God. That's why he spoke it. The word stepped out and made all of it. They could do it. They could do that as fast as they wanted to do it. That's why if you send an angel on assignment, like, like the, the heavens army, you send an assignment, they're back in five minutes. They've already dealt with what it was that you prayed about. And because, because there is no time. There's no day, no night. There is no time. There's no calendars. So when you send them or you pray for something, they go do it instantly. And then they come back for another appointment. I've seen that happen in heaven because I've been to Michael's headquarters. This is a free, free stuff now. I've been there and Michael's headquarters when they were sent on the mission. And it seemed like, you know, they were back. They went and dealt with it in the spirit realm. And then they came back for the next set of orders. That's amazing. Now you said it's in the scriptures that God turned the lights out. Can you tell which one that is? I'm not familiar. People read the whole book and find it. You're not going to. He won't let me. Okay. People to find them themselves. Steve, church and they listen to their pastor say stuff, but they don't. Most of them don't even go check it out. I admire people that search out the word to find things and see what it says about truth. Well, I do have some. He lets me quote, like he lets me cope. The first John 227 to let you know that you have a weapon in you. You never use most of them. And that's called, you know, the anointing. Yeah. It says in the Bible in first John 227, when you receive Jesus Christ and become a Christian, you get a deposit of the anointing. What is that? The anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness. You get a deposit of it and it says, it lives in you. I carry the anointing. I release the anointing. The anointing grows so much that it's like a big cloud outside of me. And if I walk into a place that begins to affect people, that's what Peter did. That's what Paul did. They said Peter's shadow healed people. It was the cloud of anointing coming from him because he did get a deposit when he got Christ. Christ puts a deposit of the anointing in you and it never leaves you. But the more you give it out, the more you get back. It's almost like a bank account. It's like an investment account. When you release the anointing, it grows. So that's what you're supposed to do. You've never done that. Make sure you start releasing it into what? Go in the restaurant. You drink out of a cup. You say, I release the anointing. It'll never leave that cup. The next person, it never leaves that cup. No, never. Not through the dishwasher. No, it's not because it's a spiritual thing. It comes from you, release the anointing. It goes in that cup. Every restaurant I ever eat at, I release it in the table. I release it in the seats. And so there's John. We've seen some people sit down in places and they jump back up. They're like, I don't know what that was because it would be God. Maybe they're not, maybe they're not, maybe they don't know the Lord. Maybe they're doing wicked things. They sit in that chair full of anointing. They all have to jump up and go find another place to sit down. So if you anoint the seat, let's say the seat in the table. For the rest of the time that that table exists, people will sit down in the anointing. And that's not just cat curd. That's anyone. Any believer that when you got born again, go read 1st John. I'll say it slow. 1st John 2 27. You have it because you got born again. Jesus Christ literally takes a deposit of the anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness and he says, he puts it in you and it lives there to buy there. That means it's there. It's up to you to release it wherever you go, whatever you touch. I have my phone up here before I send the text. I type in, I put my hand on this, they're releasing anointing. When they touch that and read that text, it comes out and you get. Wow. Oh, we actually released it in the tires of our car and I see fire tracks because the anointing looks like fire. It looks like that. In the spirit. It looks like fire. And so when we drive our car, you see fire tracks and everybody who passes over those tracks, the anointing will begin to penetrate their car. You don't know how supernatural you are. There are so many things we don't know as believers unless we are told that. And the Bible says, I have not seen or you're hearing or entered in the heart or mind of man, but God has prepared for those that love him. Well, one of the things he's already prepared is the anointing you're carrying. We have testimonies from people that their brother couldn't stand them. He lost his job and they wanted to help him. And the one guy, the brother had the good, the brother that was living right had these cowboy boots that this other brother wanted all the time. And they went to my meeting and heard me say these words. And when they went home, they anointed the cowboy boots, released the anointing in them, both of them. And they called the brother said, why don't you come have dinner? And they said, we really want to pray with you. He lost his big landscape business and now he was really needing. He said, well, I guess I'll come. And he asked, can I mow your lawn to get some money? And they said, yeah, sure. So when he went to leave, they said, you've always liked these boots. Would you like them? And he goes, yes, I want those boots. Well, these are anointed boots people from them. They carried the brother and his sister while that they carried they put in those boots. A couple of days later, he called and goes, I don't know why I've been mad at you. Wow. Why am I mad? I care about you. I just thank you for these boots. And by the way, I just got a brand new contract. I got a whole new contract to do all these condos now. And now I've got money again. I want to thank you so much for blessing me. It didn't happen until it gave him the boots. He put them on and the anointing began to penetrate now. And do you have to be in person to lay your hands on for that to work? Can you send the anointing from a distance? That would be rare. That'd be rare. Okay. You can send them something. You can send them a card in the mail. Okay. I released the anointing and you mail it. And when they open it or touch it, they don't even go. So Kat, if I put the anointing on an envelope, really prayed for it, the anointing to be released on an envelope. It goes to the person and the person says, writes on it, refused, returned to center, but they held it. They touched it. That's all it takes, Steve. That's clever. I will leave places go. We'll say it's too late, everybody. And this is the best part. Any of those people have been watching me bashing me. It's too late. You already have the anointing in you because I put it in everything as we're doing these things. We annoy all of our stuff and put it in it. And you can anoint your computer before you send emails. And the email, when they look at that email, they open it, it goes in them. Even, even if you, even if they look at it for a second and said, I don't want to read this, but they see it. That's it. Wow. Okay. Let's ask one question about sending the host. Sometimes I think, well, I've really done my job. I've spent 20, 30 minutes sending the host all over the place. I'm still in bed. I'm doing it while I'm still in bed. And I've sent them everywhere and I've given them assignment. I think, well, I'm done for the day, but you're saying five minutes later, they're back. I always give them one more before I go to sleep because you know, that's seven a.m. I'm up 20 hours a day. So they've been getting instruction out at three a.m. I, I like to go outside. I just like to go outside. I don't have to, but I want to be near where they're at. So I go outside with my staff and every time I, I give them an order to command to go somewhere, which I'm allowed to do because Christ was, you know, we know he was the Lord of hosts. He commanded the army to things he did. We can do too. I'm not going to go through all that, but I do. And I'll take my staff and I hit it on the ground and I'll just say, I'm not going to be it. Go host, make toast. That means they're going after the dark, the spiritual darkness to pull it down, to shred platforms and they will do it. And you may not find out to get to heaven one day, but when you do that, you are having an impact somewhere. But back to the anointing thing for just a minute. When I used to speak, we had a whole meetings that were nothing but to teach people to, they knew now that according to the word, the anointing was in them. And I was like, right here in the core of your being, I'd had people stand up and say, okay, now you know you have it. Lay your hand on there and ask Holy Spirit to stir it up. And we would actually have them do that. And then I always had, I always did something so they could see that it actually did something. And then I would say lay hands on the person next to you and say, I released the anointing in Jesus name and people were falling out. They started laughing. The room was getting so full. I could feel the waves of anointing coming from everybody. And I finally would say, stop, stop, stop, stop. I can't stand up anymore. So I didn't have them. I actually trained them how to use it. And people used to go while they would, they would go and anoint the reservoir of the city, like stick their hand as close as they could to it in it. And they did things like they would go to the pizza restaurant. They worked in, they would touch every pan in the restaurant, the ovens in the restaurant, the pizza place. And we see anointing, which everybody who got a pizza made on that pan got the anointing. My goodness. Forever because it doesn't leave. It doesn't ever leave because it's a spiritual thing. It's a spiritual thing. Unbelievable. You can be doing all kinds of things. Yeah. I'm re-fired up. Okay. It's like our secret weapon. It totally is. Understand the word that clearly says it lives in you. What do you think? What did you ever think you were going to do with it? Yeah. What people, what did you think? It says the anointing breaks or destroys the yoke of darkness. That's the anointing you carry. And no matter where you walk, you can release it through your feet. I walk through the store, release it everywhere in the store. Every garment I ever look at on the rack, I will touch and go, I'll release the anointing, the anointing, the anointing. Everyone who buys those clothes will have that anointing on them. Goodness, goodness, goodness. You can be busy all the time, people, just for the anointing. I'm going to get busier all the time. I see myself getting very busy. Okay. I, I told this lady, no, well, I would ask this, but it's way too long to read. So I'm going to summarize what she's saying. She's totally into everything you're teaching even today. I'm sure. But her husband began to be. A detractor. Then he went from a detractor to. He didn't like it. Then he went from that to. To being biased against it. Then he went, then he became a cynic. Then he became a mocker. Now he is a hardcore mocker of everything she's doing. And it's hurting her marriage. And she's supposed, she feels like she's supposed to submit to him. What does she do? That depends on how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. God, God, God, God, God, God, God. And then how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. God never said, he never said, we had to submit to the abuse of our husband. It's just physical abuse. It hasn't been physical. I think she would have told me, but it's really verbal wickedness. I can tell you what she can start doing. You need to start laying your hands on everything he's got. Let me see. Go to his closet. Release the anointing and all of his clothes. Make sure all of his shoes gets the anointing. You will probably see a change because that anointing destroys the yoke of darkness. He literally has a yoke on him right now. And when you keep going and you get darker and darker, it's because you know what he's doing. He's feeding his own soul with what he doesn't like. And if he keeps feeding his soul, that's all that's going to be in the layers of his soul. And as a man think it's in his soul or his heart, that's how he's going to be. That's the biggest issue. He's saying all that. It's like people watching the fake news. They would start out great. They wouldn't like it. Then they'd be listening and they'd be like, well, you know that sounds plausible. Well, you know what? I don't like the other side. And now they hate him and they don't even know why they hate what's right because their soul is filled with the lies and deception, the hate that those people who are spewing it out, it's going in whoever's watching it. The anointing can pass into people listening, but the bad stuff can pass into you. Also, if you keep listening, it says to guard your heart. That is your soul. For out of that soul will flow the way you live your life. That's what the issues of life is. Your whole life will change by what you're listening to. And it can even be your own words trashing something all the time, which is what he's doing. So he's speaking against what God has put on the earth and even in you. So you need to come against that stuff. You need to maybe send the host against those spirits of wickedness and lies and deception to pull that stronghold off of him, number one. But make sure you're releasing the anointing. It's the best thing you can use. It's the number one thing we're given. Even at the day we got born again, you got that anointing. That's one of the powerful things he gave you. It's there. He said it's there. It destroys the yoke. So that should destroy the yoke that's now on him. And you say, I'm praying and declaring that that yoke of darkness will be destroyed off of my husband. It can be free to love and free to live and free to hear God. And that's releasing anointing in the food he eats, like in the whole refrigerator and everything. Anointing in his closet, everything he's clothing he wears will have the anointing. You are so getting him consumed with that anointing. And eventually there is going to have, something's going to happen. And you will see it when it happens. That's a good thing. I don't think it was this woman, but there was another woman who said, my husband has finally forbidden me to watch Kat on the air. What am I supposed to do? Any? The same thing I'm telling the other woman to do. Same thing. Same thing. The anointing destroys any yoke of darkness. It doesn't matter what it is. It destroys it. I know we say that the anointing breaks the yoke, but actually the real word, that real word that says breaks, it actually means destroys. So it destroys all those yokes of darkness, whether it's hate, if it's deception, if it's lies, if it's an anger or unbelief, those are yokes. And that anointing was given to us so that it would break it, especially in our own family. It has a great impact on that. And I even tell people, if you're still hugging family members, you can say quietly when you hug them, I release the anointing so they don't hear it said, but say it. But I'm telling you what, if they live in your home, you have every opportunity to lay on their bed, put it on their pillow, put it in their bed, put it in their clothes, put it in the food. There is going to be a major reaction to the anointing that's breaking and beginning to destroy that yoke that's on that person. We have seen it over and over the testimonies we have, and just because I used to train people to do that, it was the first thing he had me teach. Besides the fact, I talked about heaven all the time. Everything he said is you will teach him how to use the anointing. It is a weapon, and they get it the day they're born again. So when we hug our loved ones, anyone that's running from the Lord, I'll use those words with me, hug them. We just say, under our breath, I release the anointing. Yeah. And then make sure if they're going to eat dinner at your house, make sure you release it in the food they're eating, and the plates, you know, go lay your hands on all the plates in your cabinets and the cups and everything. It sounds wild, but it really does work. It works. Amazing. Amazing. I'm excited. All right. All right. This sounds like Malachi, Milachi, whatever. Can you explain what the kingdom of God is? For example, Matthew 633 says, seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. That's her question. The kingdom is the same thing Christ talked about. He talked about a spiritual kingdom. That's he, when he talked about the gospel of the kingdom, that is a spiritual kingdom. That is a real kingdom that operates in the spirit realm. You're not going to walk up to a castle here that says, it's not a flesh and blood thing. It is the spiritual thing. And the kingdom of heaven, of course, is part of that spiritual kingdom. But on the years you operate in it, by doing one of the things I just told you, that is a weapon. Clearly it is a spiritual weapon. And yet it says what it does. It clearly says in the Bible, it destroys the oath. You have that weapon. You can't see it or touch it, but it's in you. And when you begin to release it, it actually impacts that spirit realm. And you're operating in the kingdom. When you do that, because you're using a spiritual weapon it gave you, when you speak truth to people to break off deception to them, you're operating in the kingdom. Every time you pray, you're operating in the kingdom. When you declare you're operating in the kingdom, when you help people, you're operating in that kingdom that Christ talked about, that it was so valuable that you give up whatever you can to get that kingdom. It is a spiritual kingdom. When you get to heaven, you have the full understanding of that. But the weapons he gives us now here, it says our weapons of warfare people. Remember what warfare is? It's when you come against something. You fight against the darkness and the evil. And you think, I can't do anything. I'm just a little human being. Oh yes, you can if you're born again, because you will now, a new creation means you now have supernatural abilities in you. You have supernatural weapons to use in the spirit realm, that you will really mess up the devil's plans. You're going to mess them up. So that kingdom he talks about is, he said, you cannot see it with your human eyes. But it's there because you're here. You have a spirit man. You can operate through your spirit using these weapons. And you can do wonderful, powerful things against the enemy, which is one of our, one of the things that we're called to do as a believer. That's what we're called to do. We rule and reign with Christ when we use those weapons. There are spiritual weapons against the spiritual darkness. Spiritual darkness is always against every evil, wicked, human flesh person. They're wicked because they're listening to the evil spiritual realm, the evil spiritual beings, which you have power over all the power of the enemy. Our enemy is Satan. So any demons disembodied spirits, I can go through this whole long list about that for three years. I did nothing but preach about the darkness out there and how to come against it. I did that for a long time. And so it's in me. I do it automatically. But you as a believer are powerfully and wonderfully made. That's what the scripture says. He didn't leave you without help. Number one, the Holy Spirit is here to help you all the time. Christ will never leave you. When you invited him in, he actually does step in. He's in there. He's there to help you, to help guide you with the Holy Spirit. But he gave you weapons, people. The word of God, not the one with half the verses scripted out. Okay. I'm not talking about the one that wiped out the truth and they want to put their interpretation in there. I'm not talking about that. And let me tell you that's happening a lot everywhere. And make sure you get a Bible that has all the verses in it. Yeah. And not things. Some are removing chapters because they don't like what it says. They want to make everything okay for everybody, no matter how wicked or evil we are. Hey, that's the agenda of the left. Doesn't it sound like that? Totally is. They want everyone to accept evil and wickedness. That's why they're spreading it. That's why they will never make anything good because there's no good in them. They can't even think that way. All they can think is destroy, take, steal, crush. That's what they're all thinking. That's what that whole agenda is for them. And yet Christ came to bring you life and life more abundantly. So we're supposed to have abundant life with Christ. Regardless of what else is going on around us. And maybe if you start using the anointing for what it is, it is a weapon to come against the spirit of the darkness. You will begin to see things shift even for you. So good. He didn't owe us without his blood, the most powerful thing ever in all time. The only thing that wipe away your sins and give you entrance into heaven. Satan hates it. The word of God, the word spoken, the word written is so powerful in the spirit. Satan hates that too. He doesn't like the light of God in you, but he can't stop it from coming. The greater relationship you create with Christ, the more light you have in you. It says one time at one time, even the night will be light round about you. That's you going outside at night and seeing a light coming from yourself. It is going to happen in the manifest of sons and daughters. I won't just read the word. I actually believe it and I live it. I live that word. People who don't understand that have never lived or understood even what it was. Why is it written in there? It's not just a nice story. A bad thing that happened. It is an agenda of God to let you see yourself as a new creation. You get part of his DNA in you. You get a stone of fire that gives light to your spirit man in you. And you get born again. You get a deposit of the anointing. You are so full of God right now as a believer, but you have no understanding. Right. That. Yeah. Let me ask this. Okay. We just read seek first the kingdom of God. And then with that or. Okay. Put that aside for a moment, not aside, but let's change the subject where. God came to you and said in 20, I think it was 2012. You said the kingdom age has begun. What's the difference between seeking first the kingdom of God. And now suddenly living in the kingdom age. There's a very big difference because the word talk is about when things will actually happen. Things that will come that will bring change. It changed a lot. Okay. When John the Baptist started saying, okay, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Yeah. He understood. He probably was one of the few people that actually understood. He knew heaven was about 10 days. He knew the Messiah was coming. He knew that he would die for the sins. He knew these things. And that change started when Christ was born, when he was sent from heaven to earth and planted in the womb of Mary by Holy spirit. That did happen. That happened. Things begin to change when she began to achieve. He was being birthed, not birthed, but he was being, you know, growing inside of her. Angels would come and tell her things. She knew things were going to change. She knew they would be different. When Christ born, things really began to change even rapidly, more rapidly. And at that time, Satan knew somebody had come. That's why he tried to find out from the, you know, from the wise kings. He questioned the wicked king and questioned them. But Christ was hidden and hidden and hidden, even sent to Egypt for a while because he was bringing change to this world by who he was. And then when he began to minister, then openly people began to see how things changed when he was around. And it was so powerful that he gave his life for us. When he gave his life for us, he made a way back to the place we came from. We all came from heaven. We lived in the Father. He is our Father. We are His offspring. The Bible says that the real change to happen once Christ was on this earth, it began to demonstrate and manifest the power of God. He stopped the storms. He walked on water. He increased time or he slowed time down. He created food. He made regular water into heaven's wine. You saw one miracle after another. One miracle after another began to happen. They haven't stopped happening. As the days grow closer, where the kingdom, the kingdom age would be brought to this earth, we would know more and more about it. That's part of my job is to let people know what is this kingdom? What is this kingdom? Why is the kingdom age here? So you can operate in it fully, understanding who you are, what the weapons he gave you, that would bring hope for people's lives, help for people's lives, that they would see people walking the earth that didn't sin on purpose, that could hear the word of God and demonstrate his power throughout the earth. That was the purpose of the kingdom age and it did start in 2012. All the way up to that, being a seer and understanding the prophetic, I felt something stronger and stronger coming and a lot of people announced what came in 2010 or 2010. I think that's the right way to say it. They could feel it coming closer and closer, but until the day came, and we literally in time, in time, if you were a seer, we stepped from a threshold of time into a time we've never had before. And that is when the manifested sons and daughters would be seen in the earth. That's why the earth was interveiled for us to stand up and start demonstrating who he is. The miraculous, like that people would be raised when the dead that were created. I mean, miraculous things will happen in this kingdom age, because God is going to demonstrate that he really exists. He's going to erase the great area that says there is no God. Many things are happening in this kingdom age. And the kingdom will remain up until the time when Christ is seated on the throne in Jerusalem, even after the tribulation, which is a few years, people, a few years, and then Satan will be sitting on the bottom of the pit. Christ will sit on a throne in Jerusalem as king of this world. And some people won't even put that in the Bible. That's what I said. Make sure you're looking at the right Bible. They say that these things have already happened. None of these things have happened except the kingdom ages come. People begin to speak to the weather like Christ did, and it will obey. Things that we say will begin to happen because we serve Christ and we live here for him. If you had been... Well, I was going to say, Kat, if you had been the only person and the first person who ever said that, I thought, well, Kat's going to be off here because that's not like anything I've ever heard. But years before I met you, my spiritual father, Wade Taylor, said in 2012, when it was 2012, he told me the kingdom ages come. He was 88 years old when he passed a couple of years after that. And I thought, what is he talking about? And then I later found out that Arthur Burke had said the same thing. Also, he's gotten to be with the Lord. So when you said it, that's the voice of two or three witnesses have absolutely agreed that 2012 this thing happened. I don't know why he picked out that year. I mean, Obama was in office. I mean, what did he pick that year? But I don't know what you... He loves to pick years when adversity is there. And I'll tell you why. People will actually listen because they need help and hope. Yeah. And he knew all this stuff was going to happen. He knew it, but he has got to fully expose the evil. It's not just about the devil having a heyday taken over. God is letting them on purpose expose how evil and wickedness operates. Well, socialism really does to you, but communism really does so people can see for themselves. It's not good. That doesn't mean he's doing it to hurt anybody. He's not doing that on purpose, but he has to have a time when the evil is exposed. It will be crushed and it will be pushed back because in these glorious years coming on the earth, it will be like a whole new earth, not a whole new earth, but a whole new thing happening on the earth. And favor will be given to believers. And there's people out there that wouldn't even believe me. Well, that doesn't matter. Maybe you'll be in heaven. Don't have to be concerned with it. I didn't mean that. Anyway, you cannot stop the plans of God. They couldn't stop Christ from coming. They couldn't stop the Holy Spirit from coming. They couldn't stop it from raising from the dead people. They could not stop Jesus from going in hell and wasting it. No one can stop what's going to happen this time. God's timeline. He has a timeline and the events. They're not dates. I walked up there. I didn't see one day to solve events. I saw these events happening on the earth. He didn't let me see to the end. I saw things that weren't happened. Hasn't happened yet. In heaven, you talked about, excuse me, and described that God has an event calendar. Not a date calendar, this event. But on earth, there's actually dates connected to it. We just don't know what those dates are going to be. We never know it. And when we think we've guessed it, we're almost always wrong from what I've seen. Yeah, that's what I don't ever guess. Yeah. Guessing is like wasted energy. So. You have to believe that God, you have to trust him. You have to trust him. You know, trust is very important. If you, if you, you begin to believe something, you go from believing to trusting, you actually put forth actions where you're trusting God for something. So you believe and then you begin to trust him, but there comes a day. And when you step from trust and you step into faith, you are never the same again. Never. And I had believed in God for so many years and trusted him probably for several decades. And then at one point I felt a shift in me and I said, what has happened? And a prophet literally truth called me on the phone who lives in South Carolina and said, the father had me call you to say these words. This day you have stepped into faith. Wow. Can you try to put into words. What that feels like to go from trust into faith? Cause we thought, I always thought trust was one of the ultimate things, but you're describing faith as like the next step up. If you will, what, what, what does that feel like? And if you can even think of an example, so people could go, oh, that's what I'm striving for or contending for or believing for. You want to, you want to step into faith because faith, it makes it feel the most amazing feeling you're everything. I felt such freedom, like freedom came. Freedom because I had been obeying God and I've been obeying him and everything. You asked me, I obeyed it. No matter how silly it was or why would you ask, I don't even ask him why he does anything. I, that's called trusting. When you get to trust and God says, do this and you know it's him and you do it and how amazing your life will be for that moment. But when you step into faith, everything he says after that, you were already living it on the inside. It's like there's not even one ounce of doubt. It leaves you, doubt leaves you. Doubt can't even get in you. None of the stuff that left the saying, it can't penetrate me because I'm a living in faith. I've stepped into faith. So no matter what anyone says to try to stop me from saying anything, it's not going to work. When you get to the place where you're there and God says you're there, then no matter what he says, you know that you know that you know it's happening. It is happening because you have stepped from trusting. You stepped into faith. It's an actual place that you step into. And from that moment, your faith gets so huge. It's like it's unstoppable. Not that I must have a month, but whatever God says to me or shows me, I know that I know that I know this is happening. So when you know that, you know that, you know, is living in me, it's not somewhere up here. I'm trying to find it as an example. When you know that, you know that, you know that, you know, Trump is coming back. There's no, you've moved beyond trust to faith. It's so real that no one could talk you out of it. No, they can't talk me out of it because I know it's going to happen. It is absolutely going to happen people. It's going to happen. And the great thing is you, you're standing in that faith. You know it's going to happen. Nobody can try to take it is something they can't take away from you. It isn't just something you hurt when you're in faith. You already know it's going to happen. You know it, but I'm not out there blasting people wrongfully using people. I'm not using, you know, nasty words or hurt people. I'm just not doing it. I'm going to stay right where God has me. So my words have power. They have power for hope, for blessing, for greatness. They have power in them. Part of that power is the faith that I'm in now. But anyone who is a believer can go after that. This is nothing I'm doing as hell from you. It depends on what you want. What do you want from him? Do you want to know him more? You want more of him? You want more of his presence? More of his words? You have to pursue them. Yeah. Do you want to get blessed? Well, then bless other people because you probably won't get anything without blessing. Blessing is like a seed where there's money, where there's actual health. Do you help people with things or help give revelation to them? Or maybe you're just helping them do something they really need to do. That always does something to the heart of God. So if you want to be blessed, you will have to bless first because then you're trusting God. You're not doing it to get something. Right. You truly want to bless. Yeah. I love to bless people. I love to help people. It's like, it's a part of me now. And when that faith becomes a part of you and he says it, and I know people who have already gotten there, they know that he's saying what he's saying is going to happen. That's why Hank won't change what he's saying. He knows, he knows, he knows he's already in faith for that. God said it. He showed us that he knows it's going to happen. Yeah, when you go, when you went from trust to faith, now that you're in faith, it sounds very, very powerful. Will that faith grow? Will it get more? Or is it? It does. It does. It grows and grows and like the kingdom always, always, always grows. Right. It'll never stop growing. It increases. You're going to increase in every way because it says he desires above all things. Right. That you be in health. By the way, that's living in health. Right. He wants you to prosper. Number one, above all things, he wants you to prosper. Prosper doesn't just mean money. It means the way you're living, the things you're saying, the impact you're having on people, that that's prospering in all your ways. You're prospering. That means with your relationships, with what you're doing, if you own a business, what you're doing in the church or what you're doing to help other people, there's always going to be increased. That's prospering. That's an action of life itself. That's not just here's some money. He wants you to be in that place. And then even as you will prosper, even as your soul prospers, right? Right. He also wants you to prosper and live in health. BE means a way of life. Christ became poor that we might be rich. That's his plan. Poverty is not the father's plan. Okay. So it says even as your soul prospers, you will then live in health and you will prosper. Your soul has to prosper. So if you're feeling your soul with bad news or bad words that you're speaking, or you don't even like yourself, your soul can't prosper. We can't do those other two things. Your soul has to prosper in order for you to prosper and live in health. It has to prosper. It prospers by reading the word, speaking the word, saying God's promises, saying what God is wanting to do right now, not the left, not what your friend is saying, if it's not aligning with God, the more your soul prospers, the more life it puts out, not just gets in. The more you will prosper in all your ways and you will begin to live in health. That is called divine health. Let's use this as the last question since I've done two shows today. So I'm going to cut it a bit shorter, but I'm in health, but I'm tired. So a person, and I can put myself in this, but I don't really suffer a lot from this, but I suffer some from this, where people will say, well, I don't like myself. I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I, how much I weigh. I don't like the way, you can just list and listen to this, but you just said, if you don't like yourself, I don't consider myself a person that doesn't like myself. But I don't like certain things about myself. Talk to people and myself. How do you move that needle from, I don't really like what I see in the mirror. I don't really like what God did to make me, how he made me, to, to, to liking yourself so that you can prosper. Talk about that. I'll tell you right now, that's why you can't prosper because what is the whole thing goes back to as a man thinker in his heart. When he says that word heart, he's not talking about your human flesh beating heart. He's talking about your soul. Here's your soul. Right? This is your soul. Here's your soul right here. It's like this. There's a beautiful column with etchings and writings on it. That is your will. And on top of that is your spiritual mind, your mind, your will, and your emotions are all the layers of you, that's how you're made, and those emotions, and whatever you put in those layers, words you said about yourself, the more you feel what was the things you don't like, it's not going to change. It can't change because what are you feeding your soul? You're feeding negative things that you don't like about yourself. You don't like how you live. You don't like the way you look. You don't like what's happening to you. That's why that can't be changed. If you don't like who you are, stop saying the things about you you don't like and say, this may not be perfect when I look in the mirror, but God is going to perfect it. And I'm going to love the way I look, however way he wants me to look. I'm going to love what he does with me. I'm going to love what he says to me. My souls begin to prosper this day because I'm no longer beating it up. And I won't listen to people that beat it up because the other reason why you can't prosper is everyone around you saying negative things to you. You were just made that way. That's just the way. That's your destiny. You can't change that. You lose those words out of you. You cannot keep them in your soul. Not even words you said. You cannot keep them in your soul because that's what you will become. You will become what you were saying you think you are. And I have done this with so many people. It's almost not ridiculous, but it happens the same way every time. You have to say, I repeat for saying all those negative words about me. I lose everywhere those words from my soul, from my mind, my will, my emotions. I will not allow them to remain in Jesus' name. And then you say, I choose my will to like myself. I choose with my will to be blessed and to bless God for making me this way. I choose my will to be excited for whatever he has for me. You are then feeding power to your soul to change, causing your own soul. You don't need a whole world out there to do it. You don't even need a profit to do it. You watch over your own soul. You are the keeper and watcher of your own soul. You are. And the way you talk and the way you think, the things you choose to go watch. What are you watching? You watching murders? Are you watching things that are horrible? Are you watching profanity? Are you watching witchcraft? Because guess what? You're feeding your soul. You're feeding your soul profanity, witchcraft, and violence. Do you think that your soul is going to prosper? You need to take a whole, you need to look at a soul checkup, you need a soul checkup people. You need to see, what am I watching on a regular basis? What words are coming out of my mouth, okay? What have I looked at? What have I read? Is it negative? Is it bad? Is it wicked? Get rid of it, people. Because if you want your soul to prosper, and then you will prosper and live in health, you better be. That's what it says to guard it. You're guarding it. You don't let garbage in, and you don't put garbage out. Garbage comes out of your mouth, it goes in your own soul. Every time you blast someone, that goes in your own soul. You can't stop it. It's just the way we remain. Your soul, and what you put in it is what you will become, and no one on this earth is going to change that. You can change who you are. If you don't like the way you look, if you don't like the way of what's happening, if you're upset about everything else, you're feeding your soul those words. If you want that soul to begin to prosper and the light of God to grow in it, and you actually get happy, then start saying positive things. I'm not talking about positive, I'm thinking, you really be positive about things. Maybe you had a friend that you liked, but they always end up by saying something nasty to you. I lost all those words that were spoken against me, that were nasty, that were harmful, that were bashing. I lost everyone, no matter where they came from. If I listened to it or somebody said it, I lost everyone in the mind of your soul, Jesus comes and goes, and it's like they were never there. Yes, they're going to start to feel different. Then you begin to thank God. I thank you, God, for my life. I thank you for letting me be born this time. Thank you for letting me be great for you. Thank you for bringing happiness to me. Show me, Holy Spirit, what to say, and when to say it. I give you permission to remind me to say things that are positive. Then you are on the road for your soul to actually prosper. God can give you more, do more with you, and use you more, because He wants you to go up to a person, they go, oh, this is horrible, what's going on today. Now, these are not my own words. It's bad. Do you think that we're all going to go down a hole somewhere? Do you think I'd walk away in the store if someone said that to me? There is no way that's happening, because I'm not keeping their words in my soul. I say, well, let me explain to you something. There is a God, and He's alive, and I know Him. He's got great plans for this service, and this wicked stuff you see going on is all being exposed. He's going to move His hand, things are going to be going to happen, and you're going to be so happy with your life. So stop saying the words you just said. If I were right in front of Him, I choose to lose all the negative words, I plant positive words. I believe in the life of God, the presence of God. I know He's got great plans for us. I know these are powerful days coming on the earth, and they're watching you in the grocery store. That's good. Man, that felt good. That was so strong. Do you really believe that I said yes, and why don't you? I don't just listen to this negative garbage. It comes from hell, and sometimes I'll go, the words you just spoke, hell told you those words. If you're feeling bad, you don't like yourself, you're believing those words, and if you get stronger, you're actually repeating those words. So stop marketing hell. Why not market heaven? And that is my... Oh, God. Well, you know, this is one of those episodes that people, including myself, need to listen to more than once, two or three times. There's so much meat. You can bring hope in your day-to-day life, no matter where you go or who you see. You can bring hope by saying what is truth, and God does care, and He is doing something. You may not see enough, but you're going to see this happen, and I'll even tell people, you remember this day, when I told you things would be changed and they would be great, and you will be celebrating in the street when God brings in what He's doing this time, because He has judged the evil, and then I'll walk away, say something, people, say something that brings hope in life to people. They hear enough death and garbage everywhere. It's so good, so good, so, so, so, so good. Well, can't talk about revealing heaven.com and your other website before we close. Yeah, I do have two websites. I really didn't name either one of them, but you know, the father tells me what to say, and I always obey. He named my book, Revealing Heaven, so we made our first website, revealingheaven.com, and we have a lot of products there. We actually got some new things in already that will be taken with us to Nebraska. I'm excited about it. We have some new things that represent heaven, and that's another part of my job to reveal and create heaven on this earth, so that's what you find, revealingheaven.com, and catcur.com. That is a spiritual platform that doesn't listen to any negative or evil or wickedness. It gives you all kinds of revelation in there. We have videos you can watch. You can see interviews done by people who ask me certain questions that are really great. We have a gallery of things what they look like in the spirit realm, like I think you can see what an aquamanchen looks like that I saw in heaven. You can see how even in the transportation looks like in the spirit realm. You ride on beams of light, travel on paths of light. That's what Christ did when he stepped into the spirit realm and walked through the bodies of the people. When they were going to throw him off that cliff, he said he passed through the people. He didn't say he passed around. He took one little sidestep into the spirit realm, spirit realm supersedes this physical realm, and he passed right through the people and they never saw him. You see kinds of things like that in there. There's also all kinds of decorations and things that can train you to let you know things in a greater way. There's testimonies on catcur.com, and it's the only way to give to me online. No other person's Facebook or whatever is out there. I don't ask people to give me money in any of the videos, not on YouTube or Facebook. I'm not going to do that, but people will take my stuff. They say, well, you need to give money to this missionary camp. That's not going to be great to the pocketbook people. Other people asking me to get your money, and I'm not doing it. You have to ask to go to catcur.com, click on the treasury if you want to be a part of helping to support Heaven's plan to bring Heaven to Earth. So good. Cat, we love you. Love you. Love you. Thank you so much. Would you go ahead and pray for the people as we close out? I know you've got great declarations, so go for it. Yeah, Father, I thank you for this day, this glorious, beautiful day that you have made. A day for things to be great for us on the earth. A day for us to know you more, to hear you clear, Father. This is a wonderful day, and you have purposed this day. Satan doesn't own this day. His people don't own this day, even the person sitting in the highest seat of the land. That's stolen. But Father, we know what's going to happen to those people, and I thank you for your plan for all of that to happen. But right now, Father, I just impart the life of God, the presence of God, His will, His way. I evict all evil, every evil spirit. Get out of everyone listening to this broadcast right now in Jesus' name. I thank you for showing us how to rule and reign with Christ's Son, who actually the entire earth belongs to. If I serve, I will not serve another. There's nothing darkness in me. There's no evil in me. There's light, there's love, there's the power of the living God. Thank you, Father, for showing them and giving them a taste of you so they will run after you. Your Son died on that cross because you asked Him to pay a price, and He did. Our lives for all eternity will be great. They will be excited. There will be so many amazing things to do with you, and I'm looking forward to eternity. Right now, I'm on this earth, and I'm not going anywhere until you say I go. Father, I hope they know you that well, and can think of you that powerfully, that they know who they are in Christ. Christ in you is the hope of glory, and God is powerful. He's represented with the light of God, and the power of God, and it will cover this earth like the waters cover the sea one day. I hope you're carrying it. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much, Cat. You are a dear friend, and you and I just become better friends all the time.

happy Wednesday everyone August 31 2022 our apologies were much later than normal but we will recover it'll be so good it'll be worth worth the way pardon I still have a cough I got one cough drop left right here well we may do that I don't know how this cough comes and goes but it does but anyway I wanted to say to the group to the to our viewers as you many of you know we're off of YouTube right now we got notified either this morning or last night whenever whatever that happened so they decided one of our guests said something and that's strike two and and the notice I looked at today said one more strike and you're removed from the channel so we're trying not to do that but anyway we're not on YouTube today and I think I heard that it will be two weeks someone can mention that in my chat if it if it's two weeks but anyway we're off right now we're going to and yes it's two weeks at least it says so we will be emailing you daily to let you know that we're reminding you that we're not on YouTube so please please forward or text or email as many of your friends as you can and say they're here but they're on rumble only because of all of this junk that's going on you say it in those words or any other words but we are continuing to be flexible and flow with what happens so that if this goes down we have that right now we are on rumble we are on Facebook and we're on Elijah list calm so we try to be careful we're talking code today we don't have to be careful at all because we're not on YouTube so they're gonna probably in my personal opinion people will never forget all the times they were kicked off I doubt that YouTube will last but I'm not saying that as a prophetic voice but you know we're all looking for alternatives you know maybe when this gets over and they got new leadership maybe it won't matter anymore so all right let's show I want to to keep before you new ads that we're developing that shows the the wells the freshwater wells we're digging in Uganda we're over 50 freshwater wells we're digging a new freshwater well every five days there's been 300 salvations at last report which means there's more now and there've been eight church plants so this is because of your generous generous generous donations and as I've said before a significant portion of what you donate to this ministry not only keeps us going but we feel called by the Lord to to tide if you will that money into many freshwater wells it's a lot more than a tithe but God has blessed us for doing that so we've got a quick promo on that so without further delay let's go ahead and play that Emily you Thank you again so much for your donations to support this, these wells. The Lord thanks you. I can say by the Spirit, the Lord is thanking you. Great rewards, he says in the scriptures, even if you give so much as a simple cup of cold water to one of these, you will surely not lose your reward. So that's what the Lord said, not us. So thank you for doing that. I truly believe that the Lord has shown me that when you get to heaven one day, when it's your time to go, there will be little children, maybe hundreds of them will come up to you and say, thank you because of you. We had fresh water and because of fresh water, I received the Lord. So thank you. So that's an amazing thing. We really, really, really appreciate your giving. So thank you so much. We are in an intense time. We have about eight weeks, nine weeks maybe for the election. There are, this is not prophetic, but there are some people that say, are we even going to have an election because things are getting intense? I believe, I hope there will be an election if there is and when there is, be sure that you overwhelm the system by voting, but many of you, more of you voting than they expect to vote. You need to overwhelm the system because they can't recover from that. Greg Phillips was, of 2000 mules was on and last week or the week before and said, that's the way to do it. You got to overwhelm the system. So anyway, between now and then make sure the deep state is going to try and prevent this election. We know that that's what they want to do because they know they're going to lose if we get, if the election goes through, be sure your gas is full, keep your tank topped off, keep your groceries of non perishables. Don't just fill up your refrigerator because what if the power goes out? So make sure you have non perishable, we even have powdered milk sitting in there and canned goods and cereal non perishable things that you can open the can and make sure you have a can opener too. Because a lot of people have those electric can openers, which may or may not work if they do something serious. I'm not prophesying that I'm just saying make sure your pantry is as full as you're able to do it and extra for others if you're able to do that. So I just wanted to tell you that we are, these are not going to be a normal eight weeks between now and then the deep state does not like you and me and believers and conservatives. In fact, they, you've heard several of our guests say they basically want something like nine out of 10 or they want to bring the population down to 500 million, which is, which is the population is what that's what the population. I looked up what was the population at the time of Christ coincidentally it was 500 million. That's what they want to bring 7.5 billion down to is 500 million, which is, which means that it's their desire and we've said this on the air. This is not some shocking new thing. It's their desire to depopulate the earth now they're not going to succeed. We're going to bring Patricia Katker sorry on in just a moment and she has seen into the future. They are not going to succeed at that. And so we want you to know that, but we do know that they're going to want to try. So make sure your gas is full and you're in your pantries just full as you're able to do it. You have extra water, anything that you think you might need. If you can't go to the store for two weeks or three weeks, have it have a good supply there. All right. I think that's all for today. Thank you again for your support and let's bring in Katker. So it's Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Well good morning Kat or I guess you should say it for you. It's good afternoon in it back into Florida, right? Yes I am in Florida and I guess it's afternoon. One said that your clock was off today or something. It was all three of the clocks and it's not my job to replace batteries. Okay. I do sweep and clean the floors and clean up stuff and I mean, I do do that kind of thing a lot, but I don't put batteries in the clock. So none of them were right and they were one was an hour and a half off home was an hour off and one was like two hours late. And so none of them helped me and I have something to say and so yeah, go for it. Go for it Kat. The father wants you to know that you should fear never, not ever, never in this day. He didn't give anyone a spirit of fear in case you wonder if you have fear that's not from him. So there's number one point number one if you're in fear, I'm not saying maybe you're a little concerned about things, I'm thinking if you're in real fear, that is not God. God's not putting fear in you. He's not going to say fearful things to you. He made you powerful. Right. He gave us a spirit of a sound mind. Remember that right power, love and a second gave it to us. That's what he put in you when he made you. So therefore he told me to take authority over. So right now father take authority over all fear, no matter who's experiencing it, no matter where it is in this world. I cancel you, I evict you from everybody's home, from their soul in Jesus name and I impart the life of God, the love of God, the power of God, the will, his way in Jesus name, celebration, expectation of what you're going to do father, not what the devil has planned, who's the Lord of the Flies by the way, just remember that Jesus Lord of hosts, Saint Lord of Flies says about all the wills that he has, so we thank you this day father that fear is evicted, joy and celebration, which is what you talk about, it's okay to be practical, but don't ever let fear interfere in your life in Jesus name, amen, amen, amen, and don't take all the toilet paper, don't take all the toilet paper, I've been, I've been collecting it. We've been collecting it for a few months on, I mean, we have that much, but you know, we collect it while they had plenty, because I don't want to run on the TP. Yeah, it was a good plan, collect it while there's plenty. Isn't it amazing, what did we do in this world on the earth before we had toilet paper? You know, it wasn't that many years ago they invented that, they actually invented toilet paper. I don't want to think about it. Paul Harvey had a story where there was this train full of certain, it wasn't cut up, it was rolls or something, and it didn't make its destination, something went wrong, or the guy went bankrupt or something, and someone had the idea to cut these up into smaller rolls or something like that, and it became toilet paper, he said, let's make it toilet, yeah, it was something like that. I've tried to find that article or that audio by Paul Harvey, because you know, no one told the story like Paul Harvey, you know, and he goes, and now you know the rest of the story, you know, yes, and putting it into everybody will know the rest of the story. Yeah. Yeah. Now you don't see Kat, we know that the deep state hates us. We know that they don't, that they would like to depopulate, but what has God showed you is going to actually happen? There will be no gross massacres, there will be no mass killings or dying, nodded on this time. God sent, if you think about from the Father's point of view, he sent people to the earth that he needs here right now, he needs this many people, all the ones who are here now, he sent here specifically, he timed your birth on the earth, he needs you, and in these days coming months and years coming, there will be so much activity for the body of Christ to do, even good moral people to do, new inventions, he's still sending them people, so if it wouldn't be half wiped out, that wouldn't be possible, which is why, by the way, I want to say something, it isn't that they hate us people, it's that they're very afraid of us. Oh, wow. Quite a small correction in there, the Father says, Satan doesn't hate you, he is afraid of you. Wow. Wow. Satan is the doormat, we are not a doormat, we were given power and authority, he was not given power and authority. We have legions of angels, more of the hosts ever than there is a demonic, they fire out number them, they're bigger than them, and they're ready to do things in this time on our behalf, so more than ever before the activity, what you will see is activity of the host of heaven in this world, individually doing things for people, even in groups of people, you'll see a risk is being done that would not have happened in any other way, God is about to show off his power, Satan will not get his chance, now you need to understand God has a timeline, I've seen the timeline, we're not near the end, we're near the end of the way we will be operating because we'll be in authority, in power, we'll have the great positions, we'll have the inventions, that's what is planned for our lives by the one who made you, not the one who would like to wipe you out, the reason why he wants to kill, steal all of your stories, he's afraid, he knows this is not his time people, he knows he's trying to make a rush to take it early, and guess what, do you think the God of all creation is going to let the Lord of the Flies take over right now? I think he's about to get a lot of insect bites himself, let me tell you right now, what is going to happen is God's plan, not even man's plan, not wicked man's plan, not hell's plan, okay, I don't care what their plan is, it always fails, so don't let fear be the one thing that controls you, because Satan's really good at that, he knows how to use fear, if he can get you to think about all the negative all the time, then you probably will dwell on that, you're not supposed to, he's supposed to walk in power and authority, he's supposed to rule with Jesus Christ, I haven't seen that openly happening in many places, but it's going to be, to the point the Father said, that the world will want you as a friend or to know you because you're a believer, that is how different it's going to be if you want to see your future, that's your future, not running around afraid you'll starve to death, Satan's wicked armies will come to get you and drag you away, that is not, this is not the end, this is not the time of the perilous times, this is not the tribulation people, it's hundreds of years away, and I don't mind saying that because guess what, I'll still be here saying that and you'll be enjoying heaven, so you need to understand, you say God's will, God's way, God's will not mine, but his, because when you live his will his way, you'll have celebration, anticipation, expectation of greatness in you, you were sent here to be great, not to watch the parade go by, we're supposed to be leaders, we're supposed to be the ones people look up to for answers from heaven, and man's mindset and man's head knowledge cannot come up or equal revelation from the one who made us, he knows every thought of everybody, he knows where every wicked person is, every evil camp, every hidden thing, there's nothing hidden from him, but he's going to expose all of it, and then justice is coming, he is not changing what he's saying, if you're tired of listening, don't listen, go sit with the Lord of the Flies and get a big fly swatter. Cap, do you still believe that while the deep state, especially these last few weeks before the election, I'm probably going to try a lot of things, do you still believe we need to get our popcorn out and our cake out and enjoy the show, is this a time to enjoy the show? You know I'm still enjoying the show, I will live the way the Father talks to me about, you have a choice, I'm not going to make you take what he says, but it's so easy and simple to take what you see with your human eyes, when you don't have just human eyes and you see the spirit realm, you understand, they are scrambling, to hang on to anything they can hang on to, and that would be the spiritual wickedness and the physical wickedness. They know, some of them already know, this whole thing is going to fail, they know it's going to fail. They're not saying that to their own groups, but they're very afraid, because it hasn't turned out the way they planned, because this is, this earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof, it's His. He gets to say what happens, we need to agree with Him. I'm not ignoring evil, I just don't participate in it, and when you continually repeat all of the stuff going on, I'm saying all day long, someone says what do you think about what's going on, you should say I think God has a plan, I think He's in charge and I'm on His side, because when you keep repeating what the devil wants you to repeat, you're marketing health plans, make you afraid, make you weak, strip the hope away from you, the joy away from you, you don't want to lose your joy, that's why the celebrate thing comes in. I can tell you I'm sure that Noah, it's a good thing none of you are Noah, you wouldn't have never lasted 120 years and this thing won't take 120 years, but who won in the end? I can tell you this, the Father has a plan for you, not just your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great great great grandchildren, He has a plan for you if you're alive and breathing, He has a plan for you, and that is to market what heaven is, be a testimony of what heaven is, demonstrate the power of the living God in this earth, not waiting for months to go by, you have authority right now, open your front door, kick out the devil, kick out every word, sound, image, thought, frequency of hell, if you've been watching the fake news, there's no wonder you're having issues, why not make news for God and say what He's doing in this world, setting it up for the greatest days this world will ever see until Christ sits on the throne and Jerusalem and yes, He is going to do that one day. There are people whose families and friends, close family and friends are really on their case, I have a few of those myself. Mine gave up. They gave up. Okay, I was going to ask you about that, so how do I ask this question? Is God going to in a sense vindicate, you know, vengeance is mine and all that, we don't want vengeance on our loved ones and family, but justice comes and redemption comes, is God going to redeem, vindicate whatever word we might choose, those who have held strong towards. I will say what is word, it's in power. Okay. He's going to empower those with authority and dominion who have stood and not stepped back. They will be some of the greatest leaders in this world, people will look up to them because they'll know all the time, don't stop saying what God has said, you don't stop saying it, because He is looking to see who's saying and what they're saying. Okay, He doesn't have to convince me to do it. I've seen Him in person and heard Him in person and I've seen the future. I know what the future is going to be, regardless of what the devil's trying to do, he's trying to do his great big takeover right now. He already knows it's going to fail, but he's going to take as many as he can get and he does that by crushing your dreams, by stealing your destiny. Your destiny is still waiting for you. You have to say yes to that, no to the devil, open your front door and he did anything of hell out or wicked man evicted out of your home, make a habitation for heaven and heaven in the presence of God will flood your home all the time. You have a choice, you have a choice, you can follow the Lord of Hosts or Lord of the Flies. By the way, you really mean that, of course the devil can be evicted through your walls, but you really mean open your door and let him out. If you mean that. That way if people come in and told you all the bad stuff going on or they have predicted, I won't even call it, I won't even say that they prophesied it. A true prophecy comes from God, not man's mind, by the way. It's words God spoke. He spoke them. He spoke them to somebody and said, you say this, you will say this. He's not going to tell somebody to say something that's against what he's been saying. Something that's fear getting in, they let control get in, like you said, have talked about Steve, people trying to pressure you. No one does that to me now because they know what they're going to get. Hands laid out on them. That's what they're going to get. Maybe not in the way they want to. But I will tell you this, I'm not backing up. I'm not backing up one single word that the Father has told me to say. One single thing I have been shown, guess what's going to happen? What God wants. What His plan is and what people don't see because they don't really know Him like they should know Him. They can know Him. Let's change it. They can know Him. The more you know Him, you understand how He works. He is mysterious. He's never going to do it man's way. He doesn't necessarily have to make you understand. He just says, this is going to happen and then He does it. That's good. That's good. The gospel of the Prophet is different than just the prophetic. I love the prophetic that people can see and hear and say things. It's an office, it's a place you sit in and you have authority in. So I cannot say what man is saying. I cannot agree with what they're saying. I'm not going to agree if it's against what God has said because in the end, Steve, who do you think will be celebrating the most? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I think you know John- Well, I guess what everyone else will be celebrating right along with them and they will enjoy the victory that's about to happen for us. I have no problem keeping some extra graham crackers in your closet if you want it. That's perfectly fine to do that and this day and age, it might not be a bad idea to have a few extra things around, but I do know God's not going to let anybody starve or die from starvation. He's not going to allow that. Okay. Johnny Enlo says a thing. He said it many, many times, so it's not one off thing, but he said it for a couple years now. He said, God had told him we are about to be safe from things we don't even know we need to be saved from. Is that a perspective you have? In other words, there's things that if we knew how horrific it was that God was about to save us from, maybe we'd even look at things differently. What are your thoughts about that? I know some of those things. Okay. Things it's hard to even say. But the key word is this, saved from them. Yeah, exactly. So God's plan is not to wipe us all out when he has built generations on purpose, generations like I'm seventh generation of really God doing things the way he wants to. He's been building generations with people who believe and will believe what he says. He's been building them. He's not going to, why wouldn't he let them be wiped out Steve, that doesn't even, that doesn't make sense. Okay. Right. Exactly. He's not going to do it. He's not going to get wiped out, this will not be a communist country, no matter what they say. They don't rule this country. No one sitting in the left or the hidden or the evil or the wicked or the White House or the Pentagon, anywhere else, they don't rule this country. We the people are in charge of this country and we will have what we say will happen. We will have it. I'm not talking about the darkness. What we say, justice, liberty and freedom, that is who we are, right in this moment that you're breathing, you're still free. God's not going to let that all be taken away from us, no matter how many lies they put out, no matter how many pictures they show people and they've not created one good thing. Don't expect them to do it. Don't expect them not to try to steal, cheat and lie again, but it won't help them at all because God is going to do what he's going to do and they will be brought to justice. I will not stop saying that. I will not stop saying that because that is what is going to happen. I trust him. If you know how important it was to trust God, when you begin to trust him, you begin to actually believe him. When you begin to believe him this season, you will step into a level of faith you never thought you could have. Wow. And after that, you are given a spirit of faith, a high level of faith and no one will be able to convince you that what God has said won't happen. They won't be able to. There's no way they can because you're living and walking in the spirit and not in your flesh head thinking and assuming and expecting what man has said will happen. They're wrong. If someone is afraid and they're struggling and they're having a hard time believing that and you said, if you will believe God, does that, in order to get there, does someone say, I don't feel it. It's hard to see it, but as an act of my will, I choose to believe. Is that how they do that? Absolutely. Because you know what you put in your soul is what you are. As a man thinking in his heart, your soul is at the heart or core of your being. It is a position. When he talks about the heart, he's not talking about this human beating heart, which side is that? I don't know. Whatever side is tongue beating. He isn't talking about your flesh heart when he says, as a man think it in his heart. He's talking about a position, very core heart of your being is your soul. Your soul is in the center of your being. Your mind, your will and your emotions, you know, that's what the devil is going after. Because even if he doesn't really have to do anything except control that, control what you believe, control what you say, control what you watch, control where you go. That's what he wants to do. We let him do it. Well, I stopped doing that a long time ago. Okay. I'm letting the spirit of God share with me and show me and encourage me. It says encourage one another. So if you keep sharing what the left is doing or planning or their absolute stupidity of who they think they are, they can't run at McDonald's, let alone this country. They don't know anything. They only know what Satan is putting in their soul, what wicked, evil people above them who are there controlling and some of them are about to die. So just get ready for that. Yeah. Wait a minute. Some are about to die. Yeah. Okay. So you did repeat it. So who are the some that are about to die? Just to be clear. Because you said it. Okay. This is like an Ananias and Sapphira time is what you're saying some is and I think a lot of order crossed over the line of living or dying. It's too late for them. What about what, because we, you know, when we think of Ananias and Sapphira, because I'm the one that use that, we think of people in the body of Christ. Are there people in the body of Christ who are about to leave this earth because they have chosen to not walk with them? I do know some are leaving the earth because their time is over. Okay. So don't confuse that. Yeah. You know, a great leader of God who died, I was not talking about, I said the wicked, evil people. Okay. The wicked evil who are trying to control all this stuff. Some of them. Okay. You may not even know who they are, but you will find out. You may not know who they are. Some of them are about to die. Yeah. I saw on the news. By the way, I could recommend this, there's a site called Citizen Free Press. It's kind of like a new dredge. It's conservative. And on that same day, I think it was yesterday, it could have been the day before, but I think it was yesterday, two different celebrities at the age of 32 suddenly died. Now, someone could say, well, that was the Vax, I don't know, but God is in control of life and death. And it was weird on the exact same day. And we don't know by looking at that, was it the Vax? Did they, uh, did they cross the red line with God? You know, you know, I don't know what to think about that kind of thing. I also don't want people, I don't want like believers and other people thinking maybe they crossed the line. You didn't cross the line people. He's talking about the wicked evil and some of them are hidden with evil who are actually the ones controlling. Cause I can tell you the ones in the White House aren't really running things. Not the real stuff. They're not really running it. They're being told what to say and told what to do by very wicked evil people. Some of those people, and that will affect them because then they won't have them telling them what to do. So you'll see a major thing happening in the White House, uh, probably confusion, probably a lot of confusion, more than normal confusion and other things began to like, it may even be quiet for a while because they, some of them won't know what to do now that the, the ones who thought they were going to take over everything, some of them are going to die. It's just going to happen. Like I said, I won't let them out. I won't allow them to remain on the earth. That is, those are his words. Some will die. I will not allow them to remain on the earth. So those are the ones that I'm talking about. I'm not talking about people in the body of Christ who maybe are messing around or something like that. I'm not talking about them. These are wicked evil people, more wicked than the ones in the White House. Are you in, I wanted to ask you about that. Cause that was interesting what you just said, cause we know that there's people in the basement as it were, or on the, on the earpiece as it were, or in literal, are you saying that the people that are giving the orders to the fake people in the White House, are you saying the people that are carrying out the orders are in a sense less wicked than the people that are giving them orders? I have to say that they are because they are, I know you will think that they, I'm not, I'm not cutting any of them slack and I'm not going to minimize any of the evil wickedness they did, but there are sort of what you were talking about earlier. There are more wicked people who may not even be in this country, but they're about to die. Some are going to die and it won't be expected and it will bring confusion. That's what happens in the enemy's camp when, and guess what? Satan doesn't even care if they die, he probably killed them and then he'll take them to hell and torture them more than anyone else is what he does. So you don't get anything. You gain no prize in hell when you're wicked and evil people, you get no prize, none. There's no prize in hell for anybody. And so if you, if that's who you're planning to be a part of or you are a part of it, you better get out of that really quick because it's telling you justice has already been sent, it's already been sent here. A gavel has already been stopped and no one's going to stop what God is about to do at all. And some of that, starting of it will be some, a couple, I'm not saying a lot, I don't expect 50 people to die, but there will be a couple that will die that will shock people. Wow. And maybe that shock factor that it's like who would have ever thought that might be a clue that that's one of those that were removed. It probably may not be anybody you even have heard about, not generally like living here and doing stuff here because most of those people who are in this country are the ones who are allowing to be used, paid to be used, or do it because they love evil. There's people who are over this, I'm sure Robin knows about that, that are, that are even more wicked and evil than the ones who are in the White House. The ones in the White House don't have a lot of brain. I'm just being honest, okay. And their normal brain thinking of a normal human being who's been through the 12th grade wouldn't be trying to do the stuff that they're doing because you're not going to run anything. You're going to run the end of the ground, which by the way is what they want to happen. They want to run the country into the ground, people. If you voted for them, repent for voting for them, God's going to do anything against you. You thought you were doing the right thing because of the whichever side you thought you were on. I'm on God's side, people. That's the right amount of righteousness, righteousness, justice, liberty, and freedom. That's the side I'm on. And at this moment, it happens to be the right. Yeah. Yeah. It's not that the right is so righteous. It's not that the Republicans are that much more righteous than the Democrats as a whole, but there was a more correct stance against abortion to name the big one, to name the one. Well, I think also a lot of those people did want our country to succeed. Yeah. I mean, they may have attitudes and they may not always be thinking the right thing, but generally most of that side is not going to go ahead and go along with the evil at all. They don't like it. They don't want nothing to do with it. And even major businesses, not talking about, you know, the media and all that, major well-known businesses don't like what's happening because they don't want to lose their business. Right. They don't want to. And even some of those who've remained silent, are you there? The thing you're going to start saying, some who remain silent are about to start speaking up. And are there, have you seen is what got showing you people that were, how do I just ask the question that were, let's say just two years ago, hard core left and they believed everything that was being told to them about the Democratic and the liberal establishment, whatever, who God has been slowly but surely softening. Have you seen some of that? I think it's bringing clarity to their mind about their own life and future is probably what he's been doing. The Holy Spirit can speak to anybody, even if he can speak to people who aren't believers, it doesn't mean he'll live in them, but he certainly can say things to them. Good. And their own angels can say things to them, you know, in their mind, stuff like this, you need to get out of this. This is not going to end well. This is wrong. I think he probably says something. This all is wrong. I'm sure he says that a lot to them, but you're right, Steve. There are people who are secular people and they have decided to change what they're thinking because just themselves looking at their own situation, not really participating in anything, are going to start speaking against what's going on because it's horrible government. It's no government at all. Okay. It's just control. And that's what they want to do is control. They're not even thinking they're happy and they're on the wicked, the wicked in the White House. Let's just say that you're thinking how much money they've gotten, how much control they have, and they're really excited that this whole thing's paying off for them. What they don't know is they're sinking themselves deeper in a pit than they ever knew would happen because those who are controlling don't care about them. And when, if they ever went the way they wanted it to, they would be taken out too. So evil doesn't love anybody. They hate, they kill, steal and destroy. That's what their plan is. That's why that's what looks like it's happening in the White House is because their mind is so seared right now. They can't see what's right, but they themselves can't figure out why isn't this getting better? I mean, literally, as stupid as the things are that they put out there, they can't figure out why, why they're making that happen. They don't think it's them. And it is them because this wasn't happening until that happened. Yeah. Can't live on this. And some people keep saying what God said, he is at his limit, he's at his limit. God does have a limit, people, you remember he did things in the past when he reached, when he was done with the evil and the day thereof, it was dealt with severely. And so I would say, you know, you yourself though, what you can do is give hope to people anywhere in the store, what people talking about, what's going on, it's all going to end wrong. We're all going to hell in a handbasket. It was going to hell in a handbasket, be a big handbasket will be the wicked and evil. Yeah. And I know, I can see it, that there are people that are on that side that will call the wrong side, for lack of a better word, they, they hated Christians, they hated conservative values, they hated anti-abortion, they were pro-choice, and I see some of them watching right now, and they're now waking up, they're going, what have I done? But now look what I've done, how do I get out of this now that I've made my bed, you know, the expression, you've made your bed, now you've got to lie on it. What would you say to some of those people who are waking up and then going, what have I done? What would you say to them? I would say you need to repent to God. Okay. I mean, you repent to Jesus Christ, you know, if you ever belong to Him, the things that are going on now, they are not Him, this is not His plan, He comes to bring a life and life more abundantly, where do you see abundant life? Have you produced abundant life, are they talking about having abundant life? I'm talking about the government, the illegitimate government, okay? No, because they don't care what happens to anybody, they're going to use and control, use and control, until there's no more use and control, and if you have voted for them, or you're still siding with them, or you're helping to promote them, I would really seriously ask you to just repent for all the stuff you've been involved with, to lose all the evil wickedness out of your soul, repent to God, and tell Him you want to be with Him on His side, you want Jesus Christ as your savior, and joy will flood your soul, and guess what, your eyes will be fully open to the darkness trying to take over not just this country, but the whole world, and that won't happen until the perilous times come, and the perilous times, this is not the perilous times, I know people think it is, but it's not. I've seen some of the perilous times, I've seen some of the tribulation, I've seen some of Christ sitting on the throne in Jerusalem, I've seen part of the millennial, whether you like that word or not, the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ, which by the way the Father said, you're not going to stop that from happening either, so stop taking it out of the Bible. Let me, let me, you know, Kat, you know me, I don't ever interrupt in the middle of the show to, to pray, or almost never, because I've got, you know, we're, we're getting through it, but I feel led right now, there's people watching, and they're going, what have I done, I voted the wrong, I'm looking around, it's all falling apart, I voted for this, I wish I knew how to repent, could you pray for those people right now, because there's a bunch of them, and they're going, all I just, just need is someone pray and tell me how to get out of this. Yeah, like I said, the first thing that I would do is lead you in a prayer of repentance, because when you've done wrong, and when you side with absolute evil, and I tell you, even probably 13-year-olds, 10-year-olds know that what's being said is wrong, I mean, children know it's wrong, and when you have the heart of a child, there's no evil in them, there's nothing that, that you know that, that they've had, been taken care of, they've been loved their whole life, but they can look around, they listen to anything on the news, they know that there's a mess going on, and they know that darkness, they know what evil is, my grandkids know what evil is, okay, they're young, but they know what it is, and so if you're finally gonna wake up, because I know God is shaking some people right now to wake you up, okay, he doesn't want you to lose what he's got planned for you, he doesn't want you to miss your destiny, Satan wants to steal and crush your destiny, so right now we say, I say, we would just say this together, Father, I choose with my will, to repent of all evil, to repent of being involved in voting for evil, to repent in being involved in voting for evil, I change my heart this day, I change my heart to say, and choose with my will, and choose with my will, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, I receive his will, I receive his will, his way, his way, I want his plans for this country, I want his plans for this country, and for my life, and for my life, I evict all evil and wickedness, all wicked and evil and deceiving words, they were spoken over the fake news, they were spoken over the fake news, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White House, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White House, I will lose all of them for my soul, I will live according to the Word of God, I invite Christ to abide in me i want to hear his voice i want to hear His voice i want to walk in the Spirit not to walk in the Spirit and not the flesh and not the flesh I choose to bind to my soul I choose to bind to my soul the love of God the presence of God the presence of God the life of God the life of God His will his will, his way, his expectation, his expectation of greatness, of greatness, and righteousness, and righteousness to be in this earth, to be in this earth, in Jesus name, in Jesus name, this day, this day, I step into a new place, I step into a new place, and I step out of the darkness, I step out of the darkness, I now serve the Most High God, I now serve the Most High God, I will not serve another, I will not serve another, amen, amen, very, very powerful, a lot of people got touched, a lot of people, wow, so yeah, hey, you know what, some of you watching, be sure you send this program to friends of yours, because there's some people that they're like right on the edge, and they just, you know, that you've seen them beginning to waffle about what they have believed, send this broadcast to them, forward it to them, or give them the link either way to do that, so that'd be awesome, awesome, well, you know, we have time for a few questions, anything else you want to say before we do that? Well, I do have a question to answer that someone has given me some time ago, I didn't get to answer it, they asked me, what role does Melchizedek play in our lives? Okay. Well, Melchizedek is a real being, he's not a human who died and moved to heaven, and the Bible says Melchizedek has no father, no mother, no beginning or end, which means he has always been with the father, and actually, Melchizedek is the father's personal high priest, Jesus Christ is our personal high priest, but the father is, he has Melchizedek who is sent to the earth on different assignments, at one point he was the king of Salem, he's one who received tithes, you know, when the tithes were being paid for the first time, he was on the earth, he received the tithes, Melchizedek has flesh, he's always had flesh, there's a whole tribe of angels made after the order of Melchizedek, which means they had flesh put on them, probably before we were born, I love the way the father says though, about any of the angelic tribes or the host army, he said, yes, they were made before we came, but we existed before they were made, because we lived in him, and so that's who Melchizedek is, and I know, is that a storm warning, Jen? Okay, I take power over all the part of the enemy trying to control this storm overhead of us right now, and I command the host to have them get up there and shred that storm, I refuse and review all strong winds, there'll be no tornadoes in this area, no flooding in this area, I'm over the weather, now under the weather, and I say, get out of this city in Jesus name, you will bring rain and nourishing rain, no lightning strikes, keep it in the sky, and get out of here in Jesus name, amen. Praise God, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, so again, I don't know if I did, did you have a little, I can't remember if we interrupted your flow with that, did you, did we get it? Melchizedek, yeah, a lot of people, they assumed that he was like one of Adam's sons, or they say that he was someone else who died that lived on the earth, but clearly the word doesn't say that, they can't figure out who he is, there are some of the living creatures have always, always been with the father, he didn't make them one day because he thought about it was a good thing, they've just always been with him, there's no way really to get people to understand the father has always existed, he carries time inside of him, and so that's why he's the only one that knows when Christ will return, nobody knows with the father, because he carries time, he didn't appear somewhere in time, so he's always assisted the living creatures have, the 24 elders have always existed, they're spiritual beings that serve him in heaven and all around heaven, they're not people, they're not the 12 tribes of Israel, they're not the 12 apostles, I've seen Peter Paul, I've seen John in heaven, they're not sitting there with a crown around the throne of God, so those are spiritual beings, of course Melchizedek would also be there, and people just picture nothing ever existed, there was a time when nothing existed, that's not true, before time was, the father was, the word was, which is Jesus Christ, holy spirit has always existed, but along with them would be Melchizedek, the 24 elders, the seven spirits of God, which are also seven personal spirits that serve the father, so that's a little bit of understanding and revelation for you for this question about Melchizedek, so he's always been, he was sent to the earth on assignment, and so anyway, I think that was the most important one, so if you have some questions you can go ahead. Yeah, okay, so yeah, we're going into questions about heaven or important truth, so Daniel is a six-year-old, he wants to know do we pray in heaven, I think he means either if we died and went now, or later on when it all goes, when we're all in heaven, do people pray or do we pray in heaven when we, when we go? I know one place that they, that they do make decorations and pray, it talks about the, this talks about in the Bible the souls under the altar of God, who pray and declare before the throne, and I always pictured like an altar, like you know, if you were to do into a traditional charismatic church or probably even other churches, they always had an altar down front that was maybe six inches off the floor, and people go down there to repent and do other things, they serve communion there, but that's not the way it is in the throne, the throne is a whole structure, you can actually walk underneath the throne of God, and really massive altar, many people go under there and they declare over their families, they also say things to God, not that they can't go up to a stone and say it, but sometimes they just want to do it personally or whatever, so that that's one example that yes, there are people who declare and who do pray in heaven for things going on on the earth, you know, and usually though, it's in the throne room and there's this huge room underneath the throne of God, the throne is high and lifted up, so nobody's mushed down or flattened down, so yeah, there's places in heaven, they'll go to the portal, which has been made, they're all over heaven, people go there to watch their family's lives, they can celebrate with them and different things in their life, they go there every year on your birthday and sing happy birthday to you, they don't miss you getting born again, they don't miss anything important like your weddings, your babies being born, people go to these places and they will declare blessings over you, they'll declare things over your life from heaven, so they don't ever stop thinking about us here on the earth. And when you say they declare that, that's kind of the same thing as prayer, right? It is prayer, except they know what's going to happen. They know it's going to happen. What about that, you know, you talked about under the throne, there is that scripture that says they were under the throne, it almost seems like it uses the word martyr in it, and they say to the Lord, how long till you, and I think they say, Kat, you know this better than 90, how long till you avenge our blood, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, what's the deal with that, since there's no time in heaven, why are they in heaven saying how long till you get this I think you're not talking about like a date or a time, I'm talking, they're talking about like a season. There is going to be a season where a lot of that will happen, things that were done to certain groups of people and stuff like that, there will be a retribution brought for those people, because he wouldn't have made that place for them to go and declare that. So there are several different rooms underneath his throne, it's just, it's huge, I can't even explain or give it a measurement, but there are different people down there or groups of people down there, and there are, there are some of the martyrs, I'm not saying every martyr, there are some of the martyrs who really want for the father to redeem their life on the earth by bringing justice for what happened to them, and I'm sure that he will bring justice whenever he is, whenever he does that, it will happen, and it may be more towards the end than now, but he's not having them down there just saying that for no reason, is it hard to say it, he's going to let them say it, so I'm glad that he's going in the throne and that you see visibly when you go in there, but then there's some underneath the throne of God, where people are declaring, it says if you declare and decree a thing, it shall be established, doesn't it? A decree and a declaration is that you have a face to believe it's going to happen, it's something I will do. I was in Paris years ago and we stood underneath the Eiffel Tower, and the Eiffel Tower goes forever and ever, but you can walk underneath it because there's the post, so is that kind of what you mean? In other words, the Lord is high and lifted up, sort of like you might say the Eiffel Tower is way up there, but you can still stand underneath it and see its legs or its foundations, is it kind of like that when you say it's under the throne? Well, let's just say the throne is 80 feet high, I'm not saying it is, it is very high and lifted up because if there's not just steps, there's like there's steps, then there's columns, then there's a platform, then there's steps, that they can go up to the throne, but these are actually more private places, I don't think people see it underneath the steps and you can actually see the people, there's places where they go just to talk to God and pray and declare things, but there's people sitting on the steps sometimes, usually gifts on the steps, like people will leave flowers, Christ loves flowers, I didn't know that, sometimes you'll see desserts, because Christ loves green that's good, you know that's helpful because you know you think of the throne is high and lifted up and there's you know there's training fields of temple and all these different things, but you're saying, oh there's thunder and lightning in the throne room, trust me, people run to get struck by that lightning, it's like a myth, there's a lot of love, so there is all of that that talks about in the Bible, the living creatures are as high as the throne, I mean they're really really big and they have eyes in the front of their bodies and their heads everywhere, and they're always declaring over the over those, over those Father, Son, Holy Spirit, you know in heaven, obviously you're perfectly healthy, emotionally, spiritually, physically, no pain and all that, and yet, because I've thought about this many many times, if there's something that God gives you to drink from the throne, from the rivers of life, from the throne, the water that comes from under, however that goes, it seems like it would be hard to be edified more because you're perfectly edified, how, what would you describe as, have you been there and felt the feeling as it goes into war, how is it that that feeling is better than when you're already perfect? Well, it depends on, there's so much activity in the throne, depending on when you, when you're there, I mean you could be caught up maybe five times in your lifetime and see the throne will be there, but there's so much other activity, sometimes the river of life flows from him sitting on the throne, it comes all the way down the steps, people actually will lay on the steps and drink that, and then sometimes he'll open throughout the whole throne room and be like it runs through the whole throne room, then out into the city streets, depending on whatever he, whatever his purpose is for that, but I've been there seeing people actually drinking it as it's life, it's just, it's just, it's, it's, I can't explain it, it's like the greatest love you ever felt in your life and you just can't ever get enough of him, that's why Christ said, Christ loved his father so much, he was so happy when he got to leave hell and you know, came up and he was glorified and appeared back before his father, he was so happy when he was joined back to his father, but, but people who go there are undone, there's just so many things going on, but his presence is everywhere, but when you're there with him, is that you either watch a concert or you're in it, it's the same thing in the throne room, it's greater, the greater or the even the experience of it is greater when you're there in person, then just maybe seeing it from where your mansion is or being around heaven, but you're never away from his presence, but when you're there, a lot of people do, I keep watching the angels, I got to stop them. Well, you know, I was going to ask you that, Kat, because I thought you're watching, so I was about to ask you, what are you watching, because I've never seen you look up while you're describing it and you just can't watch it. There's an over top of me right now. Wow, because it was very clear to anyone watching that you were watching something, and so, what else can you say about what you're watching? I'm just watching, I'm watching part of the activity at the throne right now, and people are laying on the steps and the river pours over them, in them, through them, a lot of people just want to drink it, and it just makes you fall in love even more with the Father, and people love to be in the throne, and then the celebration, and you hear the voice of the living creatures in the whole stone room shakes, it shakes, and the seraphim dipping down out of the glory cloud, there actually is a real glory cloud that stays permanently around the throne, a little bit above the throne, and the seraphim live there, they live in that glory cloud, and they've been with him so long that their hair, long hair looks like blue fire, and just watching them dipping down over the throne, declaring over the Father and over the Son, it's amazing, I don't feel sorry for anyone who goes to heaven, I'm rejoicing with them, I'm celebrating with them, and don't ever feel like you've lost your family members if you belong to Christ, you will never lose them, they moved to heaven for a while, and then you will all be back together again one day, and all the things that happened to them in heaven, they'll be sharing them with you, they'll take you places to see in heaven, I just had someone just say to me, I know that my sister's up there, and I know that she's making a list of places to take me, and they had not even been to heaven, I said you're absolutely right, that's exactly what they're doing, they're not up there enjoying their life while everyone's suffering down here either, they know, all of heaven knows what is about to happen down here on this earth, they know the glory is going to engulf this earth, that people will actually carry it and release it everywhere around the world, they know the baptism in fire is going to be happening, they know that this earth for quite a while will be so filled with God, that's why there will be such a mass, the mass harvest at the end will be so huge, because of the glory, the love, the life of God, we will as manifested sons and daughters actually demonstrate the power of the living God to the people of this earth, either by rescuing things or changing things or commanding things that he tells us to say, you'll see it with your eyes, you'll literally see heaven activity with your eyes on this earth, and that's what's being set up, he's going to remove a lot of the evil on purpose, so justice is going to happen, there's no man greater than God, no devil more powerful than God that can stop any of that from happening, so I'm just celebrating my life all the time, I know I have expectancy in my heart, I don't have fear in my heart at all, I know who holds me in his hand, I know what his plans are and you can know too, because these are great days you're ending into, your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great grandchildren know they're probably adding up those years, don't try to, I don't ever try to add up the years, okay, I know God's going to do what's on his timeline, I know the greatness that's being sent to the earth, the babies being born right now are some of the greatest, the greatest prophets on the earth, some of the greatest apostles on the earth, the healings are going to be so miraculous that begin to happen, that's something else that's going to start happening, miraculous healings, regardless of what's going on around, the Bible says God sets a table that's his presence, his power, his joy, and his supply, even in the presence of darkness he's going to do that on purpose, I think that also is about to start happening. I need, I want to ask you, you said something a minute ago, I do not want that to pass because I think people would want to want you to say, this is what I meant by what I just said, you said a minute ago that they aren't, I may not quote this exactly, you said they're not out there enjoying their life while you're suffering on earth, what are you trying to communicate? I shouldn't explain to some people who don't really know God, they don't know Christ, they think he doesn't care, they don't care, and they don't see what's happening, that they want to happen, they want things to happen right now, I understand that's how you feel, but when God has a plan, if he's going to expose evil it's going to be done in this time, this would be the greatest exposure of evil on the years until the perilous times start happening and they're probably close, I can't even say a year, I know I've been taking 150 years in the future and guess what, there have been no perilous times of tribulation at that time. But our loved ones are in heaven enjoying their life, they're enjoying their life, and they're decreeing and everything, even while we are suffering. They're decreeing and declaring for God to intervene on your behalf, that you will not miss your destiny, a lot of them are after saying God, I declare they will not miss your destiny, they'll fulfill what you sent them for, that my heart is for them, that I'm up here declaring over them, I have expectancy for what you're about to do in the earth, this is them speaking to the Father about their loved ones on earth. Okay, good, good, good, I want to make sure we clear that. All right, Audrey asked, has Kat Siener interacted with John the Baptist, what is his appearance now on earth, he wore clothes made of camels here, also any idea what John the Baptist does in heaven? John the Baptist is sharing things that happened when he was on the earth, but with revelation of what happened in the spirit realm, everyone who goes to heaven, you will go and see what was going on around your life that God was doing, the things he was doing behind the scenes, the things that he did that you didn't know about, and even the apostles and the disciples all got to see that about their life, some every now and then would see angels or something like that, but their whole life lived out on this earth, when they tell their stories now, they can include, but God did this, God was doing this, and it just makes it even greater, more personal for them to share, so all those people are sharing the experiences and things that happen on the earth, but with revelation about them, that's what they're doing. And John the Baptist, his, as far as- Not wearing camels here, people. He's not wearing camels, and as far as we know, as far as we're told, his only gift was teaching and declaring, but does he, I mean, would John, even someone like John the Baptist have a hobby, a fun thing that he would do, would even he have a gift that would be different than declaring? I'm sure he probably would, it probably was something to do with the nature, maybe, because, you know, he was kept in the wilderness, isn't always being just desert, I'm sure there was maybe forest or something around him, and he loved that kind of thing, I know he didn't have a lot of time, he actually didn't hear God a lot, he had him on the back side of the desert, he would share with him things that would happen, and I can tell you this, those who told or shared, if they shared a lot in their life on the earth, they're going to share more things that they found out when they got to heaven, like I was just saying, but John is not wearing camel hair, okay, you don't wish he'd taken a bath five times, but when he was down on the earth, he was not the neatest person, I'm sure he was clean in all the other ways, but the camel hair he wore, because he had such revelation given to him, there was ways God would humble prophets, he was a prophet, Jesus called him a prophet, he also is Christ, he says, you know, he's his cousin, they hang out a lot, I see John the Baptist a lot with Christ, they were cousins on the earth, and I think he also liked sweets, I know that sounds wild, but he ate locust and honey, he loved honey, Christ loved honey, he ate it all the time, and it says in the Bible that he did like it, so I just see them a lot together in heaven, because they were related on the earth, and I can tell you this, John is not wearing camel hair, and the camel hair he wore was inside out, if you have never pet a camel, if you go to Israel, if there's a hand over there, ask him, can you touch the camel, and run your hand across that hair, man, I'm telling you, it's like little mini spikes, he wore that against his skin, it was to keep him humble, that's why he did it, it was to remind him who he was, and who God was, and you know, there was things God did to the prophets, so they wouldn't think of themselves above measure, mine is pink hair, I'll just tell you right now, I was not a pink hair person, I forget it's pink, I right now can't see my hair, and that was to separate me and make me, God wants people to notice me, okay, he wanted people to notice John Baptist, when it was his time to speak, he wanted him to look different, be different, and sound different, and I had to experience the same thing, although today it's pink hair instead of camel hair, I'm very grateful. So good, so good, I'm trying to decide which of these, because we're running out of time, so this person's saying, what do the evangelists do in heaven since their duty on earth was so winning, obviously there's no soul winning, do evangelists just have their own individual gifts, is that the point? I think some of them did, and well we know, we know that Paul did, Paul had great gifts, he worked with fabrics, he made beautiful things out of fabrics, it was a gift, and it was how he supported his ministries, how he supported himself, and people came from everywhere to buy those things, I'm sure he made robes, and scarves, and all kinds of things, beautiful things with fabrics, it does mention that in the Bible, and I'm sure when when he gets time, he probably still does, still does that, but I think that was Paul. Yeah, there you go, the best of the best. The Holy Spirit's like, excuse me, but we all know that God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest he had to put hair on, so yeah, I just love Holy Spirit though, he has no problem, you know, correcting me in the middle of everything, Paul worked with fabrics, and he did that, and he was very good at that, Paul, I'll tell you what, I see Paul quite often, he's always in the gardens, outside the throne room, there's beautiful gardens, and people come there to see him, they want to know what did you feel like when this happened, what did you think when this happened, see, is people asking questions more than anything else, and people, and of course they're going to share, so they share, they still share a lot, but they have things they like to do, some of them like to work with, some some of them like to cook or bake, some of them like to make things with their hands, I know that there were other of the disciples like Peter is still fishing, that was his gift, he fished, he fished before he became a disciple, and he fishes now in heaven, people can go fishing with him, my husband said he's going to be his new best friend just in case you wondered, and this has to be catch and release, right, this has to be catch and release because unless you get caught, unless you get, because you said they play tag or something, I don't know how you worded that, yeah, they do, and well you know I already said the creatures all talk to you, and that is no different with the fish you're trying to catch or the bull you're trying to ride in the rodeos, and someone will probably slam me for that, get over it when you get there, you want to ride one, and I'll forgive you for it, but but the creatures all talk, they have a voice, they talk to your pets, they'll talk to you a lot, I love that, it will be nice, and we just sent our mama cat went home to heaven the other day, oh wow, yeah, and this is just not strange, but just like God, my mom has a pet dog out in Arizona where she would visit her mom to her mom went home to heaven, her brother went home to heaven, but she has a pet dog out there, the same day that the mama cat went to heaven, her dog in Arizona went to heaven, oh my goodness, yeah that's not a coincidence is it, it's not a coincidence, it's not, it's not, and for anyone that's new, of course I think our poor family, we had lots and lots and lots of pets, a horse, two miniature donkeys, four dogs at one point, but a zillion's a cat, so those animals will be dispersed among family members I'm thinking, but every single pet is in heaven, and we all, there are pets right, yes, you have a big enough place for them to be in though, it's good that we're going to need acreage for that, so you'll need, you do get acreage, trust me you can have acreage, but by this time they've already made, by this time Steve they've already made friends, so they'll probably bring their friends over too, oh that'd be good, grandkids and pets, people go, you know what, they think of just nuts the way I top it, you know what, God is holy and powerful and so captivating, to be in front of the power that he carries and see him demonstrate it, but the love he has, he is love, I know Christ is love, I know that, but so is the father, you have to see that he is number one, a father with lots of children, when you come home to heaven, you come home, let's say you're married, you don't go home as husband and wife, you go home as god's son and god's daughter, you get your own mansion, it can be right next to each other, there's no problem with visiting or anything, but he, he is a father, is going to provide a place for you, and he made fun places on purpose because if you picture yourself as a dad, and let's say you have four kids, if you didn't have some way for them to have fun, you would really be. Now cat just froze on my screen folks, is it frozen on anyone else's screen? I'm listening to my staff, it's frozen on my screen, yes it's frozen, do you want to try and boot her out and have her come back? Well that was a new, we don't, that doesn't usually happen with cat, so could be the storm there, yeah they could be having a storm, so we'll see if we get her back, it's kind of at the end, if you guys are willing, want to just dismiss her, that's okay too because we're kind of at the time, if you say go ahead and, and Steve will say goodbye, just kind of let me know what to do, if anyone wants to tell me what to do. Texting chins, yeah you know I was talked about my own, my daughter had a cat, Ebony, he's a black cat, he was a black cat and he got sicker and sicker, and I was dying at the time, I was under 100 pounds, some of you have heard me tell that story, it was very near death and she was dying, and I didn't, it's not that I sat there thinking I'm dying, I knew I was very very sick and they hadn't figured out what's wrong with me, now, it'd be nice to have closer to that, under 100 pounds, but I, I remember talking to Ebony and I'd say someday, because I knew she was not going to be here really, so I was laying on the couch, sick sick, everyone's gone, Ebony's on the chair and I said someday in heaven, you and I, we're going to talk, oh their internet went out, he says they will try one more time, but I said someday you and I are going to have a conversation about all of all this, and I felt like honestly that I was communicating with Ebony a boy cat, he was a beautiful cat, but you know, because as he got sick and sicker, he couldn't clean himself, so he then became a beautiful dirty cat, but you know, it'll be fun to see what happened to Ebony and try and talk with him and say, do you remember that? That's what I think I see myself saying is to the pets, I'll say, do you remember when, if God gives me that memory, so, but we had so many cats, we were cat people and so now we've had a lot of dogs, so, well, you know what guys, it's 10 44, it went long and if they're still trying, I think probably this is a good time to dismiss it, it was a great, great show, we got good, good answers, so I'm going to go ahead and say to the people, thank you so much for the show, tomorrow we have Patel Patriot, who talked a lot about devolution, not evolution, but devolution, which has to do with the president redistributing authority to those people beneath him, so that the continuity of government can continue, he will talk about devolution and anything else God's put on his heart, he was great, this will be our second time, he's very, very popular on the internet, especially among patriots, so we remember that, so Patel Patriot will be tomorrow, it will be very, very, very good, so be sure and tell your friends, we will be, until further notice, we'll be on rumble only and when I say rumble only, I mean rumble and Facebook and theeligialist.com, just not YouTube, so with that, have a great day everyone, God bless you and we will see you again tomorrow, same time, bye bye. you

Well, welcome to Elijah's Streams. It is Wednesday, February 1, but we are recording this the day before, so I'm recording this in the clock behind us. We'll say Tuesday, January 31, but you will see this in the morrow on Wednesday, so we're very excited to bring you Kat again today. She has a shorter schedule because they're in the middle of a move, so we're going to do 35 minutes and fast and furious and we'll have a good time. I had to hook myself up today and all the things are dragging in. Anyway, hope the dog doesn't bark because I didn't take care of that ahead of time, so we'll see how this goes. So pretty short show, but we'll enjoy every minute of it, so we're not going to run any spots or any other announcements. Tomorrow, by the way, is Robin Bullock, so don't miss that. So you're hearing this on Wednesday, so Thursday will be Robin Bullock. So all right, without further delay, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go. Hi, Kat. So you're in the middle of a move this week, huh? Yes, and we are so excited. I'm really excited. Awesome. Well, it's good to see you. We've got questions. We were going to jump right into questions today. Anything you wanted to say before we do that? I just want to say how much I love everybody and thank you for all the prayers you've given us over the years and even for this move, which sometimes seems almost impossible. Here we are moving tonight and tomorrow night. So we seriously are moving and we are all very excited. You know, it's a beautiful place. We know people there. We're going to meet a lot more people. I know God's going to be there too, of course. And so, yeah, we're trying to use our time as wisely as we can and our staff is actually going to come tomorrow to help. They have been bugging us forever. Please, let us help. Let us help. Yeah, we've got to take that, man. It's more talking than moving, but we're all very excited about how God has blessed us. So, yeah. And I feel that you're paying on the moving too. You know, you can have fun with friends and everything, but man, every time I've ever moved, we moved about something like 17 times in our married life. It's crazy. Wow. One time a year for the first half of the year. And then this place we've been at for 23 years now. Yeah. Yeah, so amazing. Well, listen, Kat, so you're pretty excited about the future still. Are you optimistic about how things are going? I am optimistic about everything God has said or told me and still intend to do. So, absolutely, yes, we all are. We're all very optimistic. By the way, once again, not intentionally, but we wore them. You got your teal on your hat and I got my teal on my tie and you're... Yeah. And that is heaven's color, you said, or heaven's favorite color. So, if I'm saying that right. Okay, so Kat, let me just jump in and ask you one question that I may have asked you a variant of this from time to time, but when people go to heaven, they've died and now they've graduated to heaven and you've said people, when they get to heaven, don't start comparing, don't say, how did you die? No, how did you die? They don't do that. But do... Would someone show up? Let's say they meet their parents and their parents are young like they are. They're everybody's in their 20s and 30s, I guess, looking at them. Does that... When they sit down and have coffee or whatever it is you do in heaven, do the parents say, well, tell me what happened last time we were there, you didn't even know the Lord, what happened? Do they tell that kind of story? And some say... Sometimes they do, if something's really on their heart, sure. And nobody minds at all if they ask some questions like that. I would have thought, you know, in my P-brain, I would have thought that that would be almost a sure thing that everybody would want to hear that story. But you... It sounds a little bit like it's more of an exception to the rule. Well, they actually hold meetings already when they come. Every time somebody comes new from earth, they always have huge events and everybody wants to come so they can hear what's been going on. Oh, okay. It's not gonna be any really good news, anything that's changed or maybe major things have happened that they would want to know about. That's an automatic, that part is automatic. So everybody will attend me somewhere. And then that person will be invited over and over and over again to visit people, speak places. And so, yeah, it's very exciting. Okay, very cool. So let's see, I wanted to go with this one. This one was... I've had this... Somehow I came across my desk I've had since December. It says, okay, I love Kat. I purchased and read her wonderful books. I find them very encouraging. I would like to ask her this question. The Bible says, when you try to approach the throne of God or God himself, you become very, very fearful. I have not heard Kat talking about the reverential fear of the, fear the Bible speaks of when it went in the presence of the great and almighty God. So I guess they're asking once you go to be with the Lord or once you visit heaven. I'm not quite sure where the reverential fear is that she's wanting to address. What would you say about that? I think it would probably depend on what was going on in its own home at the time. Of course, I've always, always had such holy reverence and love for the Father, for the Son, for the Holy Spirit that never changes. You never, ever get familiar with all that and not any of it. It's just overwhelming sometimes, the peace and the love that you experience when you're there. And of course, when I go many times, I'm like eight. Yeah, that's what you said. Not all viewpoint would be entirely different than most people who are already adults. So I think about what kind of fun will I have? Where will we take me? What will we do? I love him so much. I'm so excited to be here. So that would be the way that I would look at things and he wants me to. He wants me to see him that way. And there's other people who feel that way also. Well, yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. But you talked about how you've gone as an eight year old and that you usually go as an eight year old. So God sees you and you interact, I guess, as an eight year old. And you have said many times that heaven is like 50 percent worship, serious worshiping the Lord and 50 percent fun. Am I quoting you right? Is that about right? I would have to say yes. And he even says sometimes it's 50 percent fun. I'd have to make it fun. You come like a child. It makes sense. And so if you tell a story about this, I saw this or I saw that. And it makes the children or you at eight years old, when you go, giggle and laugh to see something funny, that's something that's in the heart of God to provide. Giggles and laughter and even goofiness when you're having fun, right? Yeah, you know, most everyone who comes says you must come like a child, right? And he wants us to feel that, you know, you're really all that innocent and excited and you know, you're going to have a good time. I mean, he is our father. That's who he is. That doesn't take anything away from his sovereignty, you know, his holiness, his power, the life he gives people. It doesn't change that. It's just that from my perspective and the way he's always taught me, he taught me as his daughter, he taught me as a child. So I see from their perspective. Okay, okay, cool. All right, Isaac is age 15. And he's asking this, are the world's wonders in heaven? For example, the hanging guards of Babylon, the Colosseum and so on, because we think of the seven wonders of the world, he's like, no, are those wonders in heaven? There are wonders, it says of course, those wonders in heaven. But I think it is the famous ones that we know, like, no, not those. Okay, not those. It would be like, you know, like the Valley of the Valley of the Falls would be definitely one the throne room, of course, absolutely the streets of gold, his rainbow. I mean, there's so many different things you would want to see the crystal sea, where you can swim under the water and breathe and talk and meet all the creatures there. So of course, they do actually have their list on quite sure of amazing places. Oh, yeah, the city is there. So there's so many things to do, see and learn about people have their favorites once they've been there for a while. So I would say, yes, it is sort of like, maybe more than eight. Yeah, well, you know, all right. And so if someone said, well, I will always hope that I never could go to see the Grand Canyon, I hope that I could see it in heaven. It's not like God needs to give you the Grand Canyon, he's got the grand everything. He absolutely has the grand, the grand of everything, you're right. So it's not like you missed that anymore. Won't you see what he's got there? Yeah, so good. Okay. Pam is asking this, can't you taught us that our level of spiritual authority grows as we mature in Christ? Can you tell us what a brand new Christians authority looks like? I don't, I guess, I have to interpret what she means. What does it look like? What, what would you say a brand new Christians authority like? I think maybe she's asking the moment you're saved and you're brand new. Do you walk out and possess certain authority that you didn't have? Or what does it look like if you're brand new? I think that no one can really maybe even think about that ahead of time. I think you are so undone by the glory that, you know, the glory we create for him, the splendors and the wonders that are there. You're so overwhelmed by his goodness that he gives us. But I'm brand new believer especially. They're overwhelmed really at what has been given to what Christ actually did give you, what you can operate in, how to do that, and what difference it would make here in the earth if everybody did. So yeah, there's a lot of things that there's so many things that we could talk about and discuss, but always those feelings of a new believer realize what has been paid for for them and what it's like to operate. There's like nothing is, you know, I don't think as much as I've been excited in all the years afterwards, I think the cream of the crop was the first week days and weeks after I encountered God and everything. It's hard to find that level of first love very many times. Don't get me wrong. I seek it and I do discover major encounters, but you're overwhelmed by that love. Absolutely yes. Yeah. I mean the Old Testament when I had the encounter with God 81, even the Old Testament screamed grace, grace, grace. I read it and I said, there's grace all over this thing and I had only seen bad news and that's them. All right. So Jan is asking this, when people first get to meet Jesus in heaven, what is the first most common response? Is it a joyful celebration kind of moment or a holy worship kind of moment? So what is that? I mean, yeah, so like, go ahead. Yeah, I think most of the time it's probably more of a holy thing. You are so undone knowing you're meeting actually the risen Savior, the one who gave everything for you. So I have seen most of the people probably would have that holy reverential thing that we talked about. Yeah. Unless you're a kid, then you're going to be like, yeah, besides yourself excited. Yeah. Well, you know, I, when I picture it for myself, I think, I think I'd fall on my knees or I would be, I would feel like falling and I feel like tears would come, but they would be tears of absolute unbelievable joy that we made it and he did this for me. And are there tears of joy? You know, there are tears of joy. I don't people think you never cry again in heaven. At the end of the Bible, it says every tear will be wiped away. You know, the former things, you know, more. That's the end of everything when it says, you don't cry, but crying for joy, excitement, gratefulness. Yeah, that's, it's a wonderful feeling anyway. And you absolutely love it. So yes, people still do that. Cool. Very cool. All right. Reggie's asking this, will teams of people work together or collaborate together to create things in heaven or on the new earth, like in these say, it's like groups work together on earth now to create or will, but we only create individually using our individual gifts and talents. So I guess he's likes doing things together as a group. And will we collaborate and do things together? That's the answer. We do collaborate and do things together. Of course we do. And you do learn how to create, not people, but there's creation lab where you think that's for in heaven. Okay. All kinds of things, places that we can make for each other, not talking about like our mansions or anything like that, but there we all have a creative ability because of who they are and so absolutely people get excited. Yes. And actually people say, well, what do people do? There's nothing to do there. You don't have a job or you create stuff. You hold events everywhere and everybody wants to be a part of your event. So yes, those things do happen a lot. That's good. Good. Okay. I have so many rabbit trails that I want to go to, but I'm going to jump to the next question. Elizabeth asks, how do I know if my child goes to heaven? If my child goes to heaven in her sleep, I asked this because she has a dear friend and recently that recently moved to heaven twice this week. She said she had a dream about them playing together and running. I'm not sure if I understand the question. How do I know if my child goes to heaven in her sleep? I asked this because she has a dear friend. Oh, she's saying when my child is sleeping, did she go to heaven and visit? That's what she's asking. That is a great possibility. Sure. Yeah, he takes people while they're sleeping. Okay. So they may, they say, Mom, I had this dream and I was playing. Yeah, my green kids have actually had that happen to them quite often. Okay. And those five places in heaven, like when they were four years old and they went, they didn't even know those places were there. But I mean, they have been that they ride, they rode, I think I mentioned before, you would ride lava out of a volcano. Yeah. My grandfather, my dad. Yeah, there are some of those giggles, by the way. I love the giggles. Giggles of God. Someone needs to write that book because we serve a happy, joyful, funny. By the way, of all the three, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Who's funniest if you could, if you, who's clever with their wit if you, if you had. I would have to say there's either Holy Spirit, probably or Jesus. I think Jesus definitely has the wit. I think they call Holy, well, I know they call Holy Spirit the drama king. Yeah. Right there. He loves a good joke. He really does. He loves like all kinds of drama and exciting things going on up there. So I would have to say probably more of those. The father is definitely for love. Yeah. Just dad, father, you know, I think Kim Robinson has had multiple trips together. She calls him daddy, God. You've had, I'm not asking you to say the names, your private names for God, but God has given you different names that you call him. Is that right? Yes, he had. That's a real interesting thing. And I've known several others that were like that. They say I've called them such and such and it would be something I'd never heard. But God gave, I don't know, maybe he gives different people the same ones, but that's pretty special. All right. He's just asking, how do you pray when asking God to relocate? How do you pinpoint where God wants you? I guess that means to move. I do not want to move to a place out of his will. So he's saying, she's saying, how do you pray when you're asking God to relocate you? I mean, I guess you, you want to tell him, I guess you want to ask, okay, I don't even know how to interpret that more than the question. So yeah. So what's your thoughts on that? So I think she wants to move, but she doesn't want to move to the wrong place because God didn't tell her to do or something like that. She's, she's going, you know, how do I pray? I would say, you know, you want his will done more than anything else and asked him to please give him permission to let you know. It's a good way to do that. You get, you get him permission to let you know if it's not the place he wants or maybe something different like that. I think most of the time, if it's, if it's about him and you've heard him maybe say things like that in his will towards you, I think people are so centered on pleasing him and making sure they don't step out of what he wants. So they don't mess up their life. I don't think he'd let them mess their life up if maybe they did choose something differently, but, but telling him that certainly is going to help you stay focused. And for the people that, that are not seers and they don't see all the things in the spirit like you do. I mean, can they say, Lord, I think you're telling me to go here, but if I'm wrong, would you close the door before I absolutely ask you to do that. You absolutely could do that. It's a good idea. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. All right. Shonda, Shonda, I must be Shonda. How do you release the anointing when you're on a telephone call? How would you do it if they, if they call you and you want to release the anointing? I'm sure she's meeting on the other person on the other end. So yeah, I would just hold my phone and I would just say it, or I would do it before I call them or he knew that I was going to call their number. I would say I released this, the anointing into this phone call when they pick it up, it'll go right into them. Okay. Okay. All right. Jill, let's see. This is partially cut off. Let me make sure I can read the whole thing. Okay. Jill says, as a seer, when I'm in church, I often see huge angels that stand between the first front, front seats and rows in front of the podium where the pastor preaches. It is always in the same position no matter what church. The angel is so big that his head is outside the roof. I didn't, I didn't notice an angel where we were going to church now until the last couple of weeks. Can you speak of what you know about those angels? I guess she's wanted to know if, if that's identifiable or something you've seen? I've seen angels 2,000 feet high, probably even higher than that in heaven. So just to what every side imagine is there. And I don't know that typically it's certain, you know, a tribe of angels or something like that. I just know that they do have many different sizes of angels. Do you, this is never a question that has never been popped to my head, but if you've seen 2,000 foot angels and you've seen angels that are probably roughly your size. Yes. So are massively tall angels by definition massively more powerful? Is that what the big means or what would you say? Possibly, but maybe possibly not. It's just that God loved making different types of angels or the hosts and he practiced well at doing that. Okay. Cool. All right. Cheryl is asking this question. She goes, I've heard you speak about how our loved ones in heaven can go to a portal on special days for us and sing happy birthday. For example, is the reverse true? My husband went to heaven less than two years ago. Can I sing happy birthday to him on his special day and have him hear me singing it? I'm sure that you could. I know that I have sung different things like to my father, like on Father's Day or something like that. I know that sounds odd, but I do really love my dad and a great relationship with him. And yes, and I know for a fact that Father has said you can sing what you'd like to them and he'll make sure they hear it. Yeah. Now I've said, this is maybe years past, but I've, you know, before I heard that you maybe can speak directly in there. They hear it in the spirit realm or something. However, but I've said, Lord, would you give my dad this message to tell him like, and I've said, like one time I said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I don't even know that if that's appropriate thing because he's in bliss. Why would he need to hear that? But that's, that would be my question. What kind of things can you send as a messenger or ask God to set an angel and tell your dad, you know, can you say something like that? Tell him I forgive him. You mean on earth or in heaven? No, I'm saying, you know, he's in heaven now and you know that when he left, he left a mess like that was the case with my dad. And if I would have said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I mean, that was years past, but what do you think about that? You just say, no, no, don't go there because he's already happy. He doesn't need that. I think that I don't think I would mind you saying that and all of somebody. I think it would be all right to say that. Even though they wouldn't still have to hear it. Yeah, because they already, yeah, I hear you. It's not like his soul needs to be unburdened for what he did. So it's just words of love, I think. Yeah. Okay. Dolores is asking this, do regular common people from different generations mingle with one another? For example, would an auto executive that went to heaven in 2022 mingle with the poor widow from Elijah's days, would they have things of interest to talk to? I think anyone who you would meet there would have, there's almost everybody's going to have something that they would love to talk to about you to you or with you. And you would find it very fascinating. So people still love to have conversations. They like to reason together, talk together. They love to share things. I mean, that never stops happening. Not here on earth or in heaven. Well, and then is there the sense that throughout eternity or as long as you're on heaven, one day, it's everyone's going to be on new earth. But as long as you're in heaven, are people making new friends all the time? Or do they kind of establish their friendship thing and their friends hang? Oh, they make new friendships all the time, no matter where they go. They do. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, Tracy. Oh, this, this does occur to me to ask this question because you've talked because we said a minute ago about the portals in heaven. And you know, your loved ones can look down on special occasions. Can't with that being possible, could someone, this is probably a dorky question, but because someone say, hey, they should do her girlfriend from earth and now they're all both in heaven together. And he says, come on to the portal. I want to, it's my daughter's birthday. I want to say, I want to see them and come and see where my daughter, what my daughter's up to. Could they do something like that? Or is it only for personal family? You know what I mean? I think a lot is for family, but I think you could, there's people who would push doing anything or talking about anything to anybody if they could there. So yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of these questions are questions that you don't, it's not like you walk around knowing the answers to all these deep questions, but yeah. Yeah. Okay. Tracy's asking this, I'm a worship dancer. Can you elaborate a little more on what happens when we minister and dance? And this seems like it's a common question. People want to know when I do this on earth, what's it, what's happening? What is it accomplishing is, I think, is what she's saying. What happens when I dance? I mean, that could go a bunch of directions. What is the Lord doing? What's happening in the spirit realm? I mean, is, would you have any thoughts? Because you're a seer. Do you see people dance and then see things happening because of it? I see a lot of mostly music. Of course, I do see some dance. And sometimes you dance, you're not even on the floor, like in the throne room, they have a lot of dance and pageantry and stuff in there going on. It's absolutely beautiful. And of course, there's ways that you collect things as you dance. And then it's represented in some other way in heaven, like you create artwork or paintings by your dance. Even though it is with dance, not with your paintings, it's just something that's created as something to remember that about. Okay. And back for those that are dancing on earth, when you've seen people with the pageantry that God loves on the earth and they're waving their flags and they're dancing, does it affect the angels around them when they do that? Is something being triggered in a good way when they dance? And I think that's what she's trying to get at. Do angels respond? Does our blessings drop down that we don't see? What is the dance accomplished? Or is it just dance? I know dance is considered a high praise. It even says that it's in the Bible. And so yes, even some of the hosts are absolutely amazed and really love the warfare that takes place as a dancer. When you dance, like in the spirit about things, so that is definitely something that takes place. And all three of my daughters are dancers. They would have to be wore in dance in the spirit for people to be healed, for messages to be sent to be received. And so I would definitely know whether it's dance, whether it's music. A lot of things are created in the spirit. Okay, awesome. Sarah is asking this, are there, you've seen gemstones in heaven, and I think I've heard you talk about the crystal sea and stuff. She says, is there gemstone art in heaven that resembles stained glass? Have you seen? Absolutely, yes. A lot of people have those in their home there. Really? Especially if people were artisans in that. My grandfather made stained glass wonders. Okay. He's got some he's made in heaven. Wow, very cool. And I mean, you know, it makes me wonder, because you said that guy will put favorite pictures of yours that are on earth, or you'll show up at your mansion and there it's hanging. And I'm curious if God would do the same thing. Not that you would know the answer to this, but that if you if someone made stained glass on earth, they show up and God said, this is one that you made. I really, especially loved, I kept it. And here's it. That was that sound like something he might do just because that's who he is. I think he probably would. If people gave him any high gifts, he's going to love him anyway. Yeah. And even he has some favorite things that he likes, anything he may with life with colors, things like that. Whether you're young or not young, he loves people when they give him gifts. Cool. All right. Let me see. We're five minutes out here. We got time for a few more questions here. George is asking, when some people are dying, they reach out or call for their family members who have died before them. They act as though their family members are right there in the room with them. Do you know, do they really see their loved ones and do they come? I guess they're asking, do their loved ones come to help with their transition to heaven? Can you share about that? I mean, I have no idea. I think sometimes they do. I do know for a fact that some people have seen their family members, like maybe within a week of passing or something. I think it's something that God just does to encourage people. And so I just know that it does happen. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Rachel's saying, when we are reunited with our loved ones that are already in heaven, to them, will it feel like it's been a long time since they've seen this? Or will it only feel like seconds or days since they've seen us? I think it's just seconds. Really? Oh, yeah. They don't miss someone being gone 30 years or something like that. All they can think about is can't wait to see them again when they see them. And so for them, you've only been gone for a short time. Okay. Wow. Okay. And Andrew's asking, when and why were the host, Michael's army created, was it after Satan's treason, specifically to deal with him or was it actually before Satan's treason? In other words, you've made it very clear that the only reason there's an army is not to protect heaven. God doesn't need an army to protect heaven. So when do you know when the army was created? Was it after the fall of Satan? I think the army was been around a very long time. They even wondered why they were created one time. Really? To fight. Yeah, they were there for the enemy, for who became an enemy. So maybe they only understood what they were being trained up for when that fall happened. Yeah. They were taught war and they had to run maneuvers and do all kinds of stuff like that. Really? And that one was how loose for a fallen heaven. They knew who their enemy was. Interesting. All right. Here's another question about the Michael, the captain of the warrior angels. Is it Martha's asking, I believe the angel Michael is the captain of the warrior angels and Gabriel is the messenger angels. Are there other types of angels with specific purposes? I'm guessing there'd be lots of them with specific purposes. There are so many, I cannot number them. There's many, many, many, many. There's ones who are couriers, of course, the scribes, the Bible talks about them, helper angels that help all over heaven doing things like that. Of course, there are the hosts of heaven. There's ones who serve in different places and who keep the treasures shined up and all kinds of things like that. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It makes sense that he might even have thousands of different kinds of angels, right? For categories that we've never even thought about. So, yeah. Man, just that's right. Me, A, N, G, S. Does God really cast out your sins into the sea of forgetfulness? If you brought up your past, would he not know of it? I think most of the time he wouldn't because he does cast it there and he's not going to think about it. I tell people, stop reminding him of your sins. He won't know what you're talking about if you've repented. Yeah, boy. I could have used that understanding years ago when I kept repending over and over and over and over to make sure I got it right. He's probably saying, would you stop repending? Okay. Jamelia, lots of interesting names today. Jamelia, have you seen inside of the courtrooms in heaven? What's happening in there? What do they look like? Do they look like a courtroom on earth? The judge sits on the bench up there high and then there's a defense in both sides? I have absolutely been to the courtroom in heaven. Actually, there's more than one. I guess outside, not outside of heaven, but in the atmosphere of heaven, it's invisible. I know this sounds crazy. You can actually see to it. You can see that it's there. Then of course, it's a courtroom that's actually in heaven. Yes, I've seen both. Like anything else, God sits as judge. Jesus is our lawyer and Satan gets hauled up there about different things sometimes. Other things get harder, but justice does take place in those courtrooms. So it does look like a courtroom as we would know it. Well, they have one that looks very supernatural. They do have one that looks like what you would call a courtroom, maybe not exactly like that. So they're both different than I've seen. Okay. All right. Here's the last question here. Natalie is asking, what is your favorite thing about Jesus that you would like to describe? What's your favorite thing about? Of course, you'd have thousands of things, but what stands out to you? I think his eyes. I think his eyes are so amazing. I never get tired of whenever I'm around him. I always want to look at his eyes. They're beautiful, very beautiful. But he also does have a, I almost want to say a cynic sense of humor. I mean, he was very bold about the things he said on the earth to those who were not doing right. Like one of my favorite ones is, are you you're a white and sepulchral school of dead men's bones? Yeah. You thought of the religious hierarchy. I think both of those probably, those two things are probably my very favorite thing about it. And he holds both of those at the same time. He, you know, he's got that serious side and then the clever fun side. Yeah. So good. So good. Well, Kat, that's our time. We need to let you get to your moving and rest in between and all of that. So I appreciate it very much. We'll spend more time the next time talking about revealing heaven.com, but we're going to revealing the heaven.com to see her, to get her books and all that. And there it is. Katcur.com is where you can support her. The only place you can support her is online because she doesn't ask for money in any other way. A lot of people keep trying to pretend to be her. So all right. Thanks so much, Kat. Tomorrow, everybody is Robin Bullock. We're looking very much forward to that. When you see Robin Bullock, he almost, I think he always has that pin that you created. It says, I don't do demons. He wears that on his coat and everywhere he goes. So it's a, so that that'll be him right there after people see this. Yeah. Thank you very much. We love you. Bless you. Have a good time with your staffs. We'll see you again soon. Okay. See you later then. Bye.
