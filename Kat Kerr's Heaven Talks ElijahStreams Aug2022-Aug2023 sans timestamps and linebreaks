This is the end of this video. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you enjoyed it. Happy Wednesday, August 17, 2022. Welcome to the broadcast. It's going to be a great show today. We have Kat Kerr as always. It's going to be right an hour show starting now. She's got some other things she needs to do. This is the day before Eric Trump comes. So Eric Trump will be here tomorrow. Do not miss this. Be sure and text your friends. Call your friends and let them know. We've got some great questions for Eric. It's going to be great. Oh, by the way, yes. Thank you, Julie. It is 8 a.m. tomorrow. I would have forgotten that. It's 8 a.m. Pacific time. If you're on the East Coast, it will be 11. It's 8 a.m. in the morning. That's when we could get him. We're happy to do that. We did that one other time with General Flynn. It is 8 o'clock in the morning Pacific time. So there you have it. I'm just making sure I'm not missing any notes here. Before we bring Kat on, let's bring Mike and Lori Sally on. Let's talk about the wells. They are spearheading the whole thing, the whole project. I can't wait to hear all about it. So Mike and Lori Sally, take it away. Yeah, go ahead, Lori. We are so excited to update you specifically about the water wells in Uganda. I think one of your shows you shared about that we had had 300 salvations. Well, now it's up to over 800 people who have given their lives to Jesus because of these water wells. I was just in shock. Who knew that Jesus, we know he can turn water into wine, but who knew he was going to make these water wells and share the gospel in such an impactful way. People just be... I had always hoped that maybe a person or two would come to Jesus because of this, but I had no idea that this would be an evangelism tool where hundreds and hundreds, and we just think we're just getting started. We're just getting started. We're now doing a well a week. Every week, one well. So, wow. So we're up to 47 new wells that Elijah Streams has provided. 47. I was looking at the big organization that does work in Uganda and all of last year and then all they do is water. All they do. And they did 42 water projects, not even wells in the entire year. Really? Yeah. It's incredible the pace and the excitement of the people and I was surprised as well as how many people are coming to know Jesus because of this. It's crazy. It's not normal, actually. It's something God's doing. The anointing is all over this project and just the investment that people are making. It's incredible. I wanted to share one of the stories. So I was asking my team, like, tell me what does it look like? I mean, how is this happening? How are they sharing the gospel? Because, normally, I mean, pastors are out there sharing all the time and in this one particular area, so Elijah Streams, we are drilling wells in different parts of Uganda, not all in the same exact spot. So it's in different areas. One area that is really, really dry, it's a drought area and so it's kind of like the forgotten people. It's drought. They don't have a lot of government assistance. They don't have many organizations that are coming there to help and so what they've been doing is as the water company is coming out with their equipment, they're renting a speaker and hooking it up to a car and they're driving through the village and they're kind of announcing, hey, we want you to know what Jesus is doing. There's people that love Jesus, that are responding to him and they care about you and he cares about you and they want you to know about him and so then they start sharing the gospel and then right behind them, not very far, there's these huge, massive trucks that have these huge drilling implements and things and my team is telling me that not only are the water wells an amazing thing, but the fact that we're using this equipment, the technology that we're using to drill these wells is abnormal for them because normally when people come and drill a well, they do it by hand and we're thankful for those that are able to do that, but it's not as efficient because you can't go as deep, it's actually dangerous to do it like that, but people are in awe and imagine if it's not every day you see massive trucks coming in, you know, whenever they're in these villages, when strangers come, everybody stops what they're doing and they run and they want to know what's going on so they're using that first introduction of here's why we're doing this and then they're watching the process the entire time and then when they hit water, then when they hit water, they do a big commissioning and they gather everybody together and that's when their hearts are touched and they were telling me this story about this one woman, she's 71 years old and to me when I hear 71, that doesn't seem that old because I'm, you know, I'm in my 50s so 70 doesn't seem like it's that old but in Uganda that is old the life expectancy isn't that long, we know Jesus can do it 120 years more than that, but 71 she's considered an elder in her community and my team is telling me that she has zero faith, normally in Uganda you find people that are either, they adopt something, whether they're really born again or not and they say born again, we say Christians in the states but they always say born again and that means you're really born again she didn't believe in anything or she didn't really ascribe to any particular thing, she must have believed in a higher being because she testified that she used to say to whatever higher being she was talking to if somebody would come and solve this water crisis because I've been suffering, my parents were suffering my children are suffering, now my grandchildren are suffering and then whenever we came in and drilled this water and she saw the water coming she just started yelling God is alive, God is alive God is alive that's amazing she was so excited she truly was like the woman at the well because she then gave her life to Jesus people followed suit, they followed her, they thought if she believes in Jesus, I want the same Jesus and it was remarkable so Steve, over 800 people I can't I mean I do but it's like I mean I thought maybe a person or two would come to the Lord because of these wells, I had, I never saw this coming, not even close and we're just getting started one well a week it'll probably increase unless you run out of land to drill wells I don't think we'll run out of land there's a lot of people who contact us all the time really? oh yeah, all the time tell me about that for a minute do other people call and say bring a well here or what? I get emails every week from people that hear about what's going on with Elijah's streams and how we're providing this water can you do one for me here's somebody I know in this village that needs help here's a school that needs help I don't think we've gotten close to tapping out the potential yet and so it's pretty exciting just let those that are watching know it's not as easy as just people contacting and saying hey I need a water well here because we're trying to work with reputable well drillers that we can make sure that we're going to go deep enough and the water is going to be sustainable because you hear stories of water wells that were drilled by different organizations and maybe they're drilling it and go deep enough and then it ends up running dry and that's what we don't want that to happen so we're trying to do it through relations I know you brought a video your daughter Caitlin made this video so let's watch that video about it's kind of the latest I laughed because he said we're emptying hell and we're populating hell but you can populate but we understand what he means he said we're doing damage big time to hell I mean we are literally coming against hell so let's watch that video this year 2022 the recharge plants have been started so your denerasty is not only providing clean water but is emptying hell and populating heaven by souls coming to the kingdom and we talk about your Elijah's things so everyone prays for you and God bless you so very much Mike and Lorde Salle this is amazing before the launch of this power hall Moscow has been preached and about 15 people have accepted in Christ as Lord and Savior and even land has been donated to start a church in this place this is a testimony this is amazing these are 15 souls they have come to the kingdom of God today because of the donation of the power hall thank you very much it's so exciting he's like a kid isn't he well I'm like a kid you know I'm sitting here you guys are the same thing look what's going on I mean I can't believe it I do believe it but we are above and beyond anything I think any of us expected to happen wait to see what God is doing for sure well thank you both for coming I see Kat is now here so blessings to you both I appreciate it Mike and Lorde you're working with us very strongly to look into water situations that we will be talking about very very soon here in the states you are here and we're looking at a lot of different things related to the water so we'll be reporting that and a lot of people don't know we're helping a lot of other people even not related to the water but everyone who sows into this ministry receives a reward from him I mean without you know he says even if you give so much as a cup of cold water to one of these you will not lose your reward can you imagine the rewards God's passing out in heaven and on earth thank you to all of our viewers we appreciate it very much so thank you Mike and Lorde we'll see you soon and we'll bring on Kat bless you guys okay so without further ado let's do Wednesdays with Kat and Steve music and there she is hey Kat how are you I'm great thank you so good to have you back I got my Disneyland tie on and tell people why it's okay to still love Disneyland even though we hear some of these bad things you know I always look at the roots of something or the foundation of something and well we can even look at the throne of God Satan has taken many things that are actually some of the father's images the way he operates and he is on the earth polluted them and made them not good but that doesn't mean it's okay to partake of Satan stuff I'm just making an example Walt Disney was put on the earth by God at the time he was put on here and he was put here to create fun in family entertainment that's why people think well he doesn't care about entertainment well they have it in heaven people movies in heaven is all kinds of roller coasters because God knows we need fun and heaven I say is a good bit fun it is holy is pure there's nothing defiling there's no profanity there's no wickedness anywhere in heaven not in anything to create or make there but Walt had this passion in his heart to make a place that families could come and bring their children because even in those days there was a lot of craziness going on in the 60s and things weren't turning in the best direction in that time and so many things were going on that were not good he was determined and he really fought hard well in Orlando especially to get the land for Disney World but the reason he created that in those characters was so we could have something to laugh at and have fun and he is not happy himself right now with stuff that's going on but it is going to change and the father has adamantly told me it's going to change so a lot of maybe people might end up being removed and have this replaced there because I know when Walt was on the earth he was adamant about keeping it at a level that what was produced and the content that was produced not just at that time but for years to come could be enjoyed by family, by children and know that they were going to see something safe and when Disney World was open I actually went to the park here in Florida the first year they were open it was so many masses of people were coming to enjoy and talking about Disney I always appreciated was he always showed in his movies or any of the other things he created you knew the difference between good and evil and every time good would be the victor in the movies and any of the sets he made and he made sure that you knew that this was evil and it was dark and it was not good and yet this was filled with life and light and so I loved it the heroes always saved the day and it overcame every evil obstacle or thing that was in any of the movies or things he produced and so I always appreciated that with Walt and if he was here today that's exactly what would still be happening instead of compromise and darkness invading parts of that there are going to be some covert activities going on in there and no one's going to know anything about it except God himself but things are about to start changing in Disneyland and in Disney World and I don't know if that means something might close for a while or things are being changed or things there's going to be so many things accelerated in these days where darkness is going to be pushed back and that doesn't mean it might close completely but what it'll mean is darkness will be pushed out of places and out of entertainment especially and those who make wicked movies will bomb and they'll lose their shirt if they keep doing it when this whole thing shifts so I do appreciate Walt and all that he created for families if you ever go to either one of those places you can see his own personal comments on the walls in the place and he was so appreciated the people who helped to build the place and the ones who work there now his own comments about how he feels about them he appreciates all of their efforts to help everyone have the time to make it safe and he called them a team he never took direct credit for everything he always gave credit to everyone who was a part of what he did which I also admired in him that he considered everybody involved and he wasn't just the only one that was doing anything and then of course we know there's other people involved in that place now that is not Walt's plans or his ideas some of them that are being put out there now and even in the new things that are being made there's a whole entire different content in it that most believers or even good moral people would not appreciate but just wait and see that will also change I'm glad you see your Donald Duck it's such a special place they opened the doors the year I was born 1955 I met my wife across the street from Disneyland at the convention center on our honeymoon it's just a real special place and yeah there'll be some bad apples that'll get gone and it's interesting to hear what you just said but some people think well then this must be an evil place don't think that Walt Disney's DNA is still in that thing I remember hearing a story that that he and his brother Roy eventually ran the place after he passed but Roy didn't want to spend the money he didn't want to put gold on the top of the castle there's a point or something and so Walt waited until he was got a vacation or something and he went up there and had the people put gold up there I mean I assume it was gold paint but anyway he spent the money he wanted top notch anyway so fun listen I know we have to stop at the top of the hour because of things that people have to do but anything else you want to share before we get into questions I was thinking of something just a minute ago I did want to say one more thing about Disney World I think when you're prayed up when you go there you may have opportunities to minister to people I'm not saying everybody there is bad or wicked some stuff going on or being controlled by certain people who are not very good people and I'm not going to name names or anything I'm just saying keep it in your prayers I know Walt is declaring from heaven over it absolutely and that is something God gave him to create and he was very pleased with it he's not so pleased now but it's going to change I just want to encourage people to make sure and no matter where you go this is just for parents of young children make sure you always keep your kids with you make sure you see them and know who they're with please don't just drop them off at some friends house that you don't even know the friends or the family I would do that anyway I always was like that anyway I was always very careful with my children who babysat them but if we went to a big place we made sure we made rules to go in there to make sure we all knew where everybody was if a child was always with an adult that went with us and these days right now with all the stuff going on that would be a good tip for everybody really really really good alright well I have questions for you a whole list of questions here so let me just start with the first one Nathaniel asks and I hadn't heard of this before but here he goes he says I've heard that there are angels that stand at the four corners of our home is this true or are the angels all over our home in and out so that's his question I think it depends on where you put them where you post them you are allowed to say to the angels who are sent to protect you all the time you and your family they're sentries and they're posted here by your home and they pretty much stay around your home you have others that leave and go with you when you go places and I just tell them I'm going to post a sentry at each corner of my home I'm going to post so many over the home and even down the road and they actually go there and that's what they do they watch for anything of darkness coming they pull down strongholds they shred platforms trying to control us spirits of wickedness or whatever of darkness that want to control us or take things from us so they do both they will even march around on your property and watch it all the time or you can post them as sentries in certain places and if you have a second place you can also post sentries there and that is their number one job which will protect that area that they're assigned to that's really good you know I live on acreage that's not all my acreage there's actually a few hundred acres it belongs to the neighbors but in order to keep the dare out I'm involved inside the fence so they put a fence around it I didn't realize this about sentries this is the first time I've heard you say that that I can recall but I felt I was supposed to post sentries and I used that word at every post on the fence around all the property my neighbors as well I said if anyone gets anywhere near us to try to do harm I want them to see these sentries as and I said let them think they're police officers let them whatever if they try to do harm so I don't know what you think about that well you can actually also tell them to expose anyone who's coming, why they're coming and they actually can stop them from coming they'll actually stop them they'll actually interfere with someone trying to come in on the property and that might be appearing them that might be them saying something and even if they can't see them they would hear that so that's what sentries do is keep things away from you and to make sure that your life and your property is safe so you did the right thing by posting sentries that's really good I got really serious one day because there had been evidence of an invasion and I thought I'm not having this I went to town I took off after that alright Star is asking this question she says some of us write letters to God just simply write things down to Him, to God does the Father receive those letters and if He does how does He receive them there's several different ways that can happen I would encourage you if you wrote one read it out loud to Him you can do that when you're just by yourself in your prayer time or just in the time when you're walking or just doing something you can actually read it to Him say Father I have written this letter to you and read it to Him and it's going to hear you read that letter and they probably record it it's probably recorded in heaven they do a lot of recording there's angels that's what they do and they're sent for that they actually record things there's couriers, there's scribes who write things down or else they write things down and you say or they bring messages from heaven that are written I've had both of those happen to me before but absolutely I'm just standing in a spot and just say to your family member I love you, I just want you to know I haven't forgotten you I'm excited about one day being there with you then He'll make sure they hear that people think everything's so far away but especially the Father, the Son of the Holy Spirit if you wanted to really say something to them He loves, by the way writing that thing down is an MO it's a motive operations of the Father He does have we know He has the lamest book of life we know that He has a book of remembrance He actually has many and they're real books they're huge books and He does actually write in them, He likes to write things out Christ would rather say it but the Father writes things down you know He wrote a book about your life before you were even born so I would say you writing things down maybe a good thing would be to get a journal and if you think of something each day to say something to Him then you write down the date and what you wanted to say to Him and make sure He hears that and the other thing you can do with that journal is when He begins to answer you it may be that still small voice inside but you know it's Him answering because He's answering what you just said to Him so that way you can have a two-way conversation and you can record it in a journal and then you can enjoy looking at it later on or maybe leave that for your children one day and they might be surprised if that's said to you or what you said to Him so authorship is a really big thing in heaven everyone has written a book that represents God or heaven or just something really fun but decent they're already on library shelves and your books are already in heaven do you mean everyone's written a book whether they've written it here or not what do you mean by that you said everyone some people still write books in heaven do you but are you saying people that don't write here are actually in effect authoring a book there I'm not quite sure what you're saying what I'm saying is those who have authored a book here those books I saw my own books in a library in heaven so I do know and I was told those who become authors is so important because even when you're gone that book remains here and those words will still be read by people and it may be something spiritual or it could be something just a help book or just something funny that's really decent and people love to read and there's still people who read books at all so you can go get them out of the library or you can just request to have one yourself there in heaven and you have a place for a library in your own mansion so people still still love to read well I thought it was cool when Bill Johnson had my book in his library if my book is in heaven that's way cooler yeah that's very very cool okay let me come back for a moment to this just popped into my head I think I'm supposed to share it like so it's almost 15 years ago I didn't know you yet I hadn't heard about either sentries or hosts but I was a praying man and my oldest daughter got in trouble she gave her phone number to a guy in the market and I was furious not at her but that this would happen that he would have it and he started calling and I ripped into the spirit realm and I prayed every prayer every kind of emotion about I wanted God to take it take notice and take action and protect her does God pay attention to the the amount to me there was faith behind that emotion because I knew God would act does God pay attention to our how do I say this angry faith if I can put it that way angry against the devil is what I mean I would say that's called passionate you're fierce against what the enemy is doing of course the fathers can hear you I'm absolutely sure many times he's going to answer that prayer and it may not be the way you think it will happen but it will happen and I've also seen that but you know passionate people God those people who have a passion and you're expressing what you're feeling and what you're thinking especially if it's something that lines up with what God wants and he speaks in this word about protecting and guarding your words and keeping certain people away from you because he doesn't want your family life infiltrated by the enemy or a thing that the enemy could use against you so absolutely especially the words of a parent for the child he's absolutely going to pay attention to that that's kind of like you hear about mama bear I became papa bear I can't remember any time in all of my life I prayed that intensely for my daughter but I felt there was an urgency so I let it rip alright Margaret asked is God the father and or heaven going through time with us on the earth even though the father can move back and forth in and out of time is there a sense of past present and future to Jesus Holy Spirit and the people in heaven so I think I understand where they're coming from do they get a sense of time because we're in time I'm quite sure heaven is very much aware of what's going on in any time actually the father's omnipresent he knows exactly what's going on where's going on and everything so he he has to be aware of what's going on so he can send help or send words or scribes or couriers for whatever purpose so yes he is very much aware even though he's not held by time or bound by time and doesn't operate like the way we operate here in time we have hours we're awake and hours we're sleep they don't sleep in heaven they don't have to but he's still very much aware of what's going on and all over the earth at different times on the earth so yes he's like he's present all the time no matter where we are what's going on and of course he can still go into the past and see things he can go into the future and see things the Bible says he's been from the beginning there would be time from the beginning to the end there is a beginning of time that was right when he first made the earth the end of time is when he wraps it all up and then he makes the new earth and then we're just in eternity we'll be in eternity but during this time I said time during this seasons of our life where time is very much involved with us with heaven then they are seeing things all the time as it's going by but he also knows the end of things at the same time so it's like if we're agonizing in prayer for something to happen that we want or think we need or we do need and there is a sense where God will say it's not time yet for that he'll know that it's three months in the future so he does operate within that framework he knows that this is for three months from now that kind of thing he already knows that he already knows when things are going to happen and even what's going to happen even though people have wills of their own he's already actually been through all of time he's seen all of time already but right now as we're speaking he is watching and he's listening so he can be anywhere at the same time that's one of the great things about him so he's very much involved in our lives at the same time and even does know what that end looks like and I've already told people that he actually did show me when the end of time would be and it's not really a date it's an event and I've learned that about him most of the things he plans and things for on the earth he goes by those events that he has planned and those are things that will happen in the earth that he has planned are going to happen but he did tell me one time he said there will be a day that will come when time will be no more because I won't need time and you won't need time on the earth on the new earth we won't have a clock we won't have things like that going on we will be living forever and we will also plan things by events at that time on the new earth but when everything ends is when time will be no more because he doesn't need time on this earth the reason he needs time now is because he's sending those little spirits from him, that's where everybody came from you lived in him but this is what he said time will be no more when I have sent the last one from myself I won't need time that's good I have a question about time now that we're on the subject Manuel Johnson talks about he's been transported in the future and the past so have you well God took him in the past he transported him in the past he showed him what happened he was there and it brought healing to his soul because God showed him this and that I don't know the whole story because I'm probably not doing it justice but great healing came to him by God taking him back in time does God do that sometimes does he see a need to bring someone back in time I think that he probably does because I know several other people who have encounters like that and I have been taken back in time quite a few times it was all related to things that happened in the Word of God or the way he made heaven the way he made the earth it was always related to revelation when he takes me back in time like he showed me his son on the cross and what happened when he had his spirit leave he took me back and I saw paradise or Abraham's bosom while he was there with the thief I saw him also when he was in hell approached the gates of hell and they were taking him and I saw what happened on the third day I was taken back back in the book of Acts when the Holy Spirit came and invaded in the upper room I mean there's many times he's taken me back I was taken back to the tomb the very day that he came out of that tomb I was taken that day back in time and I actually felt myself traveling it was the one time I felt myself traveling through time and I told people it was like on Star Trek or Star Wars when you go warp speed and those like shoot past you it is exactly like that I know they probably got that idea from the idea zone in heaven about how it looks like when you travel but it actually did and I actually could feel myself moving whenever we got to the part of time God wanted me to see we stopped and my feet just touched the ground crazy and it's like a portal open and I was there I was literally there in that time and I saw Mary go into the tomb looking for him and she saw the person in the garden and she came out and she thought he was the gardener because Christ was actually standing in the flowerbed smelling the flowers when these things happen both that and all the other back in time to be very very clear you went in that time this wasn't a vision a 3D experience you actually were there during the time it actually I was actually there I was wide awake I don't sleep long enough to dream I almost never dream and I have sometimes visions but this is called an encounter an encounter is you are actually there he's not showing me a film my feet touched the ground outside the tomb I saw the stone had been rolled away it was actually quite a ways down thing I also saw Christ standing he has a back turn to where the tomb was and he was literally looking at the flowers because he loves flowers and he had just been through 3 days of you know what and so when he came out of there after thanking his father for all that he had done for him he wanted to be in the midst of the flowers and I actually say Mary surmised or thought he was the gardener and she spoke to him she said her name she knew instantly when she heard him speak that it was him and then he turned around and of course she saw him then and I saw that in person, in that time that's how it happens people and instead of bashing people saying why not ask God to give you an encounter and show you something powerful I've been taking it up many many times for me and I didn't take myself I have to make it clear I didn't take myself that God had purpose for me and he'd already told me we're going to take you back in time, forward in time we're going to give you revelation on the word revelation on the times you're in and show you things to come and if you remember in Revelation 4 he actually said that to John I will show you things to come and so that's one of the things that God does with his prophets and so I was literally there in person remember the feeling of the ground the smell of the flowers everything about that place amazing Bobby Connor tells a story about going to the crucifixion not a vision not a 3D idea he was actually there and he said the smells the sights, the sounds you know have you been to the crucifixion as well? I saw a part of the crucifixion it was more what I heard him saying and they were of course very upset that he had died but we know that he actually the thing about Christ was he was such a powerful being he had to lose his soul from his body he actually had to tell it to leave he knew he had to die and so they probably were wondering why in the world hasn't that guy died they even put the sword inside and everything but he finally knew that it was time so he just lost his soul from his body and his spirit man left his body and then of course he was there his body remained on the cross until they took it down they were wrapping it the women were crying John was but John remembered also the words Christ said that he would rise again and so it was a very powerful thing people in the city people I could hear crying in the whole area there that he had died because they loved him so much he had helped so many people and did so many miracles they said you couldn't even put him in a book there were so many people count the miracles it says if the books were written of all the things he did the books would go around the world like the planet people so he was non-stop all the time doing his work that God gave him to do and so it was an emotional time but of course I already knew that he was going to raise from the dead but I had visited that place and then of course I was taken back when he came out of the tomb and then I was taken back when he was down in hell and then I was taken back I was taken back in time when he actually was sent into heaven and one of the angels had this urn with his blood because he had to pour that out on the mercy seat in heaven and so he showed me these things and he showed me the reality of the word of God it was so powerful but yes I have encounters he clearly comes and takes me just takes me like in a second and it doesn't matter where I am really and I gave him permission so it might be better if you say I give you permission to take me whenever you want to or speak to me whenever you want to that encourages him to do it actually and I don't even say that to him when he told me this is what we're going to have you do commission on the earth as a revelator this is what you're going to do and I said I'd give you permission whenever you want to and I guess while we're talking about time okay now you got me I have heard you and others talk about okay he said to the thief that was saved that became saved he said I'm telling you this day today you will be with me in paradise he didn't say in hell he said in paradise I have not heard anyone say during those three days what did he do in paradise no one's ever really related that to me at least well the first thing he did was preach the gospel to all of them it said he it said that he took captivity captive the captivity that was it was called Abraham's wisdom and paradise it is the same place where the dead we died if you were faithful and knew God and believed in God himself this is before the Messiah came God counted that your faith as being you know you were just and you were faithful so he didn't send them to hell they couldn't ascend to heaven though because Christ hadn't gone back to heaven pour out the blood except of course we know Elijah and Enoch literally were taken to heaven in their bodies and they're still there in the physical bodies I believe that they were glorified when he took them up to heaven already because they didn't have to die and that was the Father's choice to do that but but it is quite a thing for God to trust you to do things and share things for him but yes but that's his choice to take me I don't take myself but he actually entered into paradise because he had to keep his word to the thief thank you Holy Spirit said the XT he had to keep his word and he didn't say I'll see you tomorrow he said this day that day that day and so when he died they actually I think he died before the thieves didn't they have to come break their legs so they would die I think so because they had to break the legs and all that with the thieves so Christ descended into paradise paradise was not a place with rocks and you think well it's in the earth there's a bunch of rocks sitting around it was a city it was a beautiful city God made faithful and that's where his friends he called Abraham you know that was his friend many others of back in the Old Testament were friends of God because they chose to be friends of God and he didn't send them to hell they still had to they had to descend though when you believe in Christ now and you die you don't descend at all you ascend into heaven that's where he does the big difference because Christ has been there he made the way back he cleansed it he put the blood on the altar showing that he had died for everyone's sins and so that changed everything about for those who died that believed in Christ it changed some things happen that change everything and so yes he did go down there he was talking to Abraham he was talking to Joseph who raised him he was talking to all those people the faith of David all of those were in paradise and at one point they all exited and left paradise is empty now there's nothing there it's still there people actually asked me would Satan take it over he doesn't have the ability to take paradise over that's like a holy place that God made for those who loved him and believed in him and no hell can't take paradise and use it people he's never going to get paradise so he would have taken Joseph the one who was sold in Egypt he would have taken David Solomon and he would have preached the gospel and said this is what it means to be saved this is what I had to do that kind of thing he would have told the whole story he literally changed the gospel as if you tell people that Jesus Christ gave his life that he gave his life so that we might have a way to go back to heaven where we all came from there had to be a prize paid there had to be a sacrifice made and he actually told all of them they had like a gathering and he just preached the gospel to everybody there and everyone there received him as their Messiah they had to receive him as their Messiah because that's what makes it possible for you to go you know to go into heaven and so he did he preached the gospel he said he preached the gospel and so then he took captivity he captivated them with his love and his sacrifice for all for all those who choose him and so they then eventually they did exit Abraham's bosom or paradise and they are all now in heaven they don't use that anymore it's not used but it is still there it had golden buildings it actually had a river now these are spiritual places because you're there in your spiritual body I will explain to people the difference of being in the flesh and being in the spirit you have a spiritual body and it looks like you but it looks a lot better you look young you're full of energy and life and so when you died you entered into this spiritual round place that was paradise or if you were wicked there's a great gulf that separates those places I think the people in paradise can see the gates of hell and they know hell if they come up to the gates can see like it's like I can't think of what you call it a balcony they see like this big balcony that they can see in a far distance because remember the dream that the wicked man had and he wanted the beggar to bring a drop of water and put it on his tongue burning in hell that dream was real that was real and that's a good way to explain you read that dream and see what happened there was a hell he was burning in hell and he was telling God please send someone to earth to tell them about this place it's horrible I don't want my family to come here and of course God's answer to him was it wouldn't matter who came they're wicked in their heart and they don't want it and he said so that but he would not send Lazarus who was a beggar who was a beggar on the earth and he was they could see that he's eating he knew they were eating there's like a king's table a feast set there you still eat in your spiritual body people in heaven and these people in paradise were eating they had buildings that they stayed in they had a beautiful river they even had a sky because it was a spiritual place oh wow okay of the year he wouldn't take his friends who actually believed in him and lived right he wouldn't send them to place it was a dark money place here you are in the middle of the earth sitting next to the lava that wasn't going to happen God made this place beautiful and it and it was beautiful let me ask this one last question because I know we have to stop at the top of the hour there was a great earthquake when Jesus was crucified and graves were open what have you seen if anything as far as that have you seen that event graves open the earthquake I know it didn't happen I know that the earthquake was shook and graves open and people saw I'm trying to remember I don't know if they gave a number or something but it was quite a few it was quite a few hundred I believe they were actually noted it was noted and written somewhere I don't know maybe Josephus or somebody wrote that down but it does mention in the Bible that they had an earthquake and the graves were opened and they saw people walk it was just another testimony that that was the son of God I mean a lot of people began to believe that was the son of God cross that was the son of God because he knows that couldn't have happened any other way so that really did happen people came up out of the graves and they walked around it was fascinating it was fascinating but you know it's interesting because you know it shows integrity on your part because you're not making it up if God didn't show you you're not saying God showed me you're saying I didn't see people walking out of the grave people walking out of the graves when there was an earthquake so that to me that adds credibility to you because you could make something out of it I wasn't taking and showing those people walking but I do know that did happen I do know that did happen they still talk about it in heaven sometimes wow I'd love to see a video of that and I guess in heaven we get to see replays that we want right if we want to see what that looks like absolutely can see replays awesome I like those are the kind of re-runs I want to see that if you will pray for the people before we go and just bless them if you will Father I thank you for this beautiful day I thank you for your holy son our king of kings I thank you for Holy Spirit who can be our best friend but is still God he was sent to come alongside us and then when we choose to invite him to indwell us he actually moves on the inside of us and then he'll never stop talking to us but I thank you for that that you are very much involved in our lives and you do care for everyone and I pray Father that people have to understand they need to understand that when they have someone who belongs to Jesus Christ and they receive Jesus Christ when they move to heaven it is a good thing it is a good thing for them that's why they celebrate in heaven they don't weep and cry when someone comes home they celebrate because God loves it when one of his children come home one of his sons or his daughters they come home to heaven they actually have a huge celebration rewards are given from the throne at that time and then all their family and friends go to see this person's mansion and then they get undone by how beautiful and amazing or adventurous even these mansions are so powerful thank you Father for thinking of us in the past now in this time and in the future you know where we are you know that we love you I thank you in these days set a table and the presence of everyone's enemies that would be the left that would be the liberals all those evil people colluding and flaming together to take over this world which makes me laugh ha ha ha because this earth was made by you and your son and it says the earth and the focus now belongs to Jesus Christ the earth is your footstool because you're ever watching us thank you for intervening in lives people have lost things like their property or their money is running low I thank you right now you take out of your own stock and you give to those people Father because they're trusting you they're believing you and they're staying excited I thank you for showing yourself strong on their path in these days right now in Jesus name so be it and everyone said amen and amen I just want to encourage people to go to revealingheaven.com cats two books are there and other products go to catcur.com that's the only place

You Welcome to Elijah streams. It happens to be Tuesday, August 16, but we're recording this for a week from Wednesday So whatever that date is someone can put that on the screen for me. I forgot to look that up, but August this is for August 24 Even though we're recording it on August 16. So we're on with cat. It's going to be good. So if anything she says happens to be Historically incorrect because more things have happened. You'll understand why so it's going to be a great show There's no I have no other announcement. So let's If you all are ready, I'm ready. So let's watch Wednesdays with cat and Steve. Here we go Well, hello, I don't know which to say happy Wednesday. I can't say that because it's not How are you doing cat you just I'm doing great. That's always gonna be my answer You got your you were just telling me got a brand new scarf and shirt. Is that we were saying I have everything new. Okay, the jacket which is really cool You can't see. There you go. You can see powers really beautifully engraved. I just got that yesterday in the shirt which I would have worn on the platform And my scarf and yeah I was going to the salon today and the Holy Spirit said you were in that brand new black shirt looks really nice and you wear the new jacket and I'm thinking I think it could get wet. You never know when you're going to go to salon was going to happen. He said no, go ahead and wear it. Not telling me why and I'm sitting in there in the chair at the salon and she's almost done with me When I get it when I get a call and say did you remember that you had to record something with Steve Schultz? No, I didn't but now I know why he told me to wear this. I walked in the door literally walked in the door and just sat in the chair so Holy Spirit needs to be your best friend. Let me tell you he'll let you know all kinds of things you wouldn't expect that he would And so here I am today and that's very cool. You know lately Darin and I have been practicing that every not I was I was about to say every once in a while very often now all of a sudden I'll remember something We went to bed and it gets cold in a certain part of our house even though it's summer and she went to bed and she and she said I think I might have left the heater on that little portable heater so she went out there and she said the Holy Spirit keeps telling me stuff but it's not like a voice necessarily she just all of a sudden she thinks about inside that's what yeah exactly so I keep saying thank you thank you Holy Spirit thank you, you know, I think him today. That's awesome. So, so it's I would encourage people when you suddenly remember something and it was important, say thank you Holy Spirit right. Yes, absolutely say thank you. You're so so good and he likes gratitude I found that out so. Yes, he does that that that will intensify the actual friendship one if you're thanking him all the time. Oh yeah, I do thank him all the time I think him the father of something I think I think I think them I think the Trinity. Sometimes it's the father of the Lord, most of the time the Holy Spirit is when he talks to me about every day stuff, or even reminds me of things and like I can't lose anything no matter what I can't find. He either shows me where it's at literally a picture of where it's at, or it just comes back. It just comes back. What do you mean it comes back what do you mean. If I found if I've misplaced something really important and I really need it. And I've looked a little bit for it. Well there's something I always say you all need to just learn this. If I can't find something I always say these words, and they always work. It's not the word is what you're saying. And I say Holy Spirit you know where everything is it was ever made that is made right now and never will be made. Please show me where and I say what it is where it is now. And in that moment he literally shows me like a vision of where it's sitting laying or even underneath something. He does it immediately and I say thank you so much for showing me where that is. Because I give him an opportunity to do something for me by saying that. So that's asking you have not because you asked not so I'm literally asking him. But first I'm telling them who I tell him who he is. And what he does know he knows everything that was ever made. No matter where it is in time he knows he knows what's made right now and he knows what's going to be made in the whole. The best person to ask first before you run around an hour looking say that first and just say I ask you to show to me right now. And he'll either show me or someone will yell I found whatever. Oh wow. But it's like it's something that's very quickly done immediately when I when I honor him for who he is and then I ask. I think that's that's one of the meanings where it says in the scriptures before you call I will answer. It's like he knows you're about to call he knows your words are forming and he already starts forming this picture. Lord show me that years ago and I and so when I ask him something I don't try to wait for a long time I try to listen to what the very first thought because before I call him he's going to answer so that's very very cool so awesome. Well you've got some thought maybe a few thoughts on your heart for when people will watch this so share that before we get into questions if you want to. I do actually. My husband was driving me to the salon and you know the traffic's backed up like crazy everywhere around here. They're building a few new things so the streets are backed up. And also if it's the time like when school lets out there's always going to be traffic somewhere in this city. And so we had a lot of time in line we were sitting in line in the traffic but I never complain when that happened. And so the father starts speaking to me immediately and then he took me from. I wasn't in the truck. I was taken to this place and shown something he wants me to share so I'm going to share it with everybody first time ever like just happened to me maybe an hour ago or so. He took me he caught me up and put me on this long winding road I didn't even know where I was at and in front of me was where I had been he said I want you to see where you've come from he said I'm going to show you a journey. And so I saw this long road in front of me and then all the way up where these red streaks he said that's the blood of Christ that never leaves you all the way up to my feet they came and then he said now you may turn and see where you're headed. And when I turned I saw still some more road because this is my journey remember I saw more road in front of me but it got more and more transparent and then I could see shortly in the distance the city of God which would be the throne room or all the beauty and splendor is in heaven I saw that and he said everyone who belongs to me needs to know that this is your destination he was saying not just mine everyone is a believer that is your destination this is what he said to me. Everyone should love one another now because I actually say the world will know you by your love for each other stop fighting. Stop arguing stop picking on each other stop saying things aren't even true about each other. He said you spend your time loving. So when you reach that destination, there will be an even greater celebration that you chose to love on another and be a testimony to who I am. And I was so undone because the splendor that looked just like the city of God that's what I call heaven city in heaven. It was like the city of God I saw all the time I could see streets of gold I could see the glorious buildings that were in the air they're not even on the ground I clearly knew where that was but that's what he was saying. Anyone who's a believer that's our destination we're all going to the same place. Okay this is what else he said your body may die but that's not you. That's part of your covering. He said your spirit man and your soul never dies so all those if you recently had someone passed to heaven I've had three really good friends recently like even in the last week somebody met passed on to heaven. And you know she was like in her fifties and yet she was not just ready her mansion was done and she went and I was celebrating I always celebrate when somebody goes to heaven so I have that I understand that is our home we will go there until he makes the way we were but this is our destination we're on a journey together that's what he's trying to say to me he was very adamant this is a journey you're doing together where you've been and then where you're going your destiny where you're going your destination is all the same destination. But what you do now matters it doesn't matter and having a matters how we treat each other matters if you if you know accomplish the mission he has given you but honestly part of our mission is to care about each other the Bible says to. You know to consider those are the household of faith or God first that means we should consider our fellow Christian members first we need to help them we need to honor them bless them and that is our goal that and let the world know us by our love how big of a deal that because right now I don't think they think the body of Christ or Christians are known because of our love for each other but it's going to happen and I will say this Jesus won't come back several years many years away actually before that happens but he's not coming back until we are loving one another because the Bible says the world will know us by our love for each other is one of the signs that that you know that we're getting close to him coming so we have some work left to do so people just forgive people just let it go loose out of your soul somebody wrong you and just love them anyway and the other thing you're doing is you're piercing Satan he does not want you to forgive people and love one he doesn't want us to love one another if we keep fighting whenever they even know who we are how can you operate in the power of God and speak for him on his behalf if you're trashing people who are the household of faith so this is a good time for you to just say I'm sorry father from this day forward I'm going to I'm going to do the very best I can and ask for more grace and get filled with your love and let this world see me love other believers and so that was the encounter I just have literally speaking to me I was gone in the second I was right back in the seat of the truck well of course I told my husband what just happened and he goes oh that's awesome he's not a man of many words but he was thought he thought it was a great thing and I said I'm supposed to share that I'm supposed to share that the next time not remembering even at that moment that it would be just a couple hours from them when I would do that so that is a word from the father if we are supposed to love one another care about each other help one another don't pick people's you know even if you don't have maybe you don't have a vision for what you're doing right now you don't pick other people's visions apart that's okay somebody happy and can I ask you a question so almost everyone has people that are I guess we would say they're in the body of Christ but they are so different than what we are there even some of them are off base but we know they accepted Christ but and then some are detractors and some are almost enemies and yet and yet they serve the Lord and what happens when we decide to just in our heart I guess it happens in our heart first just decide you know what I'm going to love them whether they ever know this or not I'm going to choose to love them what does something happen in the spirit when we do that. Yes, but I have to have to make clear what what what you're saying I understand what you're saying you make a decision with your soul, because your natural emotions aren't going to do it. You can even say, I make a choice with my will, no matter how you're feeling about it, you can actually do that that's actually something that is possible. You don't have to feel it for you don't have to feel it then you don't have to feel you don't have to feel you do not have to feel it. You're making what you declare and decree shall be established unto you and it is going to happen. I've had to do that several times actually, depending on what people had said have done done done to me or said to me. I say I choose as an act of my will to forgive them and my emotions certainly in that moment of time probably don't want that but you overrode your emotions. That's not like you're not being you that's using a part of you maybe you didn't use very often. Your will is the most powerful part of you. It's what it's what you display. I mean, know your will is what you choose to do your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you actually choose. And my husband has always said what you choose to do you will do. That's his famous quote. And he's very right about that so why not choose with your will the way the father decided to make it and say I choose as an act of my will not my emotions to forgive and say their name. And guess what the father he will write that down and he will immediately start working on the heart of the other person because you have forgiven them. That actually gives the father and Holy Spirit freedom to pursue that person for them to change no matter they're probably you're probably not the only one they're doing things to. If people are in fear or if they're in pain or if they're angry it makes them lash out I'm not giving an excuse for them I'm just telling you that's how it operates in your soul. As a man think it then his soul. So are you that's the heart of your being your soul. I had I had a situation. I don't know if I ever brought this up but there was a guy who went home to be with the Lord years and years ago. Okay so this is nothing current years and years ago but before he did that he tried really hard to destroy this ministry that I mean so it was a long time ago but it was this ministry. And I think or I feel like or I think I, I tried to forgive him okay I don't know which words to put, and I went to, you know, I had been really really sick many people know I was bed ridden my pastor. At that time thought maybe I was, I was depressed while I wasn't, but he said I want you to go to counseling so in deference to him I went to counseling for a few times. And I told this counselor a woman counselor and I told her about this guy that tried to destroy us because she was digging deep for anything that might be bothering me. And I said this happened this happened this happened and the guy's book was on her shelf so I knew she knew who he was. And so she said I want you to go up these stairs see yourself going up these stairs and open the door and it's the Lord, and you and him are going up there together, you're walking side by side up these areas. And I want you to tell the Lord what you think about him. You can imagine that was kind of, and all of a sudden now these emotions are coming up and all of a sudden I'm balling. And I said, it was like the Lord said what do you think about and he named the name and all of a sudden tears are just flowing. And I said he did the best he knew how to do he served you with, and that was sort of a combination cat of soul and emotion all mixed in there because I choose. I chose to do that talk about forgiving someone after they're gone, after it's too late to say it to them. You can. Well, number one, I do want to say the person who passed on. Yeah, they're immediately sorry for everything ever said or did you it just is a part of what happens. So when you die and step out of this body and your spirit man steps out, you know immediately what you did that, even if we're seeing, let's say I'm not saying murder or stuff like that. Maybe you were rude, maybe you were harsh to people, maybe you did something wrong against them. You know, immediately at that moment you're flooded with the life of God and you go, wow, I should have said I was sorry, you know, I should have said I was sorry for them what I did was wrong. I should have told them one day they feel still in need to tell you that. So they're basically at that moment saying they were sorry or repenting for doing it, even though you never heard it. Yeah, there is absolute forgiveness or actually a recompense for when at the moment someone dies and he's in heaven right now can't wait to see you and hug you when you get to heaven and say man, I should have been better to you. And you're probably saying these words, it doesn't matter anymore. But it would feel I can imagine it feeling good, really, really good to hear it. And also at the same time saying it doesn't matter anymore, you know, all at the same time all mixed in the same time you're really you're kind of happy. Yeah, they did it. They did understand. No, you can't you can't try to hide from truth when you're in the presence when you're in the presence there's no there's no hiding from what is true, you know what is true. And especially leaders in the body of Christ have a double accountability might as well bring this in your double accountability is leaders in the body of Christ and I'm sure the Lord may have something to say to you when you get in heaven he won't keep you from heaven. But I'm sure he may have something to say to you because the word does say that you'll be held calm for every wasteful word. It actually says that in the Bible. Can you clarify that you said that the other day in heaven, huh? You said that last time we were on the program about someone else you said he'll have something to say. Yeah. Can you postulate or even relate what type of thing he might say to someone like that? What do you mean he'll have something to say? I think that is done at a special appearance. I'm not saying that is necessarily done when you first arrive in heaven. Okay. Unless it was a special case, as was the case I saw the other day. Most of the time you'll be in heaven and you're rejoicing you're celebrating you're so happy the presence so powerful, but the more the presence begins to just invade your soul. You kind of know I probably should have handled this better. You don't feel guilty. There's no guilt. There is no guilt in heaven. Even when you come before the judgment seat of Christ and he will say things to you like, you know, I did ask you to do this. Like he asked, let's say he asked you to be a preacher. You decided to be a rodeo. Whatever. I'm just making a crazy. Yeah. And he did great at being in the rodeo, but you didn't ever pick up the call that he's dad. He will mention that to you. You'll have a conversation that doesn't mean he's going to kick you out or anything. But because in the Bible it says you'll be held accountable. So don't use waste wasteful words would be like bashing people being unkind to people saying rude remarks. And you're you're a believer, but you're still doing this stuff up into the day you go. You will realize, yeah, man, I should have not done that because truth begins to invade you. And when you kind of hear from that truth or you ignore that truth, that doesn't mean you won't go to heaven. That just means you are going to have a time to be talked to. Well, you know, I'll just end with this because I know you have the first question about something else or anything else to say. But I've talked about my father many times and he was in fact, he's with the Lord. He was in fact a major serial child abuser. He was OK. Then he got his heart right. And I know he's with the Lord. You said he's felt really good when I talked about he's with the Lord. You said that makes him happy when he hears that. So that was a major, major, major, major sin or set of sins or years of sin. So talk about the talking to that he might receive one day. I mean, how does that work? What would he say to my dad? Because he already knew he was wrong. I'm not even talking about actual sin. I'm not even talking about sin. Oh, that was sin. No, that was sin. His repentance of all that wiped it away. Oh, OK. So he's not talking about that. And he's not up there thinking about that anymore. He's thinking about how much he loves you and he's excited for you. And he knows that you're doing great things for God. Now, what I'm talking about are people who are like, even though they're believers, it's not really a sin to be rude. It's not nice. But those are wasteful words you're speaking. They are not necessary and you shouldn't be speaking on those things. He will talk to you. He will. He will talk to you about that, those kind of things. Sin is forgotten into the sea. No, there's no more remembrance of that. Like, no matter who's out there, if you sin and you're repented, don't bring that up to the Father again. If you're repented, he won't remember it. He won't remember it. But after you've been born again and repented, maybe you sin later, repent again, please. The God is not into freely sin at all. He is not in agreement with you to freely sin when you're a believer. That's not any kind of testimony or witness for him. And you just don't want to do it because people can see you acting like that and they'll think, why should I get saved? You act just like me. If you're sinning, if you have a lifestyle of sin, that's not a good thing at all. But what I'm talking about is just people's attitudes and the way they treat people. Those things, he will probably say something to them about because it does say, you will be held accountable for every wasteful word, words that shouldn't have been spoken, that were not necessary, that maybe hurt people or, you know, interfere with things in their life. Those kind of things. Because he said that in the word, he will talk to you about those things. But you're sin. I always thought, I guess I'm wrong on my thinking. I always thought those wasteful words and things you're speaking against people were, in fact, sins. Really? Wasteful is not sinful. There's a clear definition here. No, sins, the sins, the sins that you did in the earth, you have to repent, even if it's at the moment you die and Christ comes to you and says something. At that moment, you would have to say, I do truly repent because of the keys of hell, death and the grave. But the wasteful words have nothing to do with you getting into heaven or not. It's the attitude you have. It's maybe the witness that you're being. It won't keep you from being in heaven, but you could have probably had a lot more or done more for him because if you had treated somebody different. He's clearly saying that even when you're born again, watch how you treat people, how you handle people. He doesn't want people getting crushed or falsely or wrongfully accused. He wants that to not happen from a believer because you're actually messing with the testimony of what a believer is. Let's say sinners know you and they see you acting or mistreating people. They're like, why should I bother? You're almost interfering in more than just that. So those wasteful words that you shredded people with your mouth, that's not a sin. That's just a wasteful words that should not have been done. It's a waste of time to speak them. In other words, those he will hold you accountable. That doesn't mean you're going to be kicked out of heaven and he will let you know what that means when you get there. So no, he's not talking about sins. That doesn't mean sin. That's amazing. Well, what else do you have before we get into questions? Any other thing about current events or anything like that? I'm just excited about all the fraud exposure that's coming forth, which I'm sure everybody else is also. The legitimate many has meant other people coming forward to testify against the left who were a part of that. And I'm telling people to be the biggest, probably the biggest exposure ever in the history of the earth. Because of the exposure will be so deep and so wide and so complete. That everyone is doing anything to try to take over the world to stop our lives, steal what we have, or just stop the word of God from going forth. Anything that has an evil agenda on the left or the liberals, whatever they're doing, they are all going to be exposed and justice is going to be brought against them. And that's why I keep telling them that are doing that you better go. You better go be a witness and testify against what they're doing, because the day is going to come when the window will close and they won't need people's witness. They'll have so many witnesses that have been proven to be right that will legally cause legal action to take forth, come forth, whether it's from heaven or from the earth, but they're going to be exposed. And so that's just happened again. There are eyewitnesses that have come forth from all places. I may as well tell you because it's all over the place. It's FBI agents. I'm not saying to them to went into Mar-Lago or I can't even say the name. Trump's home to steal things or mess up things, which was what their agenda was. I don't know about them. I'm talking about ones who were a part of that and are no longer a part of that. They have got some of them who've come forward and are testifying, literally testifying, which God said on November the 4th, 2020, it would happen. So those things are beginning to happen and more and more people, you're not going to hear about it until it all breaks loose. And they have to say those famous words that the 2020 election was stolen. And it will be said on regular news and they won't want to say it because of the testimony and the witness and the evidence. They are going to have to say that people. And I can tell you those things are starting to come in. They're compiling up against the left and the liberals. I'm not doing it. It's happening because God said it would happen. And we just, they just had some more come forward and do that. So I'm always excited when truth is being told because it helps people. The truth makes you free. Are there people cat-like news anchors that we would recognize? Many of them who were told, you will not report. You will not say this because you will not say it was stolen that, that are going to come forward and say, they told me I couldn't talk about it. And commentators who wanted to tell the truth and they'll say they were, they told me I was not allowed to, well, that kind of thing all over the place. Definitely. Well, we're going to have all kinds of from every area from the business arena and the medical arena. I mean, everywhere from the financial arena, the media arena, there are going to be some from every one of those different areas because that's how far reaching the lie is and the deception is. And therefore people will come from each one of those arenas and they will testify because probably most likely they're not working. I mean, I didn't be working at those places right now because they were threatened with death. Most likely that that seems to be like, well, if we can't badger them or force them, then we'll just tell them we'll kill them. And I mean, again, this is truth. What I'm speaking is the truth that has already happened. And if they can't get these people who are in these positions to go along with them, they just take them, they just take them out. They threaten them. Truly they do. And some people won't talk about it because they're afraid for their own life. But there's going to come a time when they realize if they don't come forward and say something, this thing is going to come to an end where the people believe it or is or not. And you can't, no one can stop it from happening. It is coming to an end. And that whole foundation has already started crumbling under those people of the left and the liberals. It's already crumbling and they know it's crumbling. That's why they're being desperate, like, you know, raiding Trump's home and other things and saying, what else can we find or make up or lie about that will keep this thing going because it's failing. And it's failing big. So I just spoke the truth again. There are all these people from all those arenas and some people who are very high up in them, which is the testimony they really need. They need them to come forward and say that there's going to be a big witness protection program somewhere. But I can tell you right now it is going to happen. And so some of that just happened the other day and it's already being spread everywhere and it's true. They have had some come forward to that want to testify on behalf of what is right. So good. So good. I love it. I love it. Okay. Anything else before questions? I don't think anything else right now. I do have a question here that we can kind of start with. Yeah, start with that one. That'd be good. This is I love getting I love getting and let me tell you, I get so much mail. It's wonderfully outrageous. It takes me weeks and sometimes even months to go. If it's sent to me for me personally, I do go through it and look at it. And I do pray for a lot of people at that time. If it's something that's urgent, I will pray for them. But this little child who's nine years old, I'm just going to say her name is Andrea. And I'm not saying anything else about where it came from or what. Since God is making a new heaven and a new earth. And if you didn't know that, guess what he's going to. And the word does say that he is. So she is correct. Do you know what he's going to do with the moon? And I just love these children's questions. You know, they don't they don't hold anything back when they want to know something. They just ask what people think about what they say. Well, I'll tell you, Andrea, you can probably have it in your own yard on the new earth. I am quite sure the father can make you one. And so you will not miss the moon. And you know, he did make the sun and the moon. He made them himself. It says so in the Bible. Now, when he originally in the beginning, Genesis one, one in the beginning, when he made the earth, he lit it with his glory. There was no sun or moon lighting this earth when he made it the first time. And then in verse two, something has happened because he made it the first time and it was finished. It was done. He was done with the first time he made it. In verse two, it says that darkness is on the face of the deep and the water is covering the whole earth. Well, he didn't make it that way. He would have never made it that way. He made it the way it should have been. But then Saint was kicked out of heaven, fell to earth. He began to make the earth a wilderness. It says that in Jeremiah. And so God turned the light out. It also says that. He turned out the light. He took his glory off the earth and he broke the water vapor shield around the earth, which brought mist on it because it never rained in the very beginning. You need to know that too. Even scientists know that. And so it flooded the whole earth and then he made it darkness come upon it because he took the light out. So here's the earth sitting in verse two, right? It says he made it in verse one in the beginning. He made that means made means done, made the heavens and the earth. And then in the second verse, it's a mess. There's, there's, there's water covering the sky. That's the firmament. And it says in the Bible that he took the water off the firmament. He took it off of the land and began to redo the earth. It says that clear in the Bible. So then when he began to redo it in verse two, he starts that and he even says what he does. Okay. He replenishes the plans and brings them back. He puts the sun in the sky to light the day and the moon at night to light the night. It didn't say that in one one. And people go, well, how could this be millions of years people between verse one one, right? And Genesis one, two, there are millions of years. Oh, that's the first time I've heard you put it. No, there really is because it, there was no kind of time on the earth, right? The sun and the moon counted the days and the nights. When he started redoing the earth, replenishing is the correct word. The Holy Spirit just told me, we began to replenish the earth. Well, you can't read something. If you didn't do it before modeling your home unless you built it before. So you need to look at the words that are spoken unless people have written a new Bible and wiped them out and then just forget about it. Find one that isn't. It has not been changed. But so he made the earth in the beginning and it was done. It was finished. Beautiful. And it had a water vapor shield. He put around the whole earth that brought mist onto the trees, the flowers, but the light of God came from everyone who goes to heaven gets to see this. They go to this place and he lets you see him making the heavens and the earth light of God came from the ground and it would hit this water vapor mist. And part of that was part of what the rainbow. But the sky back then in Genesis one, one was a peachy pink. It wasn't blue because the sun wasn't present. They created that needed that to make the sky blue. So in verse two, it all changes when he takes the water off of the firmament. That's the sky. It takes the water off the land and starts to be replenished the earth replenish that the creatures, the plant life. I probably didn't say it in the right order, but he did. Then we know eventually on day 16, he made man. But that's this was a whole different sky. Same earth foundation. Everything sound glow was there, but he was replenishing it so man could live on the earth. Okay, so they could live there. And then he put the sun in the sky and it brought life by the day and then the moon at night. And it even says that so you could see at night. And so now we have the sun and the moon. The sky is beautiful blue normally in the daytime. And then the sky at night is dark and except the light from the stars and the sun. I mean, the moon, you can see it clearly. But my answer to Andrea's, I'm quite sure that he would be happy to make you a moon to be over your mansion or in your mansion. That's how cool God is. I could clearly see him doing that for you, Andrea. Very cool. Hey, on and creation, I've been asked this before. I don't, don't recall if I've asked you people have asked many times on the seven days of creation, were they 24 hour days? Yes. That's what I thought, but I wanted to double check. Because the Bible says it was today in the night. And then it was another day. It actually says that it says evening in morning, right? Evening in morning. 24 hour day. Yeah. Six. Because he's God. That's why he spoke it. The word stepped out and made all of it. They could do it. They could do that as fast as they wanted to do it. That's why if you send an angel on assignment, like, like the, the heavens army, you send an assignment, they're back in five minutes. They've already dealt with what it was that you prayed about. And because, because there is no time. There's no day, no night. There is no time. There's no calendars. So when you send them or you pray for something, they go do it instantly. And then they come back for another appointment. I've seen that happen in heaven because I've been to Michael's headquarters. This is a free, free stuff now. I've been there and Michael's headquarters when they were sent on the mission. And it seemed like, you know, they were back. They went and dealt with it in the spirit realm. And then they came back for the next set of orders. That's amazing. Now you said it's in the scriptures that God turned the lights out. Can you tell which one that is? I'm not familiar. People read the whole book and find it. You're not going to. He won't let me. Okay. People to find them themselves. Steve, church and they listen to their pastor say stuff, but they don't. Most of them don't even go check it out. I admire people that search out the word to find things and see what it says about truth. Well, I do have some. He lets me quote, like he lets me cope. The first John 227 to let you know that you have a weapon in you. You never use most of them. And that's called, you know, the anointing. Yeah. It says in the Bible in first John 227, when you receive Jesus Christ and become a Christian, you get a deposit of the anointing. What is that? The anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness. You get a deposit of it and it says, it lives in you. I carry the anointing. I release the anointing. The anointing grows so much that it's like a big cloud outside of me. And if I walk into a place that begins to affect people, that's what Peter did. That's what Paul did. They said Peter's shadow healed people. It was the cloud of anointing coming from him because he did get a deposit when he got Christ. Christ puts a deposit of the anointing in you and it never leaves you. But the more you give it out, the more you get back. It's almost like a bank account. It's like an investment account. When you release the anointing, it grows. So that's what you're supposed to do. You've never done that. Make sure you start releasing it into what? Go in the restaurant. You drink out of a cup. You say, I release the anointing. It'll never leave that cup. The next person, it never leaves that cup. No, never. Not through the dishwasher. No, it's not because it's a spiritual thing. It comes from you, release the anointing. It goes in that cup. Every restaurant I ever eat at, I release it in the table. I release it in the seats. And so there's John. We've seen some people sit down in places and they jump back up. They're like, I don't know what that was because it would be God. Maybe they're not, maybe they're not, maybe they don't know the Lord. Maybe they're doing wicked things. They sit in that chair full of anointing. They all have to jump up and go find another place to sit down. So if you anoint the seat, let's say the seat in the table. For the rest of the time that that table exists, people will sit down in the anointing. And that's not just cat curd. That's anyone. Any believer that when you got born again, go read 1st John. I'll say it slow. 1st John 2 27. You have it because you got born again. Jesus Christ literally takes a deposit of the anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness and he says, he puts it in you and it lives there to buy there. That means it's there. It's up to you to release it wherever you go, whatever you touch. I have my phone up here before I send the text. I type in, I put my hand on this, they're releasing anointing. When they touch that and read that text, it comes out and you get. Wow. Oh, we actually released it in the tires of our car and I see fire tracks because the anointing looks like fire. It looks like that. In the spirit. It looks like fire. And so when we drive our car, you see fire tracks and everybody who passes over those tracks, the anointing will begin to penetrate their car. You don't know how supernatural you are. There are so many things we don't know as believers unless we are told that. And the Bible says, I have not seen or you're hearing or entered in the heart or mind of man, but God has prepared for those that love him. Well, one of the things he's already prepared is the anointing you're carrying. We have testimonies from people that their brother couldn't stand them. He lost his job and they wanted to help him. And the one guy, the brother had the good, the brother that was living right had these cowboy boots that this other brother wanted all the time. And they went to my meeting and heard me say these words. And when they went home, they anointed the cowboy boots, released the anointing in them, both of them. And they called the brother said, why don't you come have dinner? And they said, we really want to pray with you. He lost his big landscape business and now he was really needing. He said, well, I guess I'll come. And he asked, can I mow your lawn to get some money? And they said, yeah, sure. So when he went to leave, they said, you've always liked these boots. Would you like them? And he goes, yes, I want those boots. Well, these are anointed boots people from them. They carried the brother and his sister while that they carried they put in those boots. A couple of days later, he called and goes, I don't know why I've been mad at you. Wow. Why am I mad? I care about you. I just thank you for these boots. And by the way, I just got a brand new contract. I got a whole new contract to do all these condos now. And now I've got money again. I want to thank you so much for blessing me. It didn't happen until it gave him the boots. He put them on and the anointing began to penetrate now. And do you have to be in person to lay your hands on for that to work? Can you send the anointing from a distance? That would be rare. That'd be rare. Okay. You can send them something. You can send them a card in the mail. Okay. I released the anointing and you mail it. And when they open it or touch it, they don't even go. So Kat, if I put the anointing on an envelope, really prayed for it, the anointing to be released on an envelope. It goes to the person and the person says, writes on it, refused, returned to center, but they held it. They touched it. That's all it takes, Steve. That's clever. I will leave places go. We'll say it's too late, everybody. And this is the best part. Any of those people have been watching me bashing me. It's too late. You already have the anointing in you because I put it in everything as we're doing these things. We annoy all of our stuff and put it in it. And you can anoint your computer before you send emails. And the email, when they look at that email, they open it, it goes in them. Even, even if you, even if they look at it for a second and said, I don't want to read this, but they see it. That's it. Wow. Okay. Let's ask one question about sending the host. Sometimes I think, well, I've really done my job. I've spent 20, 30 minutes sending the host all over the place. I'm still in bed. I'm doing it while I'm still in bed. And I've sent them everywhere and I've given them assignment. I think, well, I'm done for the day, but you're saying five minutes later, they're back. I always give them one more before I go to sleep because you know, that's seven a.m. I'm up 20 hours a day. So they've been getting instruction out at three a.m. I, I like to go outside. I just like to go outside. I don't have to, but I want to be near where they're at. So I go outside with my staff and every time I, I give them an order to command to go somewhere, which I'm allowed to do because Christ was, you know, we know he was the Lord of hosts. He commanded the army to things he did. We can do too. I'm not going to go through all that, but I do. And I'll take my staff and I hit it on the ground and I'll just say, I'm not going to be it. Go host, make toast. That means they're going after the dark, the spiritual darkness to pull it down, to shred platforms and they will do it. And you may not find out to get to heaven one day, but when you do that, you are having an impact somewhere. But back to the anointing thing for just a minute. When I used to speak, we had a whole meetings that were nothing but to teach people to, they knew now that according to the word, the anointing was in them. And I was like, right here in the core of your being, I'd had people stand up and say, okay, now you know you have it. Lay your hand on there and ask Holy Spirit to stir it up. And we would actually have them do that. And then I always had, I always did something so they could see that it actually did something. And then I would say lay hands on the person next to you and say, I released the anointing in Jesus name and people were falling out. They started laughing. The room was getting so full. I could feel the waves of anointing coming from everybody. And I finally would say, stop, stop, stop, stop. I can't stand up anymore. So I didn't have them. I actually trained them how to use it. And people used to go while they would, they would go and anoint the reservoir of the city, like stick their hand as close as they could to it in it. And they did things like they would go to the pizza restaurant. They worked in, they would touch every pan in the restaurant, the ovens in the restaurant, the pizza place. And we see anointing, which everybody who got a pizza made on that pan got the anointing. My goodness. Forever because it doesn't leave. It doesn't ever leave because it's a spiritual thing. It's a spiritual thing. Unbelievable. You can be doing all kinds of things. Yeah. I'm re-fired up. Okay. It's like our secret weapon. It totally is. Understand the word that clearly says it lives in you. What do you think? What did you ever think you were going to do with it? Yeah. What people, what did you think? It says the anointing breaks or destroys the yoke of darkness. That's the anointing you carry. And no matter where you walk, you can release it through your feet. I walk through the store, release it everywhere in the store. Every garment I ever look at on the rack, I will touch and go, I'll release the anointing, the anointing, the anointing. Everyone who buys those clothes will have that anointing on them. Goodness, goodness, goodness. You can be busy all the time, people, just for the anointing. I'm going to get busier all the time. I see myself getting very busy. Okay. I, I told this lady, no, well, I would ask this, but it's way too long to read. So I'm going to summarize what she's saying. She's totally into everything you're teaching even today. I'm sure. But her husband began to be. A detractor. Then he went from a detractor to. He didn't like it. Then he went from that to. To being biased against it. Then he went, then he became a cynic. Then he became a mocker. Now he is a hardcore mocker of everything she's doing. And it's hurting her marriage. And she's supposed, she feels like she's supposed to submit to him. What does she do? That depends on how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. God, God, God, God, God, God, God. And then how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. God never said, he never said, we had to submit to the abuse of our husband. It's just physical abuse. It hasn't been physical. I think she would have told me, but it's really verbal wickedness. I can tell you what she can start doing. You need to start laying your hands on everything he's got. Let me see. Go to his closet. Release the anointing and all of his clothes. Make sure all of his shoes gets the anointing. You will probably see a change because that anointing destroys the yoke of darkness. He literally has a yoke on him right now. And when you keep going and you get darker and darker, it's because you know what he's doing. He's feeding his own soul with what he doesn't like. And if he keeps feeding his soul, that's all that's going to be in the layers of his soul. And as a man think it's in his soul or his heart, that's how he's going to be. That's the biggest issue. He's saying all that. It's like people watching the fake news. They would start out great. They wouldn't like it. Then they'd be listening and they'd be like, well, you know that sounds plausible. Well, you know what? I don't like the other side. And now they hate him and they don't even know why they hate what's right because their soul is filled with the lies and deception, the hate that those people who are spewing it out, it's going in whoever's watching it. The anointing can pass into people listening, but the bad stuff can pass into you. Also, if you keep listening, it says to guard your heart. That is your soul. For out of that soul will flow the way you live your life. That's what the issues of life is. Your whole life will change by what you're listening to. And it can even be your own words trashing something all the time, which is what he's doing. So he's speaking against what God has put on the earth and even in you. So you need to come against that stuff. You need to maybe send the host against those spirits of wickedness and lies and deception to pull that stronghold off of him, number one. But make sure you're releasing the anointing. It's the best thing you can use. It's the number one thing we're given. Even at the day we got born again, you got that anointing. That's one of the powerful things he gave you. It's there. He said it's there. It destroys the yoke. So that should destroy the yoke that's now on him. And you say, I'm praying and declaring that that yoke of darkness will be destroyed off of my husband. It can be free to love and free to live and free to hear God. And that's releasing anointing in the food he eats, like in the whole refrigerator and everything. Anointing in his closet, everything he's clothing he wears will have the anointing. You are so getting him consumed with that anointing. And eventually there is going to have, something's going to happen. And you will see it when it happens. That's a good thing. I don't think it was this woman, but there was another woman who said, my husband has finally forbidden me to watch Kat on the air. What am I supposed to do? Any? The same thing I'm telling the other woman to do. Same thing. Same thing. The anointing destroys any yoke of darkness. It doesn't matter what it is. It destroys it. I know we say that the anointing breaks the yoke, but actually the real word, that real word that says breaks, it actually means destroys. So it destroys all those yokes of darkness, whether it's hate, if it's deception, if it's lies, if it's an anger or unbelief, those are yokes. And that anointing was given to us so that it would break it, especially in our own family. It has a great impact on that. And I even tell people, if you're still hugging family members, you can say quietly when you hug them, I release the anointing so they don't hear it said, but say it. But I'm telling you what, if they live in your home, you have every opportunity to lay on their bed, put it on their pillow, put it in their bed, put it in their clothes, put it in the food. There is going to be a major reaction to the anointing that's breaking and beginning to destroy that yoke that's on that person. We have seen it over and over the testimonies we have, and just because I used to train people to do that, it was the first thing he had me teach. Besides the fact, I talked about heaven all the time. Everything he said is you will teach him how to use the anointing. It is a weapon, and they get it the day they're born again. So when we hug our loved ones, anyone that's running from the Lord, I'll use those words with me, hug them. We just say, under our breath, I release the anointing. Yeah. And then make sure if they're going to eat dinner at your house, make sure you release it in the food they're eating, and the plates, you know, go lay your hands on all the plates in your cabinets and the cups and everything. It sounds wild, but it really does work. It works. Amazing. Amazing. I'm excited. All right. All right. This sounds like Malachi, Milachi, whatever. Can you explain what the kingdom of God is? For example, Matthew 633 says, seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. That's her question. The kingdom is the same thing Christ talked about. He talked about a spiritual kingdom. That's he, when he talked about the gospel of the kingdom, that is a spiritual kingdom. That is a real kingdom that operates in the spirit realm. You're not going to walk up to a castle here that says, it's not a flesh and blood thing. It is the spiritual thing. And the kingdom of heaven, of course, is part of that spiritual kingdom. But on the years you operate in it, by doing one of the things I just told you, that is a weapon. Clearly it is a spiritual weapon. And yet it says what it does. It clearly says in the Bible, it destroys the oath. You have that weapon. You can't see it or touch it, but it's in you. And when you begin to release it, it actually impacts that spirit realm. And you're operating in the kingdom. When you do that, because you're using a spiritual weapon it gave you, when you speak truth to people to break off deception to them, you're operating in the kingdom. Every time you pray, you're operating in the kingdom. When you declare you're operating in the kingdom, when you help people, you're operating in that kingdom that Christ talked about, that it was so valuable that you give up whatever you can to get that kingdom. It is a spiritual kingdom. When you get to heaven, you have the full understanding of that. But the weapons he gives us now here, it says our weapons of warfare people. Remember what warfare is? It's when you come against something. You fight against the darkness and the evil. And you think, I can't do anything. I'm just a little human being. Oh yes, you can if you're born again, because you will now, a new creation means you now have supernatural abilities in you. You have supernatural weapons to use in the spirit realm, that you will really mess up the devil's plans. You're going to mess them up. So that kingdom he talks about is, he said, you cannot see it with your human eyes. But it's there because you're here. You have a spirit man. You can operate through your spirit using these weapons. And you can do wonderful, powerful things against the enemy, which is one of our, one of the things that we're called to do as a believer. That's what we're called to do. We rule and reign with Christ when we use those weapons. There are spiritual weapons against the spiritual darkness. Spiritual darkness is always against every evil, wicked, human flesh person. They're wicked because they're listening to the evil spiritual realm, the evil spiritual beings, which you have power over all the power of the enemy. Our enemy is Satan. So any demons disembodied spirits, I can go through this whole long list about that for three years. I did nothing but preach about the darkness out there and how to come against it. I did that for a long time. And so it's in me. I do it automatically. But you as a believer are powerfully and wonderfully made. That's what the scripture says. He didn't leave you without help. Number one, the Holy Spirit is here to help you all the time. Christ will never leave you. When you invited him in, he actually does step in. He's in there. He's there to help you, to help guide you with the Holy Spirit. But he gave you weapons, people. The word of God, not the one with half the verses scripted out. Okay. I'm not talking about the one that wiped out the truth and they want to put their interpretation in there. I'm not talking about that. And let me tell you that's happening a lot everywhere. And make sure you get a Bible that has all the verses in it. Yeah. And not things. Some are removing chapters because they don't like what it says. They want to make everything okay for everybody, no matter how wicked or evil we are. Hey, that's the agenda of the left. Doesn't it sound like that? Totally is. They want everyone to accept evil and wickedness. That's why they're spreading it. That's why they will never make anything good because there's no good in them. They can't even think that way. All they can think is destroy, take, steal, crush. That's what they're all thinking. That's what that whole agenda is for them. And yet Christ came to bring you life and life more abundantly. So we're supposed to have abundant life with Christ. Regardless of what else is going on around us. And maybe if you start using the anointing for what it is, it is a weapon to come against the spirit of the darkness. You will begin to see things shift even for you. So good. He didn't owe us without his blood, the most powerful thing ever in all time. The only thing that wipe away your sins and give you entrance into heaven. Satan hates it. The word of God, the word spoken, the word written is so powerful in the spirit. Satan hates that too. He doesn't like the light of God in you, but he can't stop it from coming. The greater relationship you create with Christ, the more light you have in you. It says one time at one time, even the night will be light round about you. That's you going outside at night and seeing a light coming from yourself. It is going to happen in the manifest of sons and daughters. I won't just read the word. I actually believe it and I live it. I live that word. People who don't understand that have never lived or understood even what it was. Why is it written in there? It's not just a nice story. A bad thing that happened. It is an agenda of God to let you see yourself as a new creation. You get part of his DNA in you. You get a stone of fire that gives light to your spirit man in you. And you get born again. You get a deposit of the anointing. You are so full of God right now as a believer, but you have no understanding. Right. That. Yeah. Let me ask this. Okay. We just read seek first the kingdom of God. And then with that or. Okay. Put that aside for a moment, not aside, but let's change the subject where. God came to you and said in 20, I think it was 2012. You said the kingdom age has begun. What's the difference between seeking first the kingdom of God. And now suddenly living in the kingdom age. There's a very big difference because the word talk is about when things will actually happen. Things that will come that will bring change. It changed a lot. Okay. When John the Baptist started saying, okay, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Yeah. He understood. He probably was one of the few people that actually understood. He knew heaven was about 10 days. He knew the Messiah was coming. He knew that he would die for the sins. He knew these things. And that change started when Christ was born, when he was sent from heaven to earth and planted in the womb of Mary by Holy spirit. That did happen. That happened. Things begin to change when she began to achieve. He was being birthed, not birthed, but he was being, you know, growing inside of her. Angels would come and tell her things. She knew things were going to change. She knew they would be different. When Christ born, things really began to change even rapidly, more rapidly. And at that time, Satan knew somebody had come. That's why he tried to find out from the, you know, from the wise kings. He questioned the wicked king and questioned them. But Christ was hidden and hidden and hidden, even sent to Egypt for a while because he was bringing change to this world by who he was. And then when he began to minister, then openly people began to see how things changed when he was around. And it was so powerful that he gave his life for us. When he gave his life for us, he made a way back to the place we came from. We all came from heaven. We lived in the Father. He is our Father. We are His offspring. The Bible says that the real change to happen once Christ was on this earth, it began to demonstrate and manifest the power of God. He stopped the storms. He walked on water. He increased time or he slowed time down. He created food. He made regular water into heaven's wine. You saw one miracle after another. One miracle after another began to happen. They haven't stopped happening. As the days grow closer, where the kingdom, the kingdom age would be brought to this earth, we would know more and more about it. That's part of my job is to let people know what is this kingdom? What is this kingdom? Why is the kingdom age here? So you can operate in it fully, understanding who you are, what the weapons he gave you, that would bring hope for people's lives, help for people's lives, that they would see people walking the earth that didn't sin on purpose, that could hear the word of God and demonstrate his power throughout the earth. That was the purpose of the kingdom age and it did start in 2012. All the way up to that, being a seer and understanding the prophetic, I felt something stronger and stronger coming and a lot of people announced what came in 2010 or 2010. I think that's the right way to say it. They could feel it coming closer and closer, but until the day came, and we literally in time, in time, if you were a seer, we stepped from a threshold of time into a time we've never had before. And that is when the manifested sons and daughters would be seen in the earth. That's why the earth was interveiled for us to stand up and start demonstrating who he is. The miraculous, like that people would be raised when the dead that were created. I mean, miraculous things will happen in this kingdom age, because God is going to demonstrate that he really exists. He's going to erase the great area that says there is no God. Many things are happening in this kingdom age. And the kingdom will remain up until the time when Christ is seated on the throne in Jerusalem, even after the tribulation, which is a few years, people, a few years, and then Satan will be sitting on the bottom of the pit. Christ will sit on a throne in Jerusalem as king of this world. And some people won't even put that in the Bible. That's what I said. Make sure you're looking at the right Bible. They say that these things have already happened. None of these things have happened except the kingdom ages come. People begin to speak to the weather like Christ did, and it will obey. Things that we say will begin to happen because we serve Christ and we live here for him. If you had been... Well, I was going to say, Kat, if you had been the only person and the first person who ever said that, I thought, well, Kat's going to be off here because that's not like anything I've ever heard. But years before I met you, my spiritual father, Wade Taylor, said in 2012, when it was 2012, he told me the kingdom ages come. He was 88 years old when he passed a couple of years after that. And I thought, what is he talking about? And then I later found out that Arthur Burke had said the same thing. Also, he's gotten to be with the Lord. So when you said it, that's the voice of two or three witnesses have absolutely agreed that 2012 this thing happened. I don't know why he picked out that year. I mean, Obama was in office. I mean, what did he pick that year? But I don't know what you... He loves to pick years when adversity is there. And I'll tell you why. People will actually listen because they need help and hope. Yeah. And he knew all this stuff was going to happen. He knew it, but he has got to fully expose the evil. It's not just about the devil having a heyday taken over. God is letting them on purpose expose how evil and wickedness operates. Well, socialism really does to you, but communism really does so people can see for themselves. It's not good. That doesn't mean he's doing it to hurt anybody. He's not doing that on purpose, but he has to have a time when the evil is exposed. It will be crushed and it will be pushed back because in these glorious years coming on the earth, it will be like a whole new earth, not a whole new earth, but a whole new thing happening on the earth. And favor will be given to believers. And there's people out there that wouldn't even believe me. Well, that doesn't matter. Maybe you'll be in heaven. Don't have to be concerned with it. I didn't mean that. Anyway, you cannot stop the plans of God. They couldn't stop Christ from coming. They couldn't stop the Holy Spirit from coming. They couldn't stop it from raising from the dead people. They could not stop Jesus from going in hell and wasting it. No one can stop what's going to happen this time. God's timeline. He has a timeline and the events. They're not dates. I walked up there. I didn't see one day to solve events. I saw these events happening on the earth. He didn't let me see to the end. I saw things that weren't happened. Hasn't happened yet. In heaven, you talked about, excuse me, and described that God has an event calendar. Not a date calendar, this event. But on earth, there's actually dates connected to it. We just don't know what those dates are going to be. We never know it. And when we think we've guessed it, we're almost always wrong from what I've seen. Yeah, that's what I don't ever guess. Yeah. Guessing is like wasted energy. So. You have to believe that God, you have to trust him. You have to trust him. You know, trust is very important. If you, if you, you begin to believe something, you go from believing to trusting, you actually put forth actions where you're trusting God for something. So you believe and then you begin to trust him, but there comes a day. And when you step from trust and you step into faith, you are never the same again. Never. And I had believed in God for so many years and trusted him probably for several decades. And then at one point I felt a shift in me and I said, what has happened? And a prophet literally truth called me on the phone who lives in South Carolina and said, the father had me call you to say these words. This day you have stepped into faith. Wow. Can you try to put into words. What that feels like to go from trust into faith? Cause we thought, I always thought trust was one of the ultimate things, but you're describing faith as like the next step up. If you will, what, what, what does that feel like? And if you can even think of an example, so people could go, oh, that's what I'm striving for or contending for or believing for. You want to, you want to step into faith because faith, it makes it feel the most amazing feeling you're everything. I felt such freedom, like freedom came. Freedom because I had been obeying God and I've been obeying him and everything. You asked me, I obeyed it. No matter how silly it was or why would you ask, I don't even ask him why he does anything. I, that's called trusting. When you get to trust and God says, do this and you know it's him and you do it and how amazing your life will be for that moment. But when you step into faith, everything he says after that, you were already living it on the inside. It's like there's not even one ounce of doubt. It leaves you, doubt leaves you. Doubt can't even get in you. None of the stuff that left the saying, it can't penetrate me because I'm a living in faith. I've stepped into faith. So no matter what anyone says to try to stop me from saying anything, it's not going to work. When you get to the place where you're there and God says you're there, then no matter what he says, you know that you know that you know it's happening. It is happening because you have stepped from trusting. You stepped into faith. It's an actual place that you step into. And from that moment, your faith gets so huge. It's like it's unstoppable. Not that I must have a month, but whatever God says to me or shows me, I know that I know that I know this is happening. So when you know that, you know that, you know, is living in me, it's not somewhere up here. I'm trying to find it as an example. When you know that, you know that, you know that, you know, Trump is coming back. There's no, you've moved beyond trust to faith. It's so real that no one could talk you out of it. No, they can't talk me out of it because I know it's going to happen. It is absolutely going to happen people. It's going to happen. And the great thing is you, you're standing in that faith. You know it's going to happen. Nobody can try to take it is something they can't take away from you. It isn't just something you hurt when you're in faith. You already know it's going to happen. You know it, but I'm not out there blasting people wrongfully using people. I'm not using, you know, nasty words or hurt people. I'm just not doing it. I'm going to stay right where God has me. So my words have power. They have power for hope, for blessing, for greatness. They have power in them. Part of that power is the faith that I'm in now. But anyone who is a believer can go after that. This is nothing I'm doing as hell from you. It depends on what you want. What do you want from him? Do you want to know him more? You want more of him? You want more of his presence? More of his words? You have to pursue them. Yeah. Do you want to get blessed? Well, then bless other people because you probably won't get anything without blessing. Blessing is like a seed where there's money, where there's actual health. Do you help people with things or help give revelation to them? Or maybe you're just helping them do something they really need to do. That always does something to the heart of God. So if you want to be blessed, you will have to bless first because then you're trusting God. You're not doing it to get something. Right. You truly want to bless. Yeah. I love to bless people. I love to help people. It's like, it's a part of me now. And when that faith becomes a part of you and he says it, and I know people who have already gotten there, they know that he's saying what he's saying is going to happen. That's why Hank won't change what he's saying. He knows, he knows, he knows he's already in faith for that. God said it. He showed us that he knows it's going to happen. Yeah, when you go, when you went from trust to faith, now that you're in faith, it sounds very, very powerful. Will that faith grow? Will it get more? Or is it? It does. It does. It grows and grows and like the kingdom always, always, always grows. Right. It'll never stop growing. It increases. You're going to increase in every way because it says he desires above all things. Right. That you be in health. By the way, that's living in health. Right. He wants you to prosper. Number one, above all things, he wants you to prosper. Prosper doesn't just mean money. It means the way you're living, the things you're saying, the impact you're having on people, that that's prospering in all your ways. You're prospering. That means with your relationships, with what you're doing, if you own a business, what you're doing in the church or what you're doing to help other people, there's always going to be increased. That's prospering. That's an action of life itself. That's not just here's some money. He wants you to be in that place. And then even as you will prosper, even as your soul prospers, right? Right. He also wants you to prosper and live in health. BE means a way of life. Christ became poor that we might be rich. That's his plan. Poverty is not the father's plan. Okay. So it says even as your soul prospers, you will then live in health and you will prosper. Your soul has to prosper. So if you're feeling your soul with bad news or bad words that you're speaking, or you don't even like yourself, your soul can't prosper. We can't do those other two things. Your soul has to prosper in order for you to prosper and live in health. It has to prosper. It prospers by reading the word, speaking the word, saying God's promises, saying what God is wanting to do right now, not the left, not what your friend is saying, if it's not aligning with God, the more your soul prospers, the more life it puts out, not just gets in. The more you will prosper in all your ways and you will begin to live in health. That is called divine health. Let's use this as the last question since I've done two shows today. So I'm going to cut it a bit shorter, but I'm in health, but I'm tired. So a person, and I can put myself in this, but I don't really suffer a lot from this, but I suffer some from this, where people will say, well, I don't like myself. I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I, how much I weigh. I don't like the way, you can just list and listen to this, but you just said, if you don't like yourself, I don't consider myself a person that doesn't like myself. But I don't like certain things about myself. Talk to people and myself. How do you move that needle from, I don't really like what I see in the mirror. I don't really like what God did to make me, how he made me, to, to, to liking yourself so that you can prosper. Talk about that. I'll tell you right now, that's why you can't prosper because what is the whole thing goes back to as a man thinker in his heart. When he says that word heart, he's not talking about your human flesh beating heart. He's talking about your soul. Here's your soul. Right? This is your soul. Here's your soul right here. It's like this. There's a beautiful column with etchings and writings on it. That is your will. And on top of that is your spiritual mind, your mind, your will, and your emotions are all the layers of you, that's how you're made, and those emotions, and whatever you put in those layers, words you said about yourself, the more you feel what was the things you don't like, it's not going to change. It can't change because what are you feeding your soul? You're feeding negative things that you don't like about yourself. You don't like how you live. You don't like the way you look. You don't like what's happening to you. That's why that can't be changed. If you don't like who you are, stop saying the things about you you don't like and say, this may not be perfect when I look in the mirror, but God is going to perfect it. And I'm going to love the way I look, however way he wants me to look. I'm going to love what he does with me. I'm going to love what he says to me. My souls begin to prosper this day because I'm no longer beating it up. And I won't listen to people that beat it up because the other reason why you can't prosper is everyone around you saying negative things to you. You were just made that way. That's just the way. That's your destiny. You can't change that. You lose those words out of you. You cannot keep them in your soul. Not even words you said. You cannot keep them in your soul because that's what you will become. You will become what you were saying you think you are. And I have done this with so many people. It's almost not ridiculous, but it happens the same way every time. You have to say, I repeat for saying all those negative words about me. I lose everywhere those words from my soul, from my mind, my will, my emotions. I will not allow them to remain in Jesus' name. And then you say, I choose my will to like myself. I choose with my will to be blessed and to bless God for making me this way. I choose my will to be excited for whatever he has for me. You are then feeding power to your soul to change, causing your own soul. You don't need a whole world out there to do it. You don't even need a profit to do it. You watch over your own soul. You are the keeper and watcher of your own soul. You are. And the way you talk and the way you think, the things you choose to go watch. What are you watching? You watching murders? Are you watching things that are horrible? Are you watching profanity? Are you watching witchcraft? Because guess what? You're feeding your soul. You're feeding your soul profanity, witchcraft, and violence. Do you think that your soul is going to prosper? You need to take a whole, you need to look at a soul checkup, you need a soul checkup people. You need to see, what am I watching on a regular basis? What words are coming out of my mouth, okay? What have I looked at? What have I read? Is it negative? Is it bad? Is it wicked? Get rid of it, people. Because if you want your soul to prosper, and then you will prosper and live in health, you better be. That's what it says to guard it. You're guarding it. You don't let garbage in, and you don't put garbage out. Garbage comes out of your mouth, it goes in your own soul. Every time you blast someone, that goes in your own soul. You can't stop it. It's just the way we remain. Your soul, and what you put in it is what you will become, and no one on this earth is going to change that. You can change who you are. If you don't like the way you look, if you don't like the way of what's happening, if you're upset about everything else, you're feeding your soul those words. If you want that soul to begin to prosper and the light of God to grow in it, and you actually get happy, then start saying positive things. I'm not talking about positive, I'm thinking, you really be positive about things. Maybe you had a friend that you liked, but they always end up by saying something nasty to you. I lost all those words that were spoken against me, that were nasty, that were harmful, that were bashing. I lost everyone, no matter where they came from. If I listened to it or somebody said it, I lost everyone in the mind of your soul, Jesus comes and goes, and it's like they were never there. Yes, they're going to start to feel different. Then you begin to thank God. I thank you, God, for my life. I thank you for letting me be born this time. Thank you for letting me be great for you. Thank you for bringing happiness to me. Show me, Holy Spirit, what to say, and when to say it. I give you permission to remind me to say things that are positive. Then you are on the road for your soul to actually prosper. God can give you more, do more with you, and use you more, because He wants you to go up to a person, they go, oh, this is horrible, what's going on today. Now, these are not my own words. It's bad. Do you think that we're all going to go down a hole somewhere? Do you think I'd walk away in the store if someone said that to me? There is no way that's happening, because I'm not keeping their words in my soul. I say, well, let me explain to you something. There is a God, and He's alive, and I know Him. He's got great plans for this service, and this wicked stuff you see going on is all being exposed. He's going to move His hand, things are going to be going to happen, and you're going to be so happy with your life. So stop saying the words you just said. If I were right in front of Him, I choose to lose all the negative words, I plant positive words. I believe in the life of God, the presence of God. I know He's got great plans for us. I know these are powerful days coming on the earth, and they're watching you in the grocery store. That's good. Man, that felt good. That was so strong. Do you really believe that I said yes, and why don't you? I don't just listen to this negative garbage. It comes from hell, and sometimes I'll go, the words you just spoke, hell told you those words. If you're feeling bad, you don't like yourself, you're believing those words, and if you get stronger, you're actually repeating those words. So stop marketing hell. Why not market heaven? And that is my... Oh, God. Well, you know, this is one of those episodes that people, including myself, need to listen to more than once, two or three times. There's so much meat. You can bring hope in your day-to-day life, no matter where you go or who you see. You can bring hope by saying what is truth, and God does care, and He is doing something. You may not see enough, but you're going to see this happen, and I'll even tell people, you remember this day, when I told you things would be changed and they would be great, and you will be celebrating in the street when God brings in what He's doing this time, because He has judged the evil, and then I'll walk away, say something, people, say something that brings hope in life to people. They hear enough death and garbage everywhere. It's so good, so good, so, so, so, so good. Well, can't talk about revealing heaven.com and your other website before we close. Yeah, I do have two websites. I really didn't name either one of them, but you know, the father tells me what to say, and I always obey. He named my book, Revealing Heaven, so we made our first website, revealingheaven.com, and we have a lot of products there. We actually got some new things in already that will be taken with us to Nebraska. I'm excited about it. We have some new things that represent heaven, and that's another part of my job to reveal and create heaven on this earth, so that's what you find, revealingheaven.com, and catcur.com. That is a spiritual platform that doesn't listen to any negative or evil or wickedness. It gives you all kinds of revelation in there. We have videos you can watch. You can see interviews done by people who ask me certain questions that are really great. We have a gallery of things what they look like in the spirit realm, like I think you can see what an aquamanchen looks like that I saw in heaven. You can see how even in the transportation looks like in the spirit realm. You ride on beams of light, travel on paths of light. That's what Christ did when he stepped into the spirit realm and walked through the bodies of the people. When they were going to throw him off that cliff, he said he passed through the people. He didn't say he passed around. He took one little sidestep into the spirit realm, spirit realm supersedes this physical realm, and he passed right through the people and they never saw him. You see kinds of things like that in there. There's also all kinds of decorations and things that can train you to let you know things in a greater way. There's testimonies on catcur.com, and it's the only way to give to me online. No other person's Facebook or whatever is out there. I don't ask people to give me money in any of the videos, not on YouTube or Facebook. I'm not going to do that, but people will take my stuff. They say, well, you need to give money to this missionary camp. That's not going to be great to the pocketbook people. Other people asking me to get your money, and I'm not doing it. You have to ask to go to catcur.com, click on the treasury if you want to be a part of helping to support Heaven's plan to bring Heaven to Earth. So good. Cat, we love you. Love you. Love you. Thank you so much. Would you go ahead and pray for the people as we close out? I know you've got great declarations, so go for it. Yeah, Father, I thank you for this day, this glorious, beautiful day that you have made. A day for things to be great for us on the earth. A day for us to know you more, to hear you clear, Father. This is a wonderful day, and you have purposed this day. Satan doesn't own this day. His people don't own this day, even the person sitting in the highest seat of the land. That's stolen. But Father, we know what's going to happen to those people, and I thank you for your plan for all of that to happen. But right now, Father, I just impart the life of God, the presence of God, His will, His way. I evict all evil, every evil spirit. Get out of everyone listening to this broadcast right now in Jesus' name. I thank you for showing us how to rule and reign with Christ's Son, who actually the entire earth belongs to. If I serve, I will not serve another. There's nothing darkness in me. There's no evil in me. There's light, there's love, there's the power of the living God. Thank you, Father, for showing them and giving them a taste of you so they will run after you. Your Son died on that cross because you asked Him to pay a price, and He did. Our lives for all eternity will be great. They will be excited. There will be so many amazing things to do with you, and I'm looking forward to eternity. Right now, I'm on this earth, and I'm not going anywhere until you say I go. Father, I hope they know you that well, and can think of you that powerfully, that they know who they are in Christ. Christ in you is the hope of glory, and God is powerful. He's represented with the light of God, and the power of God, and it will cover this earth like the waters cover the sea one day. I hope you're carrying it. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much, Cat. You are a dear friend, and you and I just become better friends all the time.

happy Wednesday everyone August 31 2022 our apologies were much later than normal but we will recover it'll be so good it'll be worth worth the way pardon I still have a cough I got one cough drop left right here well we may do that I don't know how this cough comes and goes but it does but anyway I wanted to say to the group to the to our viewers as you many of you know we're off of YouTube right now we got notified either this morning or last night whenever whatever that happened so they decided one of our guests said something and that's strike two and and the notice I looked at today said one more strike and you're removed from the channel so we're trying not to do that but anyway we're not on YouTube today and I think I heard that it will be two weeks someone can mention that in my chat if it if it's two weeks but anyway we're off right now we're going to and yes it's two weeks at least it says so we will be emailing you daily to let you know that we're reminding you that we're not on YouTube so please please forward or text or email as many of your friends as you can and say they're here but they're on rumble only because of all of this junk that's going on you say it in those words or any other words but we are continuing to be flexible and flow with what happens so that if this goes down we have that right now we are on rumble we are on Facebook and we're on Elijah list calm so we try to be careful we're talking code today we don't have to be careful at all because we're not on YouTube so they're gonna probably in my personal opinion people will never forget all the times they were kicked off I doubt that YouTube will last but I'm not saying that as a prophetic voice but you know we're all looking for alternatives you know maybe when this gets over and they got new leadership maybe it won't matter anymore so all right let's show I want to to keep before you new ads that we're developing that shows the the wells the freshwater wells we're digging in Uganda we're over 50 freshwater wells we're digging a new freshwater well every five days there's been 300 salvations at last report which means there's more now and there've been eight church plants so this is because of your generous generous generous donations and as I've said before a significant portion of what you donate to this ministry not only keeps us going but we feel called by the Lord to to tide if you will that money into many freshwater wells it's a lot more than a tithe but God has blessed us for doing that so we've got a quick promo on that so without further delay let's go ahead and play that Emily you Thank you again so much for your donations to support this, these wells. The Lord thanks you. I can say by the Spirit, the Lord is thanking you. Great rewards, he says in the scriptures, even if you give so much as a simple cup of cold water to one of these, you will surely not lose your reward. So that's what the Lord said, not us. So thank you for doing that. I truly believe that the Lord has shown me that when you get to heaven one day, when it's your time to go, there will be little children, maybe hundreds of them will come up to you and say, thank you because of you. We had fresh water and because of fresh water, I received the Lord. So thank you. So that's an amazing thing. We really, really, really appreciate your giving. So thank you so much. We are in an intense time. We have about eight weeks, nine weeks maybe for the election. There are, this is not prophetic, but there are some people that say, are we even going to have an election because things are getting intense? I believe, I hope there will be an election if there is and when there is, be sure that you overwhelm the system by voting, but many of you, more of you voting than they expect to vote. You need to overwhelm the system because they can't recover from that. Greg Phillips was, of 2000 mules was on and last week or the week before and said, that's the way to do it. You got to overwhelm the system. So anyway, between now and then make sure the deep state is going to try and prevent this election. We know that that's what they want to do because they know they're going to lose if we get, if the election goes through, be sure your gas is full, keep your tank topped off, keep your groceries of non perishables. Don't just fill up your refrigerator because what if the power goes out? So make sure you have non perishable, we even have powdered milk sitting in there and canned goods and cereal non perishable things that you can open the can and make sure you have a can opener too. Because a lot of people have those electric can openers, which may or may not work if they do something serious. I'm not prophesying that I'm just saying make sure your pantry is as full as you're able to do it and extra for others if you're able to do that. So I just wanted to tell you that we are, these are not going to be a normal eight weeks between now and then the deep state does not like you and me and believers and conservatives. In fact, they, you've heard several of our guests say they basically want something like nine out of 10 or they want to bring the population down to 500 million, which is, which is the population is what that's what the population. I looked up what was the population at the time of Christ coincidentally it was 500 million. That's what they want to bring 7.5 billion down to is 500 million, which is, which means that it's their desire and we've said this on the air. This is not some shocking new thing. It's their desire to depopulate the earth now they're not going to succeed. We're going to bring Patricia Katker sorry on in just a moment and she has seen into the future. They are not going to succeed at that. And so we want you to know that, but we do know that they're going to want to try. So make sure your gas is full and you're in your pantries just full as you're able to do it. You have extra water, anything that you think you might need. If you can't go to the store for two weeks or three weeks, have it have a good supply there. All right. I think that's all for today. Thank you again for your support and let's bring in Katker. So it's Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. Well good morning Kat or I guess you should say it for you. It's good afternoon in it back into Florida, right? Yes I am in Florida and I guess it's afternoon. One said that your clock was off today or something. It was all three of the clocks and it's not my job to replace batteries. Okay. I do sweep and clean the floors and clean up stuff and I mean, I do do that kind of thing a lot, but I don't put batteries in the clock. So none of them were right and they were one was an hour and a half off home was an hour off and one was like two hours late. And so none of them helped me and I have something to say and so yeah, go for it. Go for it Kat. The father wants you to know that you should fear never, not ever, never in this day. He didn't give anyone a spirit of fear in case you wonder if you have fear that's not from him. So there's number one point number one if you're in fear, I'm not saying maybe you're a little concerned about things, I'm thinking if you're in real fear, that is not God. God's not putting fear in you. He's not going to say fearful things to you. He made you powerful. Right. He gave us a spirit of a sound mind. Remember that right power, love and a second gave it to us. That's what he put in you when he made you. So therefore he told me to take authority over. So right now father take authority over all fear, no matter who's experiencing it, no matter where it is in this world. I cancel you, I evict you from everybody's home, from their soul in Jesus name and I impart the life of God, the love of God, the power of God, the will, his way in Jesus name, celebration, expectation of what you're going to do father, not what the devil has planned, who's the Lord of the Flies by the way, just remember that Jesus Lord of hosts, Saint Lord of Flies says about all the wills that he has, so we thank you this day father that fear is evicted, joy and celebration, which is what you talk about, it's okay to be practical, but don't ever let fear interfere in your life in Jesus name, amen, amen, amen, and don't take all the toilet paper, don't take all the toilet paper, I've been, I've been collecting it. We've been collecting it for a few months on, I mean, we have that much, but you know, we collect it while they had plenty, because I don't want to run on the TP. Yeah, it was a good plan, collect it while there's plenty. Isn't it amazing, what did we do in this world on the earth before we had toilet paper? You know, it wasn't that many years ago they invented that, they actually invented toilet paper. I don't want to think about it. Paul Harvey had a story where there was this train full of certain, it wasn't cut up, it was rolls or something, and it didn't make its destination, something went wrong, or the guy went bankrupt or something, and someone had the idea to cut these up into smaller rolls or something like that, and it became toilet paper, he said, let's make it toilet, yeah, it was something like that. I've tried to find that article or that audio by Paul Harvey, because you know, no one told the story like Paul Harvey, you know, and he goes, and now you know the rest of the story, you know, yes, and putting it into everybody will know the rest of the story. Yeah. Yeah. Now you don't see Kat, we know that the deep state hates us. We know that they don't, that they would like to depopulate, but what has God showed you is going to actually happen? There will be no gross massacres, there will be no mass killings or dying, nodded on this time. God sent, if you think about from the Father's point of view, he sent people to the earth that he needs here right now, he needs this many people, all the ones who are here now, he sent here specifically, he timed your birth on the earth, he needs you, and in these days coming months and years coming, there will be so much activity for the body of Christ to do, even good moral people to do, new inventions, he's still sending them people, so if it wouldn't be half wiped out, that wouldn't be possible, which is why, by the way, I want to say something, it isn't that they hate us people, it's that they're very afraid of us. Oh, wow. Quite a small correction in there, the Father says, Satan doesn't hate you, he is afraid of you. Wow. Wow. Satan is the doormat, we are not a doormat, we were given power and authority, he was not given power and authority. We have legions of angels, more of the hosts ever than there is a demonic, they fire out number them, they're bigger than them, and they're ready to do things in this time on our behalf, so more than ever before the activity, what you will see is activity of the host of heaven in this world, individually doing things for people, even in groups of people, you'll see a risk is being done that would not have happened in any other way, God is about to show off his power, Satan will not get his chance, now you need to understand God has a timeline, I've seen the timeline, we're not near the end, we're near the end of the way we will be operating because we'll be in authority, in power, we'll have the great positions, we'll have the inventions, that's what is planned for our lives by the one who made you, not the one who would like to wipe you out, the reason why he wants to kill, steal all of your stories, he's afraid, he knows this is not his time people, he knows he's trying to make a rush to take it early, and guess what, do you think the God of all creation is going to let the Lord of the Flies take over right now? I think he's about to get a lot of insect bites himself, let me tell you right now, what is going to happen is God's plan, not even man's plan, not wicked man's plan, not hell's plan, okay, I don't care what their plan is, it always fails, so don't let fear be the one thing that controls you, because Satan's really good at that, he knows how to use fear, if he can get you to think about all the negative all the time, then you probably will dwell on that, you're not supposed to, he's supposed to walk in power and authority, he's supposed to rule with Jesus Christ, I haven't seen that openly happening in many places, but it's going to be, to the point the Father said, that the world will want you as a friend or to know you because you're a believer, that is how different it's going to be if you want to see your future, that's your future, not running around afraid you'll starve to death, Satan's wicked armies will come to get you and drag you away, that is not, this is not the end, this is not the time of the perilous times, this is not the tribulation people, it's hundreds of years away, and I don't mind saying that because guess what, I'll still be here saying that and you'll be enjoying heaven, so you need to understand, you say God's will, God's way, God's will not mine, but his, because when you live his will his way, you'll have celebration, anticipation, expectation of greatness in you, you were sent here to be great, not to watch the parade go by, we're supposed to be leaders, we're supposed to be the ones people look up to for answers from heaven, and man's mindset and man's head knowledge cannot come up or equal revelation from the one who made us, he knows every thought of everybody, he knows where every wicked person is, every evil camp, every hidden thing, there's nothing hidden from him, but he's going to expose all of it, and then justice is coming, he is not changing what he's saying, if you're tired of listening, don't listen, go sit with the Lord of the Flies and get a big fly swatter. Cap, do you still believe that while the deep state, especially these last few weeks before the election, I'm probably going to try a lot of things, do you still believe we need to get our popcorn out and our cake out and enjoy the show, is this a time to enjoy the show? You know I'm still enjoying the show, I will live the way the Father talks to me about, you have a choice, I'm not going to make you take what he says, but it's so easy and simple to take what you see with your human eyes, when you don't have just human eyes and you see the spirit realm, you understand, they are scrambling, to hang on to anything they can hang on to, and that would be the spiritual wickedness and the physical wickedness. They know, some of them already know, this whole thing is going to fail, they know it's going to fail. They're not saying that to their own groups, but they're very afraid, because it hasn't turned out the way they planned, because this is, this earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof, it's His. He gets to say what happens, we need to agree with Him. I'm not ignoring evil, I just don't participate in it, and when you continually repeat all of the stuff going on, I'm saying all day long, someone says what do you think about what's going on, you should say I think God has a plan, I think He's in charge and I'm on His side, because when you keep repeating what the devil wants you to repeat, you're marketing health plans, make you afraid, make you weak, strip the hope away from you, the joy away from you, you don't want to lose your joy, that's why the celebrate thing comes in. I can tell you I'm sure that Noah, it's a good thing none of you are Noah, you wouldn't have never lasted 120 years and this thing won't take 120 years, but who won in the end? I can tell you this, the Father has a plan for you, not just your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great great great grandchildren, He has a plan for you if you're alive and breathing, He has a plan for you, and that is to market what heaven is, be a testimony of what heaven is, demonstrate the power of the living God in this earth, not waiting for months to go by, you have authority right now, open your front door, kick out the devil, kick out every word, sound, image, thought, frequency of hell, if you've been watching the fake news, there's no wonder you're having issues, why not make news for God and say what He's doing in this world, setting it up for the greatest days this world will ever see until Christ sits on the throne and Jerusalem and yes, He is going to do that one day. There are people whose families and friends, close family and friends are really on their case, I have a few of those myself. Mine gave up. They gave up. Okay, I was going to ask you about that, so how do I ask this question? Is God going to in a sense vindicate, you know, vengeance is mine and all that, we don't want vengeance on our loved ones and family, but justice comes and redemption comes, is God going to redeem, vindicate whatever word we might choose, those who have held strong towards. I will say what is word, it's in power. Okay. He's going to empower those with authority and dominion who have stood and not stepped back. They will be some of the greatest leaders in this world, people will look up to them because they'll know all the time, don't stop saying what God has said, you don't stop saying it, because He is looking to see who's saying and what they're saying. Okay, He doesn't have to convince me to do it. I've seen Him in person and heard Him in person and I've seen the future. I know what the future is going to be, regardless of what the devil's trying to do, he's trying to do his great big takeover right now. He already knows it's going to fail, but he's going to take as many as he can get and he does that by crushing your dreams, by stealing your destiny. Your destiny is still waiting for you. You have to say yes to that, no to the devil, open your front door and he did anything of hell out or wicked man evicted out of your home, make a habitation for heaven and heaven in the presence of God will flood your home all the time. You have a choice, you have a choice, you can follow the Lord of Hosts or Lord of the Flies. By the way, you really mean that, of course the devil can be evicted through your walls, but you really mean open your door and let him out. If you mean that. That way if people come in and told you all the bad stuff going on or they have predicted, I won't even call it, I won't even say that they prophesied it. A true prophecy comes from God, not man's mind, by the way. It's words God spoke. He spoke them. He spoke them to somebody and said, you say this, you will say this. He's not going to tell somebody to say something that's against what he's been saying. Something that's fear getting in, they let control get in, like you said, have talked about Steve, people trying to pressure you. No one does that to me now because they know what they're going to get. Hands laid out on them. That's what they're going to get. Maybe not in the way they want to. But I will tell you this, I'm not backing up. I'm not backing up one single word that the Father has told me to say. One single thing I have been shown, guess what's going to happen? What God wants. What His plan is and what people don't see because they don't really know Him like they should know Him. They can know Him. Let's change it. They can know Him. The more you know Him, you understand how He works. He is mysterious. He's never going to do it man's way. He doesn't necessarily have to make you understand. He just says, this is going to happen and then He does it. That's good. That's good. The gospel of the Prophet is different than just the prophetic. I love the prophetic that people can see and hear and say things. It's an office, it's a place you sit in and you have authority in. So I cannot say what man is saying. I cannot agree with what they're saying. I'm not going to agree if it's against what God has said because in the end, Steve, who do you think will be celebrating the most? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I think you know John- Well, I guess what everyone else will be celebrating right along with them and they will enjoy the victory that's about to happen for us. I have no problem keeping some extra graham crackers in your closet if you want it. That's perfectly fine to do that and this day and age, it might not be a bad idea to have a few extra things around, but I do know God's not going to let anybody starve or die from starvation. He's not going to allow that. Okay. Johnny Enlo says a thing. He said it many, many times, so it's not one off thing, but he said it for a couple years now. He said, God had told him we are about to be safe from things we don't even know we need to be saved from. Is that a perspective you have? In other words, there's things that if we knew how horrific it was that God was about to save us from, maybe we'd even look at things differently. What are your thoughts about that? I know some of those things. Okay. Things it's hard to even say. But the key word is this, saved from them. Yeah, exactly. So God's plan is not to wipe us all out when he has built generations on purpose, generations like I'm seventh generation of really God doing things the way he wants to. He's been building generations with people who believe and will believe what he says. He's been building them. He's not going to, why wouldn't he let them be wiped out Steve, that doesn't even, that doesn't make sense. Okay. Right. Exactly. He's not going to do it. He's not going to get wiped out, this will not be a communist country, no matter what they say. They don't rule this country. No one sitting in the left or the hidden or the evil or the wicked or the White House or the Pentagon, anywhere else, they don't rule this country. We the people are in charge of this country and we will have what we say will happen. We will have it. I'm not talking about the darkness. What we say, justice, liberty and freedom, that is who we are, right in this moment that you're breathing, you're still free. God's not going to let that all be taken away from us, no matter how many lies they put out, no matter how many pictures they show people and they've not created one good thing. Don't expect them to do it. Don't expect them not to try to steal, cheat and lie again, but it won't help them at all because God is going to do what he's going to do and they will be brought to justice. I will not stop saying that. I will not stop saying that because that is what is going to happen. I trust him. If you know how important it was to trust God, when you begin to trust him, you begin to actually believe him. When you begin to believe him this season, you will step into a level of faith you never thought you could have. Wow. And after that, you are given a spirit of faith, a high level of faith and no one will be able to convince you that what God has said won't happen. They won't be able to. There's no way they can because you're living and walking in the spirit and not in your flesh head thinking and assuming and expecting what man has said will happen. They're wrong. If someone is afraid and they're struggling and they're having a hard time believing that and you said, if you will believe God, does that, in order to get there, does someone say, I don't feel it. It's hard to see it, but as an act of my will, I choose to believe. Is that how they do that? Absolutely. Because you know what you put in your soul is what you are. As a man thinking in his heart, your soul is at the heart or core of your being. It is a position. When he talks about the heart, he's not talking about this human beating heart, which side is that? I don't know. Whatever side is tongue beating. He isn't talking about your flesh heart when he says, as a man think it in his heart. He's talking about a position, very core heart of your being is your soul. Your soul is in the center of your being. Your mind, your will and your emotions, you know, that's what the devil is going after. Because even if he doesn't really have to do anything except control that, control what you believe, control what you say, control what you watch, control where you go. That's what he wants to do. We let him do it. Well, I stopped doing that a long time ago. Okay. I'm letting the spirit of God share with me and show me and encourage me. It says encourage one another. So if you keep sharing what the left is doing or planning or their absolute stupidity of who they think they are, they can't run at McDonald's, let alone this country. They don't know anything. They only know what Satan is putting in their soul, what wicked, evil people above them who are there controlling and some of them are about to die. So just get ready for that. Yeah. Wait a minute. Some are about to die. Yeah. Okay. So you did repeat it. So who are the some that are about to die? Just to be clear. Because you said it. Okay. This is like an Ananias and Sapphira time is what you're saying some is and I think a lot of order crossed over the line of living or dying. It's too late for them. What about what, because we, you know, when we think of Ananias and Sapphira, because I'm the one that use that, we think of people in the body of Christ. Are there people in the body of Christ who are about to leave this earth because they have chosen to not walk with them? I do know some are leaving the earth because their time is over. Okay. So don't confuse that. Yeah. You know, a great leader of God who died, I was not talking about, I said the wicked, evil people. Okay. The wicked evil who are trying to control all this stuff. Some of them. Okay. You may not even know who they are, but you will find out. You may not know who they are. Some of them are about to die. Yeah. I saw on the news. By the way, I could recommend this, there's a site called Citizen Free Press. It's kind of like a new dredge. It's conservative. And on that same day, I think it was yesterday, it could have been the day before, but I think it was yesterday, two different celebrities at the age of 32 suddenly died. Now, someone could say, well, that was the Vax, I don't know, but God is in control of life and death. And it was weird on the exact same day. And we don't know by looking at that, was it the Vax? Did they, uh, did they cross the red line with God? You know, you know, I don't know what to think about that kind of thing. I also don't want people, I don't want like believers and other people thinking maybe they crossed the line. You didn't cross the line people. He's talking about the wicked evil and some of them are hidden with evil who are actually the ones controlling. Cause I can tell you the ones in the White House aren't really running things. Not the real stuff. They're not really running it. They're being told what to say and told what to do by very wicked evil people. Some of those people, and that will affect them because then they won't have them telling them what to do. So you'll see a major thing happening in the White House, uh, probably confusion, probably a lot of confusion, more than normal confusion and other things began to like, it may even be quiet for a while because they, some of them won't know what to do now that the, the ones who thought they were going to take over everything, some of them are going to die. It's just going to happen. Like I said, I won't let them out. I won't allow them to remain on the earth. That is, those are his words. Some will die. I will not allow them to remain on the earth. So those are the ones that I'm talking about. I'm not talking about people in the body of Christ who maybe are messing around or something like that. I'm not talking about them. These are wicked evil people, more wicked than the ones in the White House. Are you in, I wanted to ask you about that. Cause that was interesting what you just said, cause we know that there's people in the basement as it were, or on the, on the earpiece as it were, or in literal, are you saying that the people that are giving the orders to the fake people in the White House, are you saying the people that are carrying out the orders are in a sense less wicked than the people that are giving them orders? I have to say that they are because they are, I know you will think that they, I'm not, I'm not cutting any of them slack and I'm not going to minimize any of the evil wickedness they did, but there are sort of what you were talking about earlier. There are more wicked people who may not even be in this country, but they're about to die. Some are going to die and it won't be expected and it will bring confusion. That's what happens in the enemy's camp when, and guess what? Satan doesn't even care if they die, he probably killed them and then he'll take them to hell and torture them more than anyone else is what he does. So you don't get anything. You gain no prize in hell when you're wicked and evil people, you get no prize, none. There's no prize in hell for anybody. And so if you, if that's who you're planning to be a part of or you are a part of it, you better get out of that really quick because it's telling you justice has already been sent, it's already been sent here. A gavel has already been stopped and no one's going to stop what God is about to do at all. And some of that, starting of it will be some, a couple, I'm not saying a lot, I don't expect 50 people to die, but there will be a couple that will die that will shock people. Wow. And maybe that shock factor that it's like who would have ever thought that might be a clue that that's one of those that were removed. It probably may not be anybody you even have heard about, not generally like living here and doing stuff here because most of those people who are in this country are the ones who are allowing to be used, paid to be used, or do it because they love evil. There's people who are over this, I'm sure Robin knows about that, that are, that are even more wicked and evil than the ones who are in the White House. The ones in the White House don't have a lot of brain. I'm just being honest, okay. And their normal brain thinking of a normal human being who's been through the 12th grade wouldn't be trying to do the stuff that they're doing because you're not going to run anything. You're going to run the end of the ground, which by the way is what they want to happen. They want to run the country into the ground, people. If you voted for them, repent for voting for them, God's going to do anything against you. You thought you were doing the right thing because of the whichever side you thought you were on. I'm on God's side, people. That's the right amount of righteousness, righteousness, justice, liberty, and freedom. That's the side I'm on. And at this moment, it happens to be the right. Yeah. Yeah. It's not that the right is so righteous. It's not that the Republicans are that much more righteous than the Democrats as a whole, but there was a more correct stance against abortion to name the big one, to name the one. Well, I think also a lot of those people did want our country to succeed. Yeah. I mean, they may have attitudes and they may not always be thinking the right thing, but generally most of that side is not going to go ahead and go along with the evil at all. They don't like it. They don't want nothing to do with it. And even major businesses, not talking about, you know, the media and all that, major well-known businesses don't like what's happening because they don't want to lose their business. Right. They don't want to. And even some of those who've remained silent, are you there? The thing you're going to start saying, some who remain silent are about to start speaking up. And are there, have you seen is what got showing you people that were, how do I just ask the question that were, let's say just two years ago, hard core left and they believed everything that was being told to them about the Democratic and the liberal establishment, whatever, who God has been slowly but surely softening. Have you seen some of that? I think it's bringing clarity to their mind about their own life and future is probably what he's been doing. The Holy Spirit can speak to anybody, even if he can speak to people who aren't believers, it doesn't mean he'll live in them, but he certainly can say things to them. Good. And their own angels can say things to them, you know, in their mind, stuff like this, you need to get out of this. This is not going to end well. This is wrong. I think he probably says something. This all is wrong. I'm sure he says that a lot to them, but you're right, Steve. There are people who are secular people and they have decided to change what they're thinking because just themselves looking at their own situation, not really participating in anything, are going to start speaking against what's going on because it's horrible government. It's no government at all. Okay. It's just control. And that's what they want to do is control. They're not even thinking they're happy and they're on the wicked, the wicked in the White House. Let's just say that you're thinking how much money they've gotten, how much control they have, and they're really excited that this whole thing's paying off for them. What they don't know is they're sinking themselves deeper in a pit than they ever knew would happen because those who are controlling don't care about them. And when, if they ever went the way they wanted it to, they would be taken out too. So evil doesn't love anybody. They hate, they kill, steal and destroy. That's what their plan is. That's why that's what looks like it's happening in the White House is because their mind is so seared right now. They can't see what's right, but they themselves can't figure out why isn't this getting better? I mean, literally, as stupid as the things are that they put out there, they can't figure out why, why they're making that happen. They don't think it's them. And it is them because this wasn't happening until that happened. Yeah. Can't live on this. And some people keep saying what God said, he is at his limit, he's at his limit. God does have a limit, people, you remember he did things in the past when he reached, when he was done with the evil and the day thereof, it was dealt with severely. And so I would say, you know, you yourself though, what you can do is give hope to people anywhere in the store, what people talking about, what's going on, it's all going to end wrong. We're all going to hell in a handbasket. It was going to hell in a handbasket, be a big handbasket will be the wicked and evil. Yeah. And I know, I can see it, that there are people that are on that side that will call the wrong side, for lack of a better word, they, they hated Christians, they hated conservative values, they hated anti-abortion, they were pro-choice, and I see some of them watching right now, and they're now waking up, they're going, what have I done? But now look what I've done, how do I get out of this now that I've made my bed, you know, the expression, you've made your bed, now you've got to lie on it. What would you say to some of those people who are waking up and then going, what have I done? What would you say to them? I would say you need to repent to God. Okay. I mean, you repent to Jesus Christ, you know, if you ever belong to Him, the things that are going on now, they are not Him, this is not His plan, He comes to bring a life and life more abundantly, where do you see abundant life? Have you produced abundant life, are they talking about having abundant life? I'm talking about the government, the illegitimate government, okay? No, because they don't care what happens to anybody, they're going to use and control, use and control, until there's no more use and control, and if you have voted for them, or you're still siding with them, or you're helping to promote them, I would really seriously ask you to just repent for all the stuff you've been involved with, to lose all the evil wickedness out of your soul, repent to God, and tell Him you want to be with Him on His side, you want Jesus Christ as your savior, and joy will flood your soul, and guess what, your eyes will be fully open to the darkness trying to take over not just this country, but the whole world, and that won't happen until the perilous times come, and the perilous times, this is not the perilous times, I know people think it is, but it's not. I've seen some of the perilous times, I've seen some of the tribulation, I've seen some of Christ sitting on the throne in Jerusalem, I've seen part of the millennial, whether you like that word or not, the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ, which by the way the Father said, you're not going to stop that from happening either, so stop taking it out of the Bible. Let me, let me, you know, Kat, you know me, I don't ever interrupt in the middle of the show to, to pray, or almost never, because I've got, you know, we're, we're getting through it, but I feel led right now, there's people watching, and they're going, what have I done, I voted the wrong, I'm looking around, it's all falling apart, I voted for this, I wish I knew how to repent, could you pray for those people right now, because there's a bunch of them, and they're going, all I just, just need is someone pray and tell me how to get out of this. Yeah, like I said, the first thing that I would do is lead you in a prayer of repentance, because when you've done wrong, and when you side with absolute evil, and I tell you, even probably 13-year-olds, 10-year-olds know that what's being said is wrong, I mean, children know it's wrong, and when you have the heart of a child, there's no evil in them, there's nothing that, that you know that, that they've had, been taken care of, they've been loved their whole life, but they can look around, they listen to anything on the news, they know that there's a mess going on, and they know that darkness, they know what evil is, my grandkids know what evil is, okay, they're young, but they know what it is, and so if you're finally gonna wake up, because I know God is shaking some people right now to wake you up, okay, he doesn't want you to lose what he's got planned for you, he doesn't want you to miss your destiny, Satan wants to steal and crush your destiny, so right now we say, I say, we would just say this together, Father, I choose with my will, to repent of all evil, to repent of being involved in voting for evil, to repent in being involved in voting for evil, I change my heart this day, I change my heart to say, and choose with my will, and choose with my will, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, I receive his will, I receive his will, his way, his way, I want his plans for this country, I want his plans for this country, and for my life, and for my life, I evict all evil and wickedness, all wicked and evil and deceiving words, they were spoken over the fake news, they were spoken over the fake news, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White House, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White House, I will lose all of them for my soul, I will live according to the Word of God, I invite Christ to abide in me i want to hear his voice i want to hear His voice i want to walk in the Spirit not to walk in the Spirit and not the flesh and not the flesh I choose to bind to my soul I choose to bind to my soul the love of God the presence of God the presence of God the life of God the life of God His will his will, his way, his expectation, his expectation of greatness, of greatness, and righteousness, and righteousness to be in this earth, to be in this earth, in Jesus name, in Jesus name, this day, this day, I step into a new place, I step into a new place, and I step out of the darkness, I step out of the darkness, I now serve the Most High God, I now serve the Most High God, I will not serve another, I will not serve another, amen, amen, very, very powerful, a lot of people got touched, a lot of people, wow, so yeah, hey, you know what, some of you watching, be sure you send this program to friends of yours, because there's some people that they're like right on the edge, and they just, you know, that you've seen them beginning to waffle about what they have believed, send this broadcast to them, forward it to them, or give them the link either way to do that, so that'd be awesome, awesome, well, you know, we have time for a few questions, anything else you want to say before we do that? Well, I do have a question to answer that someone has given me some time ago, I didn't get to answer it, they asked me, what role does Melchizedek play in our lives? Okay. Well, Melchizedek is a real being, he's not a human who died and moved to heaven, and the Bible says Melchizedek has no father, no mother, no beginning or end, which means he has always been with the father, and actually, Melchizedek is the father's personal high priest, Jesus Christ is our personal high priest, but the father is, he has Melchizedek who is sent to the earth on different assignments, at one point he was the king of Salem, he's one who received tithes, you know, when the tithes were being paid for the first time, he was on the earth, he received the tithes, Melchizedek has flesh, he's always had flesh, there's a whole tribe of angels made after the order of Melchizedek, which means they had flesh put on them, probably before we were born, I love the way the father says though, about any of the angelic tribes or the host army, he said, yes, they were made before we came, but we existed before they were made, because we lived in him, and so that's who Melchizedek is, and I know, is that a storm warning, Jen? Okay, I take power over all the part of the enemy trying to control this storm overhead of us right now, and I command the host to have them get up there and shred that storm, I refuse and review all strong winds, there'll be no tornadoes in this area, no flooding in this area, I'm over the weather, now under the weather, and I say, get out of this city in Jesus name, you will bring rain and nourishing rain, no lightning strikes, keep it in the sky, and get out of here in Jesus name, amen. Praise God, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, so again, I don't know if I did, did you have a little, I can't remember if we interrupted your flow with that, did you, did we get it? Melchizedek, yeah, a lot of people, they assumed that he was like one of Adam's sons, or they say that he was someone else who died that lived on the earth, but clearly the word doesn't say that, they can't figure out who he is, there are some of the living creatures have always, always been with the father, he didn't make them one day because he thought about it was a good thing, they've just always been with him, there's no way really to get people to understand the father has always existed, he carries time inside of him, and so that's why he's the only one that knows when Christ will return, nobody knows with the father, because he carries time, he didn't appear somewhere in time, so he's always assisted the living creatures have, the 24 elders have always existed, they're spiritual beings that serve him in heaven and all around heaven, they're not people, they're not the 12 tribes of Israel, they're not the 12 apostles, I've seen Peter Paul, I've seen John in heaven, they're not sitting there with a crown around the throne of God, so those are spiritual beings, of course Melchizedek would also be there, and people just picture nothing ever existed, there was a time when nothing existed, that's not true, before time was, the father was, the word was, which is Jesus Christ, holy spirit has always existed, but along with them would be Melchizedek, the 24 elders, the seven spirits of God, which are also seven personal spirits that serve the father, so that's a little bit of understanding and revelation for you for this question about Melchizedek, so he's always been, he was sent to the earth on assignment, and so anyway, I think that was the most important one, so if you have some questions you can go ahead. Yeah, okay, so yeah, we're going into questions about heaven or important truth, so Daniel is a six-year-old, he wants to know do we pray in heaven, I think he means either if we died and went now, or later on when it all goes, when we're all in heaven, do people pray or do we pray in heaven when we, when we go? I know one place that they, that they do make decorations and pray, it talks about the, this talks about in the Bible the souls under the altar of God, who pray and declare before the throne, and I always pictured like an altar, like you know, if you were to do into a traditional charismatic church or probably even other churches, they always had an altar down front that was maybe six inches off the floor, and people go down there to repent and do other things, they serve communion there, but that's not the way it is in the throne, the throne is a whole structure, you can actually walk underneath the throne of God, and really massive altar, many people go under there and they declare over their families, they also say things to God, not that they can't go up to a stone and say it, but sometimes they just want to do it personally or whatever, so that that's one example that yes, there are people who declare and who do pray in heaven for things going on on the earth, you know, and usually though, it's in the throne room and there's this huge room underneath the throne of God, the throne is high and lifted up, so nobody's mushed down or flattened down, so yeah, there's places in heaven, they'll go to the portal, which has been made, they're all over heaven, people go there to watch their family's lives, they can celebrate with them and different things in their life, they go there every year on your birthday and sing happy birthday to you, they don't miss you getting born again, they don't miss anything important like your weddings, your babies being born, people go to these places and they will declare blessings over you, they'll declare things over your life from heaven, so they don't ever stop thinking about us here on the earth. And when you say they declare that, that's kind of the same thing as prayer, right? It is prayer, except they know what's going to happen. They know it's going to happen. What about that, you know, you talked about under the throne, there is that scripture that says they were under the throne, it almost seems like it uses the word martyr in it, and they say to the Lord, how long till you, and I think they say, Kat, you know this better than 90, how long till you avenge our blood, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, what's the deal with that, since there's no time in heaven, why are they in heaven saying how long till you get this I think you're not talking about like a date or a time, I'm talking, they're talking about like a season. There is going to be a season where a lot of that will happen, things that were done to certain groups of people and stuff like that, there will be a retribution brought for those people, because he wouldn't have made that place for them to go and declare that. So there are several different rooms underneath his throne, it's just, it's huge, I can't even explain or give it a measurement, but there are different people down there or groups of people down there, and there are, there are some of the martyrs, I'm not saying every martyr, there are some of the martyrs who really want for the father to redeem their life on the earth by bringing justice for what happened to them, and I'm sure that he will bring justice whenever he is, whenever he does that, it will happen, and it may be more towards the end than now, but he's not having them down there just saying that for no reason, is it hard to say it, he's going to let them say it, so I'm glad that he's going in the throne and that you see visibly when you go in there, but then there's some underneath the throne of God, where people are declaring, it says if you declare and decree a thing, it shall be established, doesn't it? A decree and a declaration is that you have a face to believe it's going to happen, it's something I will do. I was in Paris years ago and we stood underneath the Eiffel Tower, and the Eiffel Tower goes forever and ever, but you can walk underneath it because there's the post, so is that kind of what you mean? In other words, the Lord is high and lifted up, sort of like you might say the Eiffel Tower is way up there, but you can still stand underneath it and see its legs or its foundations, is it kind of like that when you say it's under the throne? Well, let's just say the throne is 80 feet high, I'm not saying it is, it is very high and lifted up because if there's not just steps, there's like there's steps, then there's columns, then there's a platform, then there's steps, that they can go up to the throne, but these are actually more private places, I don't think people see it underneath the steps and you can actually see the people, there's places where they go just to talk to God and pray and declare things, but there's people sitting on the steps sometimes, usually gifts on the steps, like people will leave flowers, Christ loves flowers, I didn't know that, sometimes you'll see desserts, because Christ loves green that's good, you know that's helpful because you know you think of the throne is high and lifted up and there's you know there's training fields of temple and all these different things, but you're saying, oh there's thunder and lightning in the throne room, trust me, people run to get struck by that lightning, it's like a myth, there's a lot of love, so there is all of that that talks about in the Bible, the living creatures are as high as the throne, I mean they're really really big and they have eyes in the front of their bodies and their heads everywhere, and they're always declaring over the over those, over those Father, Son, Holy Spirit, you know in heaven, obviously you're perfectly healthy, emotionally, spiritually, physically, no pain and all that, and yet, because I've thought about this many many times, if there's something that God gives you to drink from the throne, from the rivers of life, from the throne, the water that comes from under, however that goes, it seems like it would be hard to be edified more because you're perfectly edified, how, what would you describe as, have you been there and felt the feeling as it goes into war, how is it that that feeling is better than when you're already perfect? Well, it depends on, there's so much activity in the throne, depending on when you, when you're there, I mean you could be caught up maybe five times in your lifetime and see the throne will be there, but there's so much other activity, sometimes the river of life flows from him sitting on the throne, it comes all the way down the steps, people actually will lay on the steps and drink that, and then sometimes he'll open throughout the whole throne room and be like it runs through the whole throne room, then out into the city streets, depending on whatever he, whatever his purpose is for that, but I've been there seeing people actually drinking it as it's life, it's just, it's just, it's, it's, I can't explain it, it's like the greatest love you ever felt in your life and you just can't ever get enough of him, that's why Christ said, Christ loved his father so much, he was so happy when he got to leave hell and you know, came up and he was glorified and appeared back before his father, he was so happy when he was joined back to his father, but, but people who go there are undone, there's just so many things going on, but his presence is everywhere, but when you're there with him, is that you either watch a concert or you're in it, it's the same thing in the throne room, it's greater, the greater or the even the experience of it is greater when you're there in person, then just maybe seeing it from where your mansion is or being around heaven, but you're never away from his presence, but when you're there, a lot of people do, I keep watching the angels, I got to stop them. Well, you know, I was going to ask you that, Kat, because I thought you're watching, so I was about to ask you, what are you watching, because I've never seen you look up while you're describing it and you just can't watch it. There's an over top of me right now. Wow, because it was very clear to anyone watching that you were watching something, and so, what else can you say about what you're watching? I'm just watching, I'm watching part of the activity at the throne right now, and people are laying on the steps and the river pours over them, in them, through them, a lot of people just want to drink it, and it just makes you fall in love even more with the Father, and people love to be in the throne, and then the celebration, and you hear the voice of the living creatures in the whole stone room shakes, it shakes, and the seraphim dipping down out of the glory cloud, there actually is a real glory cloud that stays permanently around the throne, a little bit above the throne, and the seraphim live there, they live in that glory cloud, and they've been with him so long that their hair, long hair looks like blue fire, and just watching them dipping down over the throne, declaring over the Father and over the Son, it's amazing, I don't feel sorry for anyone who goes to heaven, I'm rejoicing with them, I'm celebrating with them, and don't ever feel like you've lost your family members if you belong to Christ, you will never lose them, they moved to heaven for a while, and then you will all be back together again one day, and all the things that happened to them in heaven, they'll be sharing them with you, they'll take you places to see in heaven, I just had someone just say to me, I know that my sister's up there, and I know that she's making a list of places to take me, and they had not even been to heaven, I said you're absolutely right, that's exactly what they're doing, they're not up there enjoying their life while everyone's suffering down here either, they know, all of heaven knows what is about to happen down here on this earth, they know the glory is going to engulf this earth, that people will actually carry it and release it everywhere around the world, they know the baptism in fire is going to be happening, they know that this earth for quite a while will be so filled with God, that's why there will be such a mass, the mass harvest at the end will be so huge, because of the glory, the love, the life of God, we will as manifested sons and daughters actually demonstrate the power of the living God to the people of this earth, either by rescuing things or changing things or commanding things that he tells us to say, you'll see it with your eyes, you'll literally see heaven activity with your eyes on this earth, and that's what's being set up, he's going to remove a lot of the evil on purpose, so justice is going to happen, there's no man greater than God, no devil more powerful than God that can stop any of that from happening, so I'm just celebrating my life all the time, I know I have expectancy in my heart, I don't have fear in my heart at all, I know who holds me in his hand, I know what his plans are and you can know too, because these are great days you're ending into, your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great grandchildren know they're probably adding up those years, don't try to, I don't ever try to add up the years, okay, I know God's going to do what's on his timeline, I know the greatness that's being sent to the earth, the babies being born right now are some of the greatest, the greatest prophets on the earth, some of the greatest apostles on the earth, the healings are going to be so miraculous that begin to happen, that's something else that's going to start happening, miraculous healings, regardless of what's going on around, the Bible says God sets a table that's his presence, his power, his joy, and his supply, even in the presence of darkness he's going to do that on purpose, I think that also is about to start happening. I need, I want to ask you, you said something a minute ago, I do not want that to pass because I think people would want to want you to say, this is what I meant by what I just said, you said a minute ago that they aren't, I may not quote this exactly, you said they're not out there enjoying their life while you're suffering on earth, what are you trying to communicate? I shouldn't explain to some people who don't really know God, they don't know Christ, they think he doesn't care, they don't care, and they don't see what's happening, that they want to happen, they want things to happen right now, I understand that's how you feel, but when God has a plan, if he's going to expose evil it's going to be done in this time, this would be the greatest exposure of evil on the years until the perilous times start happening and they're probably close, I can't even say a year, I know I've been taking 150 years in the future and guess what, there have been no perilous times of tribulation at that time. But our loved ones are in heaven enjoying their life, they're enjoying their life, and they're decreeing and everything, even while we are suffering. They're decreeing and declaring for God to intervene on your behalf, that you will not miss your destiny, a lot of them are after saying God, I declare they will not miss your destiny, they'll fulfill what you sent them for, that my heart is for them, that I'm up here declaring over them, I have expectancy for what you're about to do in the earth, this is them speaking to the Father about their loved ones on earth. Okay, good, good, good, I want to make sure we clear that. All right, Audrey asked, has Kat Siener interacted with John the Baptist, what is his appearance now on earth, he wore clothes made of camels here, also any idea what John the Baptist does in heaven? John the Baptist is sharing things that happened when he was on the earth, but with revelation of what happened in the spirit realm, everyone who goes to heaven, you will go and see what was going on around your life that God was doing, the things he was doing behind the scenes, the things that he did that you didn't know about, and even the apostles and the disciples all got to see that about their life, some every now and then would see angels or something like that, but their whole life lived out on this earth, when they tell their stories now, they can include, but God did this, God was doing this, and it just makes it even greater, more personal for them to share, so all those people are sharing the experiences and things that happen on the earth, but with revelation about them, that's what they're doing. And John the Baptist, his, as far as- Not wearing camels here, people. He's not wearing camels, and as far as we know, as far as we're told, his only gift was teaching and declaring, but does he, I mean, would John, even someone like John the Baptist have a hobby, a fun thing that he would do, would even he have a gift that would be different than declaring? I'm sure he probably would, it probably was something to do with the nature, maybe, because, you know, he was kept in the wilderness, isn't always being just desert, I'm sure there was maybe forest or something around him, and he loved that kind of thing, I know he didn't have a lot of time, he actually didn't hear God a lot, he had him on the back side of the desert, he would share with him things that would happen, and I can tell you this, those who told or shared, if they shared a lot in their life on the earth, they're going to share more things that they found out when they got to heaven, like I was just saying, but John is not wearing camel hair, okay, you don't wish he'd taken a bath five times, but when he was down on the earth, he was not the neatest person, I'm sure he was clean in all the other ways, but the camel hair he wore, because he had such revelation given to him, there was ways God would humble prophets, he was a prophet, Jesus called him a prophet, he also is Christ, he says, you know, he's his cousin, they hang out a lot, I see John the Baptist a lot with Christ, they were cousins on the earth, and I think he also liked sweets, I know that sounds wild, but he ate locust and honey, he loved honey, Christ loved honey, he ate it all the time, and it says in the Bible that he did like it, so I just see them a lot together in heaven, because they were related on the earth, and I can tell you this, John is not wearing camel hair, and the camel hair he wore was inside out, if you have never pet a camel, if you go to Israel, if there's a hand over there, ask him, can you touch the camel, and run your hand across that hair, man, I'm telling you, it's like little mini spikes, he wore that against his skin, it was to keep him humble, that's why he did it, it was to remind him who he was, and who God was, and you know, there was things God did to the prophets, so they wouldn't think of themselves above measure, mine is pink hair, I'll just tell you right now, I was not a pink hair person, I forget it's pink, I right now can't see my hair, and that was to separate me and make me, God wants people to notice me, okay, he wanted people to notice John Baptist, when it was his time to speak, he wanted him to look different, be different, and sound different, and I had to experience the same thing, although today it's pink hair instead of camel hair, I'm very grateful. So good, so good, I'm trying to decide which of these, because we're running out of time, so this person's saying, what do the evangelists do in heaven since their duty on earth was so winning, obviously there's no soul winning, do evangelists just have their own individual gifts, is that the point? I think some of them did, and well we know, we know that Paul did, Paul had great gifts, he worked with fabrics, he made beautiful things out of fabrics, it was a gift, and it was how he supported his ministries, how he supported himself, and people came from everywhere to buy those things, I'm sure he made robes, and scarves, and all kinds of things, beautiful things with fabrics, it does mention that in the Bible, and I'm sure when when he gets time, he probably still does, still does that, but I think that was Paul. Yeah, there you go, the best of the best. The Holy Spirit's like, excuse me, but we all know that God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest he had to put hair on, so yeah, I just love Holy Spirit though, he has no problem, you know, correcting me in the middle of everything, Paul worked with fabrics, and he did that, and he was very good at that, Paul, I'll tell you what, I see Paul quite often, he's always in the gardens, outside the throne room, there's beautiful gardens, and people come there to see him, they want to know what did you feel like when this happened, what did you think when this happened, see, is people asking questions more than anything else, and people, and of course they're going to share, so they share, they still share a lot, but they have things they like to do, some of them like to work with, some some of them like to cook or bake, some of them like to make things with their hands, I know that there were other of the disciples like Peter is still fishing, that was his gift, he fished, he fished before he became a disciple, and he fishes now in heaven, people can go fishing with him, my husband said he's going to be his new best friend just in case you wondered, and this has to be catch and release, right, this has to be catch and release because unless you get caught, unless you get, because you said they play tag or something, I don't know how you worded that, yeah, they do, and well you know I already said the creatures all talk to you, and that is no different with the fish you're trying to catch or the bull you're trying to ride in the rodeos, and someone will probably slam me for that, get over it when you get there, you want to ride one, and I'll forgive you for it, but but the creatures all talk, they have a voice, they talk to your pets, they'll talk to you a lot, I love that, it will be nice, and we just sent our mama cat went home to heaven the other day, oh wow, yeah, and this is just not strange, but just like God, my mom has a pet dog out in Arizona where she would visit her mom to her mom went home to heaven, her brother went home to heaven, but she has a pet dog out there, the same day that the mama cat went to heaven, her dog in Arizona went to heaven, oh my goodness, yeah that's not a coincidence is it, it's not a coincidence, it's not, it's not, and for anyone that's new, of course I think our poor family, we had lots and lots and lots of pets, a horse, two miniature donkeys, four dogs at one point, but a zillion's a cat, so those animals will be dispersed among family members I'm thinking, but every single pet is in heaven, and we all, there are pets right, yes, you have a big enough place for them to be in though, it's good that we're going to need acreage for that, so you'll need, you do get acreage, trust me you can have acreage, but by this time they've already made, by this time Steve they've already made friends, so they'll probably bring their friends over too, oh that'd be good, grandkids and pets, people go, you know what, they think of just nuts the way I top it, you know what, God is holy and powerful and so captivating, to be in front of the power that he carries and see him demonstrate it, but the love he has, he is love, I know Christ is love, I know that, but so is the father, you have to see that he is number one, a father with lots of children, when you come home to heaven, you come home, let's say you're married, you don't go home as husband and wife, you go home as god's son and god's daughter, you get your own mansion, it can be right next to each other, there's no problem with visiting or anything, but he, he is a father, is going to provide a place for you, and he made fun places on purpose because if you picture yourself as a dad, and let's say you have four kids, if you didn't have some way for them to have fun, you would really be. Now cat just froze on my screen folks, is it frozen on anyone else's screen? I'm listening to my staff, it's frozen on my screen, yes it's frozen, do you want to try and boot her out and have her come back? Well that was a new, we don't, that doesn't usually happen with cat, so could be the storm there, yeah they could be having a storm, so we'll see if we get her back, it's kind of at the end, if you guys are willing, want to just dismiss her, that's okay too because we're kind of at the time, if you say go ahead and, and Steve will say goodbye, just kind of let me know what to do, if anyone wants to tell me what to do. Texting chins, yeah you know I was talked about my own, my daughter had a cat, Ebony, he's a black cat, he was a black cat and he got sicker and sicker, and I was dying at the time, I was under 100 pounds, some of you have heard me tell that story, it was very near death and she was dying, and I didn't, it's not that I sat there thinking I'm dying, I knew I was very very sick and they hadn't figured out what's wrong with me, now, it'd be nice to have closer to that, under 100 pounds, but I, I remember talking to Ebony and I'd say someday, because I knew she was not going to be here really, so I was laying on the couch, sick sick, everyone's gone, Ebony's on the chair and I said someday in heaven, you and I, we're going to talk, oh their internet went out, he says they will try one more time, but I said someday you and I are going to have a conversation about all of all this, and I felt like honestly that I was communicating with Ebony a boy cat, he was a beautiful cat, but you know, because as he got sick and sicker, he couldn't clean himself, so he then became a beautiful dirty cat, but you know, it'll be fun to see what happened to Ebony and try and talk with him and say, do you remember that? That's what I think I see myself saying is to the pets, I'll say, do you remember when, if God gives me that memory, so, but we had so many cats, we were cat people and so now we've had a lot of dogs, so, well, you know what guys, it's 10 44, it went long and if they're still trying, I think probably this is a good time to dismiss it, it was a great, great show, we got good, good answers, so I'm going to go ahead and say to the people, thank you so much for the show, tomorrow we have Patel Patriot, who talked a lot about devolution, not evolution, but devolution, which has to do with the president redistributing authority to those people beneath him, so that the continuity of government can continue, he will talk about devolution and anything else God's put on his heart, he was great, this will be our second time, he's very, very popular on the internet, especially among patriots, so we remember that, so Patel Patriot will be tomorrow, it will be very, very, very good, so be sure and tell your friends, we will be, until further notice, we'll be on rumble only and when I say rumble only, I mean rumble and Facebook and theeligialist.com, just not YouTube, so with that, have a great day everyone, God bless you and we will see you again tomorrow, same time, bye bye. you

Well, happy Wednesday, September 7. We're recording this on Tuesday, September 6. So not to confuse you with the date is off behind us. I'm just changing a couple of things so this doesn't blink on us. Anyway, welcome to the broadcast. This is our second show today because we're recording this on Tuesday for Wednesday. So it's gonna be a great show with Kat. We just had a good one with Johnny, which you will have seen by the time you see this. But anyway, I just had a really neat time talking with Kat's mom. We need to have her. I can't remember her first name, but we're gonna have her on with Kat one of these times and get some of that wisdom from her. But anyway, without further delay, let's go ahead and watch Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. There she is. There's our lady. Your mom said the pink lady has arrived. So I just had a really nice chat with your mom sitting in your chair. So that was a delight. I haven't seen her since the cruise. We were on, I think so. Well, it's been a while. Yeah, it's been a while. So tell us about the clothes you're wearing. Cause you said there's something special about what you're wearing. Well, this shirt right here, we have our own women. We have a women's group and a men's group. The women's group is called Wonder Women, Doing Signs and Wonders. Awesome. And this is actually, this is the logo we made for it. It looks crooked on the camera, I don't know why, but it's not crooked. Anyway, it's a W and it's got purple and silver in it. But that's what it says. It says right here, Wonder Women, Doing Signs and Wonders. And there's some of the most powerful meetings we have. We probably have close to 800 women, maybe a thousand women come from all over the world. I think 30 countries came the last time. And I'm telling you what, they had no problem ruling, sending the host or anything. It's a really powerful event when we have it. The men is called the Dread Champions because hell will dread them. I love that. Hey, can women order that shirt? Is that for sale on your site? I would say it will be very soon. I'm just kind of showing you, this is the one that we had the last time that we, you know, we didn't have a Wonder Women meeting. It's been two years, but we're going to have a Heaven's invitation, which is our premier annual event we have. And we are going to have Wonder Women, a separate meeting. I don't have dates for those yet, but we'll get them as soon as we can. But yes, this is the symbol. We have a different color, some of the different colors and everything in it. But the women have a powerful time when they do come. And then the men, we actually bring a prophet over from England, who speaks with my husband. And they said, I still speak. I still speak, people still want me to speak. So I still speak to all the men, but my husband and Nick, they have powerful, I forgot what they call it. Respiratory or what? Workshops. Okay. Two, two-hour workshops during that event. And then my son-in-law opens for me, that would be Ben, the megamarked canvas that God calls a couple very fierce against the darkness. He opens my meeting every time I speak at the men's meeting, but then I finish it off. So you're going to get a lot, man, when we, you should be getting an email soon, because we're finally, now that we're moving though, we'll probably wait until the office moves to do that. So we're really going to get all of our emails started. We've already designed one for Wonder Women, one for Dread Champions, one for the host. We're going to have the Guardian Zone, and we're going to have a spirit force. I think spirit force, we may already have that one. So we are going to really go into high gear. Once we get into our offices, probably this year, or maybe the first part of next year, everyone else would say this year, please. Yeah. Wonder Women logo. And usually what we do, because when the daughters of God meet, he wants them to enjoy themselves too. We have powerful, a powerful event. We have activation, we have training, but we also do something fun. We actually, we actually get one of these, a lot, like a human size, big camera things, and we go, I'll take pictures together. And I know that may not mean much to some of you, but it's really a memory of the power of God and the life of God that you experienced at our meetings. And so we do that, and everybody has one to take home with them. It's really an awesome time. We have a luncheon too, so I can't wait to have that again. But right now, I'm heading to Colorado. You know, tomorrow, I'll be in Colorado. And then after that, I'll be, of course, in Nebraska. Are those venues full, or can people still come to the one in Colorado? I think the one in Colorado is totally full, except Saturday and Sunday. It's a women's event. It's their women's meeting. It's activation, not activation. Jen, what is the name of the event? Gateway on Mount Zion. What, again? Gateway. Gateway on Mount Zion. I'm so focused on even going. Gateway on Mount Zion is in Golden, Colorado, mile high in the sky. The women's thing is full. That's at Copper Mountain. But Saturday night, this Saturday night, and this Sunday, this Sunday morning, they're having, I will be speaking, both meetings in Colorado at that place in Golden, Colorado. There's a sanctuary where they got burnt. Oh, my goodness. But they have a huge tent outside. So it'll be outside. It's probably going to be in the 50s at night, so that might be enjoyable for everybody. This Saturday night, I'll be speaking there and this Sunday, and that is still open to people to come. Nebraska, I think they still have some seats left. It holds 9,000 people. I'm sure that they opened the heavenlies with Hank Kooniman. Wow. The event. I think they definitely still have some seats there. And I don't think it costs anything to come, but you have to register. So definitely go on Lord of Host and register for that event. That would be the 15th, I think, right, Jen? Is it 15? Yes. His mission is called Lord of Host Church, right? And he's in the- Lord of Host Church, yes. And he is in Omaha. Omaha, Nebraska. A couple miles down the street is the Mid-America Center, which is where they're holding it, it's being held there. And it's going to be huge. It's the 15th. 15, 16, 17, 18. Is that it? Well, the conference is the 15th, 16th, and 17th. And they're going to have Flashpoint Live there. They'll have Flashpoint Live on Thursday, I think, right? And then even Rod Parsley's coming to be one of the keynote speakers. Wow. He definitely does not believe us. The end right now, he's a powerful, live integrity man of God. And guess what? Well, King Christmas, I think, will speak that day also. And Phil Driscoll is coming to play his trumpet. Oh, man, I love that trumpet. He is amazing. I listened to him play live one time. Yes. And it's the only time, listen to this, it's the only time that I've ever listened to music when only the music, without words, obviously, all of a sudden, tears are streaming down. And it was like, it just completely overcame me. Heaven shows up. I know, I know he has family here. And I know them really well. And I'm telling you that man has never stopped for years. He's so powerful in the spirit. But he'll be playing, I know, for Rod Parsley's meeting, and maybe the one before that, he'll be playing, I think, that's Friday, Friday night. Saturday will be Brenda Kahneman. And then me, I'm speaking, Robin Bullock is speaking. And then Hank Kahneman speaking. Oh, my goodness. It's going to be a powerful time. That's amazing. And people can still get into that, you think. Yes, I'm pretty sure they can. And then Sunday is just their church, but I think they're holding their church there, I think. I'm not sure. But I think Sammy Rodriguez is going to be doing Sunday service. And man, he's going to knock it out of the bar, I can tell you. So it's going to be a very God, very, very prophet-oriented things from God with those powerful prophets all being together. And as far as you know, Kat, is he streaming that live as well, do you know? Will people be able to watch it online? I think you can sign up for the streaming, but you can check that out on Lord of Host in Omaha, Nebraska, that's his website, I think. But as of today, they have some seats left in the auditorium. Like I said, it holds 9,000 people. We're bringing 17 members just so we can have our products table. Geez, wow. There'll be so many people coming. And so I'm excited about what God's going to say. It is going to be life-changing. Well, I hope I know you guys will have it on tape. If there's something that ends up being recorded, maybe we can play a clip or something next time around there. I think that same weekend, I'm going to be reawaken America with Clay Clark and all of those. A lot of people, it's like a combination of they're all conservative, they're all patriots, but some are saved, some are not saved. And so there's a lot of evangelism that goes where Robin Bullock was there last time he didn't speak, but Amanda Grace goes every single time virtually. So this will be my second time at the reawaken. It's quite a patriot event. So that'll be fun. That's up in the Spokane area. I think it's very inspiring. I'm telling you, people, there are things that are going to be happening in this country. And I'm sure that you're going to find out some of that at that meeting, the men that Steve will be at. I know you'll hear a lot of that, too, where we're going to be, because I know the heart of Hank Kahneman and Robin Bullock has told me on what God is doing right now. And I know that's what their event with the Patriots is going to be just like that. But from the patriot point of view, this country wouldn't be anything without the Patriots. The Patriots stood in the beginning for this country, the freedom, and they're still standing for the freedom of this country. So awesome. It was an exciting time to be alive, and it really, really is exciting. Well, listen, while we're talking about jump off and share anything else you want to share, we'll have questions about heaven and things, but anything you want to share before we do that. We only have an hour today, because this is my second show. My in-laws are going to walk through the door, or my in-laws, so they'll be fun. The two boys are very rambunctious, so they'll come in. And so at that point, we may not be able to hear each other, so anyway, anything else that's on your heart about what's going on? I just know last night in the nighttime, I kept hearing the father saying to me that something was going to happen very soon. And normally, he doesn't speak to me like at night when I'm already in my bed, but I was still awake. And so I guess he decided to take advantage of that. I just saw him moving his hand over this country. Really? He didn't let me see what he was doing, but he was doing something. I'll tell you, I know that he said on purpose when I hit the gavel that last week, the gavel when it was hit, he said, justice was released then, and certain things are going to start happening very powerfully around this nation, and even overseas, that regards this country. And yes, he does love this world, and he has a lot of plans for this world, and his plans count, not the devil's plans. And we are going to see so much exposure. I know that's going to start happening. Like I already had said, there's going to be a couple of people die that are doing wicked evil stuff. I don't know who those people are. I do know that they will actually drop dead. And when that happens, you're going to know something significant is about to happen. How about that for a sign? That I want them to die, but these are God's plans. This is his world. He has plans for it. He's not allowing evil to take over, in case you wondered. He's not allowing it to happen. So all the things that have been said, this is what it's going to be. This is a new norm. No, it's not. Hell's trying to make it their new norm. They don't get a voice. They don't have a voice. They don't have authority. They don't have permission. They have nothing. They don't have anything to stand on. And even their foundation is crumbling. They've already been building. It's done cheaply. It's done with no intelligence whatsoever involved in it. You should know that by the reports coming up from Washington DC. I can just say, our lives are in God's hands. Our lives are going to be great, powerful, and amazing. That's what God has plans for all of us. So any of these events you can make it to, just make sure you stay tuned into Holy Spirit, if you can hear him. And if you don't have him, you should invite him inside of you, because let me tell you, he'll talk to you out here, or he'll talk to you in here. And then he never stops talking to me. So he's like coming into, I don't call them days of horror, or terror, or loss of everything. That's not going to happen. This is not the tribulation, people. The devil gets a couple of years for that, and it's not right now. And he knows it. And I tell you, I got a text saying that the left is threatening, saying that we should all be scared. I think they are the ones who should be scared, because the God of heaven and earth knows exactly what's going on, and he's going to do what he wants to in this time. So start thanking him for that. Yeah, I heard a major ministry got kicked off completely off of YouTube, and they keep trying to take more of us out. We have two strikes against us, but I don't have a lot of fear. We're on rumble. We may or may not be on YouTube for long. I think they're gunning for most of us, but their time is coming. Whoever's doing this stuff. They're afraid. Yeah, they're freaking out. They think if they don't get rid of us, the plan will fail. But God's not going anywhere, people. And he's the one in charge. And we all know he holds the air we breathe. Yeah, he does. And he should not have fear anywhere in you. I almost wore a shirt that said, don't let fear interfere, which is something Holy Spirit is always having me tell people. Do not let fear interfere in your life. Don't forget that. These are days of wonder and splendor and God's power in this earth. Well, and I think you were the first one that I heard. It was 2012, I believe, when God said, talk with you about let the show begin, was it 2012? It was pretty close to 2012. I think it may have been a little bit before that, because it's when the first elections were starting. The first elections that was won, actually won, and he got his seat. But I do know, let the show begin, was God knowing all this was going to happen. It was said before these days were in, it was before 2019, 2018, 17, God actually had me say, let the show begin, and guess what? He was talking about his show, not the evil show. Yeah, and back then we knew nothing. I remember you were, when you first said that, none of this stuff had happened yet. The selection hadn't been stolen, nothing had happened. It was just like, I just thought onward and upward. Well, it is onward and upward with God, it always is, but we didn't know what we would have to endure, if for lack of a better word for it. We didn't know this whole COVID thing. So God knew what they were up to. He did, he knew before they ever did it. Nothing is hidden, it says in the Bible, nothing is hidden from him. Yeah. And even those who believe he is not, will find out he is. Yeah, these are amazing times. So my wife just walked in and said, hi. She's got a haircut, so she's- Hi. Hi, Noreen. She can't hear you, but she's smiling, so anyway, she just came back because she's got her hair done. She probably didn't like that I had her come on the camera. Yeah, but she's just sweetie. We like to see her though. Yeah, we do like to see her. So, well, let's see, where do we go? Anything else you wanna say before we get into questions? I've got a whole couple of pages of that. I just, I have one, a little boy sent me some time ago. Oh, okay, all right. And I know it's something you have. So, but something very important, a lot of parents don't understand operations of the spirit realm and what certain images mean or even certain movies have things in them. I wanna encourage people to never have your child watch something that has witchcraft in it. Okay, wow, yeah. We know some things are fantasies and some are not fantasies, witches are not fantasies. It's something that's real. They spoke against it in the Bible, said have nothing to do with the necromancer. That is a witchcraft. And they have different levels in that whole area of, there's warlocks, there's wizards. These are dark images. These are dark beings that represent hell. And they've been around since the angels tried to, you know, take over earth when the watcher angels fell and they introduced human sacrifice during that time. This is a long before you were here. And so the dark arts have been around a long time, but there is no good witches. Just so you know, no good witches, no wizards, no warlocks that are good. They're all very evil and wicked. And they do all kinds of horrible things. And so this little boy was serious. He's 10. And he said, he says, I worked for his grandfather. He's the first little boy ties to me. I thought that was awesome. So we get the question, do you think the Habba is good to watch? And Jack, I won't answer that quite clearly. It has, is it wizardry? It has wizardry in it. Now they're showing good wizardry, bad wizardry. There is no such thing. There is no good witchcraft, no good wizard. There isn't, not even the Wizard of Oz. That was a fake, okay? But there's no good witchcraft, no good wizard, no good warlock. They are all evil beings. And I happen to know in that movie, The Hobbit, they have one. So I would say no. I told my grandchildren, no, don't watch that. I told my own children, every younger do not watch that. Why? Because it plants images in your soul as a child to accept the fact that they are good. Yeah. They need to be doing good acts, but they are not good. That's not a good title, or it's not a good position to have. No witchcraft, no wizardry, no warlock, should be on your list to read about or watch. So that's my answer, Jack. Be wise in the spirit. And make sure that you understand what God is against. He knows what is evil and what is not. And like a superhero, that doesn't mean they're evil, okay? But if they have a witch involved, a wizard involved, even though they're doing good things, which is not the truth, do not watch them. So there you go, Jack. Well, yeah, and you know, as a kid, we all watched The Wizard of Oz. I don't know if you did, but we watched it. And there was the white witch, and she was the good witch. And then there was the wicked witch of the East or something. And we always knew that witches weren't good, but at least for the movie's sake, we thought, well, she's nice, she's sweet. The Wizard of Oz, that character was not a real one. He was a carnival man who got caught up and taken to the Land of Oz. That's not like a bad place. But showing people even way back then that there were good witches and bad witches, that part was not real because the witches are always bad. And they know it, they do know it. And so for that reason, I won't even watch that again, not because of the guy who is the carnival guy who gets caught away in the balloon, the air balloon, but because it has as good witch, bad witch. And I'm telling you, that's gonna come to the earth. There'll be a whole group of them saying, look, we're good. You know why? Because the truth is that there is a guy who will be known and nobody will believe the lie, there is no God. That's what's happening right now. God's gonna expose all the darkness and the gray area. There's a gray area that says there is no God. That's gonna be erased. And he told me that himself. People on this earth will know there is a God and they don't want him or there is a God and they're gonna worship him. And he's gonna erase that lie. So they're gonna have to come up with something new to deceive people. And one of the things they will use is that there's good witches and they will on purpose show themselves healing people. All Satan has to do is remove the sickness off of those people because this is his plan to believe the lie that they are good and they are not good. Yeah, so good, it reminds me of anything occultic. I had what I would consider a divine appointment. I was 30 years old at the time because, or 35 because I remember where I lived in Texas. I met a Toys R Us shopping for our kids. They were pretty young back then. And I'm just looking at the aisle and some light. He's like a 10 year old boy, eight to 10. And I clearly didn't work there. I wasn't, didn't have a uniform on. And he says, excuse me, sir. And I said, yeah, what can I do for you? And he goes, I'm looking at this Ouija board. Is this okay? Is this okay? And I said, I said, no, that is not a good thing. I don't even remember what I said, but I said him straight that this was of the dark side and the devil. And he goes, thank you for telling. I mean, can you imagine where that boy might've been heading had God not set that, that divine appointment? When that came out, everybody was pushing it more so you can contact the dead. I mean, this is what they were saying. You can contact the spiritual realm. They didn't mean to make it sound evil. And yeah, I happen to know when people would use those back in the day, when I was growing up, that demons would appear to people and then it would, and I'm not gonna say anything that would make kids want to go get one because you're welcoming and opening yourself up to the darkness. That represents evil all the way. There's nothing good about it. It's something you need to get rid of. If it was in your house, clean your house, open the door and kick out all those evil spirits. Because that is one of the main things that they use to fool children or young people to see something exciting happen. But you don't want to be involved or participate with the darkness. It is not a good thing. Yeah, that was amazing. Follow that one. I'll never forget that. I think, because you pray for divine appointments and this and that, but you're just walking in the toy store and this boy knew something was off about that game and he must've had money in his pocket and he wanted that. He thought to ask, you know, I'd love to know meet that boy in heaven one day and say, what happened after that? You know, you know, when we walked away, he said. All right, well, speaking of kids, I've got a four year old that wants to know, her name is Reagan, his or her. I think it says Reagan. I can't tell if that's a boy or a girl. It says, are there parks with swings in heaven? That's what he or she wants to know. Are there parks with swings? Yes, and when Jen gets her book published, I'm going to have her up her answering questions too, because God has shown her heaven in cartoon form. She's writing books about all the encounters I hadn't had in heaven, but on a child's level. And Jen knows that there's parks in heaven there are. There's all kinds of fun things for children to do and be a part of, but yes, there's parks, like parks you never saw before. They have huge slides coming down out of the sky, like little slides that kids slide on. I think that's probably where the carousel, there's a carousel that has living animals on it. I'm getting ahead of now, Jensen, you're telling me about my book. These animals are like, I'm not kidding. Sharks, unicorns, bears, baby dinosaurs. This carousel is huge, but there's not a pole going up through them. They're just standing on this carousel that's going around and you have the most fun on this carousel in heaven. And so that is part of this park that I saw there. And so it's real exciting. So you're going to love the parks in heaven. They're all over heaven, all different types of them. And so you ask a good question. Is there parks in heaven? Absolutely, yes. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Now this one says, Shannon Ray, I can't tell the age, but she wants to know, is there dancing in heaven and where they use, where they have the use of flags in worship, so flaggers and dancing, I guess, in worship. I have to say, absolutely, yes, I've been to the throne room many times and God loves pageantry, started in heaven. Pageantry started in heaven. They have these huge flags and yes, people actually make them in heaven. That's one of the gifts they have. They make them and they put like lions on them, eagles on them. There's some of the angelic embellished on these flags. And when people run with them in the throne room, they come to life. Like the lions roar off of the flags, okay? I'm talking about like that a lot. Wait, say that again, the lions roar off the flag? Did you just say that? Yeah, the low head will move like this and begin to roar out into the throne room. They can't help it with, you know, there's a father on the throne, there's his son on the throne and they get undone. But yes, that's the difference between heaven and everything is alive in heaven. So this flags and all this beautiful pageantry they have in heaven is something wonderful to see. You can even participate in heaven. And of course they have dancers, they have dancers here on the earth because I'm trying to remember the scripture that I know it's in Psalms. It says that one of the highest levels of worship is dance. It says so. And it says, when they dance and worship, it binds the enemy and fetters of iron. And that is the very scripture that all my daughters lived by. They all are parts of dance come to cushion dance companies. They still do dance, all of them. And it's a very powerful in the spirit and it even does, it does say that scripture so that when you dance and worship, you are binding the enemy that would be Satan and fetters of iron. So good, now you, you're talking about the arts for a minute and I'm trying to remember what you said because you had contrasted this. He said, now and on earth, there's worship other than people do art to the worship. Didn't you contrast that was saying, but in heaven, there's something different about the way that goes down. Do you know what I'm asking? Yes, yes, although totally is, and I was shown this, I was visiting Reading, California, Bethel. I wasn't invited to speak, but I was invited by their intercessors to come and see the healing room they have there. And they had artists, of course, their artists were over on the side and they were playing in worship on the stage. Normally, even at our own meetings, we will do this. We have a powerful worship, but we always invite artists to come, our own artists are there, and they're painting what they're seeing in the spirit during the worship. I've known they've done that several other places too when I've been present at meetings to speak and they'd have artists up there painting in the spirit, what they saw while the people were worshiping. Well, in heaven, it's a little bit different. In heaven, the one who's holding the baton to lead the worshipers is an artist. And they will worship to what the artist is painting. So as the artist is painting, they're painting so that the people like, now if they were on the platform painting now, you and the audience would see the art. That's not in heaven. And heaven is the opposite. The artist is standing with a worship team behind them so they can see what the artist is painting and what they paint. They worship to that. They worship and that's what the music, they're hearing music as the artist is painting, they're hearing sounds and frequencies and instruments. And I told the people at Bethel because I was there and I was watching the artist paint and I saw that going on in the spirit. And I actually told them, they said, if you can tell us something that we haven't heard before that we would be interested in, we'll let you in the room. That's what they said to me. And what I told them was that I said, do you know that when you have artists on the platform painting, the worship team will paint what they're hearing from the art so they let me in right away. And I saw what happening. I said, wow, do you all realize, cause I could see what the artist was painting and went around that side of the stage. When you realize that what they're worshiping and what they're singing is what's on this art coming off this canvas and they got, and then the artist fell out in spirit when I said that. So yeah, so that's one of the ways that things are done differently. They are the ones who lead the worship, the artist with their art creates words, sounds, frequencies and music as they're painting. And that is what they play and sing in heaven. Now you've talked about while we're on the subject, you've talked about, I think there's a scripture that says it'll give you garments of praise for heaviness or something like that. I don't have that memorized. Talk about, cause you've spent a long time since you've mentioned this, what are garments of praise actually in heaven? They really do exist. And we all know that it does talk about them. It talks about them in the Bible. He'll give you garments of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness, I think is what the scripture says. And it's one of the gifts the father gives out himself when you come home to heaven. And people know that I did see Whitney Houston go home to heaven the night before. She's saying in a lounge type area, she's saying with all her soul, yes, Jesus loves me. And when she did, she was receiving Christ the next day she passed away. And I was in another state. I think I was out west on the Western tour. And I was sitting there waiting to speak and I was instantly caught up to heaven. I did not know that she had passed away even. I was caught up to heaven and I was standing near the throne and I saw Whitney Houston up there. And the father was telling her how much you loved her and he thanked her for using her gift on the earth. And he was so pleased that Jesus Christ had her what had walked her up the steps and said, here father, your daughter has come home. I got to see all that. And I don't know what was going on. I know they were worshiping in this meeting that I was gonna be speaking at but I was up in heaven watching this. And the father said to Whitney because you were willing to use the gift I put in you I'm gonna give you one of my own things. One of his own gifts that he had. And he took out this little treasure box. It was the embellishment on it was alive. The colors were moving all over this little treasure box. When he opened it, the color garnet, it was a color. When I saw it come out, it came out like a color and it started squirreling and it became a garnet fabric. And it went all the way around Whitney and became this gown, a beautiful garnet gown. And he said, because daughter, you've been willing to use the gift I put in you. I'm giving you one of my own songs that only I have sung. And Whitney was so undone. She was young, she was beautiful. She's so filled with the light of God. Cause you remember she got saved the night before. And so she had light, the light of God in her and all she did was move her hand and when she moved her hand, the father's song came off of the garment and you heard him singing. Really? His voice? So let me tell you that there's no way you can understand the scope and the beauty and the power of the gifts, the rewards he gives you in heaven. You're going to get rewarded. Okay. If you did things for him, you wouldn't want to stop him. Some people go, well, I don't want any recognition. You don't get a choice because it's him recognizing and honoring what you did on this earth. So everywhere Whitney would go wearing that gown when she chose to wear it. And when she chose to change in her own chambers, it would come off, go back in, I know this later. I found this out later. It went back in the treasure box. Whenever she wanted to wear it, she'd open it and it came out the same way. It would come out with this color, become a fabric weight or she'd walked down the streets of gold. Never she went. People could hear the father singing off of her gown. And the father looked at her and said, this is a garment of praise. Kat, I can hardly contain this. When you said he's thanked because you're willing to use, you were willing to use this gift, was he referring to only the night before that she did that or was he referring to her using her gift during her lifetime? If you even know the answer to that. He meant her using her gift willingly during her lifetime. During her lifetime. Okay, so even when she wasn't saved, she was still, okay. She was using the gift that he put in you. Let me tell you. A lot of people are using the gift God put in them and hopefully they're gonna find that out one day. But he did let her know. She knew God gave her that gift. She knew it. She knew it. And I didn't say she always lived right, but she did create gospel albums with that gift and they're so powerfully, they're anointed that she was anointed to sing and worship. And when God sent her as that little spirit of light and knit her together in her mother's womb at the time of conception, that gift was already in her. When he says, the Bible says, God said, I knit you together in your mother's womb. He's not talking about putting your arms and legs on. We can't make a human spirit people, okay. Our side is creating the flesh side, but there's real no real life in anything until that spirit is attached. Like when God made Adam, when God spoke and the word made Adam and his body was laying there, lifeless, the father leans over because that's where we all came from. We live in him and him, we live, we move, we have our very existence. That's talking about the father and he leans over and breathes from inside himself, Adam's spirit. And he said, he received the spirit of life when he breathed into Adam's nostrils and then Adam became a living soul. That's what the Bible says. He became a living soul because that came from the father. The spirit and the soul came from him. And so that's what he means at the time of conception, that early, when conception takes place, the father sends that little soul, that little spirit and soul and he actually attaches the edit that daughter flesh. And that is when life begins. You know, when you're talking about God gave her that gift, it was a beautiful gift of, you know, she had the gift of music. So God gave her more of the same. There are people that are not singers and they may not even yet be gifted as musicians. And they were usually, let's say, a builder who loves to build, they can't wait to build, they've always built cause they were like the carpenter. Does their gift in heaven relate to that kind of thing? Did they use that kind of gift as well, like building? I think he could still give somebody a garment of praise. It doesn't mean he can't give them one, but for her. For her, that's what he chose for her. And you get more than one gift anyway, but I'm quite sure. I know that the father and the son build our mansion, just so you understand, it says not made by hand. You get a mansion not made by human hands. But there's places all over heaven that people who have a gift to build and design get to be a part of that. They work with Jesus when they get to heaven and build these other places, not mansions, but places to go and enjoy, places to have excitement in, places where people are going to worship in or be together in. And what he would give them probably as an awesome gift would be heavenly blueprints to build something up there in heaven. That makes sense to me. And it sounds like really good news for someone. I mean, I'm not a builder, but I mean, there are people who get up in the morning and can't wait to make something else out of wood, you know? So, all right, well, here's a woman named, well, she goes by the handle cupcake. She says, Kat, if I'm just a mom, wait, the spirits all over me today. I keep, I'm this close to weeping out everything I read. Kat, if I'm just a mom living in New York City, how much authority do I have over strongholds? My street, my neighborhood, my whole city? So that's her question. I will tell you what the word says. When Jesus Christ was talking to his disciples and not just to them, but any believer and Jesus said, I give you power over all the power of the enemy. That should answer your question right there. We are over the darkness, not under the darkness. Satan is the doormat, we are not the doormat. We get the crowns from Christ to rule and reign. He says, you are ruling reign with me now. Now that's in the spirit realm over the darkness. We rule over that. That's Jesus' choice as a believer. If you've been born again, okay? You have deposits of things in your soul that you use to operate in this earth. Most people don't find out about them, although the word clearly talks about them. But Jesus did say, I give you power over all the power of the enemy, you know? And we can assess, they're in there, what you can do, things that you can do. So there's no enemy, there's no spiritual darkness that should have more power than us as a body of Christ, us as a believer in Jesus Christ, who lives in us, Christ lives in us. And the plan of God and of Christ always was for us to take authority and power and authority in this world and change things. By the way, we live our life, the choices we make, the words we speak. It says, what you dare to declare and decree, it will be established under you. So you can declare and decree that the gangs are not taken over your city where you're at, you're not tolerating them anymore. You don't partner with hell in any way whatsoever and begin to evict them from your city, stand in your yard, stand in your house and say that. You're taking the realm you live in and you have every right to do that and it doesn't matter what it is. If it's murders going on, if it's gangs going on, if it's drugs going on, it doesn't matter. You need to take authority all over all the evil and the wicked spirits of darkness that is promoting that and powering these people to do it, you learn to say something against it. Doesn't mean you have to show up at their place, you have authority in the spirit, you can speak from where you are right now against all the evil darkness even going on now. You do not have to receive the words of those who are wicked and evil trying to control you and that means that any time in your life, you don't have to put up with it because Jesus Christ lives in you, he waits for your words. The army of heaven waits for your words. So what are you saying? Are you complaining? Are you, all you're talking about is a darkness. If all you're talking about is the evil and darkness, you're gonna have that all around you. If you don't like it, then evict it from your life, evict it from your home and start declaring what God says, okay? Jesus is the restorer of our souls. He died on the cross, you're washed clean by his blood, you're the power of his blood, his name, his word, his authority that he has given us, that's who you are. You are not weak, you are not forgotten, you were called by God and your birth was timed on the earth for right now to say things and rule against things going on in this world because God is setting things up for the manifest ascends and daughters to rule and reign against the evil in this earth, in the spirit realm where your authority is. So yes, you absolutely have power and authority over all the darkness trying to ruin your life, ruin your family, say something against it and use the word of God if you want to, repeat what Christ has said if you want to, it doesn't change the fact that he said, you will rule in this life with him, he's talking about now and in the time is to come. So yes, people are going to know in this world who knows God, who believes in God and who's operating and walking in the spirit and not the flesh, they're going to know who you are by what's going on in your own life for God is about to do in your life that he's going to demonstrate to this world that you belong to him and you believe him. You know, Kat, it's not lost in me that you declare and decree all the time for your own state, the state of Florida, one of the states that's doing the best in the nation. I mean, that's not lost in me, you know, and you have Ivana Tia lives there, Donna lives there. I was born in Oregon and I'm in Oregon now, but I met Doreen in California, two of our kids, we were married in California, two of our kids were born in California and I love that state and it's so hard to see it going. And I'm thinking to myself, surely there's enough saints in California that are decreeing and yet it seems to be going backwards. Has God shown you anything about California? Well, Steve, you're only going to hear what's happening in the fake news. I mean, all you're going to hear is what the, you're going to only hear what the left is saying people. All right, that's true. He knows another whole side to this world that is not being heard, but they're there. And I promise you, they are taking authority. They are demonstrating, they are demanding things to be changed. They are speaking against the darkness and the evil thereof. They're taking authority over it. Why do you think everything they've tried has failed? Because we are light in this world and they can't take the light out of us. They can't stop God from talking to us. They can't stop it. And I think that's why they are very concerned. And it's all going to be showing up really soon that you do have authority and you do, you can do something about it. You can stop anything going on this wicked. I've not stopped talking against human trafficking, okay? That is horrible. It is a crime against humanity. It's even a crime against God himself because he didn't send people. He didn't send anyone to have that happen to them. There's a real devil in this world. But if you advertise more for him and talk about him more than God, are you going to do anything great for God? Stop advertising and participating with the wrong one and start declaring and declaring what God has said. And tell God, you believe him, you know he knows what's going on. You're on his side. You want to speak his words against the darkness. And let me tell you what, things are going to start changing so quickly. But what's happening right now and what is about to happen is the body of Christ is about to get major accelerated in authority, in dominion, and people are going to know they have it. So good, good, good news. And we can declare over other states, right? You declare over DC. We don't have to just declare our own state. I send a host all over this world. Good, that's good. I know you do. I send way more than- I send them for 24 hours a day for two weeks. That's really good. And they'll shred platforms of evil beings. They'll pull down strongholds. They will literally expose the flesh. Those in the flesh who are evil and wicked are getting exposed every day, but it's going to start majorly happening. That this stuff is going to be shown, that you can't get away with this. This is not God's plan. The earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof. You know the Bible says that. You know you're part of that fullness. You have a light in you that he put in you. You have authority in you. You have the anointing that Christ operated in. First John 2, 27, when you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior, you receive a deposit of the anointing and lives in you. What is the anointing? It destroys the yoke of darkness forever, you send it. That's good news to hear. Have an ice cream after you do it, people. And some chocolate cake. Deborah is asking, are there any distinctions between Jews and Gentiles in heaven? That's an interesting question. I think of course people know your ethnicity. You don't really lose your ethnicity. I mean, if you were born Scottish or Scottish there, you still look Scottish. You know, if you were born Nigerian, you still look Nigerian. You belong to God. If you receive Christ, you're going to go to heaven. So people do know that. They know that about you. They know what you did on the earth for God. That's shown many places all over heaven. So you don't stop being you. You're just a greater you. Do the accents still exist? Like Australians still sound like Australians. Jamaicans sound like Jamaicans and so forth. Yes. And yeah, all the Irish and Scottish accents, they all are still there for eternity. They're all there. The accents are there. There's different languages, but you understand every language spoken in heaven, except one in language. The one language of angels that is their own. They do speak other ones, but there is one that's just their language. And I don't think that we speak that one, but any other ethnicity that's been on the earth, was on the earth. You understand when they speak to you in Scottish or they speak to you in Nigerian, they speak to you in Spanish and you're not Spanish. You know every word they're saying in heaven. Yeah, it wouldn't be hard to hear. So, okay, in this one, Olivia and John just died. This says, please ask Kat, if she knows, if Olivia and John made it to heaven. I haven't been shown that yet, but that doesn't mean she didn't, people. I can tell, if it's okay with you, I'll just tell you that one of our writers, I can't think of her name right now, she's written for Breaking Christian News for years. She's the niece to Olivia and John. Olivia and John was saved. So, my personal testimony, we know Olivia and John is having, even though you haven't seen her, so I'm able to say that. All right, let's see, I haven't pre-read this, so here we go. Don asked, I recently had to put down my 17-year-old dog in the morning of his departure. I was praying for God to give me strength and peace. Trying to get through this stuff today. As I was praying, I saw a group of our pets that had already gone to heaven sitting and waiting and they all had little party hats on. Has Kat ever seen a pets coming home party? Yes, I have. I saw my own pets. I had a Yorkie named Molly and I got to see, she was hanging on with one breath practically, and I think that's when I was on the Western tour, I was going like a six-weeks tour and she was not doing well. She was like 16, 17 years old and I kept thanking God for letting her last until I could come home and say goodbye to her. And he did, he was very faithful, he did keep her and she was not doing really well and I actually dressed her in a little gown, people. It's okay, I loved her. I dressed her in a little hung-going gown and I gave her this beautiful thing when she passed that I would put her in and I had it all prepared and I got to hold her, I got to bathe her and she was on her, she was breathing, but she recognized me, her eyes, she could smell, she could smell, but she knew it was me and she loved me very much and I loved her very much. And finally, I just said to the father, okay, I've said goodbye, please take her so she can go home and it was like she was gone. Like her breath left her, she left her body and I actually have seen her several times in the sky since then, usually when we're sending another pet home, she will actually come for some reason and be here when that pet passes and she goes, they go up to heaven with her. It's amazing the relationship that even pets can create between each other and I did see them preparing for her hung-going party when she got there and her favorite thing to do was chase the mailman to try to get the letters away from him and so at her thing, I know, I know what was happening. I saw her running down the streets to go chasing an angel. I know people think God would not do that. Well, you don't know what you get there, okay? And there was an angel dressed like a postman with his big old wings running and he had this mail. It looked like mail and he was sewn out of his backpack and watching to see if the dog would chase him and boy, she was running down the streets to go after him like, oh, she could get. And she was having the best time and I thought, what better thing to give her? She actually got outside one time, she was an inside dog. She'd bark at the mail slot every day and pull the mail out of the mailman's hand and he would tease her with the mail but she got up one time when we weren't there. I don't know how that happened but she was chasing him all over our yard when we got home and he was throwing her the, you know, the mail, like all the ads and stuff. He was throwing it at her trying to stop her from chasing him. It was funny but to see that the father loved even her enough to plan something special for her. Totally. I've also seen when we all had a dox and it was my daughter's doxen and I did see him being also welcome home into heaven and the dogs and other pets we had where they were waiting for him. So yes, that does happen. And so if you had a pet past recently, number one, they never went by their self. Normally your own personal guardian angel will take your pet's spiritual body to heaven. And they've seen that angel a lot because dogs can see in the spirit. They saw that angel with you. So it wasn't somebody strange. They just gather up your spirit and take them up to heaven. But Molly seems from our side, Molly seems to be the greeter who gets to go with them also. So yes, the pets can do things together in heaven. It's beautiful. And is it your testimony for lack of a better word that dogs and cats can or might see your angels or they simply do? What do they do? They do. And that's why dogs are a part of the things you can't see. It makes sense. I think cats see them too, but dogs respond differently than cats do. Yeah, they do. I think they're really busy with cats since they got nine lives to try to save and not just one maybe. But I do know that pets can definitely acknowledge when angels come in and out of here, when we had our dogs that were here, they would always follow them when they walked. I could see them following them in babies. All babies can see the angels, not just the angels. You're not saying some, you're saying all babies. All babies fresh from heaven can see in the spirit. They can see, and even when my own daughters would have a baby and my daughter would be holding them and the baby would be like looking at me, like this is me here and the baby's looking at me. That baby would go like this. That's hilarious. Every single time they will look at my angels. So I know they're seeing the angels. So yes, your baby can see angels. Now you're describing some hilarious things in heaven. Talk about for a minute, because this is a, in the natural, if someone only listens to the news, this is a painful crisis, horribly yucky time on this face of the earth, and someone would say, well, God would never be up in heaven performing all these hilarious things because there's more important things on the earth that demand his attention. How would you respond to that? I would say God is already responding to the stuff on the earth people. He is setting up and recording every single evil act indeed that's being done, because the gavel's already fallen for justice to come to this nation and this world, but the evil trying to take over. No one's going to escape seeing this. So God is doing stuff on this earth right now. Important things right now for what is coming, which is the days of glory and fire are coming on earth. Those are powerful, amazing things. The manifest of sons and daughters, she's done preparation for hundreds of years already on the earth for this to happen. He knew what was gonna happen. He knew people would be coming home to heaven. He doesn't create evil, but there is right now an evil devil who hates everybody. He even hates his own demons. He hates anybody involved with him, even doing things for him. He loves nobody, but God loves us for the love that you hardly can't understand that he sent his son to make a way back to him. He's not ignoring us on the earth right now, but he's also not going to ignore what's going on in heaven. He's not gonna make somebody have to experience suffering or agony or things that are on the earth right now. This is his ballpark. This is his, he's dealing with this. We're praying who are alive here. We're taking authority right here. That's what our thing is to do right now is to take authority. For those who run their race and run it well are not going home to heaven. He is not going to ignore the fact that he wants to welcome them. He wants them to feel special. He wants them to know how much he loves them. He does both at the same time, deal with it on the earth and loves people in heaven. I was gonna ask you about that because we teach, we've always taught as believers that God is omnipresent, which means he's everywhere at once. So when he says weep with those who weep, rejoice with those who rejoice laugh, he literally does all of those things simultaneously, right? All at the same time. Yes, he does. Someone lost a baby today. He's weeping with them right now. Someone, little kid did something funny in heaven. He's laughing with that. All at the same time. He definitely can be everywhere all at the same time. And by the way, the devil can't. The devil does not have the power. He's not omnipresent. He's not omnipresent. He's not. He is a created being who became very evil and wicked, who wants to use and take away destiny, steal things, kill, steal and destroy is the MO of Satan. The mode of operation for Satan is kill, steal and destroy. God is to bring life and bring it more abundantly. So there's definitely a difference between light and darkness and good and evil. And let me tell you more than ever before, you're seeing that a lot of people have never even witnessed this before in their life, but they're seeing a lot of it right now. And you're definitely me. You will understand what God is doing because it's going to start showing up unexpectedly and suddenly. When God does this suddenly, almost no one's prepared for it, not those believing and hoping for it and not the ones trying to stop it from happening. He is fully aware of everything and knows where everybody is. It's hiding, who's cheating, who's stealing, who's lying, he knows every bit of that. He also knows who is ready to be blessed. Those who are about to reap a harvest for their giving and they're helping and they're praying. Both sides are going to have what they've been. It's seed time and harvest right now, people. The harvest is coming is not the great end time harvest. The harvest is about to come is seed time and harvest, which you've been seeding over these last five, six years on either side, good or evil. You're about to get a harvest of either recompense and justice or blessings and suddenly an empowerment. And both are going to be judged. Both are going to receive the harvest that they've been planting all these years. So the wicked cannot stop or stop from happening what God is going to judge and give justice for. But you also can't stop the blessings and the acceleration in the power of God. That's being given to those who stood firm, who helped, who prayed, who did what was right. Both sides are going to be dealt with, blessed or dealt with with justice. It is going to happen. Oh, good, such good news. You know, we have to stop shorter today just because those little grandsons are going to bust through the door at any moment now. Would you pray for the people or whatever God gives you to pray as we close this out? Yeah, Father, I just speak your life into people right now. I impart life, the love of God, the wisdom of God, His acceleration, His expectation, His celebration for all that is about to happen, that is full of light, love, inventions, all kinds of wonderful things that are coming to this earth right now. He timed you to be here for that. And God, I will speak to the wicked. You are going to receive justice. And you may not like what is about to happen to you, so you better change your mind and get on the right side. If you don't want to experience the judgment, probably imprisonment, maybe even the firing squad, I'm just going to tell you right now, and this is everywhere, anywhere right now. God is getting ready to fulfill both of those things in the earth simultaneously. And He is going to take this earth and turn it into a place He needs it to be. The greater glory of God can be seen and known in the earth. It says, the knowledge, knowing, understanding of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea. Did you know that this earth is covered with two-thirds sea? That means two-thirds of the entire earth is going to experience the glory of God, the fire of God, baptism and fire coming. There's no one out there, no human, no demon that can stop that from falling on this earth. Let me tell you what it is to do. It burns all fear out of you. It burns all anything that you've been substituting something for God for. It's going to burn fear out. It's going to burn confusion out. It's going to burn hate out, anger out. It's going to burn out of you when it touches you. So no one can stop these. These are the things and days of God. It's the day of His power. It is not the day of His wrath. But some people are about the experience wrath because of sea, time and harvest. And there's no one on this earth that can stop that from happening. These are the days that God has decided on. These are His times on the earth. And no one can stop Him from doing so. Father, I thank you for helping those. God, to know how to take authority, to do that, to stand up for what is right, to declare and decree the goodness that's coming of God, His plans, His will, His way, in Jesus' name, and stop advertising the enemy who is a loser, loser, loser. I thank you. I'm on the winning side. God, help them to be on the winning side. Send your presence to flood their lives right now. The presence of God to flood you right now in Jesus' name. And power you, inspire you, encourage you. That, Father, is what they need right now. I thank you for giving it to them in Jesus' name. And we all said amen. Amen. Cat, tell people real quick. You've got two websites, RevealingHeaven.com. What can they get there? And then you've got catcur.com. Talk about those real quick. The comments where our store is. The Father gave me a corporation for one reason, to reveal and create heaven on earth. We reveal it through words, through meanings. We also reveal it through products. Like, I love this cup. The Holy Spirit showed me how to create this cup. And it says, I don't do demons. See that? That little lightning bolt right there is what Satan was cast out of heaven on. And the Holy Spirit said, please, add it to your cup so people can enjoy it. Every time they know, he was put down. He lost his position, his authority, and his power. And I can tell you, a lot of that's going to start happening again. So you can go there for RevealingHeaven.com. Our events are on that page also. Catcur.com is a place I call the spiritual platform for God, the Father, Holy Spirit, and Jesus to say whatever they want to say on that place. And I'm just going to remind everybody, I will never, ever message you, number one. I don't know how to message people on Facebook or any other form of media. I don't do that. I'm not going to message you and say, please give money to this missionary. Please give to this cause. That is someone trying to steal your money. You will never, ever get a message from me saying that, an email saying that, a text saying that. I'm not going to do it. So you know if that comes. That's a fraud and that's a fake trying to take your money. Don't send it. Don't give them any answer to what they're sending. Don't answer their email or their messaging. That is not true. And also, oh, she said she gave me something. What is your public Facebook page called? My public Facebook page is called the Catcur. The reason for that was when I went to make my public Facebook page. Catcur was taken. And the Holy Spirit said, just put the Catcur. And then they'll know what you. Well, guess what? It was available. The Catcur is my public Facebook page. It's also what my YouTube channel is called. And that will keep you clear. If anybody else texts you or uses my picture and says they're a different Facebook, tell them they're lying. And that is not me and pray for those people to delete them. All right, Cat, good. A quick message that tomorrow, well, Thursday. This is Tuesday, we're recording Thursday. Tomorrow for those watching, Hank Kuhneman will be our guest. So we haven't had him on for a long time. So we're really, really looking forward to having Hank on. We miss him a lot. So thank you, Cat. God bless you and your team. It was so nice to see your mom. We're going to have your mom on soon with you. And have her give us some pearls of wisdom. I miss you a lot. So listen, we enjoyed it today. It was very great. And I am really close to the spirit today. I'll tell you what, even reading about pets, I'm ready to weep. So anyway, thanks again for the day. We bless you and have a great day. And we will see you all tomorrow. God bless you. Bye. You

music You Well, happy Wednesday September 14 2022 welcome to Elijah's dreams. I'm Steve Schultz host along with my wife We founded together both the Elijah list right there like this calm and Elijah streams Beginning 25 years ago. We are in the beginning of year 26 I think if I'm saying that right bringing you the voice of the prophets and never has it been more important than in this specific time Frame when so much is going on many of you have heard I'm gonna say repeat it for a couple of days in a row We are off of YouTube until December First it's pretty much fine with me Because they're as soon as we get back on they're gonna be gunning force again They are trying to remove Christians that are conservative that are speaking anything on behalf of Trump And I will not relent because YouTube wants me to I'll get all the more stubborn and you know So we're trying to be wise so that we're not Abandoning the channel outright. We're gonna they're gonna have to force us off And but neither am I gonna overly try not to offend them because they're trying to be offended They don't want to not be offended They're trying to be offended so that they have a legitimate excuse We wait till December 31 all of our strikes disappear But that doesn't keep them from the next day giving us more strikes so they can take us off So just so you all know we will be off through and including the elections there But we we're gonna be on rumble The whole time rumble is getting just as large of views or almost as large of views as our best days on YouTube Maybe we're not quite there, but almost as large and we're usually on Facebook as well So be sure and tell your friends and family anyone that wants to know when we're gonna be on where Rubble and Facebook now and we will be back on YouTube December One I think is the date or whichever the Monday is close to that probably or whatever date is close to December 1 Okay, so now cat will be on here in just a few minutes But you all have heard me talk about Mike and Laurie Sally Who have are helping us in two areas the wells being dug in Uganda and then the water projects We're working on right now. So without further delay, let's bring in Mike and Laurie Sally to kind of give us a report. Hey guys Hey, how you doing? Good. How's Mississippi this time of year? It's actually beautiful today. It's really starting to be fall weather So we're excited about that. Awesome. Now. Do you get snow? Probably not in the south. Do you do occasionally? Yeah, do you a couple years or so? Yeah, I lived in Dallas for a while And then I lived in Florida on the other side for a while. So we didn't see a lot of snow But yeah, we could get the you get the big thunderstorms and all that out there always that's our big thing. Yeah Well, listen, I know you guys have got a different things to share with us. I'm trying to decide Laurie should we start with how the Mississippi Water project came into being by meeting the mayor or where would you like to start? Sure, we can talk about that I don't know if everybody watching knows the devastation that's happening in Jackson, Mississippi, which is the capital of our state The water has the people have been on a boiled notice, which I don't know if that's common everywhere I didn't really I've never heard of it. Yeah, it's common here in Mississippi And I didn't really realize that till we moved back to the south in Mississippi several years ago It happens all the time in different areas. The water gets contaminated and so this has been something going on in Jackson for a really long time and So since you brought us on the team Steve to help begin investigating water issues here in the states Mike and I never realized right in our own backyard. Jack's struggling So we've been looking, you know knocking on doors and meeting different people about the water crisis is going on in the United States Which I didn't even realize it was so challenging here, but we were flying back from Vacation, I think it was in early June and I had actually been kind of sick the night before and had an upset stomach. So I didn't really sleep good So I didn't really look I don't know like travel worthy I actually felt like I was traveling back from Uganda like I've been on a long missions trip or something But I'm even that long so we are in the Atlanta airport and Mike looks across the way and he's he says I think that's the mayor of Jackson We've only seen him on TV and so I looked and I was like, yeah That that kind of looks like him and everybody was you know around him talking to him and stuff And I don't know why I did this but just in my mind just in my heart I said to the Lord Lord if you want to give him an encouraging word I I'd be willing to do it You're just gonna have to sit me next to him and that's just random I do that sometimes just to challenge myself because you know when you're talking about We're always talking about the prophetic and wanting to use it But if you don't put yourself out there, I don't know if you're not aware then then God really you know We didn't have an opportunity so I'm always you know since I've been walking in the prophetic I've been challenging myself in that so I think I said it so we get on we go to get on the plane you know you scan your boarding pass and Mike has all of the miles and he always gets upgraded any time we fly together man first-class Mike sally Back in the back, you know, and and he's a gentleman and always offers to give it to me But he has long legs so I let him sit in the front So I scan my boarding pass before Mike and it spits out a different seat number And I'm thinking oh well surely you know Mike's gonna get the same thing and he scans his and nothing happens And I'm like that's crazy. Well, I was gonna be sitting in a middle seat next to Mike And I actually love the window so this seat was the window so I said it was our last leg I said let me just take this seat. I'm tired. I'll sit there So I go and sit in on an 11 a and Mike's back in 29 So I'm sitting down and you know just sitting there waiting the next thing I know the mayor comes walking down and he stops and he sits in the seat right next to wow And I start speeding like oh gosh did I really just say that to the Lord like I'll give him a word of encouragement So I just start thinking like what do you want to say God? What do you want to say? So we're sitting there and you know everybody's passing by and they're all talking to him then I just I don't know what to say I don't have any profound words. So I just turned to him and I just tell him exactly what just what I just told you Again, okay, I think I'm a crazy Christian. I don't know and he says to me He says, you know, there's no coincidences in the Bible That does not happen in the Bible and really he started to give me words of encouragement and I tell me You know, I want to pray for you how can we pray for you and he starts just kind of sharing his journey and how he got into being the mayor and He he just starts pulling out scriptures and he tells me what the meaning of Jackson means It means God is gracious and he just starts kind of prophesying the destiny over his city And I'm just blown away and I said well, I think maybe I sat next to you for me Not the other way Okay, you know, well, I just know there's more and I'll just keep praying So he put you know, they they take off and he puts on his mask and puts on his earplugs and he goes to sleep He's been on a business trip. I'm sure he's tired the whole time sitting there like Lord. What is it? Why do you have me sitting next to him? Then I remember there's a water issue in Jackson, Mississippi and their husband and I thought is that why? So as we're getting ready to land I take the last minute I have before he gets off the plane and I just mentioned to him Hey, we're working with an amazing group of people that really have a passion to bring clean water And I don't know if maybe that's why God put us together Do you think when we get off the plane, you know You can exchange numbers with my husband and we can maybe see see what God has and he says sure get off the plane Mike exchange numbers and he actually texted us later and set up a meeting Go to Jackson to his office meet with his cabinet and just share what Elijah streams is doing well He set up a meeting with his cabinet. Yes. Yes. It really shocked us. It was actually kind of a little overwhelming like to walk in there with all these and he's introducing us into the CFO and this person and this person and And we just start talking about the crisis and the issue and the challenges that they're having and and it really was an amazing Time and got to give it. We gave him some words of encouragement and in from that point on You know, we were gonna do some more meetings and figure out how we can help bring water clean water Kind of a staff stopgap measure because honestly the water system in Jackson is going to take millions of dollars to repair and so our our heart was like, okay, what can we do in the meantime to help people just like we're doing in Uganda and We shared with him about the water box Yeah, and so right after that this water crisis hit and it wasn't just a matter of we had some flooding issues But it wasn't just a matter of being on a boiled water alert It was a matter of no pressure in the lines And really many people that had no water not just dirty water, but no water to flush their toilets no water today And this is Yeah And it's this is a major city and you start thinking like wow This is actually happening here in the United States and so, you know, we were actually because of the live streams We were able to be in position here We were able to jump in and begin to help some other organizations that are that are situated in downtown Jackson and there's there's there's a couple of organizations that we worked with That were out delivering water because a lot of people couldn't even get out There was some elderly and some people that were just homebound for different reasons They couldn't even get out and get the water that was being given away. And so we got these jugs I think we have a video we can show you in a second here about that But one of the pastors that we worked with went out delivered these jugs of water to people all over the city that he knew We're lock-ins and so it was really ministered to him that a lot of streams came in and was being was willing to help Financially and also providing these water jugs. And so you want to show that video? Let's go ahead and play that video Emily go for it. Hey guys, my name is brother JJ Thompson I am the pastor here at Alternative Ministry and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to Let you know how much I appreciate the work and the things that you guys may do for us I want to think Elijah's stream you're donating these gallons of water cause we in Jackson, Mississippi You know, we have a water crisis But what we're doing we are being the middleman to help those that can't get out But I've been pastoring for 10 years been in minister 20 But God is way too. I've got 60 years old to get me to do what I'm doing and I'm gonna say this I'm gonna be finished. I love what Paul said about pure religion It is happening to follow through this And I thank God for the passion. So again, thank you from Jackson, Mississippi. I'm brother JJ So that was so good, you know, he mentioned that that scripture I don't have it fully memorized, but it says pure religion undefiled as visiting the orphans and taking care of it I don't know if you guys have any more memories than I did, but that's what he was referring to He said, I don't know if y'all know what God said about here pure religion It's really in their distress You know, so think about they're in distress right now and we were able to go out and help people Deliver clean water to the elderly to the widows that were in distress because they couldn't even flush their toilets great now Talk about the water stations. Where are we on that? Yeah, so that's we're really excited about that We just got break through on that a couple of days ago and I actually have a meeting with them today after we get finished with this show There's these water boxes or filtration systems and we're actually partnering We're gonna provide three of them at this time possibly more in the future in Mississippi two of them will be with the Jackson Fire Department So we actually have partnered with the Jackson Fire Department. They just had the They're meeting with the city council that approved getting these boxes put into the fire department because that's one of the stations where people can come And get clean water and they've given out, you know, probably there's been six million Bottles of water or more given out in the past probably more than that actually by now And you think about these plastic bottles too, where are they going? They're going to the landfills and what how do we don't have a good recycling system in Mississippi? So this system allows people to have containers and there's a picture of Lee that we sent you guys of it But they can come and actually yeah, there it is right there come and fill up their containers and Get filtered water and then bring them back to their house and just keep coming back So they'll be regularly scheduled hours that they can go to the Jackson Fire Department And there's also a small town called Mount Bayou, Mississippi. That's a very poor area in Mississippi That we're gonna be providing a water box that had to have a lot of problems with their work These are kind of expensive. We don't normally do too much. We're telling people but I don't we isn't a cut aren't we investing a hundred thousand Dollars in three boxes. Okay. Okay, so that's huge investment and That includes now not only does that include the water box But the place that's hosting it like the the city or the fire department The water bills are covered any increase in their water bills are going to be covered for an entire year All the containers are covered all the training all the filtration systems. Everything is water testing the water testing regularly testing So it's something that we could do as a stopgap measure until they do, you know, it's Lori Dollars that I've actually heard a billion dollars to fix the water system here Really? Yeah a billion with a B. And so it's it's a big deal But you know, I was I was shocked you know, by the way, Elijah streams has done fifty three Wells in Uganda. So wow Over a thousand salvation. Yeah over a thousand now That is church is being planned and lands being given to to churches to plan because of this water It's it's absolutely unbelievable. I didn't realize, you know, I knew there was a problem in Uganda I didn't realize there was a problem here. No, I mean, yeah, we don't think of that. Well when we've been Examining you and us you guys and us guys We've been you know by trying to get some because the Lord spoke to us about Native Americans and and their needs are huge But they tend to be spread out So it's hard to put a central well in one spot because they're mild the summer will live miles away in a massive reservation Plus they you if you don't drill really deep which is really expensive You're gonna get what arsenic and things like that in the water, right? Yeah, there's some of the wells there that we've gotten quotes for over a million dollars for one water well And then you're not even completely sure it's gonna be clean water So it's a there's a lot more to that than just going into a reservation drilling It also takes about five years from what I understand for the entire permit process to get approved So it's very challenging. We are working on a few projects. We could talk about later But we do have a few projects with Native Americans that we're working on Um, that we believe we'll be able to to be doing pretty soon And on the uh, there's words. I'm looking at the note. We're waiting for cat to arrive So we've got a couple of minutes. They'll tell me when she arrives But uh on those water boxes. Did you say how many those will serve or to do or tend to serve? Well, we don't know for sure about a lot of people. I mean, there's still lines of cars everywhere that there's water distribution centers Even still today, there's lines of people waiting and that's just with the government's the government assigned spots There's also many churches and nonprofits that are also doing and so even the other day We were driving to town and we looked over and there was a church or some organization that was providing clean water And it was lines of cars Waiting waiting two and three hours in line to get to water. Well, and that's scripture that I quoted a lot I don't can't remember the exact quote. I've got it on a piece of paper, but I can't reach it But this is where Jesus says Jesus said if you even give so much as a cup of cold water one cup to one of these you'll not Um Lose your reward. Does that apply to the water boxes and the water bottles? Absolutely. Why I mean you're providing clean water, you know And so it's definitely there's a lot of rewards that will not be lost And there's a lot of people that you'll meet in heaven one day that'll be like, thank you for contributing to my clean water And you may be like, what did I do? Well, you sewed into Elijah's streams ministries and they provided a water box in Jackson, Mississippi And I was able to provide clean water for my kids and for my family and I was able to flush my toilets and Just the basic stuff and so yeah, it's it's definitely making a huge impact on people and just the heart behind it That's the other thing. It's like there's the practical aspect of the water but People are constantly asking me why would an organization all the way to organ care about us Right, and that's even more powerful sometimes and I think the physical water just to know that there's people out there that cares, you know And so it was great that we were positioned here in this in this state to be able to help quickly Yeah, and one of the things we've all learned is that you know When we when you agreed to come because you're you're still doing the you've gone to project That's your project with show mercy, but then you're working with us full time as well as As those how those work out you can work at two places full time believe it or not, but We didn't I think my simplistic thinking was we'll come here We'll start identifying the projects and we'll start drilling wells immediately and that was a that was uh an amazing um Learning process for me because I thought well as long as we're willing to pay the project will present themselves And we won't have to work for it, but that wasn't true. So Um, by the way, they're telling me that cat is here now So we're going to go in a second, but I want to thank you guys and honor you guys if we you know We go way back our our daughter used to babysit your daughters and now one's married and one's about to be married. So That's amazing. We you guys we've been at this for what? I said 20 years. We've known you or About 20 years. Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing. But you know, I'm gonna speak on behalf of you guys I I know your lives. I know your commitment. I know your walk with the lord and and I'm just very proud of you and lory. What a great story with the mayor Are you kidding? I mean you said I gotta end with this But you said lord if you want me to give him word, you're gonna have to Sit me down with him. You put your ticket in and it gives you it suddenly changes your seat to the one next to the mayor That's the other thing. I didn't say his seat got changed too. Yeah, really After I told him he said, okay, I have to be honest with you when he pulled out He said my seat got changed as well. Oh, man He knew that he knew and I told him and so it's so fun how god I mean the the the devastation and the hardship that's going right now is terrible But it's so crazy. God is so good to just little bitty things set you up at the right place at the right time I so love that. I so love that. You know, we're told to go out in the highways and byways to compel them to come in And that's where you know, that's literally the highways and byways and another Another part of that says and along the hedges. Well, what is the hedges? Those are where your neighbors next door are looking over the hedges going. What's with these people Go along the hedges and compel them to come in. So I I wrote an article about that one day I said, have you gone compelling lately?

Oh, yeah, it was really awesome and and then of course the meetings We had people come from around the world to the one um that was at their church on mount zine. It was amazing So so good Well cat, let's see. Let me jump into you throw it to you and anything that's on your heart to share right now before We get into questions about heaven and when people ask other questions They're sometimes they're not about heaven, but they're almost all very very very interesting. So So what anything on your heart to share this morning before we get into that? I can just say that that um Sunday morning this last Sunday morning. I did spirit force in a way never done before Really it's so Um, so complete powerful that you leave that you left that meaning knowing exactly who you were in christ Wow, what's your whole salvation experience look like in the spirit realm? What are our weapons that we get is the army of god that the bible clearly says we are in the army of god And it was just really empowering and very very I had said kind of intense, but it was amazing. And so I will thoroughly enjoy doing all my spirit force meetings We'll be doing some more online, but I believe they this I believe if you go back you may be able to watch this one Yeah, that was this last sunday and um Is it go g o m z? I think is g o m z is their website dot or Yeah, g o m z dot organ dot organ or or you can go on gateway on mount zine Facebook or gateway on mount zion's facebook page and uh emily uh or michael one of you could you put that under the Rumble or in the comments. However, you do it Is I knew more of the youtube system than this one But I put it under facebook so people can see that that'd be awesome if we give them that link so Now can I got to ask you a question? Well anything else because I have a question to launch our other questions, but um And it's kind of a blended question. So let me ask it to you this way Um, we get from time to time people say well cat must have lots of new and exciting Experiences, I think you probably when you go there must you must be a little bit surprised each time with something He shows you that you hadn't seen before And has there been anything recently you think boy, I'd like to tell people about that when I was caught up There are things but first of all, I'd like of course to mention queen Elizabeth Okay, and because there's a lot of of course buzz going on about that, you know And I think it probably bothers me personally a little bit that everybody automatically thinks people went to hell I don't know why um, you know, christ is for us. He's not against this and she clearly and I just have to say queen Elizabeth Is in heaven people if she is there and god is giving her rewards because She's had one of the longest running um I can't remember what you think That allowed God in that country Okay, and and talked all the time about jesus christ on every special uh holiday they had she always mentioned to him every single time She had uh like a message to give to her kingdom and the people of uh, england and and the surrounding countries there It was always positive and she didn't just be positive herself She always talked about god. She talked about jesus christ He totally was allowed and because when when you are the head of something and you allow jesus christ As a monarch to come into that country there is no way she's not going to escape being greatly rewarded For for the longevity of her of her monarchy and how much she loved jesus christ So people queen elizabeth is in heaven there. That's the most important thing. I could say today Okay, the controversy was going on. You know, there's always so many things made up about stuff And she didn't have enemies against her because they didn't like it that she Didn't want evil and she didn't want to let certain things to happen in that country So there you are straight from the throne room people queen elizabeth made it to heaven really good Can you can you elaborate on what you said a minute ago? You said I don't I don't know why people always think people are going to help Now you you are one that also believes some people go to hell. I know that So can you elaborate on that? So is it that? Uh, you absolutely know many go to hell But is it that more people go to heaven than most of us think or what? Probably more people go to heaven now than ever before. Okay. It is because of the availability of the word Uh, you know of the message about the the kingdom christ in the kingdom that you talked about that we rule in with them There's so much revelation out there right now There's almost kind of no excuse if you have a computer have any access to a computer People by the millions are looking at people's sites that talk about jesus a lot Even if they don't talk about heaven they want to know about him That's good So I think now more because back way back in those days like in the day of jesus they of course didn't have the internet They didn't have television. They didn't even have radio. That's why he walked over He traveled so much himself to share the kingdom But the news about him still to this day is going around the world And those there are many many many more Millions of believers now than ever before in the world And ministries and places for help that there certainly would be more Um more people going to heaven now than ever before and yes, people do go to hell. They're wicked. They're evil. They hate everything Uh, their soul is so corrupted and they don't want to repent for things. You know, that's their choice Yeah, as the father has shared with me before He doesn't keep people out of heaven and he doesn't send them to hell Because people are always saying, you know, uh, a loving father wouldn't send people to hell He doesn't he gave everything he had to make a way for you to come to heaven. So that's where his love is He loves us so much. He loves the people in the world He even desires that the vial center be free free from what sin Yeah, sin and have his son so they could come to heaven He's just not going to allow heaven to be like the earth. He's just not going to do it He's not willing to pollute heaven to file heaven by people who bring that with them because they carry it and that's how they live So the father actually said tell them it's just just the opposite A loving father would make a way for them to come to heaven and he clearly And so all right by that you mean he didn't send people to hell by that. Do you mean they choose hell themselves? That's what he said. They choose to go there. They make up their own choice in their own will There's a scripture in the bible that says I make myself known to everyone. Yeah, so in their soul in some way He says he makes himself known that means you'll have an opportunity a choice sometime in your life Or he will impress upon you to know him and the scripture is never wrong And I've had a lot of people say I wasn't even thinking about something and sitting where just contemplating all of a sudden The thoughts started pouring into me that I needed to know Jesus Christ And then the love of God would sweep over these people and they would just be convicted And then they would want to know him then they would receive him. So that's how far he goes Yeah, make sure that they know there is a loving God And this whole thing that we're living in and around this world It didn't happen in a big bang people and there's many scientists that know that there was creation Creation did happen and it's even the evidence of even over the ages is very clear even in the foundation of our earth And the way it was made So I know you evolutionists you you would like to think yourself You get to choose everything including where you're going to end up in some wonderful place. There's only two choices There's either Jesus Christ in heaven Or you choose satan who is the lord of the flies and you will be in hell not just hell forever You'll be in the lake of fire forever. So I want to encourage people seeking your own soul What would keep you from wanting to know him? What would keep you from wanting to receive all that that God has for you in heaven and that christ died for you Do you have there's that scripture and I'm sorry part. Sorry that I don't have that reference to it, but it says Uh, it's it's a new covenant scripture. It says this the covenant I'll make with them after that time And It goes on Sorry that I don't have it in front of me, but it says no more will a man say to his neighbor Know the lord for the or his brother know the lord for they'll all know me from the least of the greatest What is that scripture referring to if you know? I'm pretty sure that it's referring to the times because he's talking about a time. There'll be a time that's happened Right, we're entering into that time right now because what he is about to do And there's a lot of people who don't like me talking about they don't like hank robin Johnny they don't like there's people who don't like they think we're rocking the boat No, we're trying to get you in the boat people. Yeah, so that you don't die a horrible a horrible death and end up Throughout eternity. No, we're gonna say the truth prophets a true prophet god will always always speak the words Of revelation from the father from Jesus from holy spirit and the truth is what makes you free Not all these other things that are lies that are deceptions. They don't make you free They control you they keep you trapped and so you need to know the truth so that you will be free And there is a way to be free from evil from from wickedness from hell from Satan ruling over your life Getting caught up in witchcraft or other things And you don't want to live your life like that because this is a very short life But the way you live this life will determine where you end up and there's two places a bend to boat Yeah, you do not want to go to hell When I started getting to know you cat and I've said this on the air once or twice before with you I don't know if you'll remember this may have spent probably a year But I was raised with the fear that my least little stumble. I would not go to heaven now My tradition taught that you don't there's not an eternal hell. You just burn up. That's it But I was afraid to just burn up and that's yeah, I wanted to go to heaven But I felt like I was taught that it would be really easy to be deceived And now I'm on the other side of that. It's on the flip side of that where it's almost like This is just my language not biblical language. It's almost like God's looking for loopholes to get you saved That's how it feels like he's going if I don't get him saved this way I'll get him saved that way and you know, there's that scripture. I think it's Romans 10 9 but we can believes in his heart and confesses with his mouth and Jesus the Lord and and believes that God raised him from the dead from the dead will Be saved so there are people in various stages of maturity or immaturity who we might not even say God, you know, if they died they probably would say They they didn't make it but if if a person in the privacy of their bedroom says, you know what? I think I do believe that I think I do And for the first time he says it in his heart and says it with his mouth And then he dies right after that. He's he's going to heaven. Yes, he is he really is he certainly is going to go to heaven And yes, they're always watching from heaven. And let me tell you a holy spirit is so busy on this earth A holy spirit leads people of he impresses people. He's even these people who are not believers He's still going around those seek seeking for those who might know Christ or want to know Christ They they have so many angels and members of the host the army of heaven whose very Assignment is to lead people to the place where they can hear the truth know the truth or even have them meet individuals Who know answers that they need to know so they can get born again and absolutely? Yes, if the father said he desires That's a strong word. He desires the vilest most evil sinner Be safe because his son paid a price for everybody But they do have to choose and it doesn't matter if it's in the last breath If you did it as a child and you receive Christ in syria And and I tell you I remember when I got born again at age four that never left me I knew that I knew that I knew I was going to heaven at age four. I knew Jesus Christ Wow And so even children very young can fully give themselves to christ and they're raising an atmosphere that's so So bad, you know god will watch over them. It's not like it was me That that was me. I mean I was raised and I gave my heart to the lord very early I was baptized in that almost cult setting But I knew I'd I'd received Jesus christ. I knew about his death on the cross except for that even though there's And then I lived a significant portion of my life after that in all kinds of drudgery I don't and you know most stations and all of that. So you were talking about if somebody Look, I don't know how far to push this question But I mean if there's a current person who's a pedophile and that's during this horrible sin Cat and then they died but if you look back on that person's life when they were a child and they said Jesus I want you Does the lord remember that or did they throw that away in the meantime? What I keep saying he throws it away I know that that stuff would not be allowed in heaven at all And even if was like I said before even at near the death of a person Let's say they haven't died, but they're close to that Even if they're unconscious the holy spirit can speak to those people Wow, and that does happen because we've had people not died. It came so close to death That people thought for sure they would never survive and they came out of that coma or whatever that was And said that they were that they saw Jesus christ. I mean there's testimonies everywhere that happened I know like ian, you know, I always go back to ian who's the one I think he was a surfer Yeah, something like that. Ian, I can't remember. Yeah, I'm like jellyfish and I'm telling you what Jesus pursued him But through that whole time until I think he flatlined He was in the morning in the morgue of the hospital. I think And jesus presented himself caught him up presented himself and said your mother has never stopped praying for yourself And jesus moved his hand in this person who had he died and he saw his mother praying and crying out to god Do not let and she didn't know that he had died people She didn't even know that he was in that situation, but this was her nightly thing that she had prayed god Don't let my son go to hell. Please reach out to him I i'm i'm declaring that he will be in heaven eternity with me And he'll have an opportunity to know you and and in here from you And so because of her prayers, she was a very godly woman He wouldn't let those prayers fall to the ground. So when he flatlined And was actually falling into hell. That's a testimony falling into hell You have to remember that christ has the keys To hell death and the grave those are time frames from the time you are dying and to your death And any of those times if there was somebody like in's mother Who is faithful to him who loved him has served christ and would cry out on his behalf every night It says if you believe in your heart and don't let your words drop to ground She will not let them be wasted. He'll answer that and so that this is this was his answer to ian's mother's prayers And here is this this guy who was actually died flatline. He was in the morning had a tag on his toe And she just said because of your mother And her belief in me her trust and promise in me because of her own declarations I have to i have to take her words and give you an opportunity. Do you want me now? And this person caught up in the spirit somewhere not actually in in heaven This was outside of heaven, but it was still up in the spirit realm And he said, um, do you want me now and this guy began to weep and weep and say i'm not worthy of you I don't deserve this, you know, I was wicked and jesus kept saying yes, but your mother I can't let her words fall to the ground my word gives a promise And so he said Well, then he said of course. Yes, I will receive him. He really then he really started crying And i think christ reached out and touched him. He said life like he never felt before Because he remember he said he received christ life slowed into his body and he was so on fire uh for christ and He he was totally changed in that moment And jesus said now Do you want to go with me and he moved and he could see heaven behind christ And his hunger was so great for that. He said do you want to go with me now or you want to go back And ian was really struggling. He says, you know, I want to come so much But if I went now my mother would not know I went to heaven. So please send me back christ sent him back He came back into his body the dead body in the morgue He was looking over him about to do an autopsy And and the guy freaked out the the doctor freaked out and he goes, why are you alive? Sits up totally whole like he never died He goes, I have to find my mother and the guy goes, don't you go anywhere? And so this doctor runs out ian runs down the hall Because he probably had his wrappings on or whatever and he finds an outfit I think it was some Some kind of output, you know, uh like a doctor's assistant or something And he puts it on runs out of the hospital and goes to his mother And she was so undone What christ had done because of her prayers and ian goes all over the world right now And actually gives this personal testimony. These are those are the very words he spoke and because of his uh Because of his mother and what she believed and stood for him And he had been angry also one of the other things about ian is he got really angry about somebody Didn't want to forgive them either. So christ said you have to forgive that person So he did forgive that person and this is when he was in his spirit body So don't ever think that christ can't do something If you're standing for your family's salvation, I know the very first time I was caught up to heaven And christ when he was bringing me back said please tell everybody never stop praying For their loved ones salvation because I will be listening That's so easy. He actually had the keys. He was wearing the keys right then and he showed me these keys He said these keys don't hang on a hook in heaven He said uh, when you die, there's a judgment that comes it says can can you be taken to heaven or not taken to heaven And he has opportunity if there are people standing in in agreement or they're they're Declaring that their family members are those who they call family members people who they love like family. Yeah to Um that they will not miss heaven then christ has the right Because of our declarations Are we're standing what we're believing for? And then he has the right to use those keys and I've I've since I was shown that I've heard so many testimonies Just come in saying You know, I was one of those people I died or right at my death christ appeared to me And ask if I wanted him and so it is true that really does happen Can I ask you a question about the non-loved ones that but they're people who? For instance Ruth Bader Ginsburg died as far as anyone that I know knows she never received the lord It was totally pro-abortion, but a lot of people I'm aware of have prayed had prayed for her for years and years and years What couldn't you say about that? Sort of thing this guy'd say look all these people have been praying for you I have to give you one more chance that kind of thing I haven't seen her in heaven that doesn't mean she's not and I understand what you're talking about There are groups actually that um that christ or holy spirit encourage people to start these groups There is a group of believers very strong Intercessors who really know christ and have prayed in different moves of god and everything They have a list of celebrities in hollywood probably close to 50 years Wow Without fail have prayed for every one of these people and I did see some of those people Because I met someone who was a part of that group and I was I was just overwhelmed at their Their fierceness to have these people have christ have opportunities to receive christ They were they actually stood there's something about standing in the gap Yeah, that's another thing also that allows them to use if there's some standing in the gap Especially if it's a prayer of agreement, especially if it's a group and that's what they do and have focused themselves to do that Then those people will be given an opportunity also. That's so good that you said that because last night, okay cat You didn't know that I had this experience, but last night I'm praying alone Either that or early this morning one of those two Kind of runs together, but I started that scripture came to me where jesus said so I looked for a man To stand in the gap so that I would not have to bring judgment I don't have that one memories either, but I said lord you only needed one man Or one woman to stand a gap and at that point he said so but I found then so I then I swear by myself that But uh, so he there are major issues and people's lives Where all god needs is one person to stand in the gap Yes, that true It is true. It is very true But because there's there's different there's different things that make it possible for him to use those keys Yeah, and even for the the keys and all that other stuff came up even before all that happened And we know in the bible how many were just one that prayed for whole cities to be saved you know and that And uh, I and I do know that that happened also and yeah And god had mercy on people because that one person's staying and stood in the gap and said please don't kill them Please allow them to live for the purpose of having an opportunity He did it back in the old testament and that's before christ came And god god himself had mercy on people So now with christ and his sacrifice is made and I am serving not in any way saying Everyone's going to be in heaven. That is not going to happen. Right. That's right. I don't hear you say because I've clarified that Will be in heaven that would not have been there Except that he had the chance to use these keys and I'm telling you I've saw hell And I don't talk about it a lot because in these days I mean he doesn't want me to talk a lot about that He wants me to encourage people get people empowered to know who they are in christ because some people They don't even have a clue what they carry in their self as a believer and what god has given them as a believer And I think that meaning I did a spirit force this last sunday Absolutely tells you what it means to be a believer. It's very very powerful I wasn't expecting them to say all that that I said I thought we'd have maybe a 30 40 minute meeting and it was far beyond that But people were weeping in the in the con in the conversation. They were they were laughing. They were weeping They were so empowered and found out things they never knew about their self being a believer But if you're going to be operating in spirit force, you have to know what is that? What is that spirit force? What does it mean? What what does it give us to be able to do for christ and with christ? Then you have to know who you are first before you can even start I mean if you're in the military Let's just say the military because we are in god's army. I'm not talking about heaven's army at all the host They were made for that purpose but ourselves as a believer We do have promises That christ gave us about who we are and the authority we had the dominion we have And and that we had power over the enemy so many scriptures and those people got a lot of those scriptures And so but it was very powerful that for the first time they knew who they were in christ And they had no fear about anything. They knew they had a story how to use that a story It was an amazing meeting So it matters that you make a difference in this world By by sharing things with people by loving people caring about people And yet you cannot partake of the darkness if you can speak to people and it's not really a wise Decision to have a very close friend who is wicked and evil you will not win them just because you're their friend And most of the time the opposite thing happens. It really does It just has just the way it is That if you're not a strong believer yourself and you're saying well, I'm going to keep this friend I'll keep talking to them about christ. I'm not saying don't do that But I'm saying as your best friend It is wise to have someone as a believer Or if you could partner with you in prayer maybe go out with you to to witness and stuff like that Well, that's that whole scripture about don't be unequally yoked, right? It can it can apply to marriages It can apply to friendships. It can apply to business Yeah, yeah, really really good cat awesome You know and I the whole thing that got Ian guy that story we've talked about it before several times it never gets old to me because God is by that testimony God himself of course knew this was going to be a worldwide testimony at the moment He was doing it. He knew that because why don't you want that as a testimony because he wanted praying mothers and sons and daughters and sisters and brothers to know you can stand for A person and he will absolutely he had the keys of hell death in the grave You said he had him in his hand Yeah, and and you can say to the lord I mean I with that I might say If I had a loved one that I as far as I knew had never received christ and now he's in a coma and dying I would say Jesus you have the keys to the hell death in the grave. I'm standing for this I'm believing I'm trusting you for this person salvation. They didn't want it with their life, but trust me in my heart I know they want it now. You know, I guess I'd pray along that line right anything else You would be a perfect thing to say to christ He's waits for words like that to be spoken He really waits for people to say things like that And you know, you know, you have friends you have family We jokingly used to call them the black sheep. I don't know people What is that? Yeah, I was about being involved in darkness and stuff and it's hard to be around them But you love them. Yeah, that's the best thing you can do is just stain them the gap and even say you need to I would say that say father Jesus, I'm standing in the gap for this family member. This is their name That I don't want to see them go to hell. I want them to see To receive jesus christ, please and thank you for making that possible Before they pass and go go to hell, you know, make sure that they get to do that Yeah, and they actually write that down. They'll write it down and they're gonna go after that person I'm telling you, they'll go after them while they're living and even at their very death Uh at that time when he can use the keys. He uses the keys Almost at the point of death or right past death people go. Well, that's not possible. Well, you're not god Yeah And you can make that either so don't say that you know things when you don't know anything about it I mean, he wouldn't have the scriptures that stand stand with that that practice to love people to pray for them And that you wouldn't want to see them go to hell and yes, he will because your words allow him To use those keys By satan satan had him so nobody could use them and i'm not making that up either satan had those keys And there was a time back in the now when he would just go take anybody out He wanted to you need to you need to hear both sides of those keys Why did christ take them? Why did he take them back? Why did he take them away from him? Because those were there's those were made for a certain specific reason to have but there's authority in those keys And but to get those keys back he had to die as a righteous person This had to happen so that he would go into hell and he would be blameless He would be righteous. They gave him every authority To take those keys away from satan who had no right for them But satan takes advantage of anything he can do He'll lie to you if you can to see if you can He'll do anything he can to you and get away with it for a long time But in these days people are getting more and more aware. I'm not having a part of that I'm not participating in that evil or that wickedness. I'm having no part of it. I serve Jesus christ and I serve him alone Um, the enemy doesn't want to hear words like that coming from you But he really doesn't like it that he lost those keys and he can in no way interfere with christ using them I just have to point out to you those keys are real and they do give christ The ability to go even at the moment of death or as someone is falling into hell or they're being buried Yeah, I mean what what that's real that story indicates because you know I was drilled in is drilled into me as a kid. It's appointed unto men. What's to die and after that the judgment So they would say This is not possible. I can hear Ian say yeah, we'll take that up with God because Because they would say at the moment of death that's it the scripture says is appointed man Uh, uh, you know once to die and after that judgment. Well the death process can christ use the keys people That's good. That's really good The great white throne judgment. I can even tell him if they would read the bible There's two judgments mentioned. Okay. This is like at the end of so at the end of someone's life They died. Okay, they died There's a great white throne judgment. That's for the wicked and the dead in hell Okay, and they're all taken out of hell at one time when time is going to be no more They'll all be taken out of hell and they'll stand in this long line before the father's throne the father's throne and uh And then is that at that time is you clearly see these are all of your sins This is why you're not allowed into heaven He's actually going to show you all that and then you'll be thrown into the lake of fire at that time Okay, so that's at the end of time. That's that judgment. That's at the very end of time There's another one called the judgment seat of christ. That's not about sin Okay, that's not about your sin. You're in heaven. You've been living in heaven But time is coming almost to an end when we won't need time anymore We'll still exist and we'll always be the christ But it does say in the bible you'll be judged for every wasteful word Okay, this is in heaven in heaven towards the end of this time when before the new earth is made This will happen. But the other thing that you'll be judged for the judgment seat of christ is Did you ever accomplish what he asked you to do like if he called you know, this is an actual calling And you totally ignored and you knew in your heart you were supposed to be a certain something It could be and it could be a bill where you decided to be a pastor But that's not what you were called to do or you were uh, you were you were a builder You chose that over being a pastor. That's what you'll be judged for Did you do what christ asked you what you how does that judge when you say judge again? The old me would have said if i'm going to enter into that kind of judgment and god's going to judge me It sounds like okay now i'm going to not be saved anymore, but that's not what you're saying No, no, i'm not saying that the judgment seat of christ are for believers Yeah, who are in heaven right that doesn't take away your spell So what is the judgment? Do I get okay? I'm just going to be silly about do I get demerits? Did they take one of the rooms off my mansion? What? No, no, no that's not what that's about okay people Rewards are given for what you do in your life Like if you just help people love people you're getting rewarded for if you give them kind words If you give them something to eat if you get the money to have food Those are some of the greatest things you do and you'll get a great reward for that I know you're not doing it for that reason. I mean i've done it my whole life my dad taught us to do that And I never once thought wow i'll get a great reward. I thought i'm so happy that I fed someone who was hungry I helped to feed their family to me. It's one of the greatest blessings I can do For the lord, but then there's people who continually decide in their flesh In other words, this is your own opinion or this is what you want And yet there's something very much so that christ needs you to do and you know this you know what you know You know that you were called to do something. No, this is going to be much easier over here. I'm gonna choose this. I'll choose this This is what happens. Okay. You don't get any reward. This is about rewards Okay, you won't get any reward for the thing you chose You're not going to get any and it says in the bible. You will see before yourself them burnt up the rewards And and I clearly know I know they're not even know I was called to be a photographer That's my gift. That's the thing he put in me. That's my passion to do. I've known it my whole life That thing gives me the greatest blessing and I'm excellent at it. I mean my photographs are beyond imagination Even in this natural realm And I don't use one of those cameras that do everything for you. I have the kind where you adjust every single thing on that camera You couldn't ate that photograph And from the time I was a little girl, I would make little boxes into cameras and my mama finally gave me her brownie camera I was beyond excited, you know, we didn't have the money back then to get things like that But so that my whole passion my whole life was to be a photographer and I didn't make money off of it I did it for free for I did I did like weddings. I did all kinds of things I did like weddings. I did all kinds of things I it's my passion That gift I use all the time That is one of the biggest blessings number one the gift he made you Whether it's the best baker or the best builder or the best singer or whatever it is That thing he put in you. He sends this as gifts every good imperfect gift what comes down from the father of Like us that's him sending us to this earth for that purpose because when you go to heaven You're going to use that very gift. He made you in heaven. So that's that's one thing. Okay But a call on your life That he has for you and you know that call and someone even does I feel like that you're supposed to you know And sometimes it isn't the five fold ministry Sometimes it's not it's not necessarily in the actual ministry But it's something to do with that and God wants you to do that and you know yourself and he's told you several times That's way too hard. I just think it's going to take too much and there's people that say that That that they don't love Christ. They just think their way is better. In other words, they want his will their way Not his will his way And so there will be people who will be feared and that this is the thing At the end of the bible in the book of revelations it talks about the judgment seat of Christ And it says he will wipe away all tears. That's good. There you go people You will if you did not Take the call he gave you that he really needed you to go on the earth He won't take away your mansion. He won't take you your place out of heaven. He won't take he won't do that But it clearly says and it causes the judgment seat of Christ and Christ will make that decision He'll show you and he will show you You these are the believers. Okay, this is what I called you to do. You knew you heard me You knew I really need to do that and yet you said no I'm going to do this instead and you said no. I'm going to do this instead You don't you won't lose your place in eternity. You won't that's not what he's talking about But the rewards you would have gotten for doing what he called you to do Would have been so much greater than what you chose to do and you may have helped people and that was nice and wonderful But that wasn't what he called you to do And then the gifts that you would have gotten But you can't you can't get him now because you didn't fulfill this other thing You said in the past many times and it's hard for in our flesh, it's certainly hard for me to See god, let's say that I went there and there were certain rewards that he showed me. I'm not going to get I it seems like as much as I was so grateful that I'm still in heaven I'm he's not it seems like I would have regret and yet you said there's no regret in heaven So I don't know like like I said those aren't sins People would have regrets for their sins. They may these are not about sins people. This is all about a reward And you can think of it this way you worked for a business all the heavens not a business It's the best way to describe the people if you worked in the business and you were hired to do a specific job And you yourself decided in your own self and this is like let's say this is a huge company a corporation You hired a significant job to be over something that was so important for the whole company And you go, you know, I just I don't think I like that. I'll do that later I do it later. Do you never do it? You actually do other things within the company that let makes you look busy and stuff do you think The person who owns that company they won't fire you necessarily but you think they're gonna be happy with you if these were things that you said I I'm gonna do this is what I've been hired for this I know this is what I was called doing this company and you didn't do it It's sort of the same thing in a different scale that they couldn't reward or give you what you would have had Had you completed what you were asked to do and there's a lot of people who do that in business too because I've been in business a long time But in heaven in Christ, he knows your life He knows knew you before you were born He saw you inside the father's your little spirit of life He knew you then and he knew things you were going to be asked to do and he was sending you for a certain specific purpose But you yourself that's called deeds done in the flesh So let's just say that's what this is about. It's about deeds done in the flesh That means your own mind decided you're a believer and you love Christ, but you just add in your own mind I have a right to do this instead. You know, I'm happy doing this more than this That's what I'm talking about and yeah, there's many people do that But and I'm not saying in every way. I was perfect, but probably for the last 50 years I have on purpose focused on what I was asked to do no matter what it was If it was even if it was hard, it didn't matter to me. I focused to myself. I'm going to please him I've read the please him then please myself Yeah, the when you talked about christian photography and I can relate to that because I was a photographer I I was a people photographer and I did weddings too. So I relate to that dream was the nature photographer is You know, she had an eye for that that I just don't seem to have but I could do portraits You know to you know, at least back then before Some of the more modern ideas came by But that's a very how do I say this? That's a very Unspiritual, unreligious gift Are you saying that? By that example, uh, are you indicating that almost all of the gifts are non spiritual non religious? Are there some people whose gift was specifically spiritual? How would you define it because that's a very secular gifted most all of the gifts? Yeah, I'm not talking about we're not talking about anointing. Okay, you're talking about Callings or anointing. I'm not talking about like you're anointed to preach. Yeah for healing and stuff like that Uh, that's an assignment you have because there is no five-fold ministry in heaven. That doesn't even go to heaven It doesn't go to heaven It doesn't mean you won't be rewarded for obeying god for those calls Those are very important calls the five-fold ministry very important on the earth But the gift i'm talking about is a natural gift He gave you that when you go to heaven you will use that gift to bless everybody That's how heaven operates. He made heaven to operate that way He knew that he gave enough gifts to people like, you know, you you make great food You design things that people love and can have a good time in Or um, it's all kinds of things that you need normally in your life or would enjoy in your natural life So i'm not talking about any kind of spiritual gift. Yeah, we're talking about natural gifts every good and perfect gift Okay, I could this one Cat the one the one that I a particular gift that I A particular gift that I had I don't know if it's if it's in this category, but even as a child as I as Newspaper route and I would make money. It was a thing with me. I didn't do it for reward. I didn't even know if I was being noticed I would give Gifts I'd buy disney that tickets. I went in a contest and I give it I had a gift of giving and I've always Pursued that is that any where is that on that kind of spectrum as far as gift? I would have to say that absolutely is a gift Steve because everybody does not think that way Okay, and my family was raised that way Any way you can help any way you can bless people, you know, we're here to bless people for christ But that is that is a gift To me it's like a pleasure to be able to help people with money I love to do that and I do majorly do that help individuals help families And it says it's more blessed to give than receive And I understand that it is a blessing to give but that is like a gift that is sort of like a gift Because not everybody wants to do that and there's some people who even cause treasure chest In the back of treasure chest that you have goods or you have ways to have goods But you use that to bless people you don't have to give all your money away and there's nothing wrong with having good things By the way, you need to know that If you earn in your life and you do and and take in money and well, there's nothing wrong with you having things Okay, god's not against that it gives you great things in heaven, but don't let them have you or control you Yeah, I think where I realized there was something about it It took me years to ponder that part of my life even my childhood Because I'm thinking the one that keeps coming to mind is the one where I earned worked really hard One of sales contests and then gave these Disneyland tickets that were expensive for the day, you know to my Yes, mother's sister-in-law or something. It was in their family. They were so so poor I I completely utterly Forgot about it because I would do that all the time I wouldn't and then I would about the time she was close to death She said I'll never forget what Steven gave me Disney that I guess that I go I did and then my mother reminded me I go. Oh, yeah, so it was like it was so natural to do it. I I've never even thought about it again It was very major for them and you touched the heart of some people and And they love that in heaven when anyone does that it doesn't matter who you are They love that and I'm telling you you're gonna get rewarded for that Since we're talking sort of like rewards and rewards aren't you don't do things to get the rewards That you're you cannot escape getting them. Yeah, it's a father's delight to bless you for all that you've done for him on behalf of him Helping people loving people caring people just caring for people Comforting people when they lost somebody in being kind These are things that maybe you don't think of as important, but they're important. Yeah. Well, I like that's that's I know That's going to touch a lot of people because there's a whole bunch of givers. I know because they give to us You know here at this ministry There's a big group of givers and I keep reminding people even if you give so much as a cup of cold water Which people when they give to these wells, you know, God's gonna remember that but Yeah, the rewarded is the reward itself was the giving that's where you know if your heart's right if it feels so good to give That's what you say, but you get a lot more than that in heaven And I'm not saying that I'm not bragging or anything. I'm just saying I've seen people get the rewards at the throne And uh, some from the father some from christ But the judgment seat of christings that people don't understand is is great when you have revelation on the word to explain the revelation Yeah, the pointer on the man wants to die And then the judgment well, that's clearly not the judgment seat of christ sets at the end of time It's not the great white dome judgment. That's what that's past all of that. So what judgment is it? Yeah No, when you die it says what it's a point on anyone's to die and at that moment. There is a Salvation that's heaven itself. That's that's a judgment is the judgment is are you going to heaven? Are you here in heaven? Do they can they use the keys to go to to meet with you and ask you do you want to receive christ? So that is what that scripture means the pointer on the man wants to die and Elijah and you know We we know that Elijah and Nina didn't even need that they didn't have to die Yeah, because of what they did for god He decided to take them to take them to heaven, but I'm telling you there's they are watching us all the time They're praying over us. They're encouraging us They're sending words to us through people or through holy spirit or even through angels sometimes and god does everything He can to reach people But I do know I love the scripture says That god makes himself known to every man. That means man woman. He makes himself. That's really good to know That's really good. So people but don't stop praying for your family or your loved ones or those who are life friends Or if you're in a group that's praying for a specific group And and there are many people praying for different groups who don't belong to christ right now And and and god will reward them for that, but it's important to know that that can happen I'm really really good. Well, let me get let's hit a few more questions here Um, these are actually all this is just you and me talking this whole time, which has been very delightful You know, I can hear you know, steve. I can hear I can hear people at the same, but what about heaven? What about heaven? What's going on heaven? What does heaven do? I can see people saying that out there Yeah, that's true. You they're pulling uh Okay. Well, here's a question that involves, you know, because I was never taught about three different judgments I'm still trying to get it in my head. So here's a similar thing about Where does what take place? So joe joe's the end if I'm saying that right joe's the end joe's the end Uh, we regarding the new heaven and the new earth. She can't mention how people in heaven will all be moving to the new earth So does that mean that heaven will be emptied of humans and also I'm so reading all all the wonderful things that she has seen in heaven Like the crystal sea are all those things also going to be On the new earth or do we get to go to heaven and see them? So how does that all work? That was an excellent question. I'm very excited. That's a lot, but I can answer all that And um, I just want to remind people that we are going to have a new he says there will be a new heaven and a new earth Okay, I do know yes the the current heaven, which is a spiritual world It's not a physical world people that is the father's house. It's where he has always been. That's why it's called his house He is willing to make a new earth Much more massive than this earth. I've had he's taken me to me glimpses of of this new earth It will be one mass. We'd be glam ass and one massive ocean Now I said it says in the bible. There'll be no more seas The seas on this earth separate the land masses. Did you not know that? Okay? There is the ocean the major ocean, but there are seas that come off of that And the seas separate land masses. That's why it's called the seas They won't need seas in in heaven in the new heaven because I mean the new earth Because it's one lay a mess with one massive water around it, but it will be a huge land mass And of course the crystal sea will always be where we're at because it flows from the father himself It comes from him. So wherever he is wherever he makes worse that will be where the source of water Okay, so there's one answer there will be an ocean on the new earth there will be it'll be much bigger than this this earth here and Uh, I have to just say what the scripture says go to the end the bible people He's going to it's going to be rolled away. It's going to be taken away And he'll make a new heavens the planets will be different. I've seen a few of those really Yes, I've seen those and the father himself Will leave probably be possibly the last person to leave His house because he's moving to the new one which will be the new earth will be our house It'll be ours and his together. It'll be all ours together It's not like we're just moving somewhere that belongs to him. It's going to be ours He is willing to leave that place He's always been in to move and be with us forever and ever ever on the new earth And it will never pass away the new earth will never pass away and the heavens heavens says it will be new And I will explain to you why because when it was made It was it was stretched out and it says it was stretched out. Christ was the word Made it the father spoke, you know, the physical realm and and so the christ the word Stepped out of the father and made that and what he did because there's a place in heaven where everyone goes all your family members Have already been there. They get to watch how they made it Not having itself because it always existed But when they made the physical realm in the beginning In the beginning means in the beginning of time. That's actually what that means It doesn't mean the beginning of things existing because they always existed father son, holy spirit Melchizedek the the forliving creatures the 24 hours have always existed In heaven a spiritual world. These are all spiritual beings It doesn't mean they don't have a body that just means that they lived in a whole realm Different from ours and that's the only realm there was So within this spiritual realm the word Jesus christ made a physical realm area So that father could send us from himself to a physical earth and exist there and have a body We didn't have this body when we were in him. We were just our spiritual body was little little thing inside him living in him playing in him And so he made this decision We're going to make a physical world and a physical realm that will support that world And we will stretch it out so the word steps on him and stretches out literally Almost looked like almost like a big scroll and he stretched it out like this around a great part of the cosmos And that was within that frame of where he made all that all the planets We currently see now the telescopes is part of that physical realm and and it operates in the physical He made this beautiful place. They started putting the planets out there the stars out there The nebula they call that space art and I do too like there's a big eye There's beautiful things out out in space just floating It's really like space dust that doesn't just on its own fucking the different beautiful things They make it. It's like their art that they gave us out there Those are all physical round things and so he captured he'll keep the physical realm Until He sends the last one from himself to be born Uh on this current earth that we're in now. So nothing's passing away now There's going to be no blowing up the planet. Everybody thinks it's going to happen now It's not going to happen now. We haven't even done the things Christ said we could do And so there's still several hundred years I don't know the exact date But there's at least probably a couple hundred years left in the physical realm to operate to have babies to do things and stuff Like that and for some time after this whole thing changes And trust me it's changing because god's not done with this planet. Okay. The lord made it It's his this is the earth is the lord's and the fullness there of belong to him They don't belong to any group not democrat or republican Not not evil or good. It doesn't belong to them. It belongs to him And the father has a time line of events Behind his throne embedded in the floor and there's things on there that have not happened yet And we're not going anywhere until they're done with it So there's still a lot for us to do here But the physical realm was created on purpose so we could have a body that we could know christ receive him and then Live in eternity with him So when the last one is sent from the father and that baby is born Time will be no more. This is at the tribulation at the end of tribulation during the millennial reign People still have children so it's all the way through the millennial reign the thousand year reign of christ that that makes you happy for me to say that There'll still be children born So the earth isn't going anywhere right now But when god is ready And that last child that he sent from himself is born in the physical realm Time will be no more. That means we will be in eternal in eternity We don't need a clock and calendar to go by to live by and we won't need this physical realm It will be blended it will be blended so that in your physical body you can love Enjoy and live your life and do amazing things. We can still visit the father the throne room will still be on the new earth It talks about the new city a new city through some on the earth And it will be much much bigger than it is now. So don't worry about what happens between the time He rolls away the old stuff like it says When he rolls it all away and puts it or does away with it if he has to hold us in his hand He will so in heaven and then when he makes the new earth and he puts us on the new earth first That's what's gonna happen We will be here first on the new earth all of us together We see christ and then the father will step on the new Jerusalem and you can see it coming down from the heavens on the new earth And then we will live an eternal life that will be so amazing and beautiful and creative And exciting and adventurous and we'll be with them. We'll all be together forever forever. Let me ask some follow-up questions on this on the spiritual Place of heaven It's a spiritual place and then we're gonna one day get in the new heaven and new earth where god will come Um, okay, so right when our family those who have a precedence are there in a spiritual place There are spiritual beings out there waiting for their physical body then but jesus is in heaven and he has a Physical body right now right so then when there's a new heaven and new earth And we get physical bodies to inhabit the new heaven and earth The new heaven and new earth is a physical place and from that point on Jesus will continue to be a physical Person and then the father comes down and lives as what a spiritual being on a physical plane You're really deep you're a deep person. Yeah, I tend to you're deep, buddy. You're I just gotta know that I've wanted to ask that for a very long time The spirit realm would be done away with it. I I mean here one the physical realm as we know it now everything on this earth is only physical everything the atmosphere is all physical It will be the spirit realm That of course the spirit realm we've all received christ who lived there who are with him Had the ability to live in the spirit realm likely did in the physical realm and so That's the way it's going to be because the spirit realm has always existed the spiritual realm Which we call the unseen realm, but I see the unseen realm all the time So I know a lot about how they operate what it looks like and things like that And he only made the physical realm So we could come down here and have a body and then through our eternity It's just wonderful to have a physical body and that physical body Like enic and an Elijah who live in a spiritual world with their physical body. They look really good I've seen both of them. They look great in that spirit realm. The father just keeps him and he can he allows or permits them to Remain there. They don't age. They don't get sick or anything. They look amazing We are glorified spiritual bodies Can operate and live in a spiritual realm Like we did in the physical realm like when I say that you walk on the ground You pick things you can eat stuff you can do things with people that are fun and exciting to do You still do that now in heaven in your spiritual body But the new earth The new heavens and the new earth will still be spirit realm But but with the ability for people with a physical body to live and exist in there You won't get married. You won't have children don't want that make you unhappy. You'll be very happy. Trust me You'll be happy to be there But that's what uh, that's what the end looks like the end of time When he says the end he means the end of time having to keep track of everything You only have so many hours. You're awake so many hours. You sleep Uh, you know, I never get tired in heaven now when I'm caught up in the spiritual body But I'm never tired in heaven. And so I don't need to rest. Um, nothing wears me out. I'm not tired It's just a different way of life. It seems like the way you describe it cat It kind of seems like You know six one half dozen the other so your spiritual being in heaven it feels like you're physical When you become down in physical being in the new heaven and earth it feels like you're It feels sounds like it feels the same either way It sounds like it's kind of the same in a spiritual world in your spiritual body Yeah, you walk through the doorways. Yeah Falls you can eat the fruit do everything that's in the spiritual world because you're in a A your spirit your spirit man is living there. Your body is what is resurrected Your soul never sleeps people. That's not right. They don't know what they're saying. I'm I'm not making fun of them They just don't have a revelation. Yeah But your spirit man and your soul Never have to sleep. They're both spiritual things You couldn't look inside a person to see their soul But I know what one looks like because he showed me a human soul And I understand how it operates and why it's important to guard it And not let wickedness and evil and darkness and it's important to keep that soul Uh, you know focused on him and and not let the darkness in you or Phil would light yourself as a believer You want to keep that light getting brighter, which it does but on the new earth We've already had the resurrection happen The resurrection has happened the resurrection of the dead has happened that will happen at an appointed time On this physical earth everyone who's died that belongs to Jesus christ Their physical body is coming back It's going to come back. You'll get it back people It'll be it'll be put together with your spirit man If you've been living in heaven, it's going to be put together with your spirit man And then it's called you'll be glorified, which means you can never get sick. You can never die You'll never sin. These are for people who know christ and you will be like that for all eternity So there's still different processes. We have to go through who are here But it clearly says in the day the dead in christ shall rise That is your body Because your spirit man with your soul have been living in heaven You're in you cannot separate a soul You can't take a soul out of your spirit. You just can't do it. Yeah The way it's made but your spirit man it says, you know, it clearly says to be absent from the body That means you die Your your spirit man was taken out of your body with your soul in it and it was taken to heaven This body dies, but it says the dead in christ. That's your body shall rise one day When that happens, all of our bodies will come up your spirit man will actually go into the grave How about this it goes in gets that body and it blows up that grave no matter where you are Whether you're in an urn or whether you're in the grave you're going to come out of that and And that will be a sight to see I think it'd be one of the most exciting things that will be happening One day when the dead in Christ shall rise that means you're going to get your body back and you look really good people They'll know you're you it says you will be known as you were known on the earth that says that in the bible So if you were a male, you'll still look like a male a much better one If you are female that doesn't change you rise from the dead you get your body back You're still going to be you people will recognize and know you So don't let people tell you other things. I'm going by what the word says And when people go and when you go to be with the lord one day and other people go to be with the lord You're going to be a like a 20 or 30 something looking One woman. Yeah, and we'll but will people look at you and go. Oh, there's cat Yes, and how will they recognize you? Will your hair be pink? How will they how will people know that's cat? I mean this the answer to this question is the answer to every other question related to Well, there's something probably you're you're not considered People in heaven are known for more than just their physical appearance. Okay Everybody puts out a frequency. You know, everyone in heaven knows exactly what I'm talking about You have your own frequency that is You comes out from you no matter where you go on heaven people can feel Or hear that coming before you ever come in heaven. You're walking on having people go cats coming I can feel I can feel her frequency and and this is a true thing that happens in heaven So maybe you didn't know you have a frequency right now coming out of you. You can't hear or see it Uh, but it's amazing just just to be able to do that. So people will know you first by that Wow And then when they see you they're gonna go well, you know enough people have seen me on there It's already and uh, but people will watching from heaven right now. They'll watch me from heaven sometimes when I'm speaking They want to see what I'm going to say is wild But some people will like to watch certain people who do things that uh on the earth They want to hear what words are going to speak for christ or what miracles are going to happen and stuff like that Or what will people learn? So when you get to heaven people still want to know you they've never met you Oh, come on and they'll have meetings where you share your testimonies. Really? It's amazing People are interested even now in your we like to know and hear about people and that doesn't matter What arena that is in they want to know they want to know about you and they like personal stories to be told from the platform They love it when I talk about my family They wild stuff the crazy stuff really good. I mean, yeah hear about it So, uh, even in heaven they want to know you in here care about so what we think of is Getting together and catching up on the news. It's not it sounds like it's not unlike that in heaven Hey, come and tell us what you did in your life. They want to catch up, right? Is it similar? Something like that only mostly they just want to know you don't want to hear what you have to say Yeah, how did you feel when that happened? Where did you think when christ did that for you? When you lived on the earth at that time wasn't that amazing what happened? They talk about things like you like maybe things in history or stuff like that Uh, they don't ever discuss evil wicked things. Nobody even thinks about that anymore So they're not going to talk about that part of your past They don't they don't do that But the fun exciting things everybody does and they just want to revive you even the disciples will want to know you The prophets will want to know you Even if you want to profit they want to know certain things that you did in your life to help people of Or just things that happened in the first of that time one last question one last question about if So dureen and I let's say we're we're both Graduated to heaven and our kids are still here And then our grandkids are still here and from time to time we Would probably see their special events probably at the same time dureen and I would probably see them at the same time Yes, we list they've been different but let's say They're cousins or whatever are there situations where someone will say well What's new with your kids on the earth and we catch them up of what we just saw was So and so just had a baby. Is that kind of thing go on in heaven? Were you catching that part? Yes, about family relations and stuff like that people want fellowship I mean people like fellowshiping here If you're in the right groups of people in fellowshiping it can be a wonderful thing But everybody fellowships in heaven they go, what do we do besides they thought all we would do was just bow down Right, there's many things where worshiping is bowing down. It's a lot more than just bowing on Everything you do in heaven you will thank him because he made it for us to enjoy Or gave us the ability to be together and do things together You never stop. It's kind of it's called a lifestyle of worship you worship all the time all over heaven You know for everything and it just automatically comes out of you and so it's not like down to the earth That you have to come to one building at a certain time of the week and that's the only time I never stop worshiping him. I never stop talking about him or talking to him If I'm by myself if I'm just anywhere I do that so and having that would be normal to me And that's what people do mainly they talk about christ the things christ did the revelation they get from him when he when they get up there And they get to meet him. There's just a lot of fellowship There's a lot of events that the father plans for all of us and having to be together and do it together There's things he plans just to do with you or christ do with you So it's not like it's a boring place. There's nothing boring about it. I was like, yeah, that's amazing Okay, a lot of things together and having they really do still do things together They do really really really really good. So good stuff. I never get tired of learning more about heaven You can probably tell Uh, well tell people we've got revealing heaven calm and cat curd calm I always like to have you kind of recap what people can get there They keep you busy. I'm sure they're good at your website and Yeah revealing heaven comm is where um our our store is it's where our events calendar is And I think there's testimonies on there that people give and there's a few other things that you can learn and watch There's a lot of things that you can click. I didn't design it. I don't uh I don't even know how any that I don't know anything about wi-fi sci-fi maybe more than wi-fi. I don't know but but I know heaven fi a lot I'm really good at knowing that understanding that but so the revealing heaven comm is for that Okay, we have a corporation god told us to have a corporation He wants us to create things that represent heaven things that are in heaven Like some of the things the white people wear uh things that they would have in their mansions We're going to have a whole new list over the next year and a half probably We'll have a home decor stuff that if you come in you'd think you were in heaven Nice He really wants that to happen. He wants that to happen on the earth And his point is satan has made all kinds of things that people wear they use They talk about they play with it. They probably shouldn't play with he said he wants stuff Related to heaven that people can hold they can wear they can use they can sit on Uh things in the wall that we'll talk to you about heaven The carpeting will say things to you when you walk on it We're going to have use light a lot because light's one of the main sources of things being built in heaven Or designed in heaven is with light. You're going to see that happen all over the world By the way, that's how this is going to happen in the new witty ideas and inventions You're going to see a lot of resources And things that we use every day plus spectacular things that will be done with light is going to come here because it's all over heaven on earth as it is in heaven Is what we're going to be seeing over this next 100 years. So Don't get on your rapture rug stick it in the closet because you've got a lot still left to do in this world And we're going to enter into the great stuff and to be great for for god on this earth but my other website is cat cur.com And by the way, I don't have any other websites. That's it I have cat cur.com and that's where you learn a lot of things about the spirit realm and different things what things look like In heaven on there There's all kinds of interviews on cat cur.com and it is the one and only and I really want to say this There's no other place out there on the planet where you can give to me personally Then cat cur.com. So if you find some other other places made up with my face on it and they say things on it that is not me Yeah, and I will never ask you I will never appear on a video and say please give this much to this ministry Or if this place is doing these awesome things and I don't do it on purpose because I don't want you giving to people Who are out there and damn you so I don't do it And people actually contact us. Was that you saying to give to this orphanage? No, that wasn't me Is this who said please give this money this person who had an accident? No, that was not me You may see my face there, but it's not me I pray you do bless people if they need help and I do myself But to protect you The more the more you become known the more of scammers.

You Well, good morning from the Pacific Northwest in the state of Oregon. It is Wednesday, September 21, 2022. We're sorry, we're a little bit late today. We try, but every once in a while we don't make it. So it's going to be a good show, probably worth the wait. So welcome to the broadcast. We're going to bring Kat Kerron in just a moment. A quick couple of announcements. First of all, people that have questions for Kat, we still continue to accumulate those. If you'll pop that up there, go to questionsforkat.com. You see down there below, questionsforkat.com right there. Just like at Cinerons, questionsforkat.com. And then you'll be able to fill out a little tiny form and you type in your question in a simple, keep them really short so that we can just ask the question. We can't get the whole story, but just get your question boiled down to the simplest as you can possibly make it. So all right, I'm going to bring on Jeff here. Jeff is going to talk about the clip channel and how you find things on our clip channel. We're going to use Kat as an example. So Kat, go for that. Okay. So hello, everybody. So yeah, Kat, we've been made aware by Kat's team that she's been getting a lot of questions about different topics that Kat has talked about a lot. So I'm going to direct you guys over to Elijah Clips. So I'm going to do both YouTube and Rumble. So if you prefer one or the other, but they're a great resource. So first off, if you type in youtube.com and you just type in Elijah Clips in the search bar right here, as long as you spell Elijah and clips right, you'll come right up to it. This is the actual channel right here. Here's a couple of recommended videos. But if you click right on the channel, that'll take you to the homepage of Elijah Clips, the Elijah Clips channel. So this little, this little looking glass, this little magnifying glass, if you type in this and say you want to know about pets, you're like, what happens to my pets when you go to heaven? Just type in pets, hit enter, and it's going to show you all the different recommended videos regarding that. See cute little puppies and all this good stuff. So if you want to find out what happens to your pets, you can type in, what about a loved one and suicide? Same thing. You can type in suicide right there. Paul has done a great job of tagging these videos so that it makes it easy for you to search. So again, that's for YouTube, really easy. And if you ever curious to get a little lost, just come back to this video at like the three minute mark and it'll, you'll be able to see our tutorial. So if you're on rumble, it's a little bit different. Rumble is still in development right now, so it's not as refined as YouTube. So if you type in Elijah Clips in the search, you'll get a bunch of recommended videos. So if you just click, see it says Elijah Clips here, Elijah Clips there. If you just click there, that's going to take you right to our homepage, our channel of all these recommended things. Unfortunately, there's no magnifying glass. So the easiest way to do this is to type in Elijah Clips and then you go, hmm, pets, hit enter. Same thing. So what I would do in your search for that is rather than using the actual designated magnifying glass for the channel, it just does it for rumble as a whole. But if you type in Elijah Clips space and then whatever topic you're curious about, it's going to pull up all those videos again, suicide, celebrities, you know, whatever the case may be. So yeah, again, those are some great resources you guys. And hopefully that'll, that'll answer your questions so you're not submitting. I would, my advice would be to check either on YouTube or rumble first if you have a question and then look through those videos. They're shorter clips. You're not having to sit through like an hour and a half long episode. They're going to be five minutes, two minutes, whatever. Great resource. Check that out everybody. Happy watching. Thank you, Jeff. Yeah. You gotta realize that that we've been doing this every week for two years, basically almost two years or just right at the two year mark next month or so month and a half. And so we've answered literally hundreds of questions and some of them keep repeating over and over. So that that's what Jeff was saying if you try and find it first, if it's already there, because we're always looking for new questions that haven't been said so we can continue continue to populate both YouTube and rumble with those questions and answers. So again, go to their questions for cap.com right there. If you have a question for that and we'll get you on that. We have a list. These are all of our questions from viewers and we start going through them trying to be pretty methodical about getting getting to your questions. All right. Thank you so much. And now it is time for cats without further delay. Let's bring Wednesdays with Kat and Steve and here we go. Hello, I got my pink tie on free cat today. I think this is probably the first time in my entire life I've worn a pink tie. So only for cat only for cat. It looks good on you. Well, thank you. You're very kind. So I see your new shirt. Tell us about your new shirt. Yeah, we we have just of course, return from open the heavenlies and if I sound a little forced to solve the yelling I was doing, you know, it was good yelling. Really? Yeah. And Rod Parsley was just wild people. I mean, he looks like he's 20 years younger. No knew this, but he had been sick for several years. I didn't know it. And now he's so much better. He's healed. He's well. His wife was there too. They were so happy. And he was excited to be there with all these wild prophets. I think he's a friend of Hank Coonamans anyway, but I'm telling you what he got everybody stirred up about right now what God is doing now. And I think it really surprised me, but it was awesome. But every single speaker had the same the same message just in different ways that the end is not here. And you better be ready for what God is about to do because it's going to be powerful. I mean, I every meeting I got to go to to hear this because I was I loved even more excited. So I do know that God is up to things and I know there's a couple of people later who actually had some kind of inside information. So if you get a chance to go watch any of those, maybe go to Lord of Host website, you might be able to see some of those meetings that we had, but they were really, really awesome. They were amazing. I didn't get to see yours yet. I'm going to try and get I saw Kent Christmas's presentation was circulating. Were you there when Kent spoke? I don't think it was. I think I had just arrived. So I was actually rest. That was my only day I had to rest. Yeah, so I rested that day. But I'm sure that my team was there and they loved everything that they saw. We took like six or seven members of our team to handle the products table mainly, but they all got to attend the meetings to so it was wonderful. Now you're going to talk about your shirt. Tell us about your shirt. Can people order that shirt. Yes, they now can order it will be on our website in about a week. Okay. We just returned from the website. There's several new things actually that you'll be able to see there. I'm sure we got plenty of things in case, you know, people want to order them for Christmas or something. But I can tell you that out of anything that I ever wear that pen that one can I usually wear all the time. I didn't work today because I have this. I don't do demons. It opens more conversations. And a lot of other people have talked to said they say the same thing it opens conversations people. I mean, I don't do demons. That means I don't participate with them and I don't holiday them in my life. That's what that means. That means I serve the living God. And what an opener, you know, for that but they get where they can't stand not saying something. And even in the grocery line or even walking down the sidewalk people always ask me about I don't do demons. So we thought we'll just make t-shirts this time and take them and I'm telling you what they are amazing and they certainly are going to give a point of view from you. Well, you're not bashing people or what they believe, but you are taking a shot at hell. And, you know, that lightning bolt reminds Satan how he was kicked out of heaven and unseated. And so this is probably going to be one of our best sellers for this Christmas time. But we're going to keep an inventory because it's really a thing that's in demand. The cops are the tumblers. The pins are we have car magnets, which people will take pictures of our car because we have several different the magnets that we sell on the on the car. People will come up behind. We see taking pictures of them. So you're making this statement without even have to verbally say something. When you have a car magnet, this thing is about this big and this is I don't do demons. And then we have other ones say wonder women doing signs and I love that. I love it. Yeah. And we had those also for our event. We had car magnets and we had some other things. I think I don't know if you have a tote bag yet. Jen's pointing at something. I don't know what she's pointing at, but we did have some wonder women stuff. That's our women's group. And we're redesigning the logo for our men's group because we plan to have both of those. And of course, this may be too shiny to see, but if you've read the book, you know that one of the most important things that was put in that book was the portal in heaven where everybody who lives there goes to pray over their family members or just there's rose petals. It sounds wild, but there's rose petals all around and big urns and it's got peace in them. And when they throw them over through the portal, peace will flood onto people wherever they whoever they're trying to send those that that word of peace to them. But this is also something simple and it can't even hold a straight. You can see it. Yeah. Oh, that's the portal, right? That's the portal. Yeah. And it's the portal in heaven. It's got columns and at the base of the condue. See, like, what do you call them, Jen? Monitors. Yeah. And on the one side, it shows people who are in heaven when the family members are born again, they can watch it on that very those columns. And at the base of the other condue, let them know when they're coming home. Now, Kat, on that picture, while you have it there, the little tiny stick figures almost down the very bottom, those are whole. Those are bodies of people standing. So that could be like, that could be like 50 bodies of a person sitting on. Are these all different people from different families looking in the same portal, but they're only seeing their own family. And is their picture of their family filling that circle in their eyes or are just a part that they're looking at it. If you if you know how to actually seeing them. Okay. I'm not talking about the monitors. I'm talking about what they see. They're standing. There's usually about 1000 of them in there at a time. Okay. Okay. And so they're even with 1000, they're all seeing many different things. Yeah, most of them, if they're there, whatever's in their heart, they'll see their family number that they're thinking about or want to pray about or something. Or if it's somebody's birthday on earth, they go there on their birthday, even though they don't keep time in heaven. They know when and heaven when that's going to be their birthday and they go there and sing happy birthday to them. And then they go to different places in heaven and get gifts and put them in their mansion that's being built. So this is a really phenomenal thing. It connects everyone who has anyone in heaven. This place is something that's probably one of the most used places in heaven, besides the throne room. And, and so yeah, there's a lot of activity that goes down there when somebody gets born again. Everyone there sees that and they all start shouting. They celebrate that very moment. They see their family member getting born again. This is one of the things that they go there for. But it is a beautiful place and it's called the portal. And I'm going to see what it says here. It says heaven is cheering you on. God's love from above. And I've signed it. It's already pre-signed. It's like an eight by eight inch thing. I'm not really good. I'm the good. I'm not in marketing. Anyway, that's what this is. And it's in, it's in my book. It's in my first book. And you can see this image, but we added color to it. And, and Ken, are there, are there many of these portals in heaven or is there one that everyone goes to? There was many. Okay. They're all over them. They're buildings you can go to, but there are some that are outside. Okay. They're outside that you can go to outside and see them. You walk up to them and go look down over and see your loved ones. So they're not really so separated from, from us as of course we are from them. Right. Yeah. Well, and then Kat, if let's say you and in heaven, you won't be married. Let's say you and being in the gun home to be at the Lord, your best friends now in heaven. Do you, can you just be having any old, because there's not days and nights, but you're walking in heaven at some point. And then do you just say, Hey, Bing, let's go see what the grandkids are doing. Is it at a whim or are you directed by God to go look? Well, most of the time it's your own choice, but there are times when he lets you know he'll let you know about to come home to heaven. If you want to view it from here, then you can run out to the gate and meet them. I always wondered as a child, how would somebody know I was even there? Well, he showed me and it's these beautiful buildings built for that very, very purpose and people go there. They'll sing to their loved ones. You know, it's just beautiful to see the fact that they can still see their life. Now, they don't see any, you know, they don't see any of the, the any attacks or anything like they don't see that. That's not what this is for. This is a way for they can tend to speak over their family members and to know when they get born again. Any important day in their life, let's say your grandchild was graduating, your grandchild was graduating, you would be able to see that from here. A baby is being born. You would also be able to see that from this place in heaven. So they're kind of kept updated on things, important things in your life here on the earth. It's really a beautiful thing that God has made possible. The great cloud of witnesses, remember when it talks about that? Oh, yeah. You know, run your race. Don't, you know, run your race and remove every weight that keeps you from the end or the goal of that race. Yeah. This is the great cloud of witnesses that surround this. This is one of the ways that the great cloud of witnesses would be surrounding you. Oh, okay. So because I would have pictured almost in the cloud and their witnesses are almost in the air above you, but you're saying this is how this is what it actually looks like. One of the ways. One of the ways. One of the ways. Yeah, and meaning is I've actually seen clouds. Well, people would call it a cloud. It's probably the glory. Yeah. Every now and then I see this cloud of witnesses in a meeting like way up high above everybody watching. Not very often, but I have seen that and other people have seen it. I think Heidi Baker. At one time she had meetings or a facility in Florida. I think it was like mid-floor or center, center Florida. And at her first graduation from this place that she had gotten to have, I don't know how many weeks you were there. To complete a course, but they actually captured a picture. Literally. A lot of witnesses. And I think if you put maybe if you Google cloud of witnesses, Heidi Baker, you may be able to see that yourself. That would be amazing. That's what that is. That would be amazing. So what we've got a bunch of questions, but do you have anything you want to talk about before we get into more questions? Just exciting and exactly what God has said that people are starting to come forward. We can't name those names and some we don't even know. We do know there are several people right now who are turning to be witnesses against, you know, the one to destroy us. And by the way, just so you know, Kat, we're not going to be on YouTube now until December. So if you don't, if you don't want to speak in code right now, you don't have to just, I'm just saying. Some of these people I don't know, because I'm not privy to every single wicked individual who's paying for things to be done or actually in charge of recruiting people to do them. They have planned this whole thing well planned that you can tell. And probably since when we were all celebrating, I'm quite sure they decided we're going to stop all this. We're going to take over. But by the way, every single speaker spoke against that plan and they all said, we know God has got a plan himself. We know the miracle is going to be some said reset, some said reestablish some said that God's just going to change all of it. So I think the fact that we were all in one accord, not having talked to anybody, I never call someone and say, what are you going to talk about? I would never do that. I have to only say what God's saying, you know, as a prophet and most of these people didn't know until they heard what they were saying. So it made it very exciting for everybody. But that was their heart that it is not over. There's too many things left on this earth. God's not done with this earth or with us or with the body of Christ or actually with the world. And so I think that was the most exciting thing that happened in the last few days was being at that meeting. I was a warrior Alabama at the Robin Bullock place. What dates do you know? I think it's a, I think it's like, I think it's like 15, 16, 17 or 16, 17, 18. If you go to Robin Bullock site, you probably see that we'll have it up on ours pretty soon. But it's this next month. I'll be there for a couple of days speaking. Okay. Awesome. We're Alabama. Great. Great. Yeah, we had a lot. I guess I won't say the date. But since I'm not going to say the date and it's not that date. So I'll just say it this way, because we try to keep Robin under wraps as far as when he's going to be broadcasting at his request. It's a security thing. But we gave him a date in the future that we would like him to come on the program yesterday. And God told me it's going to be a breakthrough day yesterday and I've had all kinds of stuff. But so Julie invites Robin through his through Krista. I think it was the one, he's, we'd like him to come in on this date. Yeah. And, and, and Krista calls back and says, I want to throw a little monkey wrench or whatever word she, she says, we would like to come. Robin would like to come two days in a row, which he has never done. And he, we named the date, which we won't say just again for security. We won't say. Yeah. Exactly. Sure. That's why I asked Jen. I know it is next month. Yeah. It is sometime next month. So you're good for the, for the church meetings. There's no question on that. That's not an issue. It's like there, there was an issue with him broadcasting live and people were in the area, that kind of thing. I won't, I won't go into detail on that. But well, listen, I've got some questions and I've got a question from a 12 year old. If you're ready. So we said kids first. So here's, here's one for her for Olivia. And then I'm going to, I've got one that I've been saving to ask you. So, okay. So Olivia H 12 says, will homeless animals also boy, I almost feel, I almost feel the compassion of the Lord for this little girl. Will homeless animals also go to heaven and who takes care of them there? For example, are they adopted by families or are they cared for in a center? So she's worried about the homeless animals, which is a really sweet thing. What would you say about that? I do know what happens to the creatures, all the creatures, but I've never a child always or a young person always asked the most exciting questions that no one else asked. I guess that's what is in their heart. Being young, you know, they would think about the creatures and I can just say this. God loves every one of them. He loves every creature he made. And the ones that have a soul in the spirit, of course, are going to be in heaven. And that's why he had no output, every animal or species that had a spirit of life in them. He had them put them on the arc so that they'd be able to replenish the earth and then, you know, create more of them. So I would have to say that all of them go to heaven, which might be quite a shock to people. Heaven is bigger than this entire galaxy. There's plenty of room for all the creatures to come there. And anything that has a spirit and a soul will live forever. Just so you know that not just humans, but all the creatures that have that. And I can tell you, we know our cats do because they have personalities, they have likes, dislikes. They make their own decisions every day about what they'll let you do with them. And, you know, you all know that you're a pest to that. But even the other creatures, of course, I don't know about the adoption thing. I know that they will go home with you for a while to your mansion and visit with you. And it's not like a zoo. There's no place where anything is enclosed or kept enclosed. No creature has. And anyway, behind any kind of cages or bars, they have different domiciles and areas that they live in heaven. But you can go there and you can take them home with you for a while if you want to. If they decide to stay, I'm quite sure the father would not care if they stay, but they're all cared for. And if he knows when one, I think his point is he knows when one sparrow falls to the ground that they died, he knows it. Well, he wouldn't keep notice of something he didn't care about. Yeah. And you think about how many, how many creatures and animals did he put on the art compared to people? Yeah. Well, that's a good thought. That's a good thought. Wow. So he needs to know that they're all loved, everyone in their love. And there is a way you can go, go where they're living, wherever their habitat is in heaven. And they have an area that's there and you can go visit them and take them with you if you want to for a while. And if they want to go back, they'll just go back. But they're all fine. And God takes care of all of us, the creatures and his sons and daughters. Wow. Now you said something that was the right thing to say. You didn't know it was coming in. You talked about the size of heaven and the size of things related to God. And, and you talked about the new Jerusalem, the new earth is going to be so much bigger than ours. Okay. So I got to studying this and I've seen this before I got back to it. So I'm going to ask you this because I know you've seen the new Jerusalem. I don't ask you about it. So in Revelation 21 16, it says this city was laid out like a square. As long as it is wide, he measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 steady and length as wide and high as it is long. So here's. So I researched what these stadia are. So here's what it really, really is the new Jerusalem on this earth is 1400 and some miles wide 1400 and some miles long and 1400 some miles high, which is the height of some of our satellites. In other words, I really, then I Googled it and I doubled it checked and triple checked. In other words, you look at the continental United States and you take 60 percent of our land mass of the United States. That's the size of Jerusalem approximately. That's right. Isn't that amazing? So tell me more about it and how could it be? I mean, of course, again, because God said, what, what do you see 1400 miles in the sky? It's like, why would you even need to go high if you've got the earth? And what would you, what, what have you seen? Oh, because a number one of the amount of the money, the many people who will live, we're talking about the new earth right now. Because the new earth is where that will be established. That is like God's not just God's new home. He calls it our new home. So the new earth, it will be all of our home. And that's what we'll call it. This is home. And I tell people it can exist only because of the greatness and how huge the new earth is. I mean, the scope of it. And I'm sure it's bigger than even our galaxy could probably be half the size of the whole cosmos. It is so huge that it can of course sustain and nothing's going to go upside down or something because it's so high. But I kept telling people it is big. The new Jerusalem, the walls are beautiful. The gates are always open. There's never any shut gates. The gates will never be shut on the new earth of the city. They probably will call it the city of God or the new Jerusalem, whatever anybody else calls it. That's just a city. Now I have to tell you that as big as that thing is, it's only a city. There's many cities in the new earth, many cities and places to go visit, do things on the new earth. And that's one of the reasons why it is so big. And there's no sun or moon. It's lit with his glory. So it's spectacular. It shoots from the ground. It shoots from everywhere. All of the trees have light in them. And there's there's no darkness on it. There's no shadows really. If the light comes from the ground, there's not going to be shadows. And people are actually quite excited about that when they walk around in heaven. Now there's not shadows because the light, the glory comes from the very core of heaven, which is a world. It is a world and all these worlds were made after the lightness of that. And so it's just huge. All I could think of was how big it was. And it was so high up, but you have to understand there are some angels. There are angels that are several thousand feet high. Wow, really? Yeah. And they're in heaven now. They're in heaven now. They're in heaven now. You have to remember that in the very last days, there will be an angel that stands with one foot in the middle of the ocean and one foot in the middle of the land. And they declare things in the last days. I believe it's in the book of Revelation, but there are angels that high right now. Even just some of the hosts are like 150, 200 feet high. And their dwellings, they have it called their barracks. It doesn't look like what you imagine barracks here. Yeah. But even the army of heaven has their own area defined area that they live in and they run their missions on or their assignments on from that place. Michael's headquarters is a massive castle like structure. Also, it is, it is like shroud, not shroud is not a good word. I guess clouds of glory, but it's dark glory. People are saying it says God says I have myself in my dark clouds of glory only because they're not white clouds. These clouds are like a camouflage for him. We're talking about the father now and it looks like a million peacock feathers with eyes in them. Really? That whole cloud sometimes you'll surround yourself with that. But Michael's headquarters, even like I guess the circumference of where you would normally have walls around a structure or an area are these clouds of dark glory with these peacock feathers with living eyes in them. And that's what the purpose for that is. So just walking around heaven and singing and having it helps you understand the scripture, some of the scriptures. But that new Jerusalem is really amazing. Very beautiful powerful. That's where the throne will be. The throne will be there and other things will be there. But there's so many other things to do and see on the new earth, which is massive. It's just massive compared. I mean, there's no planet out there that's this bigger than that's going to be the new earth. It's beautiful. Well, I mean, it's like, and I'm trying to figure out, I don't know if your eyeballs in the spirit can see, you know, because the Empire State Building, then they made the Twin Towers and then the new Freedom Tower that took place and then Dubai and some of these places they've got the tallest buildings now on earth and there are probably a hundred and a hundred and some floors and like, but still you're like a thousand and some feet up, but this city goes 1400 miles. It doesn't say the sky above it is that it says the city dimensions are. So is there anything more you can tell about what's up there in the sky? Literally sitting on the new earth, it literally will come down and he says, and I do know if the father had said to me, don't worry about when everything starts to be taken apart and then put back together. He'll keep you safe because a lot of people go, well, if this is gone, where are we going to be between there in the new earth? Well, he will. He does impeccably everything ready. He himself, when it's ready for things he's going to do, it's going to be ready. No one's going to have to worry about being left out or lost or something like that. They say these things to me, but no, he's not. He knows where every hair on your head is. He's going to know where you are, no matter where you are. It's going to float around. So he will have a place for you, but he's going to make the new earth and put all of us on it first. So we will be on the new earth and then he will climb on this new Jerusalem city and come down out of the heavens. And it will sit literally on the earth and it will be that high. It will be that high because the earth will be so massive. It's not going to be. And you can imagine that shows you right there how big the new earth is going to be. Something that many miles high can sit and sit there perfectly because he made them perfectly. And so it's just, you're in awe of seeing it. But the thing that you know, the most is those gates are always going to be open. People will live all over the new earth. It'll have one land mass and an ocean. The ocean will always exist. The seas will not. The seas separate land masses. We told me the seas separate the ocean is the biggest body of water on this earth. And yet there's rivers that run off of it, rivers that run off of things. And the land masses, when the land was broken up, the original earth, when he made it had one land mass and it had an ocean. But when that whole thing happened in the earth, then later on, you know, verse two, there's, there's a mess going on. Not a mess, but it's hidden under the total water. You can't even see the earth between one and two or probably millions of years, literally millions of years of life here on this earth. And when God got ready to remake it and he, when he put it back together and he said replenish the earth, he left the land masses separated. All he did was take the water off of everything. And then he began to build up the land again. And then he put the greenery and the fish. You know, he did all that. And then he made man on the sixth day. And then he, of course, he did make the sun and the moon and verse two, verse one, he didn't need the sun and the moon in the beginning was when he made it the first time people. You'll find that out when you go to heaven. You get to go see how he did all that much. All that happened. But this new earth will be so much bigger than the one we're on now. Do you happen to know cat if, because I know in heaven, I think you said sometimes you can think yourself in a place or walk through a portal and you're, you're another side of heaven. Will that still exist that, that ability once you go into new earth or are you more now you're in your, your flesh, but it's glorified body. You can do the same thing. You'll be able to do the same thing you did before for transportation around. Okay. You do it around heaven. You'll be able to do that on the new earth. Okay. Okay. So we don't know if there'll be even the necessity or, or let's, let's have a group. Let's all go somewhere and take a flight from one end of the city for a couple hours. You know, and today's travel would take you a couple, two or three hours, three or four hours to get to 1500 miles. Yes. On the one city. Well that where do you have you seen planes or are they simply not necessary? Maybe you haven't seen planes because people like to have them and some are piloted by you. Most people get a star cruiser and they're called star cruisers. So none of that was made up by Star Trek or Star Wars. Okay. That was always in heaven first and it runs on light and they will still have them on the new earth. That'll still be a way people love to be able to do that. There's going to be trains, but not trains like we have here. You will step into beams of light. It will still take you around to the other side of on the new earth. There's going to be even more ways of transportation on the new earth than there even is in heaven right now. You can travel on light on bands of the rainbow. You can travel through a star cruisers. They have things that can take whole groups like I call them. He calls them MMS like a mobile mansion type thing, but it's like it's like a bus, but it goes in the air, not on the ground. So I would imagine, yes, you'll have flesh, but that flesh will be glorified. It'll be glorified. You'll be supernatural at that time, really supernatural at that time. And so I'm sure that will open up even more things for you. You can go visit other planets without a ship even to go to those other planets. I know that for sure. Yeah. There'll be a new a new heavens and heavens is like planets. It's going to be a new whole planet system and everything put out. Some will be for certain things to do on just those planets and you'll go there for like vacation instead of just yeah. Well, Kat, will people be on the new earth inventing things? Will technologies be being invented? Or is that stuff all invented? Well, I have to absolutely the father being the great creator with his son, Jesus Christ. He and the word made everything that ever was made. Father did it by speaking and then the word made it. We will more and more be able to create things, places and things like that. I know for a fact he told me that we would he'll send this like to a planet. Now we can't, we can't create people. We're not going to create other things like that. The place needs to go for people to enjoy and do things. You get to use your creativity. I'm saying not building something taking 10 years, but taking probably like, you know, I don't know. I don't know if there's minutes or hours or something like that, but it would be so much quicker to create design things and create things and put them places. Very good. Very good. Now there was one. Make sure I get to that. I couldn't tell if it was a child because it was under the 12 year old. But the question is, this is Cherie was Queen Elizabeth II aware of any of the pageantry on her love and respect. The world was showing her. Did she see any of the processions? Her family mourners or services? That's her question. The answer is yes. That's absolutely yes. I know she is in heaven. She did make it to heaven. And the father actually really honored her because her whole life that she was ruling allowed Jesus Christ name to be spoken, the churches to take place. She honored who he was and she did belong to him. And so I think one of the greatest honors he gave her was that she did that in her ruling and what she had made decisions on her own. As the as a ruler over that whole country that she opened it up at all times to Jesus Christ. And so that was a he honored her greatly for doing that. And so yes, everyone who goes to heaven, they do see that she watched the actual service. But I'm sure she got to see most all the things that went on in her honor. I'm sure that it blessed her very much. Awesome. Now, Janet's asking this question uses the word portal, but she's not talking about the portal that people in heaven looked down on. She's talking about an open heaven portal from the earth, you know, where people say, man, it's an open heaven over this place. So she's saying, how can we get open portals of heaven over our home? You can. It depends on how you're living your life. Number one. What do you allow to be shown in your home? What do you play on music in your home? What words are being spoken in your home? I mean, people use a lot of profanity. Heaven's not going to come hang around. They're just not because profanity is the is the only language spoken in hell is profanity. It is hell's language. It is not acceptable in heaven. No one does that in heaven. And so heaven will come where they feel like they're welcome or the atmosphere is similar to where they live in heaven. But I've been in people's homes and I saw open heavens over their home like right over. I could look up and see through it like through the ceiling of their home. I could see angels swirling around that place. I saw them on their property. This one man and I won't give his name because of course it's that's a national privacy and it was in Reading, California. And this man I was invited to speak in his home. The one time I went by myself, which they won't ever send me by myself again. 10 days and 15 intercessors from Bethel. They invited me to come and speak. And so I went I stayed for 10 days with one of the one of the intercessors and got to know her well. And well, she was a naturalist and eight, you know, gray matter. I know I'm making fun of her and I love her and she knows she laughed all the time. But finally, my staff called and said, has she anything? And then she said, well, no, I'm trying to get her to eat better. And they said, we told you she not going to eat that stuff. She's not going to eat avocado, chocolate pudding. Well, then I'm going to happen. It's not going to happen. So I just was fasting the first few days and Margaret said, get her to an in and out burger place. I know that. That's good. Wow. But but yeah, I was invited to a Catholic bookstore to speak. How about that? To a what? The Catholics love the books. They love. Wow. They so believe in the supernatural. They believe in Christ. And in heaven, I mean, they do. I never, I never said that Mary was anybody more than Jesus's mother by you. You need to know that. And I said, well, if I talk, I have to say what the father's saying. And they said, we don't care. We're hungry. I think they had like 90 people in that bookstore, the Catholic bookstore, and they had my book already on their shelves. So it was quite interesting. You know, that whole group of people. But I did let them know, you know, Mary is very much loved in heaven and highly honored in heaven. Yeah. But she worships Jesus Christ. He had to die as her as her Lord. And that's why he gave his mother to John. Mother, behold your son, some behold your mother. And so that transfer had to take place. So he died as her Lord. And so anyway, I did mention that nobody care. They were all so excited that I was there talking about heaven. Some people had interpreters with them. But it was a Catholic bookstore, but I was invited to this businessman's home. And he had meetings there all the time. And it was the first time I ever saw the river of life flowing in someone's home. Really? I said, I didn't even know this man. This man is living his life right. Because I have never seen, I've seen it in mine sometimes, but never seen it anywhere else. This man was really living his life wholly on purpose. He was a great businessman in Reading and they couldn't get the people in the home. Some of them had surrounded the home. We're sitting outside and I went, wow. And I said to him, do you realize that your, your own angels are surfing on the river of life in your home? He said, yes, I knew that. Wow. And he was Catholic as well. You're saying I don't think he was Catholic besides, besides that place being invited to speak. It wasn't planned. It was totally unplanned. Okay. People found out I was there. I would speak in the intercessors, backyards. It started in their home. When you have 150 people show up, you can't just keep it in your home. Right. So they moved it outside. It was just crazy. The response from the people that were so hungry. But one of the places I remember very well was the Catholic bookstore. And how gracious the people were and how excited they were to receive heaven culture and what heaven is all about. But this businessman was another person that I did get to speak in his home. And they had so many people show up. They were, they were, they were filling the streets with their cars and everything. But that was very significant that he did have what she said, an open heaven over his home. And you can create a habitation for heaven is what they call it. They don't come and live there forever, but they'll come and go in, in the presence of your home. They want to see your life. They want to see who's invited over to hear about Christ. And so that's not an impossible thing. And does the person, does the person ask God to, you know, say, I'll do my part, but could you bring an open portal over me? Or does it just happen? And you're from what you've seen. I'm going to start creating a habitation for heaven. And then automatically that portal is one of the things that would be established over your home. Okay. Good, good, good. All right. Aaron is asking, he said, he or she can maybe be one or the other. I heard Kat Kerr teach about the temple in heaven. Is that a different place from the throne room of God? And then I want to add to that. Is it a literal temple, just like another temple, but it's just not made with hands? Or is it something different, but it's still the temple? What would you say there? Well, I know they don't have church services in heaven. Everybody's already born again. It's there. They do have different meetings in different big buildings, but that I was actually talking about the throne room. If anything was going to be like a temple, it would be there. There's the altar is there, the altar of God is there. And people do go there and underneath his area that he sits in, his throne is a structure. It's not just a throne sitting three feet off the floor. It is very high and lifted up and underneath that is our rooms that you can go into and to declare things for your family or pray. It talks about one of those places, but the altar at the top of the throne room at the top of the throne itself. There is an altar and those rooms are way down below that in rooms. I used to think, are they under the altar itself like physically under that altar? No, they're in rooms that are under that altar. So the altar would sit sort of at the top and there's a throne behind it and then the other throne is next to it. And so Jesus sits in a throne with his father, but there's other thrones there and sometimes he invites people to come and sit on them. Sometimes he had some for children to sit on and I think everybody, if you ever saw Colton Burpo's movie, he actually said he was taken to heaven and God got a little throne or a little thing and set it right by his. And so that just confirms he does do that. This is that book we're having. It's called Heaven is for Real, right? That's that book. Colton Burpo was the name. Yeah, under the altar. I wanted to ask you about this before because you said it before. I think it's in Revelation. It says under the altar, there were people that were crying out. And one of the times it says, how long until you avenge blah, blah, blah, our blood is something like that. They were the voice of the martyrs. Are you familiar with that very much and what's the difference between that under the throne or under the altar? Maybe that's all the same. What do you know about that? I don't know if they go. I know there's not like time. So I can't say they're there for three hours. Someone else is there. I can't say that. I say that that structure is so huge. You can imagine living creatures probably bigger than any building we have here. They're huge. They're standing at like the four, I can't even say corners. The throne room is round. That is the very center. It would be like looking at him. There's two here and two back here. So the four of them are always looking at him and shouting things on his behalf. And you have to remember some people go up to the throne room. If they're showing everything there, they don't even know what to think or say. They're so undone. The throne itself, the one the father sits on and Christ sits next to him. There's two arms, but those arms rest on the backs of two more living creatures that have four heads. It talks about them. There's four heads. Like now we know that there's four. We know that there's four different living creatures, but there's also two that actually stay with the throne all the time. And they have four heads. This is a living creature. This is not something that's just carved. They're massive. So this throne is so high and lifted up. Just because of the size of these living creatures that are surrounded and the ones that hold up the throne, the arms of the throne, I'm telling you, you don't know what power is. No one knows what true power and holiness is until you stand before that throne. And these tiny little ants of people of the wicked who think they're going to overthrow him, he could just suck the life away from them. They'd be dust, but he's not going to do that. He has plans. He follows what he has said in place. But there are days of reckoning. Justice is coming for them. And no one or nothing on the earth can stand before God and say, you're not going to do it. And I understand when they say that they have no clue who he is or the power that comes from him. And that's who you belong to. If you're born again, that's who your God is. That's part of the God. He had Father, Son, Holy Spirit, such powerful beings, so holy that they do have personalities. They do do fun things with you. They created fun and heaven on purpose because we come home as the father, son and daughter. He's not going to just leave you on your own to roam around there. He has already prepared a place for you. That's where you will live. You may have more than one place on your own property. Because he does do that sometimes, but you don't understand until that is why I am so fierce about having no fear. Why would I fear if I had stood before that throne, life coming in and out of him, seeing the lightning bolt shoot on him, knowing that he had decimated hell, Satan, and he knows the plans for them are nothing. Their plan is to die forever in the lake of fire, and he's never changing that. But you, you and I, who belong to him will live for all of eternity. There's no end to it. Life excited, life beautiful, life creating, life filled with love and his presence. That's who we serve. That's sitting on that throne. He knows every single person and what they're doing. He knows your life. He's heard your prayers. He knows your heart. He's not for you. We're entering into and he is setting up right now. Some of the greatest days this earth cannot pass away into everything he has decided to do on this earth, forest with us and because of him, it's going to happen. And no matter what people think, roll up that rapture of people and get your heart. Because we will be rolling with Christ in this very earth before we ever get to heaven or the new earth. And that's what needs to be on your heart. Not all the sad, sick stories, lame stories coming from the fake, the illegitimate and the wicked. They're in another whole book. They're not even what your name is written in. And you need to understand, really think about that sometimes. Talk about that sometimes. Because if you want the supernatural work in your life, you better be talking about it. Even if it's only to yourself. Yeah, that's good. That's really good because some people say, who do I talk to? And you just said, only if you only talk to yourself. Because your thoughts are like shouts to him, right? He hears every word. Oh yes. Every time you say something like, the Lord is God and there's none beside him. All of heaven gets excited. All of heaven can hear that. But the heart of God, our Father, it swells with love because he knows his son is being honored. And anyone who honors Christ on this earth, you're not going to ever lose your place with him. You're not going to lose the reward. You're not going to lose things in the exciting times. Your name is already on the list to be used by God during these days. And so you need to understand, he knows what's going on and he knows who's doing it. And this is going to be one of the greatest fraud exposures in the history of this world. And because he has his own plan and those are the plans that will happen. Not the other plans. So can you, you know, you remember seven years ago ish somewhere. Somewhere that you came to our room on the cruise and I said, okay, Kat, I was just getting to know you. And I said, are you telling me that you, you sat here like before the God of the universe and you talked with God face to face. And you said, yes, so my question is, how does that work if there's even any way to describe because we know God is high and lifted up. And the Lord's, you know, and so there's that God who is fearsome and almighty and wonderful and all these things. But is it through his omnipresence, you can talk with him face to face at the same time he's there, or is he go there. And then how would you describe the difference between sitting there talking to him face to face and the guy that's high and lifted up that you're probably not going to be chatting it up with. I don't know what what are your thoughts. I have to say it's one of the greatest experiences I ever have and I've had that many times. I mean, you know, before all of this started back in the late 80s, when Christ came to me and said that father and I are going to let you reveal heaven. We're going to take you on tours around heaven, let you reveal heaven to earth. We are tired of the myths and the mysteries and the lies Satan has been spreading. Man has been spreading. We're going to set that straight and people will know what how heaven operates. They're going to know what goes on there, what life is like, what happens when they pass away. And obviously, at this time in my life, I was, I mean, passionately pursuing Jesus Christ to know him. And they had already planned to do this with me. It wasn't something I said I want that I wanted what they wanted. That part had happened. I had given them permission to come to me anytime they want to say something. It didn't matter if they said it inside me or outside me. And yet this had to start at a certain time on the earth, heaven had to be revealed beginning at a certain time on the earth. And so that was their choice. And because they choose whatever they choose, I'm going to go along with. And yeah, visit me face to face. Just like what I was talking with you. They came through the wall. They don't have to walk through doors. They come to the wall. They come to the wall, a hotel and speak to me. And all many times they'll say things to me. Sometimes you'll see the father is a swirling rainbow. Most of the time I just see him. Many times I'm caught up to heaven itself. I've been in the throne room. There's besides the main throne room, there's a commissioning throne room where mantles are given out. The commissioning throne room is a throne room that has the altar with the horns on it. Those are two different authors. The altar before the throne is the one that is used for people to bring their prayers and their desires to the father in person. But then there's a commissioning throne room or mantles. I said mantles are given for people on the earth. They're commissioned at this throne room and then they're brought down to the earth and placed on the people. There's so much to understand about how heaven operates, but whatever they choose, I have stood in the presence of Holy Spirit, the invisible member of the Godhead, and seen fire outline his whole body. And he can be as big as he wants or not, but he does have a real body. And I've seen Jesus Christ so many times, even before I was caught up in heaven, I saw him face to face. Even when I was young, I would see him face to face. So I'm from, I'm seventh generation of believer who actually believes and lives wholly on purpose. And I was picked out of all those in him to represent heaven on the earth as a seventh generation believer. My dad lived it, his mother lived it. We've got his history back to the others in my family line. Sometimes a whole line, a certain line of believers is chosen to do certain things during the different generations on the earth. I am not doing this just because of me. I'm doing it because I represent that family line. And out of all those who are here, he chose me knowing what my heart was, what I was willing to do his way, his will, his way. It makes a difference, but yes, I do really see him face to face and I'm undone every single time. The time Christ came and sat next to me and actually told me what I would be doing. First they just announced it. Then later I was caught up in heaven for years and shown things. Then when Christ came back in 2005 and told me that I'd be writing books, traveling around the world and all the stuff that began to happen. I don't even think I was breathing. I don't even remember breathing with him sitting next to me. The love he had for me, the waves of the love of the father and revealing their plan. And they picked me because I'm a detailed person. I have photographic memories. So there's reasons why I never argue with God. I never tell him to do it a different way. And I've met a lot of people that tell God he should do something a different way. I don't do that. I don't do that. I honored my own father. I loved my dad. I served him also when he was on the earth, but it was just something he had already had planned. And I didn't say no. I didn't argue with anything he said. And that means a lot. So God says something to you. Don't argue with him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you, as a seer, you might have had a really clear connection. I know there's other people that are operating out of faith because they're not hearing actual words. And so they're going, Lord, to the best of my ability, my answer is yes. And then they may have to proceed without a clear direction. Is that also true in other words? I think if you ever do that, he's going to start giving you clear direction. Once you have actually said, yes, verbally said it. Yeah. Openly said it to him is very important. Yeah. And if you're not sure you say, I'm not sure that I really think this is you speaking to me. I'm going to go in the direction you want me to go in. So that's good. Open the doors and give me clarity whenever I need it. And you need to be like, probably more focused on what you're saying to him. Yeah. It makes a difference. It's not like, it's not always going to shut you out if you don't, but it opens more and gives because they don't take things. Satan steals and takes, he'll control you, he'll use you, abuse you as much as he can get away with. He's getting away with it. Well, I'm not letting him get away with anything. Of course, being a seer does in that way. Maybe it gives me a little bit of an edge. But, but I had always been seeing ever since I was little. And yes, I do clearly see, I see things walking down the street going on in the spirit realm. Some of them will say, just leave it, keep going. Sometimes they'll say to declare something. So my life is like, not normally any sense of the word, but I'm telling you, when you get to heaven, you'll always be able to see any of them when you want to. But there's coming a time on the earth, not too far in the future. Well, these visitations and heaven encounters will be for many people. They'll be for many people. During this time, it probably pretty much eventually you're going to go because of your staying that you made and you didn't back up and you don't bash people who are doing things for God, even though you didn't understand it. Whatever you do, don't side with the left. Don't side with evil, you know, whenever something's presented, you say, you know, I'm not doing that or I'm not a part of that or I'm not believing for that. I'm not agreeing with that. All those statements you make, every statement you make matters in heaven. It matters in the atmosphere at home. Inviting to your home because if you're watching things that are like defiling or all the time, guess what? I was in someone's home. I went there to that was my place. I was staying in and there were two demons standing right next to their television and Jen was with me and she goes, what is in this room? And I said, well, they told us to enjoy their selection of movies they had. We wouldn't watch any of them. None of them. The person who lived there had been almost killed eight times. I said, it's the movies. I just told them it's the movies in your cabinet. There's so much gross violence just knowing the titles of those movies and and the fact that those were not visitors. Those were those were residents in their home because of all the content of the evil that they had there. And I just tell people you need to get rid of this stuff. You need to burn it. I said, and you've almost been killed how many times I said such graphic violence. You invite those spirits to to get into your life, which is true. And so being a seer, it makes it different when they go places like I'm going to go stay at the holiday in somewhere. But while we were there, we we couldn't even make them leave because they were residents. They gave them by the movies they were watching. The wife decided she's not going to tolerate. So I don't know what happened when we left. But I got a couple more questions. We started a little bit late, so we'll go a little few more minutes, but two more questions. Maybe I wanted to circle back to the to the altar because you said people in heaven will go to the altars and pray and give prayers and petitions. I think in heaven at the where where the Lord is where we're gone as high and lifted up. And yet there's also decreeing you go to the rooms under the altar and you said where they're making decrees. So my general question is both for them at the altar and for those under the altar making decrees. It seems like every decree in every prayer in heaven would by definition be a perfect prayer because you're sinless. There's no guile. There's no environment. There's no issues. There's no job. So if all of these people in heaven are praying, perfect prayers. Kat, what can you say? Are all of those prayers getting answered? Yes. And amen. What would you say about the effectiveness of those who are decreeing from heaven? Does it always happen the way they know that answer because I'm getting the prayers. Okay. They go right there as the throne or like I said under the throne, I probably will do a basic sketch of that so people have a better understanding. But I understand why images are stolen by Satan and used everywhere because from a distance the throne itself looks like this. Like a triangle or like a pyramid. I would say, well, what I would call a pyramid because there's depth to it. Four sets of steps going all the way up the throne on the four sides going up there. And then there are some areas that have closed doors where people go in and pray for things. So I know what I've seen or I've been told. I can't tell things I haven't seen or haven't been told. I do know that's where people go to declare, they go to put petitions before the Lord. I would pretty much think that most of them are on behalf of their family or things going on on the earth. And I do know that from there, from the throne itself, angels are being sent. I can say that part. They're being sent all the time. They're called up to the throne. They're given messages or assignments and they leave from there and come to the earth. And I think that probably has something to do with those prayers being given or petitions being given from from those rooms underneath the altar in heaven. Yeah, awesome. Well, someone had a word for me that they heard what my father, my natural father who is down in heaven was praying for me. And so they told me what the prayer was. And it made me wonder is that you say you kind of saying you don't really know the answer. The question was, was that prayer that he asked, was it absolute? Was God going to absolutely pray because every prayer in heaven is perfect? He would think. I think there may be timing on some of those prayers. Yeah, right. If God is in the midst of drawing somebody closer to him, or maybe they're in a time of training in their life for things that he's going to give them to do or something like that. And I don't think he'll give you something that is too soon for what you're doing with you. Right. You know, for three years, especially three years in my life, when I lost my job, my great law job, they let me go because I wouldn't take another lawyer on because the Lord said they're going to do this. You're going to say, no, you're not taking on the lawyer. He said, I know that I need those three years to train you. He didn't tell me what I was being trained for. It was all this stuff I'm doing. And I said, OK, and it happened exactly the way the day he said it would happen. It happened 30 days. Really? They came in, they said the very thing he said they would say, I gave him the answer he said to give. And so from that time, I was totally blown to the Lord. And there were things he did train me in. Yeah. Go places when he said to go to do what he said to do. And for three years, he did that. So he let me know that was going to happen. I didn't know within that timeframe, he couldn't give me all that I have accumulated now in revelation. And in training and ruling. He had to have me go through that three years of preparing me that I would understand him more and understand having plans more. So yes, they're given prayers. Trust me. They're there. I know that some things are asking for things for their family members and places, maybe your areas place places. And I know the father writes it down. He likes to literally write things down, whatever said. Yeah. But he's not going to ignore them. He's not ignoring. They're up there cheering you on praying for you declaring over you. And when something suddenly happens so totally unexpected, that thing was probably an answer to the prayers of one of your family members. Very cool. You were talking about God trains you and you were training. I'm going to share this. I'm not going to give the name of the person, but there's a famous or was famous person to see she had a global. Recognize she was globally recognized. She said to me this last week, she said, I knew I watched cat cur when she worked at that church in Florida and she she did. She was in the she helped prepare food and she ministered people and she did everything God told. She didn't try to get ahead of anything. She didn't try to be something and she says, I watched her do that and now I see what God is taking her. I just want to say that because here was a person you may or may not know who I'm talking about, but she was watching you the whole time. And now she's so proud of where you come in and now she's learning from it. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about? That could have probably been several different people. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I thought I'd share that. And then we'll come and ask me a question or something that I was doing, but I was about the father's business that was cooking, cleaning, setting up, decorating for all those events that we had. And that wasn't my favorite thing. Isn't that funny? So it may be inconvenient sometimes. It may be inconvenient for you. Maybe you don't understand why, but if he said it, just do it, people just say yes to him and do it. And then you won't miss what he has for you. Yeah. Yeah, that was amazing. It was a good lesson for me and for people watching because I go, oh, so Kat wasn't always, wasn't born ready to be a prophet and caught up to heaven. God's giving her promotion after promotion. You served and served and served. I did. You said you got fired from that one job. Did you? I did. Well, it wasn't really fired. I made it. It's the way they give you a choice. You can stay. You can take a second attorney to be under. There was no time. It didn't make sense. Yeah. And my boss lawyer said that doesn't make sense that the board is saying you have to take a second lawyer. But I knew why that was happening. It was his way of releasing me from there. And I could see that it happened exactly the way he said it would. So I did a great job and I had great relationship with my boss, with his wife. His family came to visit him all the time in the law office, which was very rare. He was a Christian. And so he knew I had favor with the judges favor with the county clerks. You couldn't just call a judge and say, change this date. I can't make it there. No, I wouldn't tell you what they'd say to you. But some people just have favor and they go, of course I'll change that. And so there was reasons why he recognized that I had favor from God for things. But the time came when God was taking me to the next thing to repair for what he had for me, which is what I'm doing now. Yeah. And I was excited when I went home and told my husband 30 days from now, I won't have my job anymore. You did. I was excited knowing that something was going to happen. And then he told me my husband at one point wouldn't have his either. And it happened just like he said, he wouldn't have it. But he really took care of us so amazingly during that time. And then he begins to establish us in what our call was in our life. So even in the times when you don't understand, maybe you don't clearly hear, you trust him because he is preparing you for something that he really needs done. And he's always watching when you say God writes everything down. Of course, aren't angels recording things too? Yeah, there's five angels sent to be with you. I see them with some people and they're always, they have a tablet kind of a thing, not like we have here, but it's just different. But the father is the one who loves to write things down. Jesus, not so much. Not so much. Jesus has to go and speak and share and not, but the father has always written things down. He loves to write things down. He has book of remembrance. He has a lamest book of life. He has got many different books that are his own that he writes in. Okay, let me ask you. Here's one last question. This is Elaine. I'm trying to find one that's a little shorter, but Elaine's asking, Kat, I know Jesus laughs in heaven, but have you ever seen the father God laugh? A big old belly laugh out loud is a question. I was just imagining the father with his head back with long flowing white hair, just letting out a big laugh. He absolutely does do that. He absolutely does. I think I'm continually amazed by the father. I know why his son loves him so much and he does. I mean, I think the hardest thing Christ went through is the three days he was separated from him and was not allowed to hear him or anything. And he had to stand for what he knew was going to happen when he had to go over to hell and then wipe them all out later. But the father does laugh. He actually does laugh. Sometimes when people come home, he's so overjoyed that he'll just laugh out loud. And then you can't help everybody and someone will begin to laugh because like contagious. Yeah. And he does have a big laugh. It's a big laugh. His voice has got layers in it. So it multiplies the intensity of what he's saying or laughing at. Oh, I'd love to see that and hear that. Awesome. And on that question, where you said, are you actually just volunteered this? You said going up to heaven or visiting heaven and these experiences are going to be for the many soon. Roughly. You said something roughly like that. My question was right now, I know, I can, I know seven or eight to have had these encounters. I know the war details of that between you and maybe Kim Robinson, Robinson, Donna, the multiple things, but when you say for the many, are you talking about for millions upon millions of Christians will be being caught up? What would you say? I have, I'm not sure about the number, but I know that many will. And I think we're entering into a season of greatness of God being demonstrated and manifested all over the world. It's going to start happening. I do know you told me at one time he'll take whole congregations or whole groups of people at one time. So it's going to increase. It's really going to begin to increase. That was a huge word you just said. You're saying God sometimes is going to catch up a whole congregation. Yes, he did say that to me. Whoa. Dream. I used to pray that when we go to heaven, we could be go together. I don't think we pray that any more because right now all we want to do is go, whether one of us goes together, we just want to go. But it'd be cool knowing that God would sometimes take a couple or a church or an interesting time. He really did say that. Is there anything before we close that you can think of that in this hour, crucial hour that we're living in, things are happening in the news, things are happening in the church, that you would like to leave the people with? If you could just, sometimes I think, Kat, you must, I know you don't, I know you don't get anxious, probably, or fear like that. But are there times you just wish the body of Christ could grab hold of this one thing right now in this hour that they're having a hard time grabbing hold of? Is there anything like that? I think sometimes it doesn't make sense at all because God doesn't live. He doesn't live or think the way you live or think. He is God, and I'm talking about the Father. And I think the one thing he told me to tell everybody to do is still the best thing to do. You start celebrating, and I know in your head, well, all the stuff's going on, these words are being said, but when you do, God has said to do, it's him saying it. Eat, cake, and celebrate because he knows, no matter what's going on around you, what's being said, even the regulations, even the criminal acts that they're doing in our government right now, or other wicked people, you cannot let that be your new norm. It is not your new norm. God is your norm. It should be the thing you go to, the thing you talk about, the thing you're excited about. He holds time within himself. It comes from him. He knows the days are getting very short for those things to continue that you're seeing now. He wants every single thing and person and group totally exposed that are part of trying to take over. He wants that to happen. Until that time, besides just praying, giving your prayers or your praise, make sure you're praising and praying. Don't let it only go to like, I've got to pray this or else you need to pray. Sometimes praise is better than praying because he already knows what you need. Praising is actually thanking him for doing it before it happens. And this celebrate thing he wants you to do is those who've done or building layers in your soul of that celebration. And when it happens, it will be so powerful for those who have agreed with God that celebration is coming. Things are changing. It is totally going to be different. It won't be anything like it is right now. That's what you're actually doing. I would say the most important thing you do is do what he is saying himself in these days with all this going on. You celebrating victory and freedom before you actually see it happen is one of the most powerful things you can do. Not just for yourself and your family, but for the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit and all of heaven. Looking down and saying they really believe and trust you that this is going to happen what you have said. And I think that other than that is helping other people who are in a place of fear, who are in a place of turmoil. Pray for them that that fear will leave, that understanding will come, that clarity will come. They don't have to live in a place of doubt, of fear, of being taken over by the enemy. We don't belong to the enemy. You came from the Father and lived in him. He knows your name. He knows who you are. He knows what you need. And sometimes the fastest way to get things you need is to thank him. That's good. You have to pray. Well, Cece, because you need something, you pray once, then thank him. That's so good. You have to get that. Whatever that thing is, a lot quicker by thanking him and showing gratitude that you're trusting him for it. Really good, Kat. Really good. Would you go ahead and pray for the people? I know they always love it when you pray and decree over them. So awesome. Yeah, Father, right now I just take authority over all the darkness out there, the evil, the wickedness, the killing, stealing, destroying, defrauding, taking away, you know, robbing people, all of that. I take power over all of that darkness. I say it has not got permission to be here and has no right to operate in the life of a believer. We will not tolerate that continually going on. I'm an agreement with the Father that end is coming for wickedness and evil to be present everywhere. They don't have permission from us. I will give permission to nothing that is evil or darkness. I evict darkness from my home. I evict it from my life. I evict it from my city in Jesus' name and I release the life of God, the love of God, the plans of God, his celebration, his validation, his justice that is coming to this earth. He and he alone do I serve and I will serve no other God. I thank you Father for showing up and showing off on their behalf, set a place at your table in the very presence of the evil going on. That you know what's happening and you have a plan and I believe you and trust you with everything within me. I am on the same side you're on, the side of the right, the side of life, the side of love, the side of justice, freedom and liberty. Because that's life in heaven on earth as it is in heaven in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen, amen. Thank you, Kat. Hey, I think in the interest of time, let me just remind people revealing heaven. I want to do it with my finger. That is where you get the books and materials and that I don't do demons. Her website, catcurve.com is the one place. It's got spiritual resources that are free. It's the one place you can give to Kat and the only place you can give to Kat. It's right there, catcurve.com right there. Please support her ministry. I know many of you do and maybe most of you do so. Kat, thank you so much. Let's see, Barry Wench will be on tomorrow, Prophet Barry Wench, tomorrow is Thursday. Kat, you and I are taping a second show tomorrow, so we'll do that for next week. So that would be good. How are you doing? I love her. I will. I will. God bless you, Kat. We love you. God bless you. We'll see you all later, everybody. Have a great day. God bless you. God bless you.

You Well, I would say happy Wednesday, but it is Thursday a week before you're going to see this We're recording the six days before For us you'll see on the clock behind me that it is Thursday, September 22 You will be seeing this on the 28th. I believe I'm not right if I'm correct I believe it's you'll be seeing this on Wednesday the 28th. So just so you know This is when the words this is when the words were said and you'll see it on the 28th So, all right, so that's the story. We have Kat Kerr coming in here in just a moment Time I don't think I have any announcements. So we're gonna get right to it. So without further delay Let's bring in Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go You Well, there we are she is how's it going Kat? It's looking a little better right now Yeah, so when you're on your live on the air Kaz So we just for those that are watching we've been struggling with the lights It's a little better right now than it was. It's got you know, it's kind of we had a change in the light and the brightness We were trying to fix what what was broken so to speak. So anyway, welcome. Welcome. Good to see you So it's much later. It's actually 5 30 in the early evening for you, isn't it? I guess I'm just getting started. Yeah, this is your day. Yeah, this is towards Well, I mean this so that's good because that means it's gonna be a good show because you're gonna be awake and alert Yes, not that you aren't always so anyway Well, well, Kat, obviously this is today the set the 22nd, but they'll see it on the 28th. So Anything you want to say before I've got pages of questions, but about heaven and other things related But anything you want to tell the people before we get going on these questions? I think there's probably a little bit of something to tell them Sometimes I said sometimes I can't release it all one time, but I do know this for a fact I don't know who and I have to say that I always am honest I don't know who but I do know That there are covert people out there Gathering information that the other side, you know when I say the other side I mean, you know, if you decide not our yeah They have no clue about it because when you get so full of yourself and you think you've won And this goes for anyone if you're if you're on the wicked side and you think you've won That means you convinced you one that does not mean you have won in any shape or form of the word and a lot of that's actually still going on however Some are realizing even more realizing that this whole thing is going to go down the drain From what their plans were not our plans. Everybody knows our plans right goodness light hope love joy celebration So but the other side has no clue really they think they've got it made They think they've got the plans laid out and they're happening and they aren't happening at all and that should bring you hope That yes, there's more going on not seeing than stuff being seen What you're seeing is their plans their announcements that they generate all the time that brings no good If you didn't know this by now Satan, I'll just say Satan Satan can't create good. There's nothing good about him There's no good plans. He's never made. He's never done anything to help anybody and that's never going to change But the side of light is always working towards Great things happening more happening on our behalf on behalf of the world because this world still brought belongs to the Lord of Glory And he has let's say spirit realm operations for sure. You don't see them I see them and it's amazing the things going on that are about to happen and then on the other side On the flesh side, there's also stuff going on that no one is aware of whatsoever Which has to remain that way so always know this there's always somebody on your side If you're on the side of light, there's always somebody go things going on plans being made that actually will happen Because we who are in the light have a great foundation that cannot be shaken the other sides already been shaking Yeah, you remember that what the father said on November The fourth 2020 he said when it begins to shake and when the shaking begins It will not stop until everything is accomplished that he has planned and Therefore because that shaking has started in earnest in many places in the spirit realm and in the flesh because they're both happening That always tells me something is about to be exposed Something is about to be done and finished. So that's all I can leave you with today I hope that helps you to stay excited and remember to share truth Remember to share what brings hope and life and celebration and stop broadcasting what Satan wants to happen So I want to I want to ask you this now You have said before cat several times on a broadcast that the enemy Satan promised Hitler all kinds of things and he was going to make him Famous he was going to make him whatever it was and now as I recall you said since then since he he's been hanging on a hook and hell Is that am I saying that right? On a hook so on a meat hook. So what I'm so now is it or is it not true that even the deep state? Literal people have been promising their foot soldiers people we see on the news if you cooperate with these evil deeds We're going to do these good things for you. That's a lie, too Isn't it? It is a lie Well, the father of lies who is yeah is really in charge of everything even some of them don't know that they think it's them And it's not them. So because the father of lies Satan Cannot ever create anything good that is productive. It's going to bring forth help. He can't do it It's been it's been blotted out of his mind and that lightning bolt that you come out of heaven burnt part of his mind away That's what the father told me so nothing good will come from that for anyone involved in that That's just the way it's going to happen It's always been that way and I wish everybody could have been there and open the heaven leaves a meeting and her What was said by a couple of speakers if you can go to the Lord of hosts and watch those meetings You'll probably find out what I'm talking about They clearly exposes that deep state stuff and what's going on with them and what's going to happen according to the word Which is they're going to fail miserably and yet we who are here I will say a scripture I will quote with you until he that remains is removed the end of Christ cannot appear on the earth That is in the word of God He who remains is the body of Christ people operating in absolute dominion authority by the time those other greater days get here That's what will be happening. No one's going to need a rescuer people The only reason the antichrist comes is that people are screaming out for a rescuer But when we're gone and no one knows that day, but the father and it's not right around the corner just in case you wondered That is a scripture that is in the Bible and that's exactly what that means So we're here Not to be beat up and stepped on in the views, but we are here to rule Jesus Christ rules and mean now in this life And the time to come that's what's about to happen in this world And because that will be phone less greater than you ever imagined speaking to the land the sea in the air and running things for God on this earth so that it will be great There will be hope joy celebration and that is going to happen. That is those are the father's plans That is what is about to happen and you will just further further see the demise of everything else on the other side Because there's no one that can stand before the living God and say I'm taking over too bad That's never going to happen and until we are removed as the light in this world the body of Christ Operating in dominion in authority That's why I keep saying get your crown on because that is about to happen the other side is going to fail every single time and I think in these meetings that just happened was so fully explained by more than one speaker Including myself it was just a glorious time with the presence of God and everyone getting so excited about what was being shared From having what having the plans were so that's what I can tell you today And that's what you should expect to happen. That's what you should be talking about Yeah, I want to encourage those who are listening there are people that are part of the deep state They think we're nuts right now, but you're beginning there's some watching this that are beginning to a little way You're beginning to say maybe these guys maybe that lady with the pink hair is right Maybe that Steve Schultz of them are right. Maybe I'm on the wrong side Can I just say this if you're one of those people get out of there repent tell the Lord you're for you're sorry for for You know wanting darkness instead of like repent from it till ask the Lord to forgive you He'll rescue you before it's too late. So yeah, don't wait. Don't wait. Don't wait. Don't wait I wouldn't wait any longer if I were you. Yeah, it's right there folks, you know, you know, there are already in covert operations actually That are getting stuff from those some of those that you'll be shocked to find out who they are It's not the V person who's telling on everybody else who's involved in that But that's what always happens in these operations. It's always what happens when evil tries to take over There's already always somebody either a plant in that group or someone in that group getting Realization of the truth of what's happening and they don't want to do that anymore or be that anymore And as I've always said, please pray for their families the ones who under one stuff Illegally pray for all their families if they have nothing to do with that They don't want a part of it and yet they're probably in hiding yourself right now because of that So I do father I pray for all those right now who have a family members out there being evil and wicked Killing stealing and destroying father. I pray for their families father. You will protect them You will keep them you will bring them peace in their hearts and run after those who are doing that Let's sick Holy Spirit on them in Jesus name That if God has a plan for their life, they're gonna realize it and they're gonna turn and come back to him in Jesus name There's my prayer for the there you go. Awesome cat. Well, then well, we'll get into questions anyone That's new watching this cat has been and not she's not the only one many people on the earth have had this in Many encounters in heaven where they're caught up before the Lord cat is one of those primary ones that I know and she's she's been called To to bring heaven the teaching about heaven to the earth is that how you describe it cat? In person face-to-face commission with Jesus Christ when he informed me that father and he were gonna start taking me on chores of having to reveal the truth about heaven what life is like what happens from the moment you pass from this world or Step out of your body your physical body and what life will be like there That is a commission and I started back in the 80s and they have no intention of stopping it And I have no intention of asking them to stop What would you say cat To someone that says look we have the scriptures. They were codified. We know those 66 books God's told us what we want what we need to know There's there you shouldn't tell us anything. That's not in the Bible Because he's given us what we need all the things we need for life and godliness. What would you say to that? I think the Bible is definitely One of the most basic things you need in your life because it gives you truth Truth about Jesus Christ truth about life and death Truth about who we are is the body of Christ and it clearly says in there that he gives his power over all the power of the enemy And if you don't know what that is you need to know what that is He fully intends for you to understand what that means and also what what we have the right to do in this world as Kings and priests and to our God which it also states those are positions of authority and dominion and Some people can they'll read scriptures and they may understand they may not understand But when things change and these times are definitely changing Yeah, the messenger and has always sent a messenger John the Baptist was such a messenger He was changing everything by the word God gave him to speak that the Messiah was coming Then we would no longer offer animals of sacrifices back in those days that totally changed everything For those who believed in Jesus Christ's our life is changing their understanding the revelation was changing We're in one of those times right now where you need to know who you are and use the authority He gave you right now and therefore that is why he's revealing himself the father of the Holy Spirit Revealing how heaven operates what he has given us to do in this world if he says the earth is crying out itself For the manifested sons and daughters to stand up and say and do things To impact this world. That's what I share It is Scriptural and it is in the Bible and I had a personal commission and you all know even in the Bible people had personal commissions given by God Given by the Lord, then that's what they did while they were here on the earth I am no different than those other ones. Okay, and because I was asked and I said yes, that is what I am doing Yeah, good good good stuff. All right Deanna's asked the question. It's it's her granddaughter's question So I'm gonna read you that question and then I'm gonna add a couple more to it myself She wants to know are there schools in heaven and I'm gonna add to that The details are their classes are their courses are their trade schools any of those type of things any or all of those are none of those in heaven I I don't know about the trade schools I think that anything you don't know how to do or you would like to do horseback riding skydiving I mean, I can I'm just listing a bunch of things if you really have been doing that You go to the one who knows how to do that and yes, they will teach they teach people They they give classes and teach people But there is word university, which is the main one that everyone goes to when you come to heaven everyone revelation on every single scripture in the word and The ones who wrote those books in the Bible teach those books with revelation to you when you come to heaven There are classes. There is a specified place called word university Whoa, and I think pastors are the most excited people when they go to that go to those classes and they've learned the full revelation Of what the word what those words meant when that they were given and but being able to see or meet those Who wrote those scriptures who after they got to heaven were given revelation on that? That was going to be what their assignment was and also there's royal university that teaches you how to rule and reign Really not just not necessarily in heaven, but in the world to come on the new earth There will be people who have positions to be over certain areas In that at that time and you learn how to do that at royal university So those two places I know I've seen them word university and royal university actually do exist in heaven Yes, you will attend classes not in a school room behind a hard desk I'm not going to tell you how they do that, but it's in different places throughout heaven Even in the celestial realm that these classes take place in it You are so amazed and I'm done by what the father has to share with you when you get there I was totally going to ask you you mean sitting at desk like I'm picturing these school desks Where somebody walks by knocks your papers off just to have fun So this is not behind the desk. Nope. It's not like that. Okay. Very cool All right. Now, how come you said I'm not going to tell you how is it kind of a more secret or we just wouldn't understand How the learning exciting ways exciting ways that has taught you I want you to find that out when you get there Okay I'm gonna ask something my wife and I were talking about this thing where you've heard me talk about our loved ones that went before us and That didn't agree with the things we're doing like the stuff you and I are doing now people that are now going to be with the Lord and You know, we were talking about it was hard to visualize Even now them and even though we know they understand everything. It's hard to visualize them. They're going Wow, look what Stephen dream doing or doing because they always didn't like what we were doing You said they will be saying that it will be saying that they will be so fully Understanding what God has given you to do in this world and it will be excited. They'll probably watch a lot Don't watch a lot. Oh, that's a good word Well, that was my supposition I was saying I think they might from time to time Look down and say let's see what Stephen dreamer up to now because they're doing this prophetic and you know now They understand it. Okay interesting. So that for a lot of people who had people that went to be at the Lord They never understood what you were doing with the Lord now. They're cheering you on from heaven Yes, and I want you to repeat this one thing and I'm going to ask the next question But repeat to me what you said if you remember it and if you don't know, but the moment someone steps out of their body What they understand you said the moment they step out They understand you leave this physical body behind your spirit man is free from this physical body The presence of the Lord will begin to invade you right then it doesn't wait you get to heaven You already can feel his presence all around you joy floods your soul. You're so excited You know when you're going your guardian angels right there with you You'll see your guardian angel for the very first time if you've never seen them before There's probably more than one you'll see them right there They're waiting to take you home to heaven and that is the very first thing they experience is seeing their guardian angels And they're going to know they're the guardian angels and they'll introduce yourself to you and they'll tell you you've got to go home We're going home take you home to the glory We're going to the heavenly realm and we're here to take you and it's going to be okay But then excitement begins to pour into the heart when they realize they see their body They can clearly see their dead body Yeah, that they can feel and touch their self because of the spirit realms all around inside the physical realm and they're now There's spiritual bodies and they're they're able to touch they feel joy. They feel celebration. They feel excitement and And so that's what happens very first thing happens when you step out of this body You will get it back people even if you're cremated It's okay if you do that because God knows where every single ash is every cell of your physical body He's gonna bring it back together one day and you will have it back You know when you said Well, but well, I was gonna say but I had heard that before not only from you But someone else that God knows where all the pieces are and I'm thinking I don't necessarily want the old pieces Just give me a new body. Why do I want the old pieces? Did he literally get the pieces? He can find every single bit of it and he will put it back together Wow, okay, love your body because it will young it's gonna be young Yeah, there's no age in the spirit realm. You will be young. You'll be filled with life. You'll be strong The possibilities of what you will experience just because of what you are experiencing now It's okay. He's gonna give you your body back people, but it will not be old It will not be any cap. There'll be nobody blind sick lame None of that will be in your body once you get that body back So cremated or not God God takes the pieces and puts it all back together cremation. Nothing Yeah, put it all back together Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. All right here. In fact, you kind of know this is different. I thought it might be similar Okay, Amy's asking this question when people freeze their embryos like IVM in vitro Fertilization when they freeze their embryos are there spirits? I don't know if she means souls Are there spirits frozen with them or does the spirit still live in God until it's implanted? That's the question normally it is after the conception has taken place It was it would be after conception is taken place. So I don't think the spirits in those embryos That's like the egg, right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, once it's implanted and I have no I have no opinion of my own ever about what people think I think about that. I know that when conception takes place Either from intro in how do you say that in vitro fertilization in vitro? Yeah, that conception must take place It has to so that has to they have to meet together like they would even in in the natural way and at that second At the very second that that implant takes place and there really is life right there That's when life begins. That is when your spirit body and soul is attached God can't attach it. There's nothing to attach it to. Yeah, put it in an egg He you have to have that conception take place. It's the best way easiest way I can say that and I know people Understand what I mean life begins a conception We cannot make a spirit and we cannot make a soul So our part is the the physical part and once that conception takes place Holy spirit will bring down from the father a little spirit of life Which is your spiritual body and your soul and it says it says in the Bible God said I knit you together in your mother's womb Well, he said that because he's the only one who can do it He's not talking about putting these arms and legs on people He's talking about your spirit man and your soul Being attached at that time of conception because they grow together the spirit and so grow with your body They grow and so that's when life begins. So no matter what they're trying to say through abortion It's not true. That's my people That's a baby that is a baby and that baby was sent from God and heaven It's little spirit and soul was knit together at the time of conception and from that time It grows through the different stages until it's time for it to be born It doesn't become a living human being when it's born. It already is on the inside of the mother Okay, yeah, I want to ask you probably the most controversial question. I've ever asked you I've known you for seven eight years I've never had the guts to ask this I'm gonna ask it today. So We all know the horrors of rape a woman women that get raped and out of those rapes sometimes there's conception What do you know of anything has God shown you anything about what how in the world does he then Put a spirit and soul in that Is he there's a plan of salvation kick in at that moment for for this little What what can you say if anything about that any babies any and all babies? Even if they're like a week old in the womb or something else they all go to heaven when they pass every one of them Goes to happen when they pass they're innocent. They weren't a part of that, but I will tell you why it happened Steve God makes I could call it a protocol. I don't want to call it a law There are laws of creation if you want to call it that the way it happens There's just the way it happens and God made that a Protocol he will not change or take away Because there's so many to send the way he ordered it to happen is at the time of conception No matter how the conception takes place if that is that is joined together if the eggless one is joined together That is true conception He always made it that when that happens He will send a send a spirit and a soul in an innate in a body and send that and attach it He can't take that away There'll be too many ways for the enemy to get in to prevent things or not have things happen And so that baby can still be kept and watched over it can still be raised even if he sent them as a prophet I've known quite a few people that were born because of that and the mother still wanted them born and they're in their And their destiny still happen So I know those aren't the best of circumstances Yeah, but I will tell you that when that takes place no matter how that takes place when conception takes place Life will happen and there will be that joining together when God said I knit you That means anyone who was sent by him. I knit you together in your mother's womb That means he attached that little spirit with someone at that dot of flesh that was just created by conception You know, do you know anything about the scripture where David says in sin? My mother conceived me has God shown you what that meant at all. Do you are you familiar with that scripture? Yes, he basically says it's in my mother. I don't know. Maybe perhaps she didn't know Possibly she didn't know that there was a creator or didn't do even that wasn't even her thought pattern of doing that But I'm glad David remained. Yeah. Yeah, for sure No, I knew he would become David when he sent him when he needed to gather in that mother's womb He knew who he would be when he grew up. He knew that would be David. He knew that would become King David It's amazing. Amazing. All right, Aaron asked my son is down nine But when he was young maybe two or three while in his bedroom He said he saw the spooky bats going in and out of the spooky castle I'm positive. He was seeing the spiritual world. This hasn't happened since but how can I encourage this gift? Is he a seer? I feel like he has a big calling that I don't understand and I want to make sure we don't miss it It sounds like he was seeing spooks It that that could be for many reasons. I'll take a little bit of time to explain each It could have been something that went on in that house before they bought it If they this is a thing if you buy a home as we live in form You better evict everything out that you don't want there Open your front door because of people did wicked things in that home or they operated in witchcraft in that home There are they'll be spirits that just remain they just do and so it's up to us to cleanse that home I've done it every single time. I've moved if I didn't have a brand new home that was built by me Which I haven't so we always evicted everything out in Jesus name We took communion and to cleanse the home we poured it some of it on the land outside and if anything was there it left So I would suggest to her she do that first Because if they had a place it was operated in in different ways or they watch things all the time in there There were life witchcraft or The darkness, you know all kinds of things go on in movies now Spirits are attached to those movies and you don't want that to remain either There's different reasons how that could have possibly happened and he may have seen it Sometimes when children are younger their eyes or some some of them are still open to spirit realm some or not I would certainly pray for him to lose that from his soul But I wouldn't pay attention to what he said to her if he sees more if you begin to see angels and other stuff Without her coaching him or anything I would totally write it down in the journal and share it with him when he gets older But that he saw either he was just having a bad dream Maybe somebody watched something or went somewhere and brought something back with them all these things are reality in the spirit realm You cannot go visit places that have evil in them and leave and think something's not following you Yeah Responsibility to guard our children from all that stuff and not participate in any of it because you actually are almost putting a Welcome mat out for it to come. Yeah, and so someone if someone says Don't get that house or don't go into that house. It's haunted. There's a there are ghosts in there. You're saying they're not ghosts There's what? They're familiar spirits Even not it's not that it's not a ghost is usually somebody who died and that was their spirit remaining that does not happen It could be it could be demonic It could be and but there's those those are evil spirits But a familiar spirit can look like somebody you knew once before and they will like I just spoke about Sometimes I'll hang around in different houses That was not the person who lived there before and that was your dead spirit. That is not what you're seeing There are things called the familiar spirits in the spirit realm that are dark from are from the enemy And they will try to influence people sometimes they make sounds in the night and stuff like that Open your front door. Say I evict all familiar spirits. I did all wickedness and evil anything of saying I evict you from this place In Jesus name and they will have to go. I know some people who think it's funny. I don't think it's funny. I don't think that any Partnership or of anything to do with Satan because eventually it will bring control over your life and But those things like that that people call they're not you're not haunted by a person usually They're saying the person who lived there through their spirit behind your spirit goes one or two places when you die It either goes to heaven or to hell. There is no hanging around on the earth not not for humans not for human Okay, now let's see. I lost here it is I I came across a piece of paper when I was preparing for this the other day and this is from last year almost over a year ago and So so I thought well, I better ask her question and here's the question is Proverbs 31 This is Francis Hansen is Proverbs 31 a real woman It's almost seems like Proverbs 31 is an unobtainable goal for women. She's what it what what were your thoughts? I would say it's not unattainable or he wouldn't put it in the word Okay, it is not unattainable. It's what it's really about what your heart desires for him Are you spending time with him? Meaning Jesus Christ? Are you running after what he has what he says? Are you hungry for his word yourself? Only the enemy would be telling you that is unattainable The truth is what's put in the word and talks about it could have been somebody who was alive at that time and they Operated like that. They operated in holiness. They love people. They help people They they really wanted to know the Lord at that time. I can just tell you I know people who live that way and That is not unattainable. It's not We live holy if he says in his word be holy as I am holy He's saying you can become that that's guess what that means. You don't sin Well, you know, if I can say because my wife and I've talked about the Proverbs 31 This is not our question or this is Francis but I remember going over this years ago and and You know, it is true that this woman Proverbs 31 rises up early before everyone else Fixes the food makes this thing then she's in business Then at the during the day and she runs the business affairs It seems and then she's back to fixing the food and I think there's some people that says I don't have enough energy in my life to ever have to be like that And I I kind of think that's what they're talking about. They're talking about becoming that woman I think you could have that kind of energy if you ask for it. Okay, you have not because you asked not people think For whatever reason they think I can ask for my rent to be paid I have food on the table. We're safe and protected. You can go beyond that. You You can ask for strength for energy You can ask for for for more of God of him You can ask him that and I can tell you I begin to learn how to ask and I didn't hesitate to ask if there's something I desired or wanted that would help what I'm doing for him But but that is not unattainable. It is not Thing is this Basically, he was saying she had integrity in her life. Well, she said she would do she did it And this is really the truth. Well, she said she would do she would do it She put her hands to something she finished it She didn't abandon it and that that has in someone who is a believer that goes a long way With the father that you're showing him I'm serious about representing the body of Christ. I'm representing Christ on this earth I represent heaven on this earth you need to have integrity in your life And if you if it's getting hard you ask God to send help you can say father Some me help to do this or have sent me to someone that can explain how to do it better There's all kinds of things you can ask him, but don't reject the whole thing And having integrity it goes a long way not just with God But with people watching your own life that if you promise to do something you do it Can I ask you a question about that about asking thing because you're you hit on something that's really intriguing to me And I practice I play with it I experiment with it and I and I have said to dream my wife If you knew the things that I asked for and the things that I prayed for Yeah, you just wouldn't leave because sometimes I'll just I'll go into I want I want my memory to be like this and I'll do I'll Describe Bible characters and I'll describe people with you know Photographic memories and I want it to be this plus this plus this now And I I feel like in different areas and I'm just talking about many many different areas I pray I feel like at this stage in my life at 67 I'm just beginning to see some of the prayers. I've been praying for different things Happen. I mean, are we literally leaving on the table? Prayers that we if we only prayed them God would do for us in our have you seen anything ridiculously crazy that some we prayed for and God just did I Think it depends on the timing is everything with God, although he doesn't go by time itself Timing is everything in our lives. Where have we gotten? What level are we at? Are we pursuing him do can if he gives us stuff will it make it squander on ourself it gives us wealth And we're not ready to handle it. Well, make us lose everything we have because we begin to have greed for that God is not against giving people wealth at all But what would you do with it if you know that that matters to him very much? He doesn't want you to lose where you already have with him because you're you're tempted now by wealth and some people are I happen to know that I will have great wealth because I'm already using mine to help people I'm already doing that and my goal is to be able to help people with things that they never could have or do That is my heart. I love people so much. My dad did that I my dad was a great example of taking stuff We hadn't owned that we needed we gave away because we love people so much So what are your plans? And I think that means so much to God if you gave you this What would you do with it? No matter what it is you're asking for what would that do? For you or how would that better help you do what he's assigned you to do? I was born with a photographic memory. That wasn't something he reached in and put it was already in me I already have a great memory and It does help in everything that I'm doing because I remember every time I've been taken to heaven and forget any of it Wow every time. Yes Wow, but I'd love to have that. I love that. Okay, so yeah, so you would encourage people to pray Bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger prayers, but maybe but Lord, you know the timing Lord You know when you know how that's not my business to know I would say make sure you consider What would you do with it? Yeah, or any God he obviously can give whatever he he wants to give you can give it But what would you do with that? Yeah? More important to God and I'd write down something if you wanted something that much I'd write it down father really would desire to have this This is what I would use it for This is why I would want you to give it to me This is how it could better help the the kingdom operate or you can use me in the kingdom better If I had this that would mean more to him than you just saying I want this Well, right, and I guess in my mind that was implied, but I hear I see what you're saying state You're saying come right out and tell the lawyer. This is Yeah, and hold yourself to the fire because he will you know Oh, yes, you're right. So Okay, this I'm gonna read to because this lady She's waited for a year and a half. So I'm gonna ask a second one from her It says we do communion daily from obedience, but as we participate Meaning in the flesh. She's saying in the physical is what she's saying. Is there anything actually happening in the spirit? I'm thinking maybe the lightning power of God would be released or something similar but she's wanting to know what actually happens in the spirit realm and And if you're if you're sincere about it does something happen in the spirit realm every time you Drink eat this bread and drink this cup, you know I do know this to the father that is a holy act and it is a holy thing To remember the death of Christ It really is and I think it should be in the heart of every believer to do that at least somehow on a consistent basis I do know that sometimes when you take it healing can come Um faster By taking that cup and it's even taking the cup represents healing It's one of the things he gives us or that happens. So a lot of times healing happens when you're taking communion Things are brought down from heaven and put on the inside of you when you're taking communion It definitely things happen in the spirit realm The enemy is you sometimes who's been bombarding you a lot and you take communion over that and say Uh, I recognize your blood and your body being broken for me that I can be free And I'm declaring that I will be free from these attacks of the enemy. You would be shocked at how quickly that was taken from you It's what are you taking it for just like I was saying before he watches the heart to see Why is this important to you? What are you thinking this represents? It represents all that his blood does for you all that sacrifice and all the stuff that he's laid down in his own life To so that you can have more of him You can understand him better have more of his More of his presence around you and I also know this it literally will evict every single thing off your property That does not belong there no longer No, no matter how it remained I already mentioned that to take communion if you're having things going on in your house It's not you open the door evict the enemy go outside take communion and say this is your holy communion Representing your blood and your body and I pour it on the land to redeem the land And this property to be used for the kingdom because I will no longer tolerate the enemy's presence And I promise you hosts from heaven will come down and they'll rip everything off of there and evict it because you did that You know I this makes me think of a question that's been happening in the last year or so that I'm because all my life because I was raised in the church. Although it was illegalistic in the first half or third of my life, but I've always said the name of Jesus in the name everything was in the name of Jesus We always we never forgot to say in Jesus name or the name of Jesus, but later in this part of my life. I'm tuning into How much incredible love the father has for his son And the name of Jesus wasn't just saying the words, but it was like what he did on the cross and oh my goodness The love that this father has for the son So when I say and I pray this in the name of your precious precious son now My heart is filling up as I say that is that a more effective prayer with the Lord, especially when it's from the heart I would say anything that adores the Lord is powerful in the spirit Anything that recognizes his authority His right to rule is very powerful in the spirit and I do encourage people to do that It's not you're not saying just a rote thing like that's like written in a book You're not just reading that it has to come from your heart and your soul when you say that And you are recognizing his authority his dominion He trashed hell on his own Crushed the enemy took back the keys to hell death in the grave And opened it and made it possible for those who believe in Christ to go to heaven And no longer have to go into Abraham's bosom or paradise so many things happen that was crucifixion We haven't really talked a whole lot about that But absolutely yes, the more you honor it the way you honor it It totally is going to uh, it totally is going to affect the father And I mean in from the father's perspective two people can be praying Uh seriously one person says in the jesus name the other person says in jesus name One of them may have That love for the father that only the father would know no one else could see that looking upon right And he would he would see a different kind of a prayer and you know, they both sounded that's that's fascinating because To me it gives me motivation to Tap into what it is that i'm saying. Why am I saying it in jesus name? So All right, uh, do the prophet jenny asked do the prophets in heaven listen to what his god is telling his prophets right now For example, does isiah listen to amanda grace? And already we can say johnny or any of those or hank or whatever or and try to decipher the Okay, so let me read for example does isiah listen to Amanda grace or other prophets and try to decipher the riddles From the word she receives i guess i guess she's asking if prophets in heaven are trying to decipher riddles To me it would seem like there wouldn't be a riddle in heaven anymore But anyway, what i don't think there would be a riddle in heaven I think they would have full understanding of what was being said And by the way, they do watch they do watch they watch us they watch meetings in different places Uh, if you were a member of a certain church, you probably would still watch to see what's going on and just declare over people still there There's many different reasons for watching Either prophets or pastors or people like that, but they they are being watched by those in heaven. They certainly are Yeah Okay, um, let me see this one. Uh, uh, I didn't read it fully. So i'm just going to read it live Nancy asks scripture tells us over and over to watch Be alert for the lord's return. How do I obey those commands? When i know the lord is not returning as in the imminent rapture Any time soon. I think it is in part. She's saying a misapplication of these scriptures that prompt so many People to constantly it seems referred to waiting for the lord's coming I'm not quite sure of the question there, but maybe you can get my favorite scripture explains all of it It says, uh, um, jesus christ Occupy until I return Um, occupy is taken dominion taken authority over all the gardens. Is you ruling as a king and priest? Before him on the earth and they don't want anything to end too soon They they know christ doesn't know the day, but the father knows the very day that christ will come back But until that time you're not supposed to be sitting somewhere just talking about that It said clearly occupy which means take authority that means you're actively taking authority over the darkness That means you're actively operating with you with With all the power that christ gave you on the earth. That's what we're supposed to be doing We're not trying to always look like we're going to escape And I say it because I know some people are looking at it right now. Let's all just escape. We'll be gone. It'll be over No, you're leaving out the best half of what still has to happen on this earth It's a testimony of the of the sacrifice of jesus christ by us operating In authority like he did the things I did christ said you will do also and greater things in those you will do So we haven't done those greater things some people. I've even done the first things And and he's not taking anybody off this earth in a rapture until that has happened That's why you have to have understanding of the spirit realm how to operate in that what your authority is How to use your authority how to operate with your dominion the weapons of warfare he gave you That's why so much of that kind of thing comes out of me He wants them to know how to do that because we will demonstrate and manifest the power of the living god To this earth that there is a god That's the whole point of it Is a god and that the darkness does not rule the darkness does not have more power Than a believer does and that's why you hear that from me from hang from johnny I can go down this long list. Yeah why they talk so much about that That's what you're supposed to be doing and people just want to sit on the rapture of praying every moment. He's going to come And yet you're asking christ forget all the things you're supposed to have demonstrated on your behalf Forget all those things that the body of christ will be doing one day to demonstrate who you are in this world That's what you're saying when you say all you want to do is escape If you happen it will happen one day But I still think the greatest proof of what you do is when he said He's not coming at this time. It will happen at a time. But until then Occupy which is in an authority until I return. So that's what we're supposed to be doing That's what we are trying to show people to do You're not supposed to be running in hiding. It doesn't say hide in the hills. It doesn't say that these are not the perilous times They're not anything like the perilous times And you know, we were I was always taught that word to occupy. I meant stay there stay put never meant But I was not taught that we're occupying force. So an example of that is Yeah, when when the world war two when we took over japan, we had to Occupy that land for a season and believe me. We were in charge We told the leaders of japan. You can do this. You cannot do that. We we were in charge We were occupying force. And so god's saying occupy as a force Where where you're in charge even to see even satan wants that that's what satan's going to do right now He's trying to occupy People who don't want to be occupied people who don't want him don't need him. They're already set with god They already know what the purpose is in this world and since we know that there's no way that's going to be taken away from this by some squany Want to be leader from anywhere from hell. That's just not going to happen And therefore that's why this is going to be such a crush It's going to be crushing to the darkness because we still have to do those things that christ talked about He wants to see us do the greater works the greater works is raising from someone from the dead that was just That's a greater work. I say well, we have to be at least raising the dead Okay, we have to be doing these things because christ said these things i did You will do also and greater works you will do He wants those greater works seen operating around this world because we belong to him And that won't happen for everybody's just with out of here And I will say this for him. He said please tell them that I said the rapture will not be a rescue party The rapture will be a celebration of glory. That's good. That's good. That's good. In other words, you say these words You say these words the rapture will not be a rescue party. It will be a celebration of glory Good because we're operating like him to the point where he can't bear to be without as well in other words by the time He has the celebration. It's a celebration event We were already celebrating on the earth. He just came and got us and the celebration Amplified is kind of what I'm hearing you say Yes Okay, okay. Good. Good. Good. All right. Hannah is asking god is three part being father son Holy spirit and we are three apart being body soul and spirit But did jesus have his did jesus have his own body soul and spirit While on earth i'm not quite sure why they're asking this question And if he was god in the flesh did the other members of the trinity make up his spirit and soul well That's complex. I don't know. I guess they're trying to figure out the god head Within jesus the father's to me. I am in him We are in each other. I think that may be what she's trying to figure out. What did we made up? What was he made up of? I could certainly tell you that when christ was on the earth He had to be willing to have a body There would be no reason for christ to come as christ. He was the word That's who he was he worked with the father. They made everything the father would say what he wanted the word would step out and make it That's how that worked. That's why christ made everything. There was it was ever made The word was to say the word was with god and was god Right the word became flesh. It even says that that means he got a flesh body so he could rule in this world Indominion in authority. Okay He had to have flesh on him so that he could live holy Give this the permanent a sacrifice of him dying for us and then the fact that in his spiritual body He wasted hell. He wasted it He melted the faces of hierarchy of hell took the keys of hell death in the grave away. He knew that was a plan It was finished for salvation on the cross But he still had to descend to take back our authority that god gave adam that adam gave to the enemy There was all this reason why it all had to happen But I can tell you for sure that was jesus christ Okay, who had a flesh body born from the womb of a woman the holy spirit over overshadow mary's mary's womb and holy spirit planted Christ who had to become a seed the word had to become a seed And that was brought down from heaven by the holy spirit overshadowed mary planted that in her womb That happened to no one else ever on in all of time That's the only time that happened because he was the son of god And mary couldn't have that happen from a man. So it had to be planted in her womb and christ was planted Okay, the word was planted. He had flesh on him because of that He had to have the flesh to give us authority in the world and because adam was flesh and he gave him the authority And then he gave it away christ had to come in the flesh and that was his own soul and his own spiritual being He was all spirit. He already had a soul He had to be willing to be made into a seed by the father and then brought down and planted in mary's womb That's how it happened. That's why it's called an actulate conception It was done by holy spirit and sent by the father and then he grew up. He was born He had a body that was a real bus body. He had to have blood in his body or there couldn't be a sacrifice All this is boots and revelation that was given to me So i've always known that christ was always had a i have to say the word always had a spiritual body And even though he has a flesh body, he still can step inside the father Holy spirit can still step inside the father. It can still be the three in one even though he has his glorified flesh Yeah, it's just a it's a phenomenon. I you know, I used to read those scriptures about I think it's either john 14 or 17 where he says you and me and i and you and And us and them and he's talking about that thing and I always thought it just was like a it was like poetry We're so united that's like urin s and we're that he wasn't talking poetry wasn't he was talking about reality Talking reality. That's crazy because it's a crazy reality who but since you told the story where jesus stepped inside of you When you got saved that's the first time I realized. Are you kidding? I know the holy spirit comes to live with us But I didn't realize that it was literal that jesus steps inside you It's literal because he has unlimited Layers of himself the father has unlimited layers. Holy spirit has unlimited layers. That's how he can be everywhere all at the same time That's why holy spirit can do that when you invite holy spiritual and value as a believer He sends a whole layer of himself in you and it literally lives in you and he will guide you He will protect you. He's not just walking alongside. He actually comes inside When you does Cat when you pray to the lord and let's say you're talking to jesus now You're a seer and you've been there, but he's living literally in here So when you're praying to jesus, are you praying to what you see? Are you praying to who you know up there because you've been there or are you praying knowing? He's right inside you. So you're literally talking to him inside you. What is the fuel? When he comes in person to see me, it's not the him. He's still in me. He's still in there And so it's holy spirit. He comes on assignment Uh to personally talk to me because when he leaves from that encounter, he leaves and goes back to heaven When the father comes he'll walk through the wall He'll come wherever he wants to say something to me and he comes in person And I see him face to face because I am a seer I see the fire blazing in his eyes with love for all of us I I see I can feel the power and I see that rainbow coming in and out of him in waves You can actually see the little spirits and souls of all of living in him riding on those. Oh you oh, you're seeing those That's amazing. Wait. Yeah. I mean, I figured it was good enough amazing enough to see him But while you're seeing him you're seeing the spirits that he still has with him. Yes. Wow Wow, wow Jesse saw him and Jesse was caught up He was caught up in the flush his whole body was taken to heaven And he began to get weak and they had to give him this copper colored fruit And that would give you energy because you were there in the flesh and that body physical body wasn't prepared to be In that atmosphere for very long it would begin to affect you I don't ever have that because I'm taking in my spirit. I'm taking out of my body My spirit is taken to heaven by holy spirit by the Lord To be shown things on purpose. But when they come here, it's them coming They come they share the Savior they want to and then they leave that doesn't take away Christ living in me That doesn't take away Holy Spirit. Yeah, it's hard to grasp that because he is him. Yeah. Yeah here. God. So you can be This is interesting cat because I read you something from the year and a half ago where they want to know When you do come in and hear what happens there Here's the one that's from right away right now And this is cat being a seer tell us what what what she sees what you see when a person This water baptized can she can she tell? As well what is happening there in the heavenly realm at the exact same time is something happening in there or Are they just watching I don't know what fully with the question There's always something happening when you do something that's a greater commitment to Christ Always something is recorded in heaven. It's recorded from heaven It's also written down in your book that he's writing that the father's writing continue writing your book He wrote every day of your life before you were born But he adds continually to that book with the things you choose to do yourself There's also books of commitment There's so many books the father has a whole library of his books that he's written in And of course there's something very powerful when you get born again But even the water baptism thing is representing us dying with Christ and then rising again That that is something that will happen in the future eventually But that does actually represent that it gives you a closer commitment to Christ. I was four Um, I was four when I got born again, but I was 18 when I was actually water baptized And I felt a greater uh impartation from really When I when I went under that water and came back up I was overwhelmed by the presence of the Lord at that time because he was there That's amazing, you know, because again as your testimony That is true is that you felt and saw and felt Jesus step inside of you and yet years later You get water baptized and you feel a greater power and annoying. Yeah, that's amazing Go ahead. Don't leave me alone So Generally saying you need to explain that you need to explain the scripture Okay, Jesus said father me and you and you and me. I pray that one day They will also be that way Okay I pray that what happens then because when you go to heaven if it never happened before you can totally step into the father Holy spirit will step into the father. Jesus will step into the father and you will be one He will not have said those words. I pray that they be one even as we are one Inside of each other you actually can do that in heaven When you have died and moved to heaven Well, uh, yes, but to clarify then but didn't you say there's a certain amount of that? You just said of course that he will step inside of you now and So maybe you can clarify what happens in heaven When that has already happened to some degree here on earth. He steps inside of you. So how is it just more? When you're born again Well, I don't know when yeah when you're born again. He stepped inside of you. You said Jesus So what so when you when it says that and the word that he's right So when you go to heaven And he steps inside of you. What's the difference between that and the earth thing that happened? I guess I think that that that is the very first time he was stepping inside of you at your invitation And your invitation to receive him as your savior you're receiving him as your savior And and he does when you say that father. I'm not father. You say uh to the lord I receive you as my savior. I repent of all my sins ever committed right now I don't I don't want that in my soul right now. I'm asking for you To indwell me the bible says he indwells you it says that and he does step inside of you And you sometimes he will say things to you and that's still small voice you hear sometimes is him Yeah, and yeah, I guess I've always wondered how do you tell the difference between him and the holy spirit talking to you? I mean, you probably know because you know their voices more, but I think I think it depends on how long you've been listening Because I can tell the difference. Yeah Yeah, right now I get an impression. I see a picture. It's all like thank you. Holy spirit kind of or I'll just say Thank you Jesus, which it means all the above. I guess it's the lord, you know, uh, let's see, uh, Okay, this must have been some something you said the last show You said you pray once and then you keep thanking him So send the uh, that's an interesting send the uh, I guess I'm a bit confused I heard that if you have to pray more than once that it has not been in faith Are we to continually pray over and over the same prayer for unsaved loved ones? I think that uh asking for things from the lord Not necessarily the salvation thing. Uh, I would tell people. Yes, you should not stop praying for them You don't have to pray every day every night, but I would totally say uh to to make sure that you're just saying, you know It's a declaration you're making. Yeah You're making a declaration and it says what you dare to declare and decree it shall be establishing to you So if you're declaring that you know that your love them will know christ That they will receive christ and they will be with you in eternity Which is one of the most important things you can say in your whole life for your family members That is surely going to happen. He will pursue them So that that will happen and so I have to say it depends on what you're saying and what are you asking Yeah, your family member to be saved is different than saying. I need this. I would like to have this I would love to go there. There's different reasons and different type of prayers that you pray Of course, the most important one would you be stand in in that place? It says stand there for when you should stand there for and don't step back about your family members knowing him Uh, he is going to do everything he can in possibility And there's a woman that I that I've been friends for years and years and she said her testimony is Years and years ago She prayed for her mother to be saved as far as she kind of presented it as if she prayed once and that was it From that point on she said thank you lord that my mother is saying to that you're gonna say And that's kind of a variation on a theme right that works the same way Right, that's whatever your soul is whatever strengthens your soul more If I ask for something which is rare, but if I do I just I personally just thank him after that Okay. Yeah, that's Thank you for blessing me for this Thank you for helping in this that what I'm seeking after I I'd like to thank him and I think a lot of people don't think I think they should I remember Lord came to me a long time ago and said it would be wonderful If my people were more grateful. Yeah Yeah Well, it's a it's to me. It seems like it's a higher level prayer because to pray and pray and pray and pray For this is lovely to get saved for 20 years where this person's prayed at once and thanked him For 10 years. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you 10 years later because god without faith It's impossible to please god and right gratitude is okay that I mean that's a higher it seems like it's a higher level But I think you will take either one One Does show that your faith is grown If you can just ask that one time and your faith is there to believe for it and then thank him after that I think that's probably how most of the people I know that's how I do it But it depends completely where you're at what level you're at as a as a Christian and a believer They may for a while feel like they have to Keep saying something is better than not saying anything or not even asking at all So it depends on the level of the person who's doing that But it's certainly blessed the lord when you say it enough to and believe this is going to happen because I'm trusting him for this to happen and then thank him for Awesome now linda's asking how do how do you pray for people? Who are hateful and evil and she says in a meaningful way what she's saying is how can I meaningfully pray for someone who is just Full of hatred and evil. That's what she's saying. I guess she's wanting to know how to pray I think you do that as an act of your will and not from your emotions Your soul has three parts your mind when you think about Your will what you choose to do and your emotions that display what's going on on the inside of you I think you can totally even though you somebody despises you they abused you a lot You don't do that as an act of your emotions. It's not an emotional thing It's a statement made by your will and you say I choose to my will to forgive this person Then god will actually act like you forget them But you cannot keep bringing up the thing that they're doing. I think that's more important than saying You know, how do I do that? But your will your will is the strongest part of you and your will can actually override your mind What you're thinking that can override your emotions what you're experiencing in your feelings Your will is what really matters because that's what really moves thing is your will Kat the We've talked a number of times about abuse and there's innumerable viewers that are watching right now who are abused by a parent one or more both one or both um, I was one of those um A lot of those parents that did the abusing have died. Some went to heaven. Some we don't know. They may not have made it So there's these wounded souls left behind Who have not figured out or been able to forgive The parent now the parents gone they may or may not be in heaven How does that person forgive in a way that heals their soul when It ended badly. There were never good words. They were abusive It's going to be the way the father showed it happened. It is using the keys to the kingdom It's losing every unkind hateful abusive Word or action ever done to you by that person and you say I lose that in jesus name and jesus comes down It says he restores our soul. He will literally come down and pull that out of you He'll pull it out And that is the number one way to do that and then you don't have those thoughts can't keep returning to you about that The ending is going to give you those thoughts every day if it's still in you If it's in you he's going to mess with you if you don't want him to then you have to get that out of your soul And when you lose stuff from your soul, it's gone. It doesn't return It's gone Then you bind the things of god and I choose instead to bind the love of god the life of god His plans his will his way into my life that I will keep And guess what you're going to think about Not the abuse you're going to think about the love of god the life of god And then you will be totally free from all those thoughts of that. You know, no matter how long it happened It will be gone okay, is it fair to say or Accurate to say that even with this what you just said There would be some people that got their soul was so damaged that it will tend to be a little bit more of a process than an event They'll end up having to do that a few times In other words, because they haven't figured out You may have to do it a few times any time it begins to rise up. You say no satan. I'm not taking that back I have loosed it from my soul It is not coming back in Jesus name and some people have to because they the experience it was so long But there will come a point where you say that that is gone and it will not come back But I have prayed with people who went through three marriages of horrible abuse And I had just been shown this by the father and I went to new new I don't know where it was New Jersey Genu I went to New Jersey and I was invited by a pastor and his wife to speak in New Jersey I went back many times by the way and he went in the store to get milk or something Milk or something and those few minutes his wife turned to me. She said I don't know why I know this But you're here to set me free Should I've been abused in three marriages and I still have nightmares of the torment? What do I do? And I said I can show you in three minutes if you're really going to mean this you said I will mean it What do I do? I said you choose You choose to use the keys to the kingdom and you're going to choose in the name of Christ to lose all of the abuse You can name the people I use I lose the abuse from and said the man's name The other abuse from this person the other abuse. I will not keep any of those thoughts any of those feelings in his motion I lose them all in Jesus name right now And a minute later Steve she turned to me in the car and said I am so free I It's gone. It's gone. I I can't even try to bring it up. It's gone. It's gone. I'm a new person And she just grabbed me and how we should I don't know what to say I said this is what the keys of the kingdom were always meant for You can lose the bad stuff and the evil and the abuse and the harsh words and the critical unjust judgment lose it Lose it and then you say and I did say after you've done that I said let's bind the joy of the lord I actually say let's bind the joy of the lord you choose to bind the joy of the lord his love in his life And it was that one minute later. She her face had light in it because she was so crushed with life itself And she married a pastor wanting to be free. She said but even though I've been married a few months It's still it's still there. So that's because you have to get it out You have to choose to get that out and I went over the period of seven more years and it never came back And not only her but her 16 year old son or 17 year old son at the end of my meetings Brought them up front. She said they want to do the same thing because they see that I'm so changed They did the same thing They lost all the abuse the words of abuse the actions of abuse by those by those men Loosed them all from their soul and they bound the joy the lord and the love of god And they were jumping up and down and they said it's gone. It's gone. I She she when I come back two years later the the woman said it's never come back to me It has never come back to my son You know that I mean I wish there was a magic bullet where we could teach this to the entire body of christ because It's so powerful. I mean I've used loose from my soul A whole lot of times with this because I've been in process Um, you know, maybe some of it was from abuse, but by the time I met you most of that abuse was healed Uh, but it took me decades cat when maybe it could have taken me minutes Because I didn't know this because it's fairly new teaching but and when the father came to me And I was actually in my room when he came to me He said what am I about to train you and it will change the way the body of christ lives He said in these days. I don't have six months. I don't have a year for them to get whole I don't have that time. I need them to be active and I need them to be free He says so I'm about to show you how to use the keys to the kingdom Uh in with revelation and that's what I'm going to show you he said and with these keys with this revelation You can lose wishcraft from your soul All abuse any satanism anything you've done concerned the darkness words that were spoken actions that were done even as a child Things you saw happen like trauma and all this violence stuff He said you they can lose it in minutes. That's what he said in minutes Oh, man, they lose it my son's name. He will come and pull it out of them But then they need to find love and life and things about whatever they choose You know god's love price love his life his joy his celebration and he said and that Can never be taken up by anybody And he said if it's a hard time, it's been a really hard time in a long time They may have to repeat that because the enemy will try to bring it back It's gone at that moment because he took it out But he will try to represent that by giving someone a dream or a nightmare and you I would tell them Why would you I'd sit up saying I'm not taking that I refuse to take it because he wants you trapped He wants you to be controlled But this is exactly what the father told me and that was the first time I actually got to use it outside of my own life So I'm gonna bash you somewhere. I don't know they bashed me. I turned around from them and went I lose every wicked I'm kind word spoken to me right now and by the love of god. I turned around at that moment. How are you doing? It was gone. It was gone. I had to prove that myself Me and Margaret used to do it all the time and Margaret is the one who realized you can do it as a as a lifestyle She said well, I did it four times this week. I went. Are you kidding? Really a one-time thing she goes. Oh, no, we're supposed to be doing this and the Holy Spirit said she's right You're supposed to be doing it as a lifestyle because satan and wicked man will present themselves to you all the time And that's how you handle it. You get it out of your soul So if you're going through the grocery store and someone Decides they don't like you and says something mean Maybe you're not wearing the mask that they're wearing and they're they're mean to your faith You might have to go outside and lose that from your soul or lose those I would do that or just turn right around in front of them I wanted them to know I was free and I sometimes did it on purpose to show them. I am free It's gone. They wouldn't have heard me say that And they're like, what are you doing? I went being free You mean right there you would just lose it from your soul in front to their face Are you saying I would why they didn't mind giving it to my face That's hilarious The fight is in the story of our souls and if we know how to use the keys to the kingdom I can do it every time Wow I live that way That's why I could easily forgive those two people who made a blog to bless me I sincerely could really forgive them because I had been living that kind of lifestyle I keep nothing in here that is not god That's good. That's good. Ken. Well, I don't want to hit any other subject because I want people to end on this one Pat would you just pray for the people especially in that vein what you were just teaching anything that Anything else the lord would give you so Yes, and any in any walk of life no matter who you are how old you are You probably have experienced some kind of trauma or unjust judgment Spoken over you criticism harsh criticism Even witchcraft spoken over you. You don't have to keep any of that in you The keys of the kingdom were created for us to be free And so I will just pray this is what you would pray I choose as an act of my will To lose from my soul and sometimes I lead whole congregations Any witchcraft any wicked thoughts any actions any trauma any violence Anything I watched that I had not wanted to see any anything my eyes saw that they shouldn't have seen Any perversion I lose it all if somebody practice that in my home I'm not keeping that in my soul if I heard it. I lose all of it in Jesus name And it's going to go right now And then I make people wait because I have to see christ come down and you pulls are them Sometimes it looks like gray matter. Sometimes it looks like really And and then when they're done with that I'll say okay now We're going to bind the things of God and then once you have done that it doesn't matter what it is It could be perversion you watched online It could be things that you read books you read about witchcraft Any of those things you can lose all that you have to name what it is and lose it from your soul So that it would be taken out and then you say I choose with my will to bind The life of christ his joy his celebration His validation His plans for my life those I bind to my soul And Jesus name and then he will actually come down and walk down and put them in your soul And that is what you'll think about every day. That is what you will repeat every day because it's in your soul If you find out you're just sad, I want to tell you sadness is a is also one of the enemy's greatest plans He can make you sad over nothing. You don't even know what you're sad Lose the sadness if you if someone has passed away lose the grief Retain the memory and the love you have been the but loose all the grief especially if they Did abuse you you want to lose all that from your soul? You don't want to keep it But it doesn't matter what it is if it blows the enemy if it was plans the enemy to control you To harm you to crush you to steal your joy your destiny I mean the enemy tries to do that. He'll make you sad if you don't get it out It'll go to a oppression and then depression and then it can keep going further And you don't even know why you're having those experiences is being put in there by an enemy you Get it out Cat is that the same thing or does it accomplish the same thing? Because we weren't talking about deliverance But do some people lose from their soul and all of a sudden they've had deliverance from the demonic Is that well actually the father said it would accelerate the one thing he said to me is it will accelerate deliverance Okay I was a woman and she had had witchcraft spoken over her and they had uh in her family and they had books She said a red book one never never received it. She said but something's controlling me She said this after meeting it was like out west somewhere and and nobody was around. I said, you know what loose that book Loose the book if you remember the name of the book loose it because if you saw what it still went in your soul So first get rid of that so she got rid of that I said now you're going to evict you're going to loosen your soul the witchcraft trying to operate with you Up with you gonna lose it and she got to the words. I loose and tried to say it She couldn't even say she said something is choking me and my goodness Tell you the reality of the stuff and I said I put my hand here not hard And I said I want you to shout Jesus Christ after I say I choose to lose And you say I I choose I choose Jesus Christ I choose Jesus Christ as soon as you say that you say I lose witchcraft And she did she said I choose Jesus Christ and all of a sudden she goes I lose witchcraft And she said I felt it leave me I am free. I am so free. Thank you for helping me. Thank you for helping me And so in caught the father who told me you can lose those things that are trying to control you Uh, if you still do it in Jesus name, I've had people who were thinner These girls wanted to commit suicide because their boyfriend dumped them That's a serious thing and all I could think about was suicide suicide. So my one sister called me and said well I know they're not believers, but what will happen? I said, let me call them And I told him I said you're about to do something in the name of Jesus Christ You have to be willing to use his name if you want to be free and she goes I'll use his name I'll use his name. So what she's doing is reaching out to christ As her deliverer. That's what she was doing And so she said I I received christ I'm going to speak in his name should I choose with my will to lose suicidal thoughts And deep breath over and she said the guy's name I lose it now in Jesus name and then she stands for a minute and light came from her face And she said I'm so grateful to have Jesus Christ in my life now because you remember she had to receive it Should I have him in my life? I have no thoughts of suicide. There is no grief. Nothing. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone She said I'm going to follow him for the rest of my life and this was someone my sister just met on the street And and she looked like she was in really really not a good way. So guess what She's Jesus name It's like when people quiet up for healing you remember in the word when he said they asked him to be their healer He said that was the same as asking me to be their savior And he said not only to the people not only are you not only are you healed but your sins are forgiven Yeah So if you find someone in turmoil Tell them to do that. Tell them they have to choose Christ He is the deliverer and the restorer of our soul and no one else can do that for them You may go through a course for six weeks, but but is that going to get rid of that or is it going to make you feel better? Yeah, I mean it makes me think of I've had Um, oh, this is not anything recent or anything, but the some deliverance ministries They'll take you through hours and hours of stuff and it's complex and it's helpful and they name it They name the demons and they they cast a matter or whatever But what I'm sensing from you is you can get the same place. He took someone else four to eight hours to do That's right in in minutes if you know, it's not like there's It's not like what they're doing is wrong. It's just more like but it's not right at the same time if you can do it this way Is is it's for the kingdom age is for us operating in freedom and that you have to be free from the enemy Are free from things that crush you and take your life away from you It is really that simple and like I said, you may have to do it more than once if you've been if that's been happening a long time Yeah, it will it will it will have to leave you it will have to leave you and the same thing cat if someone is Again, I'm not asking for myself. Although there were times I used to have this but if someone Said I've done everything I can I can't forgive this person. I can't forgive my father. I can't get forgive my mother Do they do that? Do they say I lose unforgiveness for my soul? Is that what they could absolutely lose the Unforgiveness from their soul you can lose unforgiveness You can lose a fence from your soul any of those things that that be set us to hold us back You absolutely can lose all or any of those things from your soul Really the reason why you're doing it and experiencing it is because it's in there You know if someone's having an issue whether it's rage or anger or they're just they can't have any control of themselves It's always always a soul issue. It is always what's in your soul Awesome. Well, cat. Thank you so much. Um, hey quick. Tell people about your two websites and how they can get a hospitalist tell me to say one more thing Okay Okay, let them know that because they are the guardian over their soul of their children or the watcher over their soul Whether you adopted them or they are your own If someone's been bullied at school or maybe they were showing something They don't want to see and they keep seeing the images You can lay your hand on their head and you say as the watcher over their soul I choose with my will to lose from my child's soul All of the unjust criticism the cruelty the lies the abuse I lose it now the bullying I lose it from the soul in Jesus name and Jesus will come down and take the out of your child's soul And then I choose to bind the love of God the life of God to their soul and I have heard from parents That said it was gone when they prayed that over their children Well, and you could do that if there sound asleep, right? Didn't you say that one? You can do it while they're asleep It's what you're saying that you're believing for them and that means even children who were in an abusive situation and adopted Some of those things will hang around with those children if it just has been proven And so cash or try to help them but the help they need is for Christ to restore their soul So you as a parent have the right to pray that over any of your children's soul Those who you take care of like a child if you have adopted them And I was called down to Orlando to a teen center And I taught this to every worker in the center that probably was about 80 of them And they were crying after I was done because they said when he used to sit here with its drugs or its abuse We have to work a whole year just to gain their trust just to help them get rid of what they're experiencing inside We will be able to do it immediately And then that whole year can be spent So let me know Christ to learn how to operate with Christ and and they I heard from them since and they said is Spend the game changer for that whole place in Orlando that's been around for years They now lose all that stuff from their souls So good so good. Wow. I'm glad you added that part too. Okay. Go ahead and talk about your two websites now that Thank you for adding that stuff too. Yeah, I have a revealing heaven calm, which is the name of my book That's my main website where you can get products you can find out events from there I think there's testimonies on there. We're about to upgrade that one and also cat her calm That's k a t k e r r.com It's where you can get a lot of revelation given there's um tutorials on there teaching you some of the stuff I've been sharing say how to do that There's also a gallery that shows some of the things in the spirit world that they actually look like some in heaven some around the world And it's the only place you can give to me online I do not ask people to give to other people or the organizations because people are out there trying to cheat you Prove you that it's me saying this is a good thing. Give to it. I'm not going to do that If I was going to ask you that I'd tell you in person or write you maybe a personal letter or something But I'm not ever going to ask you to to give to them Okay, because that's your own personal decision if you want to give to somebody But if they're saying that's me saying that it is a lie It is not true. So don't believe anybody who sends you stuff like that They'll take my pictures and make a fake facebook or a fake youtube and they try to do it all the time But the stuff I say on my own is where truth is If i'm if i'm interviewed by people from my own website That is truth the truth makes you free Not lies and deception and I pray that you are free today and you can operate with christ in this day To give powerful things for him to be great for him In jesus name Amen, amen cat. Thank you so much. We love you. Love your team and I say give our regards to being he tells us a dad joke every now and then he comes on He's great. We're gonna have fun in israel Um in april.

You're helping us do go ahead and run that Giving a cup of cold water is a simple way to show someone they are valued That you care about them When Jesus talks about this Maybe what was trying to say if someone cares enough to stop and think about what you need Or what might help you and They actually do something about it. Wow Sacrificing for the benefit of another That is loving your neighbor Thank you for loving us For giving us a cup of cold water You give me a cup of cold water and me And me And me That was so good the young woman there that was telling that little sermon at whatever we might call that That was really even a teaching from the scriptures. It was so good. So I love that We are now we have not we're not only digging wells in Uganda But we we've dug some in Nepal and more to come and then we are providing fresh water now in several different ways in the state of Mississippi We're providing some water boxes that were put we're installing at some fire departments where people can come and fill up with clean water clean filtered water because Jackson Jackson, Mississippi. I think it's not Jacksonville Jackson, Mississippi has had a lot of water issues And so we're providing cups of clean water or in this case gallons and gallons of clean water at a time So there is some of the equipment that Emily was said we were going to show this last time. That's a water box see They're filling there's someone comes in at the fire department fills up their own water with their own buckets And we we're installing I think four of these either three or four depending on we've had we paid about a hundred thousand dollars to get These really expensive water boxes that are mobile But they they filter the water and so it's clean and send the local fire departments And let us put them there. So you see right there in the box. It says Elijah streams. So excellent So thank you for showing that and we appreciate that now quick quick Let me read this thing we have we're going to start every day giving you a 30-second spot about one of our Episodes of American Warriors.

I can We're gonna put chocolate cake so far. It's showing angel food cake, but that's that's a that's a good kind of game Anyway, welcome cat. How are you today? Well excited. We are back, of course from our covert activity in Mid-Florida that was actually during the storm people really really which really never affected us and by the way It actually had to skirt Jacksonville. It wasn't even allowed to come to Jacksonville. I don't know if anybody knows that No, we didn't know that I actually hit it with my staff and People think what is this crazy stuff you're talking about taking authority over the weather the other thing is I Never intended just so people know the weatherwaters have very specific Assignments when one starts to come when it's in the midst of it and even after it's done or goes off the coast or something I know that about maybe probably close to a third of America is in drought actually a lot of it's in drought So I fully intended to send that storm all the way up around the coast to where those drought areas were and if one comes Again, I'm going to send it out over the west because they they really are in serious drought And I think California's had fires already Have had fires, but we won't have any fires here We had plenty of rain and I'm not ignoring the fact that it did some damage down in Tampa But that wall of faith that we built is all along the east coast So I'm gonna have to get with a group seriously on the west coast and teach them how to build that wall of faith that Lines up with what the father said is when he made the ocean He made boundaries for the ocean and even says so in the word of God Then he made the land in the sea. He told the sea you will not pass over the land You must stay within the boundaries. I said for you true As weatherwaters we began to say that because most of the storms always would come up the tip of Africa up the east coast and then you know do damage everywhere and so We decided to use the words that God spoke himself and say you can't go beyond these bounds You will not come ashore and do destruction and we started doing that No storm has been able to come in along the east coast at all and they would even try to get close And they'd be bumped back out the sea We have records to prove that and so does the meteorologist. They don't know what's wrong That's what they say. We don't know what's wrong. And so it kind of has to sneak around how to come up the other side to do something But we drove through it on the way home from down near Orlando Yeah, the only thing we got was somebody's Construction orange cone was in the road. We did hit that but that was about it Now can't what do you say now some of people say well point out that that the Fort Mayer Beach area got hit really hard There was an island out there So is that an area where you weren't dealing with Fort Mayer? So you know? What would you say? It's on the west coast of Florida. Okay It's on the west coast of Florida So we have found that we can build these walls wall face by agreeing with what God said to the ocean himself And that's why that has worked powerfully here, but no one on the west coast has picked it up I I thought that to everybody no matter where you are in the Gulf. They've started to do something about that now But it's mainly that wherever you're at wherever you live is where your greatest authority is Okay, that's just the way it is right now. I'm sure it wasn't going to be anywhere We go, but some people are just beginning to take authority real authority over the storms and over the destructive weather I'm not changing what God put in place. He had these seasons for different reasons He needed them for the earth to either rest to be nourished or to make way for new growths to come There's a reason why he created weather, but he didn't create destructive weather Yeah, I see what you said authority over the storm He had authority over it because he was righteous of course as the son of God But he knew that he could speak to the weather and he was trying to teach the disciples to do the same thing and So that was one of the things given to me to start weather warriors and teach the body of Christ How to come against destructive weather and there's too many testimonies even talk about all over this country From people who operate in that who do take authority over it and know what to declare to it no matter whether it's a tornado if it's an earthquake if it's a flood whatever it is and We've been really successful according to the word of God taking authority That's just a work Christ did works the works I think you will do also that includes the weather But we are not we don't live on the West Coast I was in central Florida and Central Florida didn't get very much anything of all happening and we were even there during part of it And there was some wind some palm fronds and there was some rain But even in that place so I think the hardest hit was where it came in I think Punta Gorda and Fort Myers not that people weren't praying they were praying I'm sure some of them were praying but Really how to make a stand for where they live that destruction will not happen and cat Can I ask you a question about you? Let's see. I'm from California initially. I'm in Oregon now I was born in this state Oregon, but I was raised in California There has been so much drought in that state now if there was a big old front even if it was almost a Dangerous amount of water you would almost think that we'd need that thing to come Assure, how would you pray? It'll say if you live there and if you were if you were making a stand in Southern California where it's such a drought How would you make the right kind of stand so it's not destructive? But it gets that water in where it's needed. How would you pray? The first thing is I would begin to command low pressure systems to form Or to come a low pressure system is what brings the rain and actually God based the operations of weather on Pressure systems a high will bring in a dry cool air It helps with humidity if you have serious humidity stuff like that not that you'll take it away forever But we can actually make the temperature adapt to that so a high pressure system Will actually destroy a storm it will so if you have high pressure coming in you want the rain to remain Then you command the high pressure system to go off either to the west the east or wherever you need to go It to go to or you just command the low pressure system to come through quicker and bring rain That will not be destructive and you see it's it's really a whole thing that you're taught and there is and I always teach it For free and I try to do even at meetings when I go to them because they make a major difference People have stopped tornadoes may then go back up in the sky They have stopped lightning from striking and just circle in the sky They've they have caused the whole areas of their city not be destroyed because they've been speaking against when the weather people say You know, this is what's coming. This is what what this is what's involved in it Then you would know I actually have a manual a very simple For different things that when they start to come what you say Before it gets there while it's there and even after it leaves if you need rain You need to pray you just you can say I pray for rain But you need to command the low pressure system because you get to command You command because Christ commands not everything and not people ever You're not going to command people that's a waste of time your authority is used in the spirit realm But the devil has learned for many so many years how to take advantage and use weather to do destruction He didn't really have the right to do it, but he'll do whatever he can get away with so that's why the father had me begin Weather warriors and we have had floods recede I'm not kidding We've even put out forest fires in certain years because we would command a low pressure system to come with a great amount of rain And just rain until the fire was out There's all kinds of things you can do as a believer You don't have to sit there and be destroyed at all But if you need rain you can say father I declare rain to come in Jesus name I command a low pressure system to be in the form right now It will bring rain and the rain will remain until our ground has been watered and the earth has been nourished here And then it will go that's that simple. It's your faith It's still faith Steve. You still need faith. Yeah, you start trusting God Then you actually believe him and at one point you step into faith and from that moment in your life You should continue to let that grow and that's where the words we started speaking against I knew because when I was younger I would watch the weather just to see what they're gonna say And I would sometimes say that is not gonna happen Not understanding even what what authority I already had and the things wouldn't happen And then the fathers are doing the start weather warriors It'd be one of the first things the body of Christ will come in agreement Wow their denomination or whether they like anybody or whether you know, I don't like them There's this and that they won't care if destruction is had that way They will want to do it together. We have about 60,000 people who are now involved in weather warriors and pray in Really 60,000. Wow. Okay, so there'll be a time on years when we speak and these things will happen and people always say The manifest and sons and daughters will come in the land to see in the air But they don't know what that means. This is one of those things You will speak and the weather will follow the pattern the father made it to follow with no destruction involved and I had already spoken before when the father took me into the future and showed me a serious earthquake it was in California and I don't know who know who did this, but the father said this is This is a greater work that is coming and I know people for years have prayed But more people in California talk about the big one coming then they do stopping it. Yeah, they do Yeah, the words are seeding your atmosphere people is seeding your atmosphere Well, this always happens here. Well, probably will if you don't stop saying it your words have power and authority so I was taken into the future not not a long way and I saw a serious earthquake come and Expressway systems collapse buildings collapse people were dying and I was I was standing there and of course in my spiritual body But I was watching all this and all of a sudden one young man stands up and says I command you to stop moving earth I command you to cease earthquake, and I command you to put it back the way it was before you came Wow Those words the earth came back together the buildings came back together and the people who died were no longer dead Wow To me very poverty said that is a manifested son of God And that's what I mean when I say that the land the sea and the air will have to obey those That follow Christ that believe in him that do the works in greater works You will do also that was a greater work So it is going to happen people will begin to get it They'll get it and they'll start operating and it doesn't have to be everybody in the city But he does need people who actually believe What that you know there's a scripture that says if you confess with no believe what you're saying don't doubt your heart You should have what? You should have what you say. Yeah, whatever you say that is that is walking in authority That's called dominion in authority. That is occupying Occupy until I come Christ. Yeah That doesn't mean sit on your rapture rug That means take authority where you see that it needs to be taken and operate in the spirit with your faith and That faith does please God and you when you the more faith you have in the greater it gets then the greater things You'll be able to do for Christ or with Christ and the thing about the faith thing is that you know I pointed this for years in practice now and then God knows the exact level of faith that's emanating from you whether it's vibrations or whatever it is He knows so one you may have a minute from now an increased faith But five minutes from now it may reach a level of faith I think is that true your faith can grow even in a moment and all of a sudden grow very quickly because as you're speaking and Eventually we will when we move and get out of the place. We will have news and media Program or network. I'm not quite sure what it is and we will actually Teach people that way through those resources of having We're gonna have a weather. We're gonna have a weather. We will have a weather channel But we will all in the body of Christ begin to speak to the weather and we will keep our cameras where with it So they can see what is happening They speak the truth. This is what the father said. This is being added to your list And then you'll go broadcast things where things are happening and then you they will speak over the reporters One of our people will speak and you begin to see changes and people will join them. Wow cat And that's why the earth will be a totally different place to live in and God wants it to reach that level and Operating at that level see if you can see there will be no use for the antichrist No, there will be absolutely no need for him because the body of Christ will be operating in power authority with Jesus Christ and The mass miracles and the things that people see changing. They were one after they're after Jesus Christ at one point They don't want to know him and so that is one of the reasons why some of the harvest will be so great But I'm not talking about the last Harvest before we all get out of here But I will promise you there will be a catching away because he said there would but the rapture will not be a rescue party This is from Holy Spirit himself. The rapture is not a rescue party It will be a celebration of all of us operating such power authority that God just has to have us That's why that's good Christ will not be able to appear or have authority on the earth until we're gone Because he can't you serve the authority? We're already operating in after all these generations He won't be able to do it and the Bible says into he that remains is removed That's the body of Christ the antichrist cannot appear and so we have to get greater in authority and dominion And our faith is going to change. It's gonna get greater And so he gave us weather warriors sort of this is how you start this is what you begin Yeah And people faith everywhere has grown so much to see even in this storm that went on there Well, I was rescued there were miracles that happened because people were declaring and taking authority and I know two places not this time But one of them when there was great floods coming and God said tell them to begin to stomp on the ground and command the water To go down and before their eyes it did really happen in more than one place Okay, I wanted to ask you right a few minutes ago, and I wanted to get circled back to this You said I took my staff and I pounded it down. So my question was You were you're in Jacksonville, Florida? Harry, did you do it there? Did you do it on a map? You have a map in front of you did it on a map? What what what did you do that had the that had the effect that you're talking about? That was before I got to Jacksonville, Florida. Okay, we had to leave Orlando in return of course because well, we just had to come back and And so I actually started speaking to it when I was in Orlando. I didn't waste any time I went out and sent the host on as the host are always sent to shred the bands of the storm. So these hurricanes We we know pretty much how to speak to them and we know there's gonna be some kind of results Every now and then one's actually stopped and it never goes anywhere or it's shredded in the morning But this storm here that we just had come here was I know that the devil's real purpose was to set it up through the entire State of Florida mass destruction. Well, that was not gonna happen Not on my watch or the weather warriors watch and I was not tolerating it even coming through my city And I did hit it with the staff. I hit it and I said you're gonna get off and you're gonna go quickly But when you go through the wall of faith that's been built along the east coast because if it was going to go back out In the ocean actually had to go through that side of it. I said when you go through there, you will be shredded and The next day after that happened people woke up in this city and went where did the storm go? Where did it go? It was in pieces people. That's where it was. It was in pieces Well, even the tail of the storm was not allowed to stay on the east You mentioned the bands the destructions in the bands a lot So do you speak to the bands and say I want you to disintegrate you? You know, do you speak to them? Do you name bands to having to go and shred those bands of the storm? Okay, because one this one of those bands begin to separate it loses power. Yeah No, I send the host to do it. Yeah That's good. And so the one clarification when you so before you were in Jacksonville But because you had authority over Jacksonville, you were in Orlando area. You took authority with your staff while you were in Orlando about Something to represent in my staff that that's where I hit the storm But when I got here, I actually went out to the beach area Okay, I guess some of the bands were beginning to come through we kind of got ahead of it And I my husband with me and we stood right out there and there was rain and there was wind blowing I I told I told it again It was getting offshore and it was going because I was standing in why that wall of faith that was built It goes out some miles offshore along the and I was standing there And that's when I was telling you will be shred as you go through there gonna be shred You will have no longer have the image of the hurricane and when that begins to fall apart the storm falls apart It just does and then the high pressure can grow the high pressure going up into the storm That's what it was saying also in Orlando I've come in the pressure to begin to raise because when the pressure goes up the storm can't get any Greater it can't and then it will actually begin to be downgraded And I remember in Hawaii when that huge massive storm was due to hit the next day and all the weather channels were saying Hawaii will be wiped out We have powerful weather warriors in Hawaii and I told them to agree that that the the host would come and take the head off The storm just take it off the storm. It would fall apart And I still we somewhere have a copy of that weather report from the Hawaiian Islands the next day going what happened There was nothing left of it. It was nothing. It was like something came and took the head off of it It fell apart completely Destruction was there ever we don't understand and then they then we would take other channels And they were all beginning to say that that year was a great year to to take authority and people everywhere begin to take it And so we actually saved some of those weather channel reports and them saying we don't know what happened It's gone, but this one especially I think all of my friends and the weather warriors in Hawaii said you stayed up You did a great job. The head of that storm was totally just taken off. There was no I left there was no kind of nothing left and So people need to know that if you have received Jesus Christ, he said I give you power I give you power the things I did you will do you should expect to do them But if you never step out and I'm not saying God, I pray this won't you can go ahead and still say that if you want to He wants us to take authority. He wants to see us rule Jesus Christ said you'll rule with me now in this life So you're saying it's not that you should say dear Lord, please take the story It's like saying I take authority over this storm. That's a totally different thing. It is a totally different thing It's called it's called you're using faith Yeah, the Lord said when I return will I find faith? He said that in the word because he wants to see us use our faith and yes we were given authority in the earth as the body of Christ and We demonstrate that by doing those things and it's going to get greater and greater So the days that we're now are not the end of everything because we've only just begun to do these things Yeah, and the father wants them seen for generations to come us taking authority and what we do is we represent Jesus Christ We show people that he's real because we're using his name We're doing the things that he did and that's what he said to do. You cannot use them against people I have to keep saying that because people want you know want to send a host to kill their whatever or whoever That's never gonna happen. They're not gonna do that, but you need to understand who you are first Who are you? What are you talking about? Do you talk more about the devil's exploits? Or Christ's conquest because you should be talking about the kingdom the kingdom of the gospel the kingdom of heaven That's what should be coming out of your mouth no matter who you talk to you can't repeat everything the devil is doing That's all that's gonna be in your soul. That's the only conversation you'll have with people How is that directing them to know or want to know Jesus Christ? And when you do these things You you must be very aware that you what you did and what you with that wall of faith that you built and what you Go out there with your staff and you might literally be saving billions upon billions of dollars in damage And I know of course you always have people usually Christians People don't make fun of us or lapidus the Christians who are clueless to who they are themselves Say we're wasting time or we're not supposed to be who are we Jesus Christ? And I always say I'm just like him because that's why That's why I received him. That's why he wanted me to do this. This was his commitment to us Take dominion take authority. That's what he said to us He didn't say to be afraid and run and hide. Yeah He was very clear the works I do you will do and greater works in these because I go to the father is very very clear, isn't it? And yet you'd be surprised how many people bash the weather warriors for taking authority And I'm like, well, you don't even know what the word says Well, you know, and then there's exactly the works of Christ. That's what we're doing We're trying to help people save lives, you know, let them know he cares, you know He's the one he's the only one who can give us authority to do this But you still have to choose to do it So don't waste your time bashing people and this is what the father said if they're out there bashing the good works We're doing that's because they have no they have no vision their self They have no plan their self to do anything with God So what they do is go around and find people who are doing and they spend their time bashing them Yeah, it's yes That's not helping the body. That's certainly not helping the image of Christ was so slow on another and care about one another If you don't want to do it, that's fine pray for the people who do Yeah, I mean we used to call that there wasn't I won't say the gentleman's name I'm sure he's alive anymore, but after Walter Martin died Who was a pretty well balanced teacher another guy came along and he became a heresy hunter And all he did was look around for all the errors that the body Christ and he decided he was God's gift to point out all the errors And there was no life in that Yeah, yeah, it was not a gift it was a It's almost like a curse. It was like taking the enemy's accusations You know anyway, it's it's really bad. So what'd you look up? You looked up at something just now you looked up? Oh There's all kinds of things in this room to look at if I was gonna get distracted. Yeah, anyway, well anyway High-fiving each other see that's what they're doing. Awesome. I love that I mean, they have a lot more sense of humor than we really don't they I mean, there's some serious ones. I think you said before but there's also some hilarious ones and that's their gift They're angelic gift is there funny and they're humorous and there are some that are very funny and God always sends them with one who is not He explained to me the two scribe angels were signed to me. They're still here because I haven't written book three yet they'll be with me until I'm done with book three and One is very serious and you know, he likes he likes He likes setting the fire of God places to do things to wicked people and and he would rather do about they talk about that kind of stuff He's out, but the other one is hilarious And I'm gonna tell you the names but one actually means holy one and the other one who's funny. It means humorous Humorous he kind of bugs the other one and father said this is why I do is that there's no other way? Really to have them rub against each other, you know, like a husband or wife dust We help each other kind of die We learn to die Yeah, you know, I don't think of the angels is needing to learn that or learn to die. Yeah, but you're saying they need to learn too, huh? So the father will find total opposite You didn't send them on assignment. He'll let them know I'm watching you Seem more real now every angelic being whether a member of the host of the under Gabriel or under Michael They have personalities. They have favorite things. They like yeah, like where they like to see they like to eat I do know they eat man up with the more than men and heaven people and And people always ask me I want yes You will get to meet your angel and know them in heaven and they won't belong to you and they won't serve you like a butler So I've had that question asked to No, no, they're they're free from having to take care But you will get to see them and I'm always amazed at they have their own places. They live in heaven. They have They do have angel games, which is probably where the Olympics came from. I'm quite sure And it's sort of like extreme sports. It is like that but but the angels with the What the way he's he's gifted them because they Very cool the things that they carry the things that they can do and stuff like that They do and it's not the only reward they get is that Christ is always there to watch them and they love that they love him Very much, especially the army does a lot but but they Actually will fellowship during big meetings, which is one of my favorite things to do is sit there I just got back from open the heavenly and And angels were everywhere They're saying hello to each other. They they will give each other if they want it to become They don't know everybody every angel doesn't know every single angel in heaven. Okay, there's millions of them there And they do they have friends they have friends they do things with and everything in heaven or they help work on projects in heaven together But the one thing they always do is sometimes we will exchange like an address with somebody back Yeah, I say hi. Oh gosh. I like your story. I I'm so happy I can meet you You came from a home state can can we kind of stay in contact to let's change addresses We used to they exchange feathers with each other. Oh, really Wow, so it's almost like a friendship rain a friendship necklace a friendship feather So wow and I so I see that a lot in big meetings because everybody's guardian angels come with them They come and they get to attend the meeting they'll sit there and they get more excited sometimes I think from the people do Hearing what's being sad because they know what truth is they recognize it But they do they do have friends and sometimes they get to see them if you go to the same meeting Maybe three years later or something else though. They they still know that they know each other, so I love that I love it Well, Kat anything else before we I've got questions for you. Did anything else that you want to share? Before I was mainly going to talk about the weather thing so people would understand Now literally there were millions of people praying I got I got so many tests and so many messages people saying we're standing with you We're praying we're agreeing with you in florida in florida, you know for everybody that was there And I love to see those kind of reports that people are with us together with the body of christ praying for one another And so that also I've seen a lot more of that happening That the body is becoming closer the body that's listening that knows that there is a god they love jesus christ And it may be some simple person You've never heard of before but some of them are some of the best intercessors ever And now along with their intercession they actually will command the army of heaven also They'll command they'll send the host now in their prayer closets They'll do it all the time and they make strategic times on their even on their calendar to send the host different places So that makes me happy seeing people step into something that christ clearly did He commanded the army of heaven and the things he did that is one of the things that we will be doing And it's really starting to make a major difference in the atmosphere of the spirit realm itself And even now when I go places, I'm seeing less and less darkness spiritual darkness over places because of people taking authority and Bearing yes, I am And I know the news the fake news are never going to say anything about it But I can tell you from the ones who know about the foundation of this whole woke thing this whole thing That's been been trying to shove in our faces Is falling apart and the spirit realm can't lie The spirit realm shows clearly what's happening in the spirit realm between goodness Between the light and the darkness and and of the evil You know god over the evil and what's happening in there things are already changing Setting up for what's going to happen in the natural that I am probably the most excited about awesome, so yeah, I mean we You've talked about this like they're um I mean we could get off in all kinds of tangents here, but I mean you talked about One day and I can't christmas. I just saw him prophesy Not not necessarily the one where you were all right, although I saw that too, but he's quite a prophet But he said at times coming when god's going to wave his hand and a lot of people who are stuck in Homosexuality will just begin healed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and you've mentioned that Is that part of what you're saying and things are getting ready to fall apart? um from the dark side And is it is that is god chipping away at at that? for instance that area of Sin homosexuality and one day he goes okay. That's enough the rest of it just goes And it and it's just largely gone or what I think for him. It's more Of the layers he's building around okay Okay, I know you said chipping away. I understand why you said that but but for god when things begin to change It's what he's putting there. Okay, but he's putting in places or over places over cities I can see layers of light Uh hovering over whole cities and the darkness when they see that begin to leave that area they don't want to be They don't want to get caught in that when when it gets brought down to over these different cities And and you know it says he even says can a city be changing today? You know, uh, when I know they were talking about israel can Israel be saved in a day There will be times in that thing that begins to happen It will it will begin to happen and I do know he specifically mentioned And groups of people to me probably maybe I don't know five six years ago Maybe even before that before that he did but even more so now that yes All a lot of these people who are in confusion who's believed deception and living a different kind of life It will be in a day in a day He will wave his hand and and every single one of these people Involved in these certain things their eyes will be open and they will dump the darkness and run into the kingdom They will run so good so good man. I hope there's angels high-fiving with that too I mean, yeah, that's such good news because It has gotten to be so dark and we've talked about this And starting about seven eight years ago when we were talking about you said it's not really actually getting darker darker It's that he's ripping the veil off. He's exposing how dark it's been So in reality, you know, I use the term chipping away, but you're saying in reality He's putting layers of light and light and light and pretty soon. That's all that can remain. It sounds like Yes, because see the the evil Can't operate in an atmosphere of nothing but light They can't I'm talking about people at this point. Yeah They really can't operate when the presence of god is so great There's no evil spirits around To help commands, which they don't think they can command, but they're just being used by the devil Uh, there's not a lot they can pull on to do evil things. That's basically the way it is the regions of light Evil will not want to be there Crime will not be even evident in regions of light and that's what he's really beginning to prepare the regions of light to be shown um he reveals the good And exposes the evil and all these several years he's been doing almost nothing but exposing evil But the whole time he's been exposing the evil. He's preparing to take that away And in when in doing that he makes deposits. I think thank you, holy spirit He'll begin to put deposits of his presence deposits of the glory of god deposits of all these different things over areas right now And now the wicked the wicked the spirit in the spirit realm they can see it They don't want nothing to do they they can't stop that from happening And I don't care how long people have been evil or evil spirits been wrong. They cannot stop god From doing what he wants to do When he has people on the earth willing to work with him to do those things that makes us very dangerous against hell Can I ask you this about the air? We've talked about it in the past. I think I can't remember what you said Well about hollywood because it's one of the darkest areas Of sin because there's so much junk going on behind the scenes Even a cultic worship and all of that kind of stuff luciferian stuff Is the same thing happening as god even as we speak is he building layers of light? If you've seen any of that In hollywood or what he is but actually the angels that the city is named for City of angels is what lost the angeles. The word angeles is angel people Yeah, it's the city of angels and it actually will be probably called the city of angels Uh, I do know that when I was there a few years ago and I was speaking I was shown these angels that have been there forever With these urns and they were pouring out Before the last time I when I left they actually poured oil on the whole city and anointed that city in the spirit realm Whoa god Whoa, so that's really good news. Yeah, that would that would be something I would try and pray out of you Thank you for doing it because a lot of people there's a lot of people that have been praying for that and there was someone that I Talked to a number of months ago and they said well, we were going to minister And then they learned out some of the actual occultic things that were going on where they were going to minister And I think they pulled off because they didn't realize the darkness that they were dealing with so Yeah, I just think god's gonna need to help them. Well, I've got some questions here Let me start with the kids one seven-year-old mackayl m-i-k-a-l. I don't know if that's a Michael or mackayl. I don't know. It's a boy or girl. Sorry, but mackayl wants to know Why did god create adam as an adult and not a baby? That's what mackayl seven-year-old wants to know There's a very good reason because he needed people on the earth A baby can't have a baby people and that's what he made adam and eve so that they could create They with him And bring all those I don't know how many they ended up by doing together themselves But the reason why he made it male and female was when they come together Of course, you know babies come and those little spirits of life that live in the father At the time of conception He takes one of those from himself and knits it together in the womb With that little daughter flesh that was just created and that is when life begins right then And that's when the baby begins to form and grow and then eventually it's birthed into the earth And uh, and he made this so that we we all lived in him. We were little spirits who were still us Um, we didn't really have a name yet And maybe not all of our personality was there, but you can think of billions of them living in the father Crazy and that's that's where we came from Okay, now adam's body was made but we Lived in god our little spirit a little spirit person with our soul in the spirit And that's how he creates human beings at that little dot a flesh at conception one of those and he says I knit you together in your mother's womb That's what he did Because you were still you that's what he said. I knit you together So he's saying you were with him I don't think people even get that and that you together But you were already here but in him So he took your spirit with your soul in it and knit that and attached that to that little dot of flesh And then the spirit grows with the baby inside the baby and uh, and so He's ever been you've been from the beginning to the end because you were there with him in the beginning of time And you've been to the end when we won't need time because god's already been there We were in him and we would move in and out on the rays of the rainbow We saw everything that there was out there to see You know, that's an interesting question of this young child because I never really stopped and pondered it But the only two human beings that ever lived that were never a baby first We're adam and eve unless i'm forgetting something You know, I think Is this when he when he made animals He made animal he made the chicken people not the egg first. Yeah Yeah chicken that could lay eggs, but he bought the all the animals were created also that way Okay, he didn't send them to the earth to be little baby things He sent him as you know, those who could create the little baby the chickens were laying the eggs Okay, yeah, but they got he didn't send an egg to exist on its own So that's just the way he's always done it. He made sure that those babies when they came They had parents to take care of them His whole thing about be fruitful and multiply Yeah, he ranked with all these adult creatures and adam and eve and then he says now multiply and fill the earth um, it wasn't I mean in in human thought it takes weeks Before all of a sudden the babies are coming all over the earth, right? So But through the animals, but all right, so Julie is our producer Julie Smith, you know, Julie So she don't ask me if I would ask you this question. She says okay to use her name So she's saying can't my mom passed away two years ago today She was a mighty warrior over her family since she passed I've seen many prayers. She's prayed for her family Come to pass and I know many more will as well A couple of days ago. I asked the lord what mom is doing right now and I immediately heard quote She's cheering you on close quote. I know this includes prayers over her family Yet has the lord revealed what else what else cheering us on Means in heaven and do our loved ones in heaven fully know our destiny on earth that is still yet to come So what he's asking? I guess what does it all mean cheering him on a lot of questions? But I can I can't answer I can't answer them I do see people cheering us on my own dad Um every now and then I'll hear him say something and not not real often Every now and then he'll say that was that was great. You did a great job. You got it that time I mean, I don't have to say that That was pretty pretty close to my dad And um, but I do know they go to the portal that we have shown people pictures of that And um and actually I might as well show it now But we actually created a smaller size to them So almost anybody can get them if you want to give them as gifts or something Uh, I just had it in my heart is one of the most important things that the father gave me was to take me to this portal They're all over heaven They're huge beautiful buildings that people go in there and walk up a stairway They literally look over a railing and when they look down They see their loved one on the earth now one thing they don't see they don't see death and destruction But they see you uh when you get married they see when you have a baby They know if you've been rewarded for something they know if you did good deeds Uh, but every year on your birthday, they especially go there and declare over you They sing actually happy birthday to you and yes, they cheer us on because god What he knows when something's gonna happen. So he'll let us know he'll let everybody know Uh, your loved one is about to have a child. You need to go to the portal so you can watch it And so people get to watch these things and they're going. Yay. That's great. Yay. We're so happy And so they don't miss those happy moments in your life. And so that's what he meant when he told her That she was cheering her on she was cheering her family on and the other thing is the prayers she prayed My dad prayed my grandmother prayed my great-grandmother prayed It's still circling in the atmosphere until they are fulfilled. That's all my dad I know he prayed for every one of us. I know he did. I know he prayed for certain people And if I'm in a place where it was that he was I can hear the words I can go into a building and hear prayers that were already prayed And somebody invited me they built uh, they took a piece of property and they built um a christ a church And then across they built a big school And they always felt the presence of god in the school They didn't know why so they invited me to come to walk in there. Did I see anything? Did I hear anything and I was almost went down on the floor Really of prayer. I found out it used to be a place of prayer not labeled a place of prayer But great intercession took place in that building And I literally could hear the prayers and I began saying out loud what I was hearing and they they got totally undone That this is where the students now go in this place that has the presence of god so strong because prayer took place there And that's incredible Sometimes people walk past me steve and I hear things coming off of their clothing Really? Yeah, such as give an example If you can think of one well, sometimes it's good sometimes it's not really good Okay, I know one time I was out somewhere Excuse me at a place a nice place people went there to have fun and stuff. I think there was like a Sort of like an amusement park type of thing There are people coming from all over the world and I would see things with them that weren't really good And so I just on purpose. I didn't want to necessarily stand next to them Uh, I might start saying something to the spirits who are with them and then the people I don't I don't want I don't want to make people afraid so I'm gonna go off somewhere Then I would speak against the spirits I saw with them But I was standing in line to get on this boat ride And and there was a woman there and I won't tell you what her she wasn't from America. She's from another place Demons started coming out of her Really and I turned around And I shoved my husband I shoved him. He's always he's used to strange things like this I said get back and get out of the line Well, he didn't even wait any more just because he said what I've said their demons coming out of that lady over there And I want to say something about it, but I can't do it behind her and I'm not getting on the boat because I'll be saying I'm on the boat And I did I broke the power of the enemy off of her life. I commuted them to go Uh, or to shut them out. Were you talking out loud cat? Were you talking out loud that she could hear this or what? No, no, she couldn't hear me. Okay. You need to hear me They needed to hear me. Okay They probably were leaving her because I was behind her. I see. Okay. Well, that's helpful right there So the presence is with me all the time men or where I go there's always things reactions in the spirit realm if I go somewhere And it's no different than no different than paul or peter is that when you walk past them his shadow heal them That was the cloud of anointing coming from him Well, I have a large cloud of anointing and it impacts whatever is going to be there with me So I think that's what happened, but I wanted to say something so I knew I couldn't say it right then because The lady would have to be afraid and leave and so I went off where they could hear me Um, but I didn't go on the boat with her because I knew I'm gonna be laying hands on her and then they'd throw me out And um, I was wanting to help her Yeah, but I see things I see things like this everywhere and I'll let god tell me pray for them Uh, that's dude. That's for someone else to pray for or whatever So tell me what to do about each situation with that one was I was kind of kind of surprised And I mean they were like a lot of them coming out and I'm like, I just wanted to put you get back That was really good I gotta pray I gotta pray so he goes, okay, but let's go up here. Okay. Go ahead and pray and you know, my husband is The perfect person for me because he doesn't get excited about much. No, he's very mellow being is is a mellow guy He's Yeah I won't say any more about all that, but anyway, he's great. Yeah over it And uh, and some I could see leaving from where they were just leaving they would just disappear, disappear, disappear And then I just left I sent the presence of god to that woman to begin to surround her that she would know christ And so but that's the whole thing about me going anywhere even to the mall. It's like not normal Yeah, well, I understand that more and more. Hey talk about for a minute. Okay. You said like of our loved ones So I would have for instance in my loved ones I'm sure that I had a lot of them were praying families But many of them had really really wrong doctrines But they loved god to the ability that they were able to love him They understood about the cross more or less they got that but they would be praying now with their prayers Although albeit sometimes they would they were probably prayed amiss. They were praying Make them Sabbath keepers lord and god wasn't interested in making them Sabbath keepers He was interested in making their followers of christ. Would their prayers be circulating and accomplishing things? I think the prayers that that remain are the ones that you usually pray over your family members Okay, it's always about christ to know christ to have a great relationship with christ to understand who they are in christ Those kinds of things like that those those are the prayers my dad prayed and my grandmother prayed Or for people she knew that didn't know christ those prayers remain They're productive prayers. Yeah, and he won't remove the words the words that you speak actually remain They saturate your clothing So or they saturate you Depending on even what side you feel with the darkness you feel the light Um, but but a lot of people like the building I walked into the prayers and the words and the and sometimes it was worship I heard saturates the walls Wow, that's what heaven also, but it saturates that place And is the lord cat is the lord? How do you know how to ask this question is the lord therefore constantly hearing those prayers in the air? Yes, even though it may be two or three generations later. He's hearing those. He's still hearing those prayers Yes, that's fascinating because I've never been caught that You know, we've always always thought their works do surely follow them and you know, he remembers the prayers But I think of them as they were prayed and he's got them in his hand or a bucket or something But you're saying no, they're circulating even come up before the throne of god. Okay Interesting interesting. All right. Let's see. You've got a time for a few more questions here Um, okay. This is a cute one. This is a mom asking about her two-year-old son since Mallory is asking since I began commanding the host A few months ago almost to the day my two-year-old son began talking to me about cow c o w cow In his room every night. He smiles at him talks to him tries to feed cow his snacks shows cow His toys and has described him as what I believe to be a host Have you ever seen one that looked like a cow? My son has always seemed to see in the supernatural even as young as he gets Interesting question Probably more than likely is a member of the host because I keep telling people most of them look like creatures like The royal guard all look like lions That is a tribe the host as well as gaverals are all made angels are made in tribes the first tribes were in heaven And so all of gaverals has they different tribes of angels some are the guardian angels some are like scribes some are Like courier angels some would be for different They're bringing mantles down or they bring body parts down from the warehouse Those are all tribes and those members of those tribes do the same type of thing Because he needs so many to do different things. They would do that The hosts are also made in tribes and that is usually depicted by they are usually Like assigned to one type of thing like they wore in one type of a battle or they wore with certain weapons And when he needs those weapons he sends them to the different places he needs them in some of the hosts are Are a weapon themselves the way he puts them together and that's hard to explain but most of the hosts of the armies of heaven I see them as creatures And there are some that have heads that look like Remember the ox? Yeah, yeah, what did he say one has the head of a what? Yeah, that would be like a cow Yeah, it would wouldn't it it would so he might well have seen Yeah, something that would have had of an ox it would look like a cow little boy. Oh interesting fascinating, okay, so Okay, Susie asked is we get a lot of questions about have you seen this person or that person in heaven Here's Susie Goose is her handle Susie Goose asked has can't see never can either in heaven I've been studying Jeremiah and Daniel and though the king never can either acknowledge Daniel's god is real And encourage people to worship Daniel's god Did he finally do the same that's her question About that I'm pretty certain that he is there. I mean even the fact that he recognized god for who god was Um, that was actually why the father created a paradise which is in the earth where Were the those who believed in god before christ came along they believed that there was god He wouldn't they died he'd send them there. He didn't send them to hell or hades That was for the wicked and the evil and of course that place is empty because when christ died on the cross One of the things he did when he went down into the earth Before he went into hell He had to go into hell it mentions that he had to take back the keys of hell death and grave wipe up hell Show Satan that he had no power over the son of god He was in paradise first and when he was there Uh christ saw ever ham isaac jacob but many more who believed and knew there was god and would speak to god They didn't call him a sign or something christ actually went there and it said christ led captivity captive He preached the gospel to all those in paradise and once christ Left hell on the third day and came back in his body when he was the first resurrected from the dead At that time many of those all left and went up to heaven when christ finally went back to heaven To pour out his blood on the mercy seat That's what happened after he came up into the grave and he told mary remembers he told mary I had to go to my father and your father that was father god in heaven And he had to pour out that blood on the mercy seat as evidence that he paid that price And at that time all the ones who who received him of course in in paradise And you also remember that it said that people saw the dead walking around Yeah, yeah, they did hundreds of them that they saw them walking around And that i'm quite sure happened at the time that probably when christ was preaching to them When he was what speaking to them Yeah, when they they all received him every one of them in there Yeah, you can imagine how long that had been going on adam and eve were there I mean a long time Prepared a long time well, okay, um I I wanted to ask a follow-up question on that because never can answer you hadn't seen him But you you're you're assuming that he probably is there I've wanted to ask what about cyrus? There's a scripture that says though. You did not know me I did this and this and this through you, you know and people talked about trump being a modern cyrus But that scripture says that though cyrus did not know him. He had a calling honestly Do you know anything about whether cyrus ended up in heaven? No, I don't know anything about that the father will probably tell me now that you asked that question He probably will eventually tell me uh I have I have seen many many many many many many many people in heaven Some people think there's a handful there and they'll know there's a lot of people There are millions of people already in heaven So it's not like it's like you sort of walking in new york city and thinking can I see somebody? It's almost kind of like that. There's some yeah And I don't just walk around and have been looking for somebody they always escort me where they want me to go Or what they want me to see uh seeing I do know john Wayne made it That was really good. I know the disciples are all they're except not judas Yeah at all And neither hit people you know that may um Come into the question that I wanted to ask one of the okay, so Here is sherry is asking this at the time of the new earth Okay, the new earth is created. Where is hell located? Is there any way the spirits of the people in hell Will be destroyed so that they do not have to suffer forever. So that's an interesting question That is not what the word of god says at all Hell will be empty because nothing will be in hell and this whole earth will be gone It says so in the bible He's going to wrap it all up. It will not exist at all But the lake of fire will exist but it won't be on the new earth But it will be forever where whatever he put that Uh, it's still be a spiritual place of torture not a physical place Um, so I just know that the lake of fire will exist. It says they'll burn forever never That's why it's important to pray for people. I have a question to ask about a follow-up on that because I've known some people some are even close to me Relative wise but one of them Anise told me a few years ago. Well, you know, she's got a church and she's She's a co-pastor at her church Uh, but she says but we don't believe in hell anymore. Now. I'm assuming she believes in jesus christ Talk about if you if you have anything to say about Because you're not saved by The way you correctly believe on hell you're saved by grace In in in jesus christ as your savior to talk about what you would say to someone Or about the situation where someone says I just don't believe in that. I don't believe in hell. What what would your thoughts be? Well, the first thing I would do is tell them my experiences that I had when I was taken into hell In a while I was taken there and explained that this word of god that That god had written Is uh, it's a book to live by it really gives you the truth about how to live how to live for him with him And his plans his plans he had for man his plans He had for this earth and then of course We know the end when he says the end will come and the bible says the end will then come That means the end of time. We won't need time anymore But this earth we're on right now will not exist it clearly says he will make a new one That doesn't mean he will remodel this one again because the new one will be so massive Uh, even just because the city of god that's going to be on there. He would have to make it massive Yeah, probably gonna be bigger than our whole entire galaxy the new earth I would really assume to do that. I've seen parts of it that I can tell you that We don't need time. We won't need calendars things are always done by events in heaven And you know, there is the jewish people have a calendar they follow. Um Just so you know, not everybody in heaven is a jew Uh, there are jews there who receive christ and many of them do that right almost at their death Many of them. He'll appear to them. He just does Um, he appeared to those who were in abraham's bosom or paradise at the same place And god kept them because of their faith in him for believing that there was a god The world talks about that too But everything changed when christ came and died for us from that moment christ is the one you paid the price That all evil and every sin that could ever be committed. He had to carry that in his body That was destroyed on the cross and he's the only one who can say I receive your repentance and yes, uh, yes, I will when they ask him to be their savior That's what you're doing. You're saying I recognize who you are. You're the only one who can forgive sin So i'm repenting on my sin. I want I want to belong to you I'm inviting you to come and and be in me and be my savior forever. That's a significant thing because there's no other being ever That ever existed that paid the price for your sins to be forgiven So just because you say well, I like how they do this or we do it this way because of this Uh, your life at one point you must give it to jesus christ. You must receive jesus christ And uh, the one good thing that's uh, is happening now is christ does have the keys of hell death in the grave Which means he can go At the very moment of your death and say do you want me now if you've got people praying for you to know him That's surely going to happen But you're the only way into heaven Is through jesus christ There's no other way. Yeah Didn't send you to hell on purpose. He actually made a way because he loves you. He made that way Back to him where you used to live in him. He made a way and that's what the word says christ paid the price No one else paid the price and he was god And yet came to the earth lived the man lived righteously And was he laid down his life and paid the price with his blood That that blood when you receive christ washes away every sin you ever had like you never did it That gives you entrance into heaven when you die It gives you all the eternity to be with them when your family members who go there That's what you do. You're securing that for for your all eternity That's good. Would you believe something is good? That is not well, i'm god showed you how Multiple times at least i i think and because he wanted people to know hell is real Otherwise, he kind of just kept it to himself and said they'll find out You know, but he's he wants you he's taken other people to hell as well so that they can talk about it Right other people kind of like you as well. I have a question about I wanted to ask you this before I don't think I ever have when we lived in him before We lived in the father before And he's getting ready to send us down to here's mom and dad and he knows this is where he's Does he Tell let's say me does he tell me when I'm in him. This is your life. This is what you're going to go through these are some of the things you're going to affect you and do you still want to go do you receive this this um Plan for your life or or is that none of that It's shared with us. We just come down and what happens. I think there's a part that is shared um, I remember laying in god's hand and him talking about Really really some of the things he told me wasn't just about my life, but the future itself Uh, but I clearly remember laying in his hand looking at him. I would lay like on my stomach and just stare at him I was so fascinated with him and uh, there's a holy hill inside of him And we could choose to run up that hill and he would put his hand This is deep stuff inside of his mouth and we would climb in and then he would bring us out and he would that's how I was in his hand. Wow and it says Who shall I have my tent? Who shall ascend my holy hill? um That holy hill is inside the father And there's a lot of footsteps going up. There's some going up and coming back that didn't mean you weren't important That means you made a choice even then. I'm gonna pursue. I'm gonna I'm gonna know him I want to know this person that I'm living in we knew we were living in him because we would write out the rays of the Rainbow when it would go in and out of him because the stones of fire were in there the river of life which produced that Holy, uh, it looks like the northern lights. It's bands that come in and out Like there's a band of teal blue Gold I mean they just come out the most beautiful But there's always these little spirits that can we can jump on them and ride in and out of him That's what we used to do. We couldn't leave him. We couldn't live somewhere else in him. We live We move we have very existence. Oh, wow. That's how that goes. That is exactly what that scripture means And the other half of that scripture says the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things So there was a time on the earth when prophets who knew this and God showed them They knew that's how we lived we they knew it And so people think well, there's nothing in there. Yes, there is you need to read your bible more We lived in the father He was our father. We are his offspring the bible is very clear about that Well, guess what when I had a child that was my offspring that came from out of me So everyone who ever lived or existed on the earth they all we were all at one point in him And he didn't start sending us Until he made Adam Right Made the body Then the father the the word stepped out because that was Jesus's name also when the father spoke the word stepped out of him And made a form in the ground and they made the body of Adam and it was perfect and amazing But there was no life in it Then the father leans over who was carrying Adam's spirit And it says he breathed the spirit of life Into Adam's nostrils and Adam became a living soul. That's exactly what the word says That's proof we came from the father and he was our dwelling place And I love that scripture because I know what that means And that's what you were You remember him Did you said you remember him talking to you about did did he tell you anything about what your life would be that you would ever remember that? And you know, I didn't always remember that but there came a point in my life where he began to show me Okay, you know When he was training me to do things he actually caught me up and showed me And then of course there was the time in 2010 when I began to say to him I want my heart to be like your heart I want to be just like you because you know, you say that to your father if you love your father You say that to your father I want to I want to be I mean, of course, I adore Jesus christ and still do he was my beloved He always has been I spent 20 years just Approaching christ to know him and one day he walked in the wall of my house and he's never stopped coming So he was first I I received christ at age four. That's a long time ago A very long time ago. So good 70 human years ago I was born and then four years after my birth I could see angel. I mean, I already saw angels. I saw them. I wanted to know him in our home We heard about Jesus every day of our life. It was just the way my dad was. That's what he he loved the father He loved the son So I grew up knowing them but at one point I went hey in Sunday school. Hey, I need to receive him I know I want to receive him. So I actually asked christ repented of my sins. I don't know what they could have been at age four But I received christ and I literally he appeared and stepped inside of me crazy He is in there and no one on the earth could convince me. He's too late people Oh For that's amazing With him the angels over in the room were applauding. Uh, they were writing things down in heaven when I got at age four I Understood this That's amazing Well, it sounds like to me you are you are you sound like you are almost a protege If I can use that term the same way akeana was at four or five or six She's drawing masterpieces of art. You're at four five and six and you're walking a masterpiece with the lord There are some people that are so far out ahead of The rest of it because you were born with it would be like putting a genius only instead of making you a genius Which you might be you made you go ahead But that's why I have such a passion to tell people Yeah There came a point when he said you can't keep this anymore yourself And he put me in places not meetings. I never shared ever shared in meetings. I didn't really want that I never wanted attention. I didn't want to draw attention to me. I had one friend in school because I had a tribe at home I didn't need a lot of friends But I had uh, I had some of heaven's wisdom and every now and then I would just share a word with somebody And it would kind of freak him out because I knew exactly what it was I needed and I would say it and I would just I would walk away So my life and I'd see things all the time. I tell my dad my mom would just keep telling me I was strange Compared to the others. I was strange. Well, RJ was there. He was kind of strange too. Anyway, um, But but yeah, I I knew this inside Christ is real and he's in me And I would tell other kids and they go what what what? How can I see him? I know you need to invite him in yourself But that was the atmosphere we grew up in so for the Holy Spirit that was normal Uh, I wouldn't say familiar at all. I'm not familiar with going places I'm always undone when he takes me but that is choice but but that's why I was sent And I was choosing in a generational line of many people for generations who love god serve god Obey god. I was part of that generational. So this is actually a generational thing. I'm doing That those who went on before me in these generations whose platform or whose steps I followed in I was chosen this time to do this. Yeah, very profound Well, cat, um, I'm looking at a time. I've got another show to do at one o'clock 30 minutes from now So we kind of have to wrap up this but I'll tell people that clay Clark will be on in 30 minutes at one o'clock So I'll be back here After catching a quick bite or something.

Well, welcome to Elijah's Streams. It is Wednesday, February 1, but we are recording this the day before, so I'm recording this in the clock behind us. We'll say Tuesday, January 31, but you will see this in the morrow on Wednesday, so we're very excited to bring you Kat again today. She has a shorter schedule because they're in the middle of a move, so we're going to do 35 minutes and fast and furious and we'll have a good time. I had to hook myself up today and all the things are dragging in. Anyway, hope the dog doesn't bark because I didn't take care of that ahead of time, so we'll see how this goes. So pretty short show, but we'll enjoy every minute of it, so we're not going to run any spots or any other announcements. Tomorrow, by the way, is Robin Bullock, so don't miss that. So you're hearing this on Wednesday, so Thursday will be Robin Bullock. So all right, without further delay, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go. Hi, Kat. So you're in the middle of a move this week, huh? Yes, and we are so excited. I'm really excited. Awesome. Well, it's good to see you. We've got questions. We were going to jump right into questions today. Anything you wanted to say before we do that? I just want to say how much I love everybody and thank you for all the prayers you've given us over the years and even for this move, which sometimes seems almost impossible. Here we are moving tonight and tomorrow night. So we seriously are moving and we are all very excited. You know, it's a beautiful place. We know people there. We're going to meet a lot more people. I know God's going to be there too, of course. And so, yeah, we're trying to use our time as wisely as we can and our staff is actually going to come tomorrow to help. They have been bugging us forever. Please, let us help. Let us help. Yeah, we've got to take that, man. It's more talking than moving, but we're all very excited about how God has blessed us. So, yeah. And I feel that you're paying on the moving too. You know, you can have fun with friends and everything, but man, every time I've ever moved, we moved about something like 17 times in our married life. It's crazy. Wow. One time a year for the first half of the year. And then this place we've been at for 23 years now. Yeah. Yeah, so amazing. Well, listen, Kat, so you're pretty excited about the future still. Are you optimistic about how things are going? I am optimistic about everything God has said or told me and still intend to do. So, absolutely, yes, we all are. We're all very optimistic. By the way, once again, not intentionally, but we wore them. You got your teal on your hat and I got my teal on my tie and you're... Yeah. And that is heaven's color, you said, or heaven's favorite color. So, if I'm saying that right. Okay, so Kat, let me just jump in and ask you one question that I may have asked you a variant of this from time to time, but when people go to heaven, they've died and now they've graduated to heaven and you've said people, when they get to heaven, don't start comparing, don't say, how did you die? No, how did you die? They don't do that. But do... Would someone show up? Let's say they meet their parents and their parents are young like they are. They're everybody's in their 20s and 30s, I guess, looking at them. Does that... When they sit down and have coffee or whatever it is you do in heaven, do the parents say, well, tell me what happened last time we were there, you didn't even know the Lord, what happened? Do they tell that kind of story? And some say... Sometimes they do, if something's really on their heart, sure. And nobody minds at all if they ask some questions like that. I would have thought, you know, in my P-brain, I would have thought that that would be almost a sure thing that everybody would want to hear that story. But you... It sounds a little bit like it's more of an exception to the rule. Well, they actually hold meetings already when they come. Every time somebody comes new from earth, they always have huge events and everybody wants to come so they can hear what's been going on. Oh, okay. It's not gonna be any really good news, anything that's changed or maybe major things have happened that they would want to know about. That's an automatic, that part is automatic. So everybody will attend me somewhere. And then that person will be invited over and over and over again to visit people, speak places. And so, yeah, it's very exciting. Okay, very cool. So let's see, I wanted to go with this one. This one was... I've had this... Somehow I came across my desk I've had since December. It says, okay, I love Kat. I purchased and read her wonderful books. I find them very encouraging. I would like to ask her this question. The Bible says, when you try to approach the throne of God or God himself, you become very, very fearful. I have not heard Kat talking about the reverential fear of the, fear the Bible speaks of when it went in the presence of the great and almighty God. So I guess they're asking once you go to be with the Lord or once you visit heaven. I'm not quite sure where the reverential fear is that she's wanting to address. What would you say about that? I think it would probably depend on what was going on in its own home at the time. Of course, I've always, always had such holy reverence and love for the Father, for the Son, for the Holy Spirit that never changes. You never, ever get familiar with all that and not any of it. It's just overwhelming sometimes, the peace and the love that you experience when you're there. And of course, when I go many times, I'm like eight. Yeah, that's what you said. Not all viewpoint would be entirely different than most people who are already adults. So I think about what kind of fun will I have? Where will we take me? What will we do? I love him so much. I'm so excited to be here. So that would be the way that I would look at things and he wants me to. He wants me to see him that way. And there's other people who feel that way also. Well, yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. But you talked about how you've gone as an eight year old and that you usually go as an eight year old. So God sees you and you interact, I guess, as an eight year old. And you have said many times that heaven is like 50 percent worship, serious worshiping the Lord and 50 percent fun. Am I quoting you right? Is that about right? I would have to say yes. And he even says sometimes it's 50 percent fun. I'd have to make it fun. You come like a child. It makes sense. And so if you tell a story about this, I saw this or I saw that. And it makes the children or you at eight years old, when you go, giggle and laugh to see something funny, that's something that's in the heart of God to provide. Giggles and laughter and even goofiness when you're having fun, right? Yeah, you know, most everyone who comes says you must come like a child, right? And he wants us to feel that, you know, you're really all that innocent and excited and you know, you're going to have a good time. I mean, he is our father. That's who he is. That doesn't take anything away from his sovereignty, you know, his holiness, his power, the life he gives people. It doesn't change that. It's just that from my perspective and the way he's always taught me, he taught me as his daughter, he taught me as a child. So I see from their perspective. Okay, okay, cool. All right, Isaac is age 15. And he's asking this, are the world's wonders in heaven? For example, the hanging guards of Babylon, the Colosseum and so on, because we think of the seven wonders of the world, he's like, no, are those wonders in heaven? There are wonders, it says of course, those wonders in heaven. But I think it is the famous ones that we know, like, no, not those. Okay, not those. It would be like, you know, like the Valley of the Valley of the Falls would be definitely one the throne room, of course, absolutely the streets of gold, his rainbow. I mean, there's so many different things you would want to see the crystal sea, where you can swim under the water and breathe and talk and meet all the creatures there. So of course, they do actually have their list on quite sure of amazing places. Oh, yeah, the city is there. So there's so many things to do, see and learn about people have their favorites once they've been there for a while. So I would say, yes, it is sort of like, maybe more than eight. Yeah, well, you know, all right. And so if someone said, well, I will always hope that I never could go to see the Grand Canyon, I hope that I could see it in heaven. It's not like God needs to give you the Grand Canyon, he's got the grand everything. He absolutely has the grand, the grand of everything, you're right. So it's not like you missed that anymore. Won't you see what he's got there? Yeah, so good. Okay. Pam is asking this, can't you taught us that our level of spiritual authority grows as we mature in Christ? Can you tell us what a brand new Christians authority looks like? I don't, I guess, I have to interpret what she means. What does it look like? What, what would you say a brand new Christians authority like? I think maybe she's asking the moment you're saved and you're brand new. Do you walk out and possess certain authority that you didn't have? Or what does it look like if you're brand new? I think that no one can really maybe even think about that ahead of time. I think you are so undone by the glory that, you know, the glory we create for him, the splendors and the wonders that are there. You're so overwhelmed by his goodness that he gives us. But I'm brand new believer especially. They're overwhelmed really at what has been given to what Christ actually did give you, what you can operate in, how to do that, and what difference it would make here in the earth if everybody did. So yeah, there's a lot of things that there's so many things that we could talk about and discuss, but always those feelings of a new believer realize what has been paid for for them and what it's like to operate. There's like nothing is, you know, I don't think as much as I've been excited in all the years afterwards, I think the cream of the crop was the first week days and weeks after I encountered God and everything. It's hard to find that level of first love very many times. Don't get me wrong. I seek it and I do discover major encounters, but you're overwhelmed by that love. Absolutely yes. Yeah. I mean the Old Testament when I had the encounter with God 81, even the Old Testament screamed grace, grace, grace. I read it and I said, there's grace all over this thing and I had only seen bad news and that's them. All right. So Jan is asking this, when people first get to meet Jesus in heaven, what is the first most common response? Is it a joyful celebration kind of moment or a holy worship kind of moment? So what is that? I mean, yeah, so like, go ahead. Yeah, I think most of the time it's probably more of a holy thing. You are so undone knowing you're meeting actually the risen Savior, the one who gave everything for you. So I have seen most of the people probably would have that holy reverential thing that we talked about. Yeah. Unless you're a kid, then you're going to be like, yeah, besides yourself excited. Yeah. Well, you know, I, when I picture it for myself, I think, I think I'd fall on my knees or I would be, I would feel like falling and I feel like tears would come, but they would be tears of absolute unbelievable joy that we made it and he did this for me. And are there tears of joy? You know, there are tears of joy. I don't people think you never cry again in heaven. At the end of the Bible, it says every tear will be wiped away. You know, the former things, you know, more. That's the end of everything when it says, you don't cry, but crying for joy, excitement, gratefulness. Yeah, that's, it's a wonderful feeling anyway. And you absolutely love it. So yes, people still do that. Cool. Very cool. All right. Reggie's asking this, will teams of people work together or collaborate together to create things in heaven or on the new earth, like in these say, it's like groups work together on earth now to create or will, but we only create individually using our individual gifts and talents. So I guess he's likes doing things together as a group. And will we collaborate and do things together? That's the answer. We do collaborate and do things together. Of course we do. And you do learn how to create, not people, but there's creation lab where you think that's for in heaven. Okay. All kinds of things, places that we can make for each other, not talking about like our mansions or anything like that, but there we all have a creative ability because of who they are and so absolutely people get excited. Yes. And actually people say, well, what do people do? There's nothing to do there. You don't have a job or you create stuff. You hold events everywhere and everybody wants to be a part of your event. So yes, those things do happen a lot. That's good. Good. Okay. I have so many rabbit trails that I want to go to, but I'm going to jump to the next question. Elizabeth asks, how do I know if my child goes to heaven? If my child goes to heaven in her sleep, I asked this because she has a dear friend and recently that recently moved to heaven twice this week. She said she had a dream about them playing together and running. I'm not sure if I understand the question. How do I know if my child goes to heaven in her sleep? I asked this because she has a dear friend. Oh, she's saying when my child is sleeping, did she go to heaven and visit? That's what she's asking. That is a great possibility. Sure. Yeah, he takes people while they're sleeping. Okay. So they may, they say, Mom, I had this dream and I was playing. Yeah, my green kids have actually had that happen to them quite often. Okay. And those five places in heaven, like when they were four years old and they went, they didn't even know those places were there. But I mean, they have been that they ride, they rode, I think I mentioned before, you would ride lava out of a volcano. Yeah. My grandfather, my dad. Yeah, there are some of those giggles, by the way. I love the giggles. Giggles of God. Someone needs to write that book because we serve a happy, joyful, funny. By the way, of all the three, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Who's funniest if you could, if you, who's clever with their wit if you, if you had. I would have to say there's either Holy Spirit, probably or Jesus. I think Jesus definitely has the wit. I think they call Holy, well, I know they call Holy Spirit the drama king. Yeah. Right there. He loves a good joke. He really does. He loves like all kinds of drama and exciting things going on up there. So I would have to say probably more of those. The father is definitely for love. Yeah. Just dad, father, you know, I think Kim Robinson has had multiple trips together. She calls him daddy, God. You've had, I'm not asking you to say the names, your private names for God, but God has given you different names that you call him. Is that right? Yes, he had. That's a real interesting thing. And I've known several others that were like that. They say I've called them such and such and it would be something I'd never heard. But God gave, I don't know, maybe he gives different people the same ones, but that's pretty special. All right. He's just asking, how do you pray when asking God to relocate? How do you pinpoint where God wants you? I guess that means to move. I do not want to move to a place out of his will. So he's saying, she's saying, how do you pray when you're asking God to relocate you? I mean, I guess you, you want to tell him, I guess you want to ask, okay, I don't even know how to interpret that more than the question. So yeah. So what's your thoughts on that? So I think she wants to move, but she doesn't want to move to the wrong place because God didn't tell her to do or something like that. She's, she's going, you know, how do I pray? I would say, you know, you want his will done more than anything else and asked him to please give him permission to let you know. It's a good way to do that. You get, you get him permission to let you know if it's not the place he wants or maybe something different like that. I think most of the time, if it's, if it's about him and you've heard him maybe say things like that in his will towards you, I think people are so centered on pleasing him and making sure they don't step out of what he wants. So they don't mess up their life. I don't think he'd let them mess their life up if maybe they did choose something differently, but, but telling him that certainly is going to help you stay focused. And for the people that, that are not seers and they don't see all the things in the spirit like you do. I mean, can they say, Lord, I think you're telling me to go here, but if I'm wrong, would you close the door before I absolutely ask you to do that. You absolutely could do that. It's a good idea. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. All right. Shonda, Shonda, I must be Shonda. How do you release the anointing when you're on a telephone call? How would you do it if they, if they call you and you want to release the anointing? I'm sure she's meeting on the other person on the other end. So yeah, I would just hold my phone and I would just say it, or I would do it before I call them or he knew that I was going to call their number. I would say I released this, the anointing into this phone call when they pick it up, it'll go right into them. Okay. Okay. All right. Jill, let's see. This is partially cut off. Let me make sure I can read the whole thing. Okay. Jill says, as a seer, when I'm in church, I often see huge angels that stand between the first front, front seats and rows in front of the podium where the pastor preaches. It is always in the same position no matter what church. The angel is so big that his head is outside the roof. I didn't, I didn't notice an angel where we were going to church now until the last couple of weeks. Can you speak of what you know about those angels? I guess she's wanted to know if, if that's identifiable or something you've seen? I've seen angels 2,000 feet high, probably even higher than that in heaven. So just to what every side imagine is there. And I don't know that typically it's certain, you know, a tribe of angels or something like that. I just know that they do have many different sizes of angels. Do you, this is never a question that has never been popped to my head, but if you've seen 2,000 foot angels and you've seen angels that are probably roughly your size. Yes. So are massively tall angels by definition massively more powerful? Is that what the big means or what would you say? Possibly, but maybe possibly not. It's just that God loved making different types of angels or the hosts and he practiced well at doing that. Okay. Cool. All right. Cheryl is asking this question. She goes, I've heard you speak about how our loved ones in heaven can go to a portal on special days for us and sing happy birthday. For example, is the reverse true? My husband went to heaven less than two years ago. Can I sing happy birthday to him on his special day and have him hear me singing it? I'm sure that you could. I know that I have sung different things like to my father, like on Father's Day or something like that. I know that sounds odd, but I do really love my dad and a great relationship with him. And yes, and I know for a fact that Father has said you can sing what you'd like to them and he'll make sure they hear it. Yeah. Now I've said, this is maybe years past, but I've, you know, before I heard that you maybe can speak directly in there. They hear it in the spirit realm or something. However, but I've said, Lord, would you give my dad this message to tell him like, and I've said, like one time I said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I don't even know that if that's appropriate thing because he's in bliss. Why would he need to hear that? But that's, that would be my question. What kind of things can you send as a messenger or ask God to set an angel and tell your dad, you know, can you say something like that? Tell him I forgive him. You mean on earth or in heaven? No, I'm saying, you know, he's in heaven now and you know that when he left, he left a mess like that was the case with my dad. And if I would have said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I mean, that was years past, but what do you think about that? You just say, no, no, don't go there because he's already happy. He doesn't need that. I think that I don't think I would mind you saying that and all of somebody. I think it would be all right to say that. Even though they wouldn't still have to hear it. Yeah, because they already, yeah, I hear you. It's not like his soul needs to be unburdened for what he did. So it's just words of love, I think. Yeah. Okay. Dolores is asking this, do regular common people from different generations mingle with one another? For example, would an auto executive that went to heaven in 2022 mingle with the poor widow from Elijah's days, would they have things of interest to talk to? I think anyone who you would meet there would have, there's almost everybody's going to have something that they would love to talk to about you to you or with you. And you would find it very fascinating. So people still love to have conversations. They like to reason together, talk together. They love to share things. I mean, that never stops happening. Not here on earth or in heaven. Well, and then is there the sense that throughout eternity or as long as you're on heaven, one day, it's everyone's going to be on new earth. But as long as you're in heaven, are people making new friends all the time? Or do they kind of establish their friendship thing and their friends hang? Oh, they make new friendships all the time, no matter where they go. They do. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, Tracy. Oh, this, this does occur to me to ask this question because you've talked because we said a minute ago about the portals in heaven. And you know, your loved ones can look down on special occasions. Can't with that being possible, could someone, this is probably a dorky question, but because someone say, hey, they should do her girlfriend from earth and now they're all both in heaven together. And he says, come on to the portal. I want to, it's my daughter's birthday. I want to say, I want to see them and come and see where my daughter, what my daughter's up to. Could they do something like that? Or is it only for personal family? You know what I mean? I think a lot is for family, but I think you could, there's people who would push doing anything or talking about anything to anybody if they could there. So yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of these questions are questions that you don't, it's not like you walk around knowing the answers to all these deep questions, but yeah. Yeah. Okay. Tracy's asking this, I'm a worship dancer. Can you elaborate a little more on what happens when we minister and dance? And this seems like it's a common question. People want to know when I do this on earth, what's it, what's happening? What is it accomplishing is, I think, is what she's saying. What happens when I dance? I mean, that could go a bunch of directions. What is the Lord doing? What's happening in the spirit realm? I mean, is, would you have any thoughts? Because you're a seer. Do you see people dance and then see things happening because of it? I see a lot of mostly music. Of course, I do see some dance. And sometimes you dance, you're not even on the floor, like in the throne room, they have a lot of dance and pageantry and stuff in there going on. It's absolutely beautiful. And of course, there's ways that you collect things as you dance. And then it's represented in some other way in heaven, like you create artwork or paintings by your dance. Even though it is with dance, not with your paintings, it's just something that's created as something to remember that about. Okay. And back for those that are dancing on earth, when you've seen people with the pageantry that God loves on the earth and they're waving their flags and they're dancing, does it affect the angels around them when they do that? Is something being triggered in a good way when they dance? And I think that's what she's trying to get at. Do angels respond? Does our blessings drop down that we don't see? What is the dance accomplished? Or is it just dance? I know dance is considered a high praise. It even says that it's in the Bible. And so yes, even some of the hosts are absolutely amazed and really love the warfare that takes place as a dancer. When you dance, like in the spirit about things, so that is definitely something that takes place. And all three of my daughters are dancers. They would have to be wore in dance in the spirit for people to be healed, for messages to be sent to be received. And so I would definitely know whether it's dance, whether it's music. A lot of things are created in the spirit. Okay, awesome. Sarah is asking this, are there, you've seen gemstones in heaven, and I think I've heard you talk about the crystal sea and stuff. She says, is there gemstone art in heaven that resembles stained glass? Have you seen? Absolutely, yes. A lot of people have those in their home there. Really? Especially if people were artisans in that. My grandfather made stained glass wonders. Okay. He's got some he's made in heaven. Wow, very cool. And I mean, you know, it makes me wonder, because you said that guy will put favorite pictures of yours that are on earth, or you'll show up at your mansion and there it's hanging. And I'm curious if God would do the same thing. Not that you would know the answer to this, but that if you if someone made stained glass on earth, they show up and God said, this is one that you made. I really, especially loved, I kept it. And here's it. That was that sound like something he might do just because that's who he is. I think he probably would. If people gave him any high gifts, he's going to love him anyway. Yeah. And even he has some favorite things that he likes, anything he may with life with colors, things like that. Whether you're young or not young, he loves people when they give him gifts. Cool. All right. Let me see. We're five minutes out here. We got time for a few more questions here. George is asking, when some people are dying, they reach out or call for their family members who have died before them. They act as though their family members are right there in the room with them. Do you know, do they really see their loved ones and do they come? I guess they're asking, do their loved ones come to help with their transition to heaven? Can you share about that? I mean, I have no idea. I think sometimes they do. I do know for a fact that some people have seen their family members, like maybe within a week of passing or something. I think it's something that God just does to encourage people. And so I just know that it does happen. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Rachel's saying, when we are reunited with our loved ones that are already in heaven, to them, will it feel like it's been a long time since they've seen this? Or will it only feel like seconds or days since they've seen us? I think it's just seconds. Really? Oh, yeah. They don't miss someone being gone 30 years or something like that. All they can think about is can't wait to see them again when they see them. And so for them, you've only been gone for a short time. Okay. Wow. Okay. And Andrew's asking, when and why were the host, Michael's army created, was it after Satan's treason, specifically to deal with him or was it actually before Satan's treason? In other words, you've made it very clear that the only reason there's an army is not to protect heaven. God doesn't need an army to protect heaven. So when do you know when the army was created? Was it after the fall of Satan? I think the army was been around a very long time. They even wondered why they were created one time. Really? To fight. Yeah, they were there for the enemy, for who became an enemy. So maybe they only understood what they were being trained up for when that fall happened. Yeah. They were taught war and they had to run maneuvers and do all kinds of stuff like that. Really? And that one was how loose for a fallen heaven. They knew who their enemy was. Interesting. All right. Here's another question about the Michael, the captain of the warrior angels. Is it Martha's asking, I believe the angel Michael is the captain of the warrior angels and Gabriel is the messenger angels. Are there other types of angels with specific purposes? I'm guessing there'd be lots of them with specific purposes. There are so many, I cannot number them. There's many, many, many, many. There's ones who are couriers, of course, the scribes, the Bible talks about them, helper angels that help all over heaven doing things like that. Of course, there are the hosts of heaven. There's ones who serve in different places and who keep the treasures shined up and all kinds of things like that. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It makes sense that he might even have thousands of different kinds of angels, right? For categories that we've never even thought about. So, yeah. Man, just that's right. Me, A, N, G, S. Does God really cast out your sins into the sea of forgetfulness? If you brought up your past, would he not know of it? I think most of the time he wouldn't because he does cast it there and he's not going to think about it. I tell people, stop reminding him of your sins. He won't know what you're talking about if you've repented. Yeah, boy. I could have used that understanding years ago when I kept repending over and over and over and over to make sure I got it right. He's probably saying, would you stop repending? Okay. Jamelia, lots of interesting names today. Jamelia, have you seen inside of the courtrooms in heaven? What's happening in there? What do they look like? Do they look like a courtroom on earth? The judge sits on the bench up there high and then there's a defense in both sides? I have absolutely been to the courtroom in heaven. Actually, there's more than one. I guess outside, not outside of heaven, but in the atmosphere of heaven, it's invisible. I know this sounds crazy. You can actually see to it. You can see that it's there. Then of course, it's a courtroom that's actually in heaven. Yes, I've seen both. Like anything else, God sits as judge. Jesus is our lawyer and Satan gets hauled up there about different things sometimes. Other things get harder, but justice does take place in those courtrooms. So it does look like a courtroom as we would know it. Well, they have one that looks very supernatural. They do have one that looks like what you would call a courtroom, maybe not exactly like that. So they're both different than I've seen. Okay. All right. Here's the last question here. Natalie is asking, what is your favorite thing about Jesus that you would like to describe? What's your favorite thing about? Of course, you'd have thousands of things, but what stands out to you? I think his eyes. I think his eyes are so amazing. I never get tired of whenever I'm around him. I always want to look at his eyes. They're beautiful, very beautiful. But he also does have a, I almost want to say a cynic sense of humor. I mean, he was very bold about the things he said on the earth to those who were not doing right. Like one of my favorite ones is, are you you're a white and sepulchral school of dead men's bones? Yeah. You thought of the religious hierarchy. I think both of those probably, those two things are probably my very favorite thing about it. And he holds both of those at the same time. He, you know, he's got that serious side and then the clever fun side. Yeah. So good. So good. Well, Kat, that's our time. We need to let you get to your moving and rest in between and all of that. So I appreciate it very much. We'll spend more time the next time talking about revealing heaven.com, but we're going to revealing the heaven.com to see her, to get her books and all that. And there it is. Katcur.com is where you can support her. The only place you can support her is online because she doesn't ask for money in any other way. A lot of people keep trying to pretend to be her. So all right. Thanks so much, Kat. Tomorrow, everybody is Robin Bullock. We're looking very much forward to that. When you see Robin Bullock, he almost, I think he always has that pin that you created. It says, I don't do demons. He wears that on his coat and everywhere he goes. So it's a, so that that'll be him right there after people see this. Yeah. Thank you very much. We love you. Bless you. Have a good time with your staffs. We'll see you again soon. Okay. See you later then. Bye.

Happy, I started to say Tuesday because we're recording this on Tuesday. Happy Wednesday for those of you watching this live for you. It is Wednesday, February 8. We're recording this at 3.20 in the afternoon on February 7 to get the sense we're recording Cat. Sometimes her schedule works better for us to record in the afternoon before. Most of the time these days that helps it work out better for everyone. So all right, well, welcome to the broadcast and a quick reminder that we tomorrow's for you tomorrow Thursday is Mel Kay. We haven't had her on for a while and she's going to give us an update on what's going on out there. So I love her very much. She's a great patriot in the patriot movement. She's that all the reawakened American thing. She's an absolute God of fear and she loves us and we love her. So that is Thursday tomorrow for you. We'll ask you some of the latest updates. So we're going to bring in Cat here in just a moment, but before we do that, here's a quick reminder about the wells we're digging. Thank you. I love that music, I like the beat to it too, and plus the whole Irish feeling of it, it's a great, here's a big word juxtaposition with the music and you're seeing the, I don't know whether it's called the bush or whatever you call it in the villages of Uganda, very primitive, poverty-stricken by any standard that we have, and they may not consider themselves poverty-stricken at all, I don't know how that is, and I'll have to learn more about that one day, but they sure need the water, they surely need the water, so we thank you for your help on that. Alright, time to watch for Kat and Steve on Wednesday, so here we go with Kat. Well good afternoon, I guess it is afternoon, it's actually like, we're taping this, so it's like 6.20 in the evening, your time isn't it? I think so. Yeah, you'll have to ask Jen that, I never know what time it is. You went to bed, you went to bed at, usually you go to bed at 6, right, because you're up all night, are you still up all night? I haven't been up since 4am. Oh, you've been up since 4, that's really unlike you, you don't get up that early. Not really, I'm really involved in doing something, you know, than I am. Well good to see you, well we've got some questions, oh I forgot to check with you before the program, if there's anything you had to share before we got into questions. I think Robin shared so much the other day, probably not except that we are still busy moving and we're very excited about it, but I really wanted to give the time since I didn't have a whole hour today to let people ask questions. Okay, alright, the first one is going to come from me, in fact we were talking about that. I won't bless the people though, let me go ahead and blow it up. Okay, are we on? Okay, yeah, so this is from me and so our staff was talking about prayer in one of them, so why don't you ask Kat what it's like for you. I think we asked you one time, in this big recollection we said, what's prayer like for you and I think you said, in the recesses of my memory here, something about yours was more about decrees, but don't let me put words in it, what is prayer like for you? Yeah, well there's many different types of things you can call prayer or that is called prayer even in heaven. Ruling is something, ruling is what's in the spirit realm, it's you taking authority and dominion and by the things that you either say that God is doing because He's told you or things that you have wanted yourself to release into the spirit realm to make a difference in people's lives. The other thing is called declaring and decreeing which a lot of people I've heard, you know what you dare to declare and decree shall be established unto you, that is my number one way I pray because I'm trying to establish usually something very specific, something God had asked me to take authority over, something He's asked me to make decrees about and so that is my favorite way to pray. And I still, another thing is talking to God, just having a language with Him is also partly prayer and I know God had said, you know, you pray all the time because you talk to me all the time, that's what He says to me, that's what the Bible says to me. Oh really? Yeah. He said, you pray all the time because you talk to me all the time, that's really instructive right there. Yes, it is and we should all have that much time and attention to give to Him but absolutely declaring and decreeing is the number one way I pray. Taking authority, taking great authority, having spent time with the Father or the Son, discussing things that they have going on on the earth right now, what is about to happen on the earth, things like that and then He'll say go make decrees over that and so that's what they do, I do a lot of that. Also for family members, I'll declare and decree over their lives things that they need either from heaven or that they're involved in working on this earth, you know, for the Father. I wanted to ask you a question about, you know, there's a scripture that says resist the devil, it's right in there, agree with God and there was that phrase, agree with God, there's so many things we could agree with God and I had something happen to me the other day and I'll give you an example, it's like I'm praying for this person that's in need so I said Lord, and this is not the exact one but it's kind of close to Lord and I know He's like your beloved Son, this one I'm praying that I have in my heart and I know you and Him are friends and I agree with you that you would never, ever cause harm to Him and I know you and I agree on this and I know that if anyone feels empathy for what he's going through, it would be you and I just want you to know I agree with you and that was kind of like a non-prayer prayer because I was explaining the need, He knew the need I was talking about but I was explaining it in agreement, what are your thoughts about something like that? I think for sure that would be a conversation, you know, God does take the time to even meet even myself about things that people are going through and things to let them know that I care about, He cares about, things like that so there are other types of conversation that you wouldn't necessarily specifically call prayer and I think that's because we show that we love people, we really care about people and our empathy goes along with them and whatever they're going through and the Father absolutely adores and loves people who, you know, it's not His plan to put us through things no matter what it looks like sometimes especially these last couple years that He is delighted to see the heart of people that care and I think it's so important for us to have kindness and care about people, you know, sometimes we get so caught up in our own world or our own life, we forget sometimes there are others out there who do need a kind word, an encouraging word, maybe a letter written to them or something letting them know someone is here with you, we've got your back, you know, we care about you so certainly there's all different kinds of conversation you could have in any way that some people may say well I didn't even think of that as prayer but anytime we love people it's going to touch the heart of the Father. Wow, yeah, you know our old school thinking for lack of a better description our old school thinking would be they would say and there's nothing wrong with this but they'd say what did you do in your quiet time or did you have your quiet time because if you don't put in time and I understand that very much but it kind of came off as a legalistic thing from time to time if someone would say did you have your quiet time it's a little bit freeing to me to have you say even if you're showing kindness even if you're talking to the Lord I was trying to figure out who, remind, be reminded who was this famous person of prayer that said I have hardly ever prayed for more than five minutes maybe he said fifteen minutes I don't know it's fine it was like either five or fifteen so I'll say five I've never prayed longer than five minutes but I've never gotten more than five minutes without praying it was something like that it was probably fifteen can let me ask you so some people have been taught now there's the scripture this is you know we're supposed to give him our our petitions with thanksgiving let your let your petitions or prayers be known to God in the in the prayer of thanksgiving all that so are there people who do who you would say get too much into petition and not enough in other things what would you say how would you exhort someone to pray I like do some people say Lord I need this and Lord help me with that or help my family is it too much is too much petition I think it depends on the person himself I guess most people would would would some people just gonna ask for I guess whatever they're having issues with or whatever they're thinking about or wondering if something will work some people can't kind of not sure about making up their minds I think and so sometimes they may ask more than other people would but I just I love people who declare declare and decree us that you really are serious about getting something done for God and making sure that petitions petitions are being heard maybe not even just your petitions it might be others petitions you know they're going to something like we were kind of just talking about a minute ago I don't think God ever gets tired of hearing anybody's petitions at all if you ask me personally I don't think you know I totally was asking that so I so yeah I totally was so if that if that if too much is you're not worried about too many petitions then oh no I don't think so no no no sometimes you wish people would ask more well that's true too doesn't he says you have not because you ask not your life be that side of that okay so all right well I'm gonna ask you a question from Benny age 12 so he says are the skill levels of all people the same in heaven like are they all the same strong they're just as strong they're just as fast speed he seems to be asking about athletic by the question he mentioned strength and speed is everybody the same or some stronger and some faster I don't think everybody is the same at all I think everybody is still at different levels you know if you pursue something of course you're gonna know more than someone who never had before you do have the ability to learn new skills all the time in heaven or improve the skills that you have in heaven but no I don't think everybody is at the same level that's good to hear yeah in fact that the way you answer boring to say why bother to go to something if everybody is the same right well that's true oh I lost I was gonna ask a follow-up but I lost it okay Jack age nine okay he he wants to know can I transform into things in heaven like an animal or a character he wants to know if he can transform it I assume this is like when they're playing around or something there are places in heaven they can go that is for a play area that yes you can actually change you can be smaller can be larger I think that you can become a cartoon in certain areas and then you play out cartoons with your friends you actually are in the cartoon so he's absolutely right and I you said in certain places are there because it sounds like a what would be a term it sounds like a fun zone or a fun village or or something there are places that usually in the amusement park there's a lot of things going on similar to that they have all kinds of things that you can do you can travel different ways like in bubbles you can go up to different places where is it the play places in the sky I know it sounds crazy but it's heaven yeah yeah it's very different and when you go there you expect some of those things to happen well I gotta ask you when a lady wrote to me I didn't respond to her today because I didn't know how to respond because I don't have an answer for everybody's question but she wrote she's very nice about it but she says but I'm quite certain there's no cotton candy in heaven so apparently she heard that you had said there was cotton candy in heaven and I might my thing would have been if I'd written there what what would prevent God from giving a delicious cotton candy that would be nothing yeah so I'm talking to people about the funness the giddiness the laughter the hilarity of God because we got the holy thing we've been taught I don't know we don't have it down but we've been taught the holy side we have not been taught the fun side I mean what would you like to tell people to say there for the first time I would say the same thing that the father said to me if he didn't make fun places in heaven he'd be in trouble with all those kids coming home I mean that's a perfect like a little child the Bible is clear about that you come with the heart of a child because you're going to have adventures you're going to have fun and the father wants you to have that why wouldn't he he is your father so of course he planned different things to do even adventures for you to do things to learn different places to go to learn them you can visit rodeos you already know about the amusement park there's so many places in heaven you go even beautiful places out outside parks all kinds of things dinosaur park you know people get up get off on that but you know you're not God and I can tell you when he is a father a loving father he's going to give everything he can do bless his children and that's why he's he wants you to expect it yes why what do you think if you do with all these millions of children coming home to heaven that's really really good and you know the the the thing about it is not only millions maybe there's even billions because from the beginning of time billions well because from the beginning of time children have been have lost their lives when they were little you know I have never asked you this question but I want to ask you this question there were people that perished in the flood and some among those cats surely there would have been children throughout whatever the earth was in those days when when those children perish in the flood and they were almost babies or very very young children do you expect to see those children in heaven one day of course I do absolutely I would they were innocent children why would they not go to heaven the father's been adamant about that from the from the very beginning he would talk to me about that I expected all children to go to heaven yeah they didn't do anything wrong right they do have an opportunity to receive Christ in heaven if they want to and they'll actually come to his throne and bring him flowers and say they receive him they don't necessarily have to do that to be in heaven but they want to do it well it wouldn't that almost by default if they went to heaven wouldn't they I can't imagine someone saying as a child no I don't want to receive Christ right anybody they love him they so fall in love yeah so I think it's such a blessing for the father to allow them to do that so they do have they have a big event where they're invited to sit on usually on the throne of the father and then Jesus will come and he will present himself there and Jesus and he will ask Jesus to be received as his savior okay good good good good okay say that we've got three children's questions today say love my granddaughter my granddaughter's name is say that but that's what he said they may say pronounce a seal that but say that or see the age eight is asking cat are there singing squirrels and talking flowers in heaven that she's eight years old she wants another singing squirrels and talking flowers I have seen both while I was in heaven so I can adamantly tell you absolutely yes the flowers have faces yes they sing home meadows sing sometimes and yes squirrels do not just squirrels most of the creatures are most of the what you would call an animal especially all your pets they all talk they talk and then there is some there's a whole group of squirrels that I know and I don't know why and I haven't laughed out for the so many times I don't care people love it there are a group of squirrels that actually are called greeters GR TERS and when someone comes home to heaven they will actually go in this group and they will actually sing and dance for the people welcoming them to heaven I can imagine some maybe some older type stuffy person and here they are opening the door and here's this group of squirrels ready to sing and dance they have to stop having pain I'm not kidding the Holy Spirit does does make sure it all happens and so if there's something you don't like you'll change when you get there that's you know that's actually the mouthful right there and he said because I know but you know what because when I if you had the further okay I'm 67 for the first 50 years of my life I could never have received most of that that you're saying because I would have I don't know what I would have thought would be wrong with that I was just taught that heaven is holy and we're going to worship him and no I would have said no we're probably not going to just sit on the cloud but I didn't have a replacement for that activity I just didn't believe it I had someone wrote I saw it written and someone said there won't be the reason we know that there won't be this is a kind of a quote the reason we know there won't be amusement parks and heaven that there are none is because the elements it's because that's on earth and the elements on the earth will be burned up with fervent heat so therefore we know amusement parks won't be in heaven they were there first before the earth was even made about time or what's going on earth are you kidding it's on the earth because it is in heaven see I want you to say that because I knew that was your answer because I've come to learn that and it makes sense it's logical you know everything about the river of life well we're on the earth so why did they burn I mean the thing about is when I saw that I thought well that would mean if you followed that logic then that would mean since we have mansions on the earth and that earth is going to burn up there can be no mansions in heaven and since we have roads on the earth to drive vehicles there can be no roads or vehicles of any kind in heaven and you pretty soon you you have God with his hands up say what can I do you you've made all these things illegal for me to have in heaven it's kind of crazy all right well that's good news cat I'm glad you're here to bring the good news all right I like this question K I don't know how old but she says does God have any particular reason reason when he sends twins triplets or whatever to be born does he have a reason I'm not quite sure what she means I don't know that he has a reason other than he just he loves seeing all three of them I guess or both of them or whatever but I don't know of any certain reason that he would send since he sends those from heaven and he tells them this is your assignment which we you know we don't know now but he he gives an assignment if he's gonna send triplets he would probably does this make sense he would probably get these three children together and say you're gonna be triplets in about a minute from now what does he he tells them about their life is going to be and then he sends them or what I think there's a whole lot of stuff that goes on with all that there are times sometimes he'll actually mention it to people before they before they're born you know while they're still living in him in him he'll let them know the their purpose even he'll let them know sometimes who he's chosen for them all kinds of things go on so they'll be really hard to say but he does share with them most of the time not necessarily whenever when they'll be born but that they will be born together as a family sometimes he does do that okay all right now Matt is asking this this is it sounds like my kind of questions I would be asking you says do people look back on their earthly life fondly from heaven so they've gone to heaven do they look back and think of you know I you could say not like the good old days because they're in the good old days now in heaven but do they look back and say remember when we did this to their friend remember when we went to the creek and we all went so visit that kind of fond memories from heaven I think sometimes that they can kind of remember being with certain people maybe not younger maybe a little older they do I think depending on how close also that you got to the Lord he himself may actually show you oh really oh yeah yeah he'll show you he's shown me different people he's shown me different people that I knew before I came to the earth and I've seen myself sitting in his hand quite a few times explaining to me some of the things I would be doing of course I didn't remember them until much later on so sometimes he does do that but it really depends on the relationship you pursue with him especially the Lord that he will share things with you from your past past meaning before time yeah okay BT BT before time BT BT alright here is okay I don't know how specifically the answer you'd answer this but I'll throw you the question Sarah is asking in light of all the exposures coming from those caught up in sex trafficking how do we pray for all the victims being delivered in this horrendous experience so I don't know how would you tell them to pray for the victims that are being delivered is that that's what their question is well there is something they can do if they knew about it and that was the losing of their soul oh you can you can because God has not disordained it that way but he created that way and it was a soul checkup it's all about your soul the keys to the kingdom which you bind others will be bound in heaven which you loose and it will be loose in heaven meaning if let's say it was a horrible encounter like we're talking about something like that and then someone they met who was adapted being a soul doctor they could share with them if they lose those things and named him by name and then they lose them out of their soul and Jesus name Jesus will come and take them like they were never there and I teach that actually haven't done it well but I actually would teach that to different leaders of different groups that want to do that especially for young people who are rescued from drugs and those things like that and they cried it they were so rejoiced because they said it would take them a year to work with a group or a person and in this way in three minutes they have loose everything in their soul that ever was there that the devil put there and I you know let's camp there for a minute we've got about ten minutes left here but let's see we're going to keep it to 40 minutes or so today so someone is rescued and if you could see their soul and I don't know as a seer if you can see that cap but but let's say that you just know okay so you see their soul and let's say it's full what do you see because that was one of the questions what do you see first of all it depends on which person or type of person you're talking about I see all kinds of things I can see people who have gone to suffering I can see people who have been abused if someone is abused they'll have like you know you've heard people say we're gonna tie the knot these are all about relationships this is not like the twisted rope hanging out of you somewhere I'm not saying that this sort of right you knew that they had some kind of negative relationship in their life somewhere because that's what I see therefore I know they need healing for that and in the past I would just pray and declare over them now I actually will go up to them and talk to them and I'll teach them how they can be free from that in Jesus name the God never intended you to go through those things that was not his purpose there's a devil in this world I hate everybody and whatever you can steal from your destiny the point of the devil to mess with people in that is he wants to steal their destiny and that's one of the ways that he does it is by the abuse no matter what kind of abuse that is that they have to go through but I remember the the time that the father showed up and showed up in my room he said I'm going to show you and he said I will show you he said after I show you this people will know how in minutes to lose everything out of their soul and they'll never suffer from it again wow this will help every single believer accelerate their life into victory because I don't have someone you have three months three years ten years trying to get healed from stuff that was done to them wrongfully he said if they follow these instructions it's simply the keys to the kingdom which everybody doesn't always understand none of those different ways people can use those keys to the kingdom he said but I'm talking about what you lose on earth you lose from heaven you lose from heaven so what you lose from your soul that was done to you on earth that was wrong heaven will come and lose it from your soul completely and it will be like it never existed if you want to bind the things of god and then we were growing up we were always hot to bind the devil yeah are you uh there's something much better than binding that it's binding the love of god the life of god the plans of god the will of god his joy his celebration his expectation you can choose with your will to bind those things to your soul and no one can ever take them away from you and you will feel completely different so these are things taught to me by the father and I remember it was out it was ours earth time because I remember glancing at my clock and then he took me and he would be taking me back and forth showing me things on the earth and showing me how people got healed it was really uh quite a drawn-up process and I have helped so many people and we actually help people become soul doctors that's what god calls me a soul doctor I heard you use that a minute ago I hadn't heard that term before but in other words it it would be like you don't have to become a licensed uh professional counselor you can become a soul doctor you're right practice what god says took me into the future and I saw down the hallways of businesses athletic places um it didn't matter where it was churches churches and I would see a doorway that said soul doctrine it had a little sign up outside and people would go in the air to get like sort of like counseling or healing or being made whole when they're sold it was quite fascinating so yes there are things that you can do to help one another how to be free from all that garbage and I mean the list was like so long and it didn't matter what it was that the people had wanted to lose from their soul if they were involved in it if their family was involved in it if situations that happened to them every one of those could be lose from your soul drugs you know all kinds of all kinds of things you would choose to lose them from your soul can use uh I felt to ask you this while you were talking because you were talking about a person could lose it from their own soul by by doing what you've taught them to do so this is what this is kind of the yucky question so there's women watching right now who have been raped and they never got delivered from the trauma of that rape or the or the horrible memories of it men too because a man can be raped because he has a child okay how would you walk a woman right through what would she say right now in her prayer time how would she use her words to to be her own soul doctor if I could put that right I would just say to her that God actually I think even better than that is I should tell you a real situation that happened okay okay um one of the first times I ever got to use that I had just been with a father maybe weeks later I was in New Jersey I was invited by a pastor and his wife and her two sons and he went in the grocery store to get some things from my room your snacks and stuff and she said I've got it you were sent here for me this is a real story you were sent here for me and I know in the next couple minutes you can help me be free because I knew that the Lord would help me get free she said I have been been through some of the worst torments of um violence violent torments night and day before I was married three times and and to the wrong same person not the same person same kind of person and she said I can't stand it anymore I thought God I've got to be free of this I don't want the nightmares I don't want the torments my kids were present with some of these happened and so they've gone through these same things what can we do to be free right now and in three minutes I told her do you know what the word says about binding and losing she said well binding and losing you know you mean yes I said yes that what you choose to lose from your soul that was done to you will be loosed from heaven itself heaven will come down pull it out of your soul completely and it will be like you never experienced it before she said show me right now my husband's still in there show me now right now and so I let her through it you know um and she she gave her name she said uh father in Jesus name I'm choosing to lose from my soul all the violent activities the violent things I've been that I was hurt with that I had to stand and see that my kids had to stand and see I'm fed up with it I'm tired of the devil abusing me and I'm not going through this life anymore so I choose with my own will to lose it in Jesus name right now forever and ever amen and then this light came on her face really I have never ever seen and this light came I mean I was overwhelmed I mean I knew it would work she sat there and she started crying a laugh and she goes she said some minute she goes it's gone I mean it's gone I mean in three minutes it's gone it's literally gone it's like I never had it before I I can't even remember some of the actions she goes I I've got to do this with my two boys before you even go back can you please do the same thing with them they were like the like 10 and uh 15 something like that or 17 something like that I said of course of course she said all I can do is laugh now before I couldn't even stand to think about going to bed at night her husband knows that was sort of goes what's wrong she goes I'm the happiest person in the world wow she worked and so yeah the third night she brought them and I led them to the same thing and I saw her 10 years later she said do you know what that stuff has never come back you're still filled with joy because after that I taught her how to bind the joy the Lord God's love his his his presence you know his purposes for your life his celebration and she said we're still filled with that stuff she said I am so grateful and you should I've helped so many people through that out of their life it is really really that's and they have lose they have people have lose some drug addiction alcohol all kinds of things some things they're like even witchcraft they have lose that from their soul and and because they were repentant first and then they lose it from the soul so I have to say one of the great and the father said this may be one of the greatest things I ever show you and he was right so he calls me soul doctor all the time I love that term too I this first time I heard you use it but wow that's so powerful yeah I mean his body can people can be sick in their body and still be happy if you're sick in your soul you have no life at all wow this may be the most this is the most important thing we did today and we've even like kids we've let kids do that too that have been abused but the teenager place in Orlando that camp that they have to go to for a year they have me come down and I taught every single one of the leaders and the teachers how to do that and he said they'd never been the same again and now instead of having all those weeks and months to trust the person who used to be with that person it takes a few minutes and they're free wow wow cat that is simply amazing and I've heard you talk on this a lot this was especially poignant if I guess you know uh because people you know I've heard it and I I've done lots and lots and lots of self you know losing yeah I feel like I got it at a new level today of understanding even though I heard these words before I feel like it went even deeper this time so personally I think I've received benefit from this but I know that people watching this is very important I'm sure there will be many many many people Steve they will never be the same again after this broadcast we are going to print mini booklets we actually are going to print mini booklets m-i-n-i mini booklets that people can order in bunches and stuff like that they can even hand out to people and then eventually we'll probably print a book and give the whole story about how the father came how he taught me all the places he took me and my daughter finally came to the door I think it had been almost four hours I had locked myself in my room my older daughter and she goes mom can I please come in I went I've just been with the father she goes can I please come in come down my bed and I showed she was the first one I told her all about that and she she now of course she's married she's got kids and she helps people by being a soul doctor wow amazing cat wow cat thank you so much very very very important broadcast today so good so good okay uh while you have it here uh let's point out revealing heaven.com is on the screen uh people can buy your books there and other materials right yes but I want to share one more thing the Holy Spirit oh please oh go for it yes one more story okay that my one sister who has had a wildlife I'm telling you she was um my one sister not Jen one of my other sisters you know I have like seven and one of them had gone through a lot of stuff in her life and she was younger she was kidnapped she was found back she went through all kinds of things and then God God got so ahold of her and uh she's a smart person she tells me if you know anything or think of anything or God wants me to have something you call me grow up and make sure I get it and so uh she called me one time and I think this is one of the times when she was going through stuff she goes I've I've had someone call me on the phone wanting to commit suicide because the rotten boyfriend that's what she called him broke up with her and ditched her and she said she was so heartbroken she couldn't stand to live and her her friend was right her friend was not a Christian this is a while uh and I and I said so what is she goes I've heard you talk about a soul doctor before would you mind if I call my friend to get her on the phone and you lead her through that because I don't want to see her take her life and I said you know I well so she did I told her about Jesus Christ and she said she knew that she had knew who the Lord was I said did you know he can make you completely whole so you don't need your boyfriend you don't really need that person if somebody loved you they wouldn't have dumped you ditched you and used you like that and she said I'm willing because if I don't do something I'm I'm not gonna live and so I told her about the love of God his sacrifice you know the full story of it and so she received crisis or savior and then she lose that guy out of her soul by name never to run after him again never to be heartbroken again and the Lord came and took that whole grief suicidal thoughts out of out of her mind and she never committed suicide wow amazing wow wow I didn't know it's gonna be this good and this important okay I was starting to mention revealing heaven.com so please go to there to see what materials in the books that cat has talk without folks about what's that cat cur.com but cat cur.com is what I think the father calls a spiritual platform whatever he wants to say no matter when it is he gives it to me to say I will put it on there there's all kinds of videos self-help videos learning videos training videos that's what a lot of it is some of them are interviews I've had with known people which I really enjoyed having those interviews we are in the midst of updating both of our websites but cat cur.com will always be the one that we we put a lot of emphasis on training that the father has given or things that you can do yourself by helping people you don't have to be a brilliant you know you don't have to know everything there is to know it's your heart for love for want of caring with people and it is also the only place in the in the cosmos that you can give online there is no other place there's no other no other website that where you can go to do that we did that on purpose because people would try to use you if you're known you know and they would send things to people messages to people saying it was me if you give this orphanage then you'll get so much given to you and god bless you so many times they're just trying to steal money sometime so if you want to give online you can is it what it is it jan see i don't even know myself is it the cat curve yeah the cat curve what for you to give online is that where you go no is that cat cur.com jan is it cat cur.com
