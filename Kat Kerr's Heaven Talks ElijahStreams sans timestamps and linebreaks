welcome to Elijah's dream with your host Steve Schultz president and founder of elijahlist ministry stay tuned for another exciting episode where you can just how God is interacting and blessing the world your nation and your family as revealed by prophetic courses throughout the earth gets that prophetic perspective right now hi Steve Schultz hair with elijahlist ministries and elisha streams TV we wanted to welcome you here today so today I'm especially excited to have Kat Kerr how you doing good to see you great about it's been a few went since I've been together yes yeah it's about time Kat has had been taken to having many many times over the course ago at 20 years or more 20 years yes almost every day mazie is it every day almost every day almost every day but he just catches me up so usually he doesn't give any animals for anything he just takes me up if he wants to show me something or say something important for the body of Christ to know or if the world's interested speak let me just jump to bed last year for a minute and then we'll jump into 2018 you were one of only three or four people that I could just put my finger on say these people do long ahead of time exactly who would the elected president tell me a couple just a couple of things about what God had told you months and months ahead of time for Trump even before Trump ran even before that election was planned got him and telling me that I'm going to make America great er than ever it's about to step into his destiny but I can't start this until I shift the government and there will be a president in the White House one day they will extend their hand to the believers so I knew that was coming and when he told me that he caught me up to heaven literally months and months and months before he said I've chosen Trump and people won't like it and they won't understand it but that doesn't matter right now because I'm going to change America and I need him he's an all-american boy that is all for America and he is smart he can't be bought he can't be moved and he cannot be controlled and he said he will know me and he will hear my voice and he said from the time he sits in the White House a miracle we might have a boring day I remember you saying that and I think about that Oliver Lilia what before I jump in this then we asked this thing about Trump okay I've had people good godly believers and they're all upset and the way I would be flying is a very kind of upset because he's not acting like pastor in chief and I said to these Francis but he we didn't elect the pastor and she arrived at a commander chief so from God's viewpoint does he ever talk with you about that a lot he talks to me about many things about Tom number one the people he's positioning now on the earth to be leaders yeah it's because of their generational line he's part of them an amazing generational line that paid a price with their life for the gospel Trump I'm talking about trying on his family lineage has got powerful believers men and women of God even passional in his line and in this time on the earth much fruit will take place many things will happen that have never happened before and he is positioning people to be leaders in the government in business and in to church and one of the things if all the said was I've chosen him but the people need to know you don't need a pastor in the White House right now you don't need a pastor you don't need the five hold ministry in the White House we need a businessman who sharp who knows how to make money who's not afraid of people who can deal with international matters this is from the highest in the land who made all of us and he knows what's best for our country that's amazing of ana technics area for those that may have not seen some of the previous things that we've talked about Kat I mean I got to know Kat started three or four to three years ago three or four years ago and we went on a cruise I actually I went on a Kevin Lee cruises cruise with Kat was the featured speaker and I was fine you actually came to our room to visit with my wife I was exciting the poor sister was looking for you all over the ship we didn't know what time that was I'm so exciting to meet you and talk with you about your life and the things that Lodge Alyssa's done too so always just as captivated we were totally unaware at the time yes let's jump to 2018 at the time of this recording we're a few days into its 11th of January we won't always date these recording but this one is important because I'm gonna say some things about what's going to happen so it's important for the people know this is January 11 2018 that's awesome because he actually told me from now on when I speak I will say the date so let's jump to 2018 when the guys start talking to you about this year last year well some of the things like I said he's been saying things to me probably over the last 40 50 years that far back hello this time we're in right now well about things that would happen on the earth that the manifested sons and daughters the greater works the which we are so are going to be blasted when we see what God's going to do with us the things Christ's position force ruling and reigning with Christ what does all this mean then he would show me things in the word so I've been prepared literally literally that long by him but steps into the season right before the elections he really started focusing he said I'm gonna make you very political because I'm going to throw you out there in this election you won't be able to go back so I'm you were going to tell them Trump's going to win and I need him there and this is what will happen this will happen people try the lines you know cheat and lie about him and I can tell all those people if they ever hear this you better step back because this is God's son he chose who he wanted he's not gonna he's not forgotten him he's not going to let up on what he's doing with him and no one will win in the next election they won't win that either he will that's all just give you that for free so you're saying trips back for a second I'm gonna be here for eight years pence for eight years and then the one pen sticks I'm just gonna throw it up there cuz the father is saying this for 24 years we will have God in that White House what see this is a generational thing he's doing this is not just something for a few weeks again once it even a couple years that he's setting up for when you told me the Trump is going to win I was I was intrigued not upset cuz I kind of liked the guy from the very beginning but then these horrible things would be said and then he would step in the mud and say things and then I would write back to cabinet there are you still saying it was just now I learned I don't go back to Kat and say are you still saying because of course now that I know her of course she say poor my God positions a time when the fullness of time has come yeah this is God's time to do something he's strategic that's why we're being strategic right now that's why he's giving times and stuff he's very strategic right now because he's setting up literally for us to have the wealth of the wicked to push back darkness to find out really who we are be a joint heir with Christ and so he's not and this is what he said Trump is raw he had a good work corner he said he's really wrong but I will temper him pence will temper him and he will be a great leader for this country but I'm saying all that because we had to have that that was the foundation for this time you did because it was all a foundation to prepare for what we will be it allowed to do in this country and I can tell you 2018 he's calling me season of destiny and that is a powerful word to say that that means many people many companies many churches ministries will be finally stepping into the true destiny opportunity now it's up in preparation we ask you about the wealthy because I know it's been like has actually have a date of like 23 years of when I first started hearing that prophecies about the wealth of wicked and I thought was gonna happen that year if I got the right date it was that was 1994 when I started hearing that but then it has happened to a degree over these 23 years but you're seeing this is different this is different how destiny and and I've people supposed to do something to cooperate with that I would tell people the first thing you need to do he even gave me a little tweaking list which I will share in the meeting because when he has me share something is to train people right maybe train for what God needs and how you do this because this is this this is a very focused time be focused in your priorities make sure you can go back as much as possible have restorations with people who who were not happy with you no matter whose fault it was it's going to be your job to make that restoration hear them that doesn't mean you want them to repent to you that means you're going to go to them and say you're sorry that they were upset about something but you're praying for them you care about them if you're going to be able to doing something big for God then you have to make sure that what's behind you is not left you can't hide things don't have hidden ones and you get rid of all the wounds because he's giving you seeing brand-new to do in this time and our brand new or new ways to do it that will be powerfully seen will be very visible the things he'll do with us now won't be behind doors anymore you'll be out there for the world to see the internet will go viral with many of these things that will happen and there will be many extremely wealthy people that will get born again that will want to put their money into the kingdom like immediately I'm talking about celebrities Oh the third thing on the list he is taking Hollywood nice I'm saying everything you've seen before now which is something a lot of things have been happening behind the scenes a lot of main actors actresses of getting born again but what will be coming out of Hollywood at the end of two years but it's going to start this year will be powerful does it mean it'd all be Bible stories but he's going to change the content in a lot of these movies and the ones you don't want to do it won't remain yeah I mean that's cleaning up and we didn't know how messy was we kind of had some ideas yes I you know what the time left how much time we have left guys give me an idea okay so give you more to share more on that list did you have some other things on that list that there's those three main things that people will begin to see immediately in the news and will be heard will be about Israel England or Hollywood and we need all that he needs those things to happen and if you wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't important that's what we have to look at there's other countries involved and I will mention that in the meetings but he is focusing on different countries right now selected countries and especially for us destiny that means if you're a little grandma somewhere and he said that he would do something with you and it's been 40 50 years and it hasn't happened this is the time with that soon not too late at the best days or are you late the best days are way ahead of an odd wait now and in the future not talk to you at all about the North Korea situation oh yes great family right that that was going to be something I will talk more detail about it he said North and South Korea will become one this year or just going to begin this year when you step into destiny you're stepping in a new door there's much that will will take place but he leads us up into our life we step on a threshold of time and everything behind use them preparation a transition is a good word for that we're at a time of positioning right now and you will step through that door it will be like you're dreaming because when you step through that door it's so easy it's almost like you're just you're moving and you can't believe that you're doing this because this is when it's God's time for it to happen and when you step something to you as you know I mean I would say things years and years ago he said it doesn't matter it will happen yeah what happened because God has said it will happen so the Korean thing got back to Vallon North and South are going to be reunited is it good I can't even say it's gonna be the leaders of there right now yeah I mean but what you have one or two that may not even be on the earth yet is that what you're saying is it what your you'll be left with this I'm saying what maybe move okay I see what you say this typically the North Korea yeah I hear you okay and then so people that let's let's do this for the benefit of those viewers they're looking at the news you're afraid of the nuclear thing and some people get afraid the shrimp's gonna push a button or something least not gonna push the button but what out of how can people's attitudes dump fear for lack of a better term how do we get rid of the fear that everything you need to do is loose what you have there right now because fear is almost like a disease if you have some in you and you never get rid of it the devil's always going to bring it back he'll make it greater he'll make sure you hear things more things that make you more fearful fear doesn't belong to God and if you're a believer it should never be in you it's one of the enemy's weapons it's his greatest thing is one of his fear when it's the substitute so get rid of all that fear and when you get up in the morning recognize who you serve father I love you I thank you to stay for your son I declared that I will be powerful in you they don't have sound wisdom with supernatural discernment I won't receive any fear from the enemy this day because I'm on your path now and you hold me in your hand so fear is a great weapon that's what enemy and this is what you do by the news maybe not watch so much yeah I was talking to me I literally if I watch the news I loose it all out of my soul because I'm gonna go by what God says not like your you're not ignorant of what's going on you're innocent of it okay you didn't cause it to happen God has great plans America's not going to be blown up and Tom's not leaving the White House and he will not do something that God literally does not want and if you start to see something God will correct him oh we got just a few minutes left so don't worry about anything else is going on around you okay this country here is going to be safer stronger a better off in every way and so I'm letting you know you either have to ignore some of it pray for the people saying it but even some of the media may lose their network or their speech that they're sitting in that's that's amazing by the way I understood this out well the tape is rolling and I'm gonna risk something 25 26 years ago a young prophetess she's still around but she's not known she's a personal friend but she's not a public and we were in our living room when she began to prime say this was in the time there were still Fox News back there this tweet this is like way back and the most prosperous network on that I am the television was CNN everywhere why she didn't she she's prophesying in our living room just to my wife but she goes that's just since CNN's coming down and I thought seeing the ends coming down Oh 23 25 days or something like 26 years ago and I think God is giving this specific revelation now we don't we don't pray for the demise of networks but we listen to what's being prophecy right it's the difference between hearing the word and it's what they're being used for if your whole agenda has changed now the enemy is in that agenda then it will be in confusion in fear like it's doing and a lot of the stuff is saying is actually made of outright lies yeah he said they're actually lying and deceiving and if he will not let them remain in that place because this is his time on earth for us to be great and to know him that's wonderful I'm going to ask you one more question and then we're out of time but I want to ask you about I've heard words about they were coming into time of a renaissance like the like there was where inventions and different things though the main thing is inventions I suppose different ways of thinking but let's not talk to you about inventions that are coming up a lot that's part of the destiny the whole destiny thing it can be for things not just people not even just believers giving for the secular world it could be for many things but this this season when turning to there'll be freedom and liberty the to be what God made us to be he has saved some of the best inventions that will actually change our whole lives new energy sources new ways to even process foods and stuff that will be safe they will not make a harmful from any way we travel even ways there will be accidents and things new sources to travel with there are many many new things you're right it is a season of the idea zone to drop down on this earth but not just get the ideas bring them into being so that we can enjoy them well before we go before we signing off I want Kat to share with you about her products offensive amazing I think we have some of them up here

other one is more about relationships in heaven and how heaven is still connected to this earth and so just go check it out very good thank you so much I appreciate I've read the books that they're amazing huh when I first read those it gave me like my wife and I were just sitting there with tears streaming literally not no exaggeration you talked about those babies that were either aborted or their even miscarriages and you talked about that and how these babies went to heaven and we're taking being taken care of by Jesus and the angels and how we needed to name the baby babies and you get your babies when you go to heaven they've given back to your very baby that you carry and if you had one aborted and you repented of that you go to heaven you get those babies given back to you get to raise him in heaven they'll still have the gifts God put in them so they really haven't missed anything demon living the most amazing beautiful place that's it means a lot of healing to keep that's amazing my wife and I we had I would say the name but we had she had a miscarriage we were young marrieds and it was hard we had two children and this while we were waiting for the third one to arrive she miscarried and it was a very traumatic thing so for us to read this book and and realize that we ended up even literally on the cruise picking a name and because we didn't know whether it was a boy or girl we picked the name that worked either way yes yeah and that was what we did so we picked that name and now once in a while when we think about it was the Oh Lord say say hello to you know you know because we are plans to give them a gift and you will good okay that's beautiful that's beautiful well one last thing before we sign off is that I wanted I know that those of you watching you're saying man I wish I had the whole tape of everything caps is going to say to give you two for two full sessions which but if you if you want to see these your DVDs we're going to make those available I think you'll put something on the screen that they can click into or look up so look as you're watching this you should be seeing an ad right about now and be sure to get those CDs these are like the best there's been a year since I've ordered CDs and DVDs because there wasn't anything new coming out not really new this stuff's really news Testim all right well thank you for joining us and we'll see you again next time bye bye hi welcome to prophecy decoders I just know Isaac you will get a prophetic perspective I'm watching the Winter Olympics and lo and behold headlines go all around the earth regarding what took place at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in South Korea the sister of Kim jong-un shakes the hand of the president of South Korea now that was hard to believe unfathomable just a few days ago a few weeks ago and definitely over the last several decades what is happening in Korea something unusual is taking place as North Korea in South Korea decide more importantly in North Korea and that ruler tyrannical ruler decides to join hands and show unity in the Olympics now I know it's just a look at games there's so much bigger things at stake like a missile program a nuclear missile program in North Korea and the dangers inherent in a dictator having those kinds of weapons but I want to talk about something could it be that what took place in the Winter Olympics in the opening ceremony opening ceremony a sign of coming attraction that's what I love about prophecy it's a sign of coming attractions now what's been prophesied in advance maybe that gives us a glimpse of the coming attractions Jeff Jensen had this to say on April 24th 2017 there is a common cry that echoes from that nation that God remember would removed the dividing line and make a unified Korea again it is the heart of God to bring healing to that divided nation and to make one unified Korea again I will remove the dividing line in the nation of Korea that is divided my people for 70 years and just as I brought a swift justice to my people who are in Babylonian captivity after 70 years they will be released to their land to rebuilds so many biblical references in that prophecy about Babylonian cavity 70 years now we know what took place in Israel's history about being captive for 70 years in Babylon but when they were free we hear about how to joyous the occasion was how the hearts began to sing again and I am looking forward to when Korea is unified again when North and South Korea families are not ripped apart like they were decades ago and they remain apart where there's so many tears shed over here of a united Korea coming guess what I know that joy will be all over that land I've been to Korea I've been actually to the border of North and South Korea I've seen the sorrow and the heartache of families ripped apart and I look forward to that day and guess what God is going to come through loud and clear Jesus in North Korea North Korea is the number one country for the most persecution of Christians so can you imagine where the dividing line is removed North to South Korea oh one and the gospel of Christ is going into North Korea have billions I am rejoicing over what I saw on the opening ceremony in the Winter Olympics a united Korea is coming thank you for watching

Hey good morning at least good morning here on the west coast also known as the left coast and we got Kat on the right coast also known as the East Coast and this is Kat Kerr and we're welcoming you now some of you will be getting on right now as we talk and and really want to remind those who are watching that at any point if you missed the first part you will be able to replay this right away if I understand it correctly so we won't waste a lot of time waiting for you to come on because you can replay it so I'm going to encourage you to do that be sure and also encourage you to tell your friends and text them that the Kat Kerrs aren't so Kat Kerr with a pink hair how are you Kat I'm doing great how about you I'm doing really good how is the whatever what has what does this pandemic or this the claim of a pandemic however we said how has that changed your life in the last few months what you've been doing not a lot of hanging out almost nothing the enemy does or was a part of affect me so I've actually stayed pretty busy and I've been going in and out of here not flying but in and out a lot so I've not really been here in my in my in my office I haven't had my office isn't my home if you all don't know that actually live in my office or my office lives in my home however you want to look at it that means is gonna be activity here all the time and because we do we ship stuff out we haven't ever really been kind of shut down not here and so our staffs been coming in and out and doing stuff excuse me stuff for us but nobody I know personally no one has had the virus and if the new virus and that's all guys ever said to me is never was it's not a plague it's not a disease it passes and that's what God is said to me from the beginning it will pass and it's not pass you know and so um much quicker than what people probably thought our plan from the people I've talked to out in the public about things I know people have all kinds of mindsets or what been listening to the wrong source especially this isn't something that's deadly to everybody and I know there has been a lot of stuff going on I'm not gonna jump to question number two right now although I'd like to so really not affected me not one member of my family of 100 family members no one has gotten it no one has gotten and no one knows anybody who's gotten it and I think most of the 50,000 people who follow me have not had it either protected a lot of people if that's what they're declaring this what they're believing for we will have us whether we say and no one should tolerate it anyway you know I've been telling people from the beginning you tell the BIOS you're not tolerating it evict it out of your presence out of your city we have authority over any sickness and just any sickness or disease actually because Jesus did you know it's interesting that you said nobody you know has been sick is this last weekend we went to see our daughter we've been we haven't seen her during a lot of this time you know trying to be somewhat conservative about it but I was talking to Jerry and I said do we know anybody anybody at all relative family friends and we know personally who has gotten sick and we just racked our brains and if we don't know anyway that's kind of sick we don't even know anybody we don't know anybody you Michael got something that he thought could be that he never was acted but it was it's weird for it overall the fear that is out there they're having a hard time tracking this you know let me just let me just well you know what I better be careful because if I don't go in the order of our questions I'll be jumping all around I know what works you I'm excited I do want to say one more thing about that I've never called it a pandemic that's tags get put on things and I know that word actually means it's worldwide that's what that word means that does it means it's not just done in one city or one country that's what that word means I'm not saying there haven't been cases out there I'm not going to be the ignorant about it but I do know this for a certain 90percent of the people have never been affected by it people who are normally healthy okay it's for those who may have already had something or of course but my mom's going 90 she's had nothing okay and so I think it's also how you think about it yourself and if you're taking a stand against it I'm not saying it never existed but I do know that 10percent maybe 90percent no not at all which is a good thing really it's a good thing but and I think the more that's the realization of that come I think there's somebody who's getting extremely upset and angry right now that would be our president it does explain that what do you mean a lot of lies have been told to him and those lies I'm not going into number two right now right they lies from certain areas and professionals I'm not talking about people on his actual staff I'm talking on people he reached out to find out information have literally lied well about the impact of it about what these are gonna call post about what his and he needs to only responded because he cares he really cares but he's about to do he's not really happy about what the findings are he sent things out on his own to find out the truth he actually began to talk to people to find out what people were experiencing saying I'm just gonna throw that out there for free I know it's not necessarily but since we're talking about that virus I just need to know let people know the truth that I do know not maybe not assumed about really the truth I care when this thing has gotten going again there's a whole lot of like we've talked like you just said lies I'm sure those exaggerations really people have that I want to throw this out before I ask this follow-up question on number one I had to do the research the other day about the number of deaths in the United States in a given day yes and in the calculator this is 2017 it's interesting here as it was almost all seven so I happen to I thought why 17 that's that's far away from that so nobody can say these numbers are connected and you took out just the deaths in the United States where any cars whatsoever it's like 7770 deaths every single day so we're basically out of 365 days the people that are freaking out who have passed away I mean every death is a sad thing so I don't want to say that incorrectly but that's like 10 days 12 days worth of normal us a desk and and around the entire United States for the equivalent I mean we have as a you as a nation we are used to 7770 deaths in a given day and many of those are from influenza so they have noted that all the people that have died there isn't it interesting that the that the influenza though the common flea deaths have dropped dramatically that's because they're calling everything covered 19 so that's a number to us number one that we wanted to talk about is what is God saying about the United States and China and all of this as it relates to what we're talking about well to be very honest with you God has never changed anything he said to me about what he's got planned what's about to happen what is happening now and I think a lot of the focus and maybe even attention has been drawn away from some of the things the good things that are starting to happen that God has planned because of that of course we know the fake news and I don't mind calling them that exist what they are they want to draw attention to what they want people to see in here which is always going to be doom and gloom fear you know anything that's bad in any way and so I think a lot of the focus has been on that on purpose well number one we all really know why they don't want Trump reelected so anything that can make anything look bad but maybe he was involved in they're trying to blame him for everything now but that would happen to you so God has never stopped talking about the greatness these great days of glory the high call of God that is the season ring now he's still planning these things he's still setting things up in the background and this is a time of acceleration and all of this stuff going on he still is is preparing to accelerate us into the next level of not just him but even in society in business in every arena that seems to be shrinking and disappearing he's about to accelerate and cause explosion every one of those areas I think we will end up with more jobs available than it was before this virus came and I only won't call it nothing but a virus before it came I think there'll be more out there and more things out there and even while this is going on there are actually new jobs and new ways to be employed increasing even in the midst of this but that's not being told out later in the news that's that's messily let's go on to number two thanks for that I want to before he asked this question there was a time not that long ago when people who are in ministry Christian ministries we had to be very very careful about referring to left and right a Republican and Democrat and he yet can't over time it's become very very clear that that believers tend to be on the right they're not all on the right meaning left versus right and and unbelievers tend to be on the left that's not exclusively true but it's a lot true so but here I am going to openly use the term left what does God tell you about exposure let's start with enough we go to the right if you want to but what does going to tell you about exposures that are coming he actually told me this maybe I don't know before the whole virus thing started I already knew this was because of what the high call of God because of the great things are about to happen through the body of Christ he had you he had you have this plan so he knew everything that would happen he knew all of it of course we know because he's God he knows everything about every individual no matter where you the world you can't hide anything from him and a lot of hidden groups that have been working with the left these are wicked even people evil people will be exposed I mean he said from the top to the bottom in that whole group I know that there's some nice people on both sides there always will be some people who don't understand what's going on there on the left and they think for whatever reason they want you that that's decide to be with but I don't vote and I don't agree with anyone who wants to take the lives of babies and neither does God by the way he doesn't still doesn't like that and so I tell people if your base base your decision on how you're going to live or choose those who out there and that means anybody whether it's the governors whether it's mayor's whether it's anybody not just the president you better choose so many stands for lives because that's who God is going to be using to impact things in this in this country and even in the world and so there's a lot of things that have been going on that they think have been hidden so this exposures like he's pulling back this whole not a veil but he's pulling back this whole thing where people have been hidden kept hidden who are promoting and paying for a lot of the violence especially going on or threats of violence which has never stopped happening there's always threats of violence that have no ground whatsoever they've been saying along since this whole that they're even using the virus now you know we kind of went past that to promote violence it could possibly happen they that left they really want us to fight not everybody but I always have to say that nobody but there's a great majority especially leaders in that whole group that are hoping that we will have civil war and that we will lose everything we have and they were really happy that we were quarantined in our homes because we were less of a threat and and they want to hand-feed us so they can control us that's just been their agenda now for years and but I can tell you what this is God's time and I don't care how much they strive they fight they plan they pay their money out it doesn't matter how much they hate or playing against God they are fighting him they're fighting what he wants right now and these are running into some of the greatest days the earth has seen not just for the next several years but for several generations to come and he's never stopped telling me that so people better roll up your rapture ugh and I do know that there's some people out there that don't understand the timing of God either so they think this is the end and I can tell you it's going to be a lot more than just a little virus that happens in the end but all those who on purpose and there are many that are going to be exposed not just excuse me not just in this country because this thing is so far-reaching that are plotting and planning against what God wants he wants righteousness justice and liberty in our country that there are those outside this country that also hate our country and they hate our president and they have even dropped their own barriers which probably wasn't the smartest thing they ever did I will tell you this not even in hell are their partners not even in hell do they do they come together to try to plan clean evil there is no friendship or love amongst any evil people not not in the criminals not anybody not criminals not people who want deaths not people who want violence not people who hate anybody who come against anybody those who have no care or concern for life itself no matter who it is or what age they are there's no love for each other and when those brutes begin to plug together it is the downfall and that's always happen in history but God's not just repeating what's happened he's going to expose and levels we've never seen before and I'm saying with the documents to prove what's been going on he's been showing me visions of these groups of people meeting behind closed doors even in other countries to play an imply our downfall I'm talking about America's downfall and that is what they want in they're not going to get it and I think when this is all over people will be absolutely shocked see how many people are involved in this great deception to bring fear control in this country and I will say bottom line is as Satan wants this country this country he doesn't care what he has to do to get it he doesn't care who he gets to get get come to his side to help promote or even do those things or lie cheat and steal about those things to try to make this happen no one can fight against God and win and when he has people who have been praying and declaring to him let me tell you by the hundreds of thousands of body of Christ really seriously especially like the last four or five years having coming together and numbers never seen or heard of before even in groups even online doing this declaring God's will be done in this country there's no way the enemy's going to get this country and not just this country there's other countries now and leaders of other countries that are getting born-again and whenever they had whatever you know yourself whatever is on the head is what will come down it will come down to the rest of the people but great deceptions been going on for some time and I think people will be shocked at the degree the level and how many the number of that's going to happen so they can try to hide all they want to they can't hide from God okay thank you when I've heard you say both in public when we're doing conferences together or in a trip to Israel that we did together with us so much you've said almost every time you speak these are quote these are not the perilous times and now this virus came along and you're still saying these are not the perilous times is that why Sarah would say well if I look at my Bible these things are all plotted these conspiracies this has to be this has to be it's too wicked and and yet here's what I'm going to say agree or disagree the reason you know it's not the perilous times is by revelation is that true or not true is true but also the fact that I have always been real sensitive about a lot of stuff even as a little child I have and my dad was like that also and if you if people could see a really understand it's not just what I know about the futures what I also know about the past like in the days of Noah and stuff like that and that also is by revelation but if you just read the word if the earth was so bad Steve if it was so wicked I'm talking about the whole world that God had to destroy it except for a handful of people how bad was that because he searched for people that he knew he could trust that knew him and if he only found a handful how wicked was the rest of the world at that time but I myself know hundreds of thousands of strong powerful believers who live justly who love who help who serve God who know who he is if he has that many people on the earth why would he destroy it because it says in the perilous times it will be as it was in the days of Noah wasn't anything like it was in the days of Noah right now there's people who care who help who bless you know who want good even people who are secular people when I say secular that means non-believers there's even secular people doing good who want good who actually want a future and so this is not my number one statement is this is not as it was in the days of Noah I mean they were eating each other they were killing their own family members they were so involved with defilement that even hell was involved in their lives like in person involved in their lives and they were worshipping demons and an outwardly has stuff happening that is not the way it is right now no matter how bad they think it is and if you've been born and around probably maybe for the last thirty years or so you haven't really seen terrific evil on the earth I mean I would have thought if anything would have been in the days of Hitler right when that pure evil that was hell involved in the whole country not the people by the way of my people in Germany and I love people in Germany but that was Satan's controlling a whole country but at that time in the days of Noah Satan was controlling the whole world he was involved in every evil act every evil deed to the point where people were so horrible that God had to wipe them off the face of the earth so you know one can say that now is as it was in the days of Noah and yet the Bible says those times will be we haven't begun to tap into creativity into inventions we have not even completed the shortlist Jesus gave us that he himself said we would do it hasn't happened yet and God is not willing to with all of us off this earth and take us away because if the body of Christ was raptured who would fulfill we haven't even seen one manifested son or daughter or stop an earthquake and make it put it back the way it was before let me tell you what these things like that coming and so therefore just reading the Bible and understanding God actually means what he says just as a normal believer which I haven't met for a long time I would understand in my head it can't happen now I know people that have a 40 and 50 year you know Commission that they haven't even started to operate in if he's giving Commission's and mantels and anointings for the greater works why would he end it all because I happen to know from the father the day of his son's wrath and the day of his sons power can't happen at the same time and right now we're in the day of his power so this is not the perilous times yeah that's interesting can you talk about the inventions because God revealed that to me I remember the moment I was reading a magazine three or four years ago four five years ago about this incredible inventions health-wise that God had been anointing these people and they were coming up with miraculous discoveries and recoveries and I thought all of a sudden it was as that went down from heaven it's not in words but in and all of a sudden I understood exactly what you're saying why would God suddenly why would he invest all these time and energy to begin to bring these inventions in these healings to the service so they could begin to affect the earth and say that's it I'm wiping this place out it doesn't it's not logical and you know what I know God doesn't necessarily think logically and he definitely is strange in this Arius but I will say this he has his plans and he has a time on yes I know that by revelation I've seen it but I can tell you just by reading the word itself when pastors or people don't understand what's going on they don't they couldn't even think in their whole soul that great and good and powerful get happened they're totally ignoring the fact about the kingdom which is a spiritual King that we rule in now in this lifetime and just because Jesus talks so much about the kingdom that's our authority our Dominion and the things that will create invent we will have authority over the land the sea in the air there's a manifested sons and daughters it's all scriptural so just reading the word and being open to the Holy Spirit without even the revelation he has literally shown me he's taking me into the future and show me things happening and let me tell you I've gone over a hundred years into the future and I'm not I'm not I'm not afraid to say that Wow if you had stood before the man if I said son of God face to face and he is telling you things there's no way anyone out there can stop you from believing it Eitan and you don't look at what's going on you don't ignore what's going on you take authority over and that's what I've been telling people for the last few months take authority over all of it you know you don't have to be caught in any trap the enemy's setting and then take his oppression that he wants you to have and fear he want you to have those things don't come from God and yet he's appointed us to greatness it says so he has good plans for us he said so these aren't things even man is saying so just the understanding of what he's saying in his word if you drew your own timeline and I challenge anyone to do it by the way the tribulation has not happened there's people even saying that and it hasn't happened I've seen parts of that and even let me talk about it because he wants people to focus on the days they're here and what their purpose is if he times your birth on the earth you need to run after that and ignore everything else the enemy is trying to convince you of and you have to run your race get rid of every weight that gets in your way that means things that might be going on you take authority over it Jesus gave us power and authority in this earth I think one of the greatest issues is the body of Christ do not realize who they are and the son and daughter of God they just don't realize the authority they have over Satan they have over any circumstances situations in their life what we say with our mouths matters what we let in our soul matters and I make sure mine stays free of everything no one has to walk around depressed or fearful and call those things that be not as though they were it doesn't say talk about the things going on right so you know one scripture of call those things it be not as though they were you live and act like they are happening that they are coming if you have expectancy in your heart but this is changing and you're gonna have a part in that that's that's like number three what are you doing here but but I can tell you what the the exposure that is going to be falling and it's already started it's already started and I can't name names or same thing but I do know some inside people concerning Trump and stuff going on and I got it already told me stuff anyway it wasn't like they were telling me anything new but I do know that great exposure is about to take place and I had someone tell me this didn't come from me someone told me that they had that God had said to them that if the Democratic Party does not change that's the left that they will be no more now I didn't say that that was said to them because of because of where they have gone now what they started years ago wasn't what they are now we give open doors to the enemy and you choose the darkness and you choose death and not life then your own mind becomes seared to things that wouldn't even be good in the normal or in the natural and I can just tell you there's gonna be great things and actually some people will no longer live yeah I mean even beyond the earth anymore because they've been doing and coming against God and hating and eatin people and actually some of that happened last before in 2016 some things happens people just God took him up the air yesterday he I know that I know you and I know your what God has showed you that I know early on God showed me that President Trump was his man he's not our pastor and she is a commander-in-chief but he's the person like the Cyrus on the earth that's working with him also I see him progressing in the things of the Spirit from it is less of a baby Christian than he was back when he first started ready I can tell right what do you say to people let me ask it this way I've heard you prophesy or just declare that Trump will be here for eight years and I've heard other people with a prophetic gifts a trip will be here for eight years if my people pray and humble themselves into battle or whatever how would you describe the balance between what God would like let's say another four years for president Trump which I believe he does versus us praying so that it will happen I mean I can assure you that all the prayers I would tell people to keep praying but the prayers have already going forth for him to be here for another four years good okay really seriously about that that the prayers needed to him there and the people who people don't even know about by the tens of thousands that is what they've been doing every single day since 2016 not getting off their face not stop declaring so God doesn't need like every single person in the world to do something in the earth he needs a people he needs a remnant that that is their passion what his passion is is their passion and right now this is God's passion is for him to remain here he is going to win in 2020 and God does not stop saying that to me he says it to me almost every day he will win and he will do even greater things in the next four years than he did in the first four years and I know people are saying things well everything's been wiped out he already did it hasn't all been wiped out it's what's in the hearts of the people that he with hope for a future you know with goodness with caring and just totally not listening to any of the left who are saying the opposite you can't hold people I'm not saying he was always perfect obviously he went through a time in his life when he wasn't but he has more and more going into the light of what God wants and I do personally know that he seeks out his first counsel is with the strong believers and leaders of believers is his first counsel and he has not stopped now it's not doing that so he doesn't stand scripturally he doesn't stain in the counsel of the ungodly in this virus he probably had some of that but he didn't know that they would be lying and giving him false information he seriously seek to those who were professional in certain arenas that he expected the truth to be given to him and he's finding out that was not so I'm not saying every single person but there are people that were doing it on purpose and plotted and planned to that for their purpose so Trump doesn't stand in the counsel of the ungodly he seeks the counsel of the godly and even God himself number two he allows and welcomes God to be in our country on purpose yes and so there are things he his own self has prayer they have prayer meetings they have Bible studies in the White House his wife is such a powerful prayer warrior right now and it's not just Tim it's his family also they can't they try to separate them and read them apart because they're even more dangerous when they come become unified any family is by the way but the way he's focused himself he wants the best for this country and he's willing to do what he knows inside he has to do he's certainly both enough to do it he can brush everything else aside I've never known a single person on the face of the earth has probably been bashed trashed as much as he has in that position that he's in and yet has gone full force what he knows will help our country make a country great and not just our country he's reaching out to other leaders of countries to help them so why would God abandon him and pick somebody who doesn't even want babies to live they don't they want to control they don't care about anybody really except themselves why wouldn't he choose the darkness over the light he's not going to well good stuff can't our third area we're gonna cover today is down on the body of Christ kind of needs to prepare for what God is going to begin to do from heaven most of it I mean I've heard different prophetic words about we don't know the the tiniest bit tenth of what he's about to do has never been done before but we don't know what that is how do we prepare for that what can we do well I would say I'm praying that most people took advantage of the time they have had with their families I know one thing that's extremely important to God even if even if we want in this time even it was just like normal times but we're not wondering a very divine time right now your relationship with your own family and I'm saying like husbands and wives first and then then with their family members to make that you're bonded together that each of them are giving love to each other because God loves the home he loves marriage and he loves family and so this to me I kept telling people you have an opportunity that's never happened in the world before where it's kind of stopped everything's stopped and you maybe quarantine I didn't even call it quarantine the you are now secluded with your family and you get to be together do things together you're literally a seeding into the soul of the generations that are now on the earth growing up and they will never forget these days the things you said if you taught them to pray if you never did that before if you haven't ever prayed for them to floor let them see that in you because that's going to be so important for how they live the choices they will make and so even in not even considering all the spiritual leaders right now but just in the home and the family the number one preparation you should be making for what is coming is to know and understand God has great plans for you no matter what is going on there could be a whirlwind of going around in your life you know maybe you've lost your job maybe the company closed maybe whatever that isn't gonna stop God from blessing you you have to see that know that and you should be telling your children there my dad always seated us with faith with hope for a future the the greatness of God his a love for us the possibilities even when it seems impossible all of that impossibility gets wiped away because nothing's impossible with God and I say number one don't run after everything else run out there try to do things in abandon the ones he first gave you you know I do happen to know that when you first get to heaven the first question guy will ask you is what did you do with your family I'm gonna stand on his throne and say how many souls did you win it's like he didn't know right he knows everything it's not that he doesn't know that or care about that but the ones he gave you personally to care for to love I know there's a lot of broken homes pray for those people anyway but your spouse's love you pray for them anyway that they know God that they understand God and always for your children especially if you've been a strange call them have conversations with them and I know you people were thinking maybe they'd been more than that that's number one okay make sure you're spending that time with God to even be able to do these things you have to have that time with God you need people say how did you develop your relationship with God I spent time with him well what does that look like I didn't lay on my face and cry out and tremble and pray for eight hours a day I went in a room and shut the door and say okay God I want to know you I want to know you I want to be just like you I want to understand what you want from me I want to know you closer than anyone else on the earth I'm gonna do great things I need you here you because I love you and I did that for days and days and days and days and one day he walks through the wall of my home and after that he never stopped coming and I never stopped seeking Him it says in the Bible no matter what's going on in your life I love the scripture seek ye first the I'm up God and His righteousness sake everything else you need is going to be added to you yeah and yet so many people are listening to so many other voices and yet if there was one scripture in the Bible I would tell them they need to meditate on and run after and declare that when you talk about what God wants it draws him to you not that he doesn't care about you but he's listening for those who want to know him more who cares about what he cares about and so number number one probably would be make sure you're seeking God more then don't forget your family and then after that you need to change your mindset about who you are and what God thinks about you because if he put you here now he has a purpose for you he has a vision and a purpose for every single person he really does I have a 12th grade education I'm not some great big Brian that's been to universities and have all kinds of certificates and things like that but I have a heart that's after God yeah David did and look how many mistakes David me but look what she did for God he never stopped loving God and when he made mistakes he'd go to him and ask for forgiveness but he had a heart ram that's what God says about him it was after him and so the simplest things cuz people get all these study books and resources and they want to look in here maybe I'll find something that will just kick me into high gear it's called God that's what it's called it's called it's Christ it's known him he holds everything in his hands he made everything never existed he knows the future he knows every every desire of your heart and he came to me one day because I people said well how much do you pray and I heard God say you tell them I said you pray all the day because you never stopped talking to us clear conversation with God and prayer doesn't mean it's okay to give him his needs of course he cares about you cast all your care upon him he cares for you I'm talking about just having conversation about anything I include him in and I will ask him all kinds of things or discuss things with him even if I don't see him in front of me that doesn't stop me from doing because I believe he hears me which is well again back to the word so many people don't even read the words you need to read the word how about put that on your list okay but he's serious if you seek him whether all of your heart all of your might and all your mind you'll find him because he's waiting right there next to you but there are great things coming and he will use many unknown people not unknown to him but I'm known to mankind these people have just kept themselves I'm not saying be a hermit and go hide in the hills and by the way you can't get anyone's age or share the kingdom or stuff you know with people if you hide from people and I was always a person who didn't really want to be by people I was one in fifteen I already had major jobs going on for me and my family to help with my siblings because I was you know older than most of them and I didn't know God even from a young age I was four and I actually saw Jesus Christ up inside of me so you can imagine living my life like that being a seer seeing the spirit realm all around me I know I didn't have a normal life and and yet I still had to make choices like everyone else right I don't live a stress-free life I don't know if you are you kidding if we gave a list of things that were going on around us were you Lucifer my soul we give it to God we bind him to our heart and run after whatever he has said he wants to do and I will assure everybody people can fight and yell and argue all they wanted this is not the end don't waste your time preparing to get on your rapture rug you will do nothing okay he didn't say to you that I said take Dominion take authority that means you rule and reign that means you take you don't you know put up with anything in the enemy don't tolerate don't participate with him but you get your crown on and you begin to rule by what you say the choices you make and openly manifest who and what you believe he is and you who do you who do you follow and unbelievers don't big good job No yeah nobody let me we're about out of time for today but I want to ask you some people might not have missed this but I I didn't miss it sent me I'm missing I didn't miss what you just said when you talked about how you prayed and I'm going to ask you about whether it's a selfish in a good way a good selfish now you said make me closer to you I want to know you better than any person on the face of the earth that one stuck with me when you said it's never going to leave so it's not added to my prayer that's kind of like be my prayer talk about that for a minute how selfish and how Germanic can we request God to come like that he wants you to do it he so desires if we really understood we came from I'm down about the father now we came from him he carried us inside of himself until he timed our births on the earth so we would have a body he created a whole physical realm how much time and energy did he take himself to make a way for us to be here and then also what did he do to make it possible for us to come back to him that's how much he loves us and he loves everyone the same he doesn't pick some people over other people because he loves them more it's because they have surrendered more because they're more willing maybe to give up some things maybe to change what they're doing or saying it's your desire how great is your desire to know him because his number one desire and everything he could have or do or want is us and he wants to hear us say those words I remember when I would hear him laugh out loud when at one point I used to start yelling I got side electrodes on you and I would yell I want to be just like you well I want to be just like you I want to operate like you that is his that's his bottom line for all of us not just me but if people can get their eyes off everything around them and begin to say that to him do you think you'll escape being great answer is no and I don't do it to be great it's not about what I get or don't get it's about what he gets it's about what he wants and in the Bible God said let us make man in our image that's Father Son and Holy Spirit and after our likeness their life this is how they operate he's not repeating himself an image is an image but likeness means how they operate so he himself said let us make man to look like us and act just like us it's good if we were operating like him oh my word this would be a whole different world but we're entering into seasons and even generations where it will be such a different life ok and that will continue to grow and improve until the end begins to come I'm talking about the very end and I can point to mark 16 all day long and Jesus said can you music this is what you need to tell all those people preaching this is a perilous times this is a tribulation he said no we don't have time for that right now it's got its own time he said the devil gets a bump in the road he only gets a few short years to be in charge but until then the body of Christ will grow an authority and Dominion in inventions and creations we have to create things because he's a creator the world will look different ok until that time starts and that is generations away he said in mark 16 they'll be wars and rumors of wars nations rise against nation Kingdom to rise against Kingdom but the end is not yet so they want to know where are we in the Bible we are right there the end is not yet the manifested sons and daughters must be in this earth visibly seen doing supernatural acts never done in the years before we will actually speak and things will be healed not just an arm or a leg or someone's body but cities God has given us such authority use he's going to build readings of light and glory that sin and sickness won't be able to exist in the Ruby regions of darkness and evil because until Christ you know comes and all the whole thing ends until everything ends and evil is still here they'll still be people who want evil and so people have to live in those evil dark cities they want to be because they won't be able to do any versions of glory so this is what he's plenty his ultimate plan is is to have this on the earth okay that greatness is coming in every area five major diseases will no longer exist on this earth at one point and yet people are saying a virus is bringing the tribulation okay I can tell you the virus and virus and it's passing and that's what he said it will pass and he said it will pass quickly and so I want people to understand you can have as much of him if me just just to you know 12th grade graduate all right with know a high-minded education it's what's in my soul it's what is in my heart it's where are my desires my desire is for him and if you're gonna have a best friend you don't tell them every issue in your life you don't go around spewing and other people hurting and mourning them were supposed to speak life we're supposed to bring hope were supposed to take authority we have a light in this and the more you use that light and the enemy looks at you one day you look like a burning Inferno he wanted to be able to see you that's what I'm going after that's what every believer should go after that they want to manifest who he is and what he is breathing in our lives at this time so run after him first seek ye first the kingdom which is him yes but it's also ruling in that kingdom what does that look like it looks like on earth as it is in heaven so good just so good well we could talk for you I know you and I we could go for a couple hours like we did at one time on the cruise your staff we're all looking for a car worth it was it maybe she's visiting Steve and dreams crazy yeah so this one will keep me shorter but then we'll have you back more often if that's okay I would love to have it so thank you so much I know if nobody else got anything I got plenty of it I know that people are going to be passing this around it'll be fun we'll have you back here several times of course before the election because it'll be fun to talk about what's happening there too and yeah and I'm having that prayer out there sometimes I pray those huge prayers like that and I think man I hope that's not too selfish but today I found out it wasn't too selfish so no no oh well God bless you can't we'll see you thank you everybody for watching be sure to tell your friends send this over share it over and and we'll see you again soon God bless ya see y'all later

watching now the streaming portion of prophetic revelation so we're about to introduce in just a few moments Kat Kerr be sure and text your friends and let them know Kat's about to be on she is an all-time favorite mo we get more views when Kat Kat is on than almost any other time so she loves to talk about heaven before i bring her on let me just tell you all a quick story that about 2013 or 2014 can't remember which year my wife and i went on a cruise uh off of the east coast um the caribbean cruise and before we went all i had this sudden insatiable desire to get every book i could get on heaven people that have visited heaven i just got this big old stack of books and i don't know why i was getting it but uh uh often by the way when you have these desires that you don't know where they came from where they pretty much come from the lord when they when that happens and so during the whole cruise when we'd have our downtime in the room we i would read these books and the ones that were my favorite are the ones called revealing heaven i think there was there's a volume one or two i might have only had volume one at that time can't remember but and i would sit there in my i would just string tears as i hear heaven described by Kat so i'm going to let's this is a good time let's bring Kat on about now and we're going to hey Kat how are you we can see you now i'm doing

a little overcast and a bit rainy just a little bit here in the northwest but we could take that because we had those fires out here just a few weeks ago so yeah listen kat i want to before we jump into this and i you know i see you got your red white and blue in the stars and all along with your pink hair i love that i want to hear if you would do this for the people some have not ever heard you speak before and this will be passed around um i wanted to ask you about your visits to heaven just a few minutes on how many times you've gone if you can even quantify that sort of thing and then how does it help you to know what God's saying right now today well i've been a believer from the age of four i forget how old i am because i'm just gonna claim timelessness you know there you go i've been on this earth for i'm sure it's over 60 years at least but you know when you're connected to heaven you feel like a child we all know what the word says you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom of heaven and it's not just a requirement it's because heaven is so amazing and beautiful and adventurous and filled with awe and wonder that you would almost have to have the mind of a child when you get it and that's that's your future home everyone who belongs to jesus christ and just so you remember this or you know think about this there were several people in the bible the old testament the new testament that either saw God himself he came down and visited with them or they were caught up to heaven so even though i'm taken to heaven that's not my plan i don't even do that God catches me up by his spirit and takes me on tours of heaven and there's a reason for that i like i said i've known the lord from age four i've had a personal relationship with him then a real intimate relationship with jesus christ probably 20 30 years just really seeking him out to be in his presence and so also as a seer i also didn't make that happen from the time i was a little girl i could see into the spirit realm so i've always seen angels or demons activities of hell activities of heaven and in the spirit realm you know that's called the unseen realm there's more than just creatures and angels there's places that were built for heaven to use or other places that the enemy uses all around us that spirit realm is present so i see it all the time so you have to understand it's normal to me to see and understand these things but probably my first encounter happened when i was probably around 13 and i was just walking and talking to God and he gave me an open vision of me myself and i was asking God you know i'm one of 15 kids by the way so if you're that means if you're not you don't have a clue okay especially when you're number three that means a lot of responsibility and you know i'll build your character early learn to love people no matter what they do or say to you and so God fully prepared me to be taken to heaven and see what he wants me to see then he takes me and brings me back to share it and i've been doing that for over 20 years hear to me many times but in 1996 appeared to me and said that he and the father were going to start taking me on tours of heaven so they could reveal heaven to earth in great detail i happen to be a detailed person and the few companies i worked for especially the law office you know or design interior design they loved that detail thing in me because nothing was left out nothing was forgotten i also have a photographic memory which God uses that so i remember every time i've been to heaven and i stopped counting after one 000 times wow i'm like you know i'm i'm like this warehouse of revelation on heaven but also the word of God revelation on the word of God and the father son and holy spirit and even time itself so i do know many things that are going to happen on the earth and i've been taking over 100 years into the future so if you're sitting on your rapture rug get off of it and get your crown on so you can get ready to rule with jesus christ these are things that father has me tell people all the time wow and so he's just catches me up when he wants to i'm here one second and then my spirit my spirit man is somewhere in heaven when he's done showing me things i could see four or five different places and i hear the angels talking nobody sees me except the angelic or father son or holy spirit they see me in heaven the people don't see me because the father said i was seen by people in heaven they'd do the same thing you would you would run up to me and say please tell my family member i love them and they would be doing that all the time so people up there know i come to heaven but they don't see me when i'm there that way i'm not chased down the streets of gold that makes sense hey i'm going to ask you a question i've never asked you before kat we've talked for hours about all of this i've never asked you this if you are a portrait artist in detail if you if you could do that would you have been able to draw the distinct characteristics of the father's face i could because of my photographic memory but i think one of the greatest experiences i've ever had was when jesus christ introduced me to his father and jesus himself gave me a commission to reveal the father himself what he's like the things he says what his heart is on things and so people hear me talk about the father a lot and they go don't you care about jesus well i'm just doing what jesus asked me to do to help people understand who the father is why jesus loves him so much why he's willing to go to the cross for us even when it's like to be around him in heaven the father is absolutely he definitely has white hair but it's got life and it's like it moves and i never forget that i touched it one time when i was there it's like life jumped into my entire being his eyes are like you can barely see his eyes because of the glory coming out of him i so remember the rainbow which he talks about in revelation 4 and when john said i saw a rainbow round about the throne like i'm to an emerald now i want to stress he said i'm too like an emerald it actually one of the biggest parts of the rainbow is teal which happens to be the father's favorite color if you like that yeah that's a that is a beautiful color i love that color yeah the rainbow is not like just stationary it comes from him so it moves and waves in and out of his very being and it's very captivating and sometimes he'll grab one of the bands of the rainbow he throws it and it goes around having them bring somebody to him that he wants to visit with second thing excuse me i'm sorry um when the when the lord brings you thousands of times i suppose now um you're what you're saying Kat is that his purpose is not just to tell you but he wants you to tell tell about it right because you know paul or whoever was caught up in the third heaven said i saw things i wasn't allowed to to say and i'm guessing the lord must show you some things you're not allowed to say is that right very few things because really have a commission he said if i if i take you there you have to share good and now paul you have to understand saw things ahead of his time so if he had tried to share in his own time there's no way people had in their head not even could they conceive of what he was trying to say and so the father says certain things to be revealed at a different time this is definitely the time when he wants to reveal much about himself about the trinity about heaven itself in the future also and so i i get a lot of revelation on the word on time and you know God's been the father's father son and holy spirit have been from the beginning to the end in the end to the beginning they know everything already that's going to happen they actually have a timeline uh in the throne room that has God's important things that will happen on the earth and those things that are his appointed time if you go check the book of acts it actually says there are some things that are not for man to know that are appointed to happen that are in the power of the hand of the father himself and only when he reveals himself is it allowed to be given so so some of the things i'm sure paul saw were things that he he could not at that time reveal but in this time he showed me things for up to a hundred years that will happen on this earth and one thing i can promise tell you that he will always love you he will always seek you out jesus christ will always pursue you even to the very grace that you might know who they are that your that your destiny might be saved and you would be with them in eternity it really is their greatest desire so a person that um out again there's people even watching that are gonna say man i've sinned i've made so many stupid mistakes i've blown it all over and over whatever the case may be and your word to them is what i would say don't let the devil lie to you and say that God's not going to want you that he would not receive you in heaven you simply have to repent of your sins receive christ as your savior and you have to remember what the word says he wipes and blots out all of those things you did that were wrong every sin you ever committed or anything you may have said that would be uh crushing the people or taking the life out of people he will forgive that and it will be to you like it never happened and he will write your name in the lamb's book of life and let me tell you we go to heaven for a while but he will make a new earth one day i've had glimpses of that and the things we'll get to do out in space it is amazing but you do not want to miss the one who carried you before you were in this earth the one who loves you the most the one willing to send his son the love that comes from him is consuming and to me the most memorable times i have is when i was in the throne room or i was with the father to spend time alone even with him which he does with people in heaven your loved ones are living in the most amazing powerful beautiful adventurous place that you could not ever create and there's some view and declaring over you even now on this earth so i tell people if you don't know cross you might as well give up if your grandmother or your room is up there praying over you your words have power and the holy spirit will get you that's good well uh Kat thank you so much for that let's let's then talk about uh november 3 the election God has been speaking to you about the election coming up uh where where do you want to start i'm going to just give you the floor well first of all i'm going to say that God actually started speaking to me about trump before he was actually in the running right before he announced he would even run and then i think there were 16 republicans running against him for that spot and God told me i will remove each of them one by one until there's only one person left that the republican uh national convention can say yes to and that will be trump God throws trump before he was even born he knew everything he do what he would become and he knew in this time he needed somebody strong who couldn't be bought who couldn't be bulldozed who couldn't have fear put in them they would hear what he wanted and he would carry that out and this is what the father says about trump he's an all-american boy that cares all for america and i knew then that he would win no matter what anyone said or was trying to figure out in their head that he was going to win and i will say that again God has never changed what he said yes i just spent time with him last night and trump will win that election but never in the history of our country have we had so many people trying to cheat steal harvest ballots i mean everything bring violence to bring distraction and i'm sure that the left was even hoping that the whole virus thing would keep everybody in their homes and nobody would get to vote but each time something comes up hoping that it will help them win their person and by the way i have to add this when i was just speaking in colorado God spoke to me he's prophesied just like in the old days where when you open your mouth and it's him speaking he actually said why would you want a villain for your president when i've already sent a superhero so if you ever wonder what does does God think that's what he thinks because he's going to choose who wants life liberty freedom and justice and not communism you know not socialism not controlling not violence not no no integrity no one's no respect does that party have and they've continually gone down into a deeper hole a deeper pit buying votes putting out commissions for people to be defamed and it doesn't matter who's running that's good you're going to hear bad things about them because of the fake news they're all on their side on the side of darkness because i don't know what's what you would call it and on the side of light and life is trump and God has evidently told me he will win despite the the crimes and the things that they're committing trying to make it happen for biden people want somebody who knows what they're doing and has hope for this country and trump will win on november 3rd yeah i think off camera before we went on i had told you that i saw a major news outlet online version of it and they this thing says that uh now the statistics are that uh there was like a well they said a 91 chance i guess is where they were that that that biden was gonna win and all of these statistics i can't remember exactly but in other words they're trying to throw out that there's this is going to be a a slam against uh that there's no way trump could win and and you're looking at that what do you do when you see that do you laugh what do you when i laugh a lot because you know what heaven laughs literally laugh every time uh because God knows that they represent the darkness that represent no hope for life no future if you want to open the borders and let every criminal anyone come in from any country anywhere without boundaries it's going to be just like all the other countries that fell into a hole became a third world country they want to take the guns away they want kids to pick what sex they are this is what the other what the democrats platform is i'm not making it up and i know at one point biden said give me all your money i'll make america russia that's recorded that is literally recorded and God said all i have to do is let them open their own mouths and they they cause their own downfall and they may have a few handful of people and they may have great wealth supporting them but trump has the people he has the moral majority he has the body of christ and God is on his side and when he won in 2016 God literally put his hand on america and moved it across america and he changed it to red and that meant the it's not that the republican party is necessarily always the greatest thing but it's the party he's running in and i can tell you not just will trump win now but God has said in 2016 there'll be 24 years of me in the white house God in the white house with his plans and his his presence welcomed by our government here in america so to the point that people will come to america to find God instead of the american God is that detailed and he is that focus so he said they're like ants throwing themselves against a great mountain that no matter what they say or do or spew or lie he is shown me them in secret rooms literally you show me them in secret rooms making bargains with wicked people with poople of violence and paying them and God said i will expose every single bit of it well i just can't ask you about that when when trump wins then when trump wins i'm not going to say if he wins when he wins it's a few weeks from now what do you see is he going to go to work what kind of things you see him doing and does the father people really knew him he's already been making his plans he has things written down he's got uh agreements ready for leaders of countries to sign that's gonna make this country even greater he's got all kinds of things he doesn't sit statically around and i don't even know how he finds that time right quickly he got over that virus it was like that i do know millions of people were praying for him not just in america but around the world they know this is what they say i've met many people and even leaders like um educational leaders government leaders from overseas they said that if if trump ever did lose america would become a third-world country and there'd be no hope for the leaders of this world to have someone to be mentored by and so definitely is adamant about it he said no matter what they try to pull you have to remember that God has already spoken about this he did what he said he would do in 2016. he said and i did tell people for several years and he did that great exposure would come at every level in the government in the business arena in the in the medical arena and all those he said i'm going to expose pull back the lid and let you see what's really there and sometimes we look around go it's so horrible it's got to be the end oh no it is not the end we're just beginning to be do some of the greater things for God but God has to when he's going to change the platform to be accessible to the body of christ to his plans his will his way he has to expose the darkness it's always been there it's just that now they have media to let their lives out to and people who have great money can pay people this is the one thing they're forgetting you're going to get this all for free when you pay for criminal activity and those people are weak enough in their in their soul and weak enough to not care about this country to do violence or do wrong things like harvest ballast and then dump them places they'll be the first ones to yell as loud as they can when the dominoes begin to fall and all this exposure happens the ones that were bought paid for will totally begin to to shout and yell who paid them to do it and it'll go all the way up to the wow and so there'll be no hiding they can't hide because they've already exposed who they are by buying these people and these weak people don't care about the plans that they have a democratic party they just care that they have money so when whenever the devil tries to buy people or do things it never works you can't pay evil to do evil it's not exposed the Kat has the lord showing you about um because there's a lot of men people i mean i don't even like to read those because i don't want to take that in but a lot of people are threatening or saying that we're like this close to civil war because if trump wins or doesn't win um is he showing anything about the violence in the land after the only violence we're having right now is paid violence exactly what we're talking about they tried doing that in obama's term all they kept saying was there's going to be civil wars they kept saying we have half a million i can't tell you many times it leaked out and guess where it leaked from this is obama term uh when he was in office and we had i had friends who were actually in that office on purpose for other activities but it came from the top they wanted anarchy in our streets so they could overthrow america call in uh armies from outside america to come and enjoy it it never worked because remember what God said 24 years in the white house it never worked then and it won't work now people who they want to fight each other have families they have destinies they have a future they want that life and hope they are not crazy enough to just start to run out in the streets start hurting people so i promise you the only ones who are going to be fighting are the ones who are paid to do it and they've been dragged people into the fight it won't work wow what what have you learned from the lord about uh abortion and where where that's going or how soon you have is he giving any time frame about when we're going to end this thing i can tell you what it will happen absolutely be on the shadow of that within these years and i would i would think most likely within these next four years was trump it will be ended because he despises that he knows his murder and he was struggling with all that before he even ran until somebody showed him videos he literally saw medical videos of that procedure happening and from that he was absolutely horrified he actually is the most pro-life president we have ever had in america and that is high on his list and every time i hear from him or he does an updated survey it's always on that list how how do you feel about abortion being ended do you stand for life are you pro-life even though he knows what i believe he sends it out on a continual basis to i know many different people but i always get those it's still on his heart it's high on his list he wants to end that and guess what God wants to end it too what people don't realize is every one of us at one time we're in God himself is the word in him we lived we moved that means in and out on the rays of glory we had our very existence and so we didn't live in another body somewhere in heaven your little spirit man lived in him he times your birth on the earth it's not an accident and if he does that it's because he needs that person here and so he does not like it when he sends them and then their lives are ended and they have to go they go back to heaven of course every baby's taken back to heaven their own angel takes them there so God you're messing with his plans you're messing with his little children and he does not like it you know what it says in the word it'd be better if a millstone which is probably the size of i don't know a dump truck if you've been at a millstone tied around your neck and thrown into the depths of the sea uh if you touch one of his little babies so guess what i don't know what's gonna happen all those people who promote it uh i know repentance is always there for those who who haven't done or forced to do it you need to repent for that so that you can go to heaven and you get your little baby back that you ended in yeah i was gonna that actually plays right into what i was going to ask you because i keep seeing even as you're talking there's this for lack of better terminology it seems like we're split down the middle half of the country wants trump and the other half wants to me it seems like evil because they want abortion to be to be contained so it seems evil but God loves that other half he does i guess i want to ask you what do you see happening to that other half who in many ways many of them hate God they don't all hate God but many of them do what is God showing you about awakenings or revivals or things like that to come of course he's if he showed me that much time i i've seen a lot he's going to have a habitation that will so saturate people with his very presence and his plans and then we are there's the baptism in fire there's his spirit being poured out over all the earth there's many things that happen that we talked that talked about in the bible some of them will touch the whole earth but right now God is focusing on america to be an example of heaven culture on earth and that shows you where he's going uh there'll be many people who if they're they're pushing and the reason why a lot of people hate the other side or hate life is they're listening to the fake news and the fake news is focused especially on lying and making unjust accusations and they have caused people to compromise their soul which God will hold them accountable to what you watch what you read and what is what you hear or what you say yourself it goes into your soul it has layers it collects this stuff and if you get too much of it you're going to compromise your soul and then you may be deceived and you can't even see people some people have changed their whole character and everything because they've been feeding on it and i tell people all the time don't watch that it's nothing very surprised and so the thing about half the country is i know there's governors who have compromised their life and compromise their whole state i don't see how they ever expect to be re-elected and some many will lose and i'm saying many will lose their seats whether it's in the house or whether it's uh like governors or people like that they're going to lose their seat because God wants in this time for freedom and liberty to abound for prosperity to abound he needs it so that this the message can be taken around the world that people can build and have places to use that God needs for things and it's just his time for that wow not going well and i know people think it's the most literally there are more that want God in this country than those who don't want him no that's good because a minute ago i said 50 50. you're saying it's not 50 50. it is not it's almost like 20 80. really well yeah we don't have a voice most people unless you have if you're watched on youtube or facebook you have a voice you know if you know in your community but as far as the major networks none of them want God and they're being used by the enemy they don't even realize that well you know when trump won the first time God actually recently talked to me about this when God won when God uh said trump would win and he won and he had me actually prophesy that many people in the democratic party or people who voted you know against what God wanted they would need psychiatric help and it was all over the news um they had to go get psychiatric help because you know why their soul was compromised and they felt defeated they felt like they would have no life that that it was all going to be over because you know trump is such a horrible person and all those are lies because look what he did in our country all the millions of jobs and our life was so much better because he was here and that was God's plan well God said the same people if they've been feeding themselves this next these last four years the same lie the thing we need to pray about as a body is that some of them will not take their life because you've got that many years of of your soul being compromised and twisted and trump wins they'll think they'll believe what the fake news says there's no life for you anymore in my prayer since he told me that just a a couple weeks ago that that would happen because um they've been told everything bad about him and about life uh if he was going to be here another four years and this is the crazy thing even psychiatrists know this it's a term he's in there for a term never in the history of our country have people you know riled up against somebody or hated somebody so much and plotted and planned against him spoke against him every minute of the day i don't think the real news i don't think cnn i'm just gonna say they don't even know what real news is anymore because it's biased a news person and the reason for the network and the news was to make us aware of things and we decide what to do about it but they don't even give you that they tell you what is truth which is lies really lies and so it's hard to get it out if you don't know how to lose it from your soul which i actually have free post election therapy for people i did that when trump won the last time swallows who thought it was all over because they believed the lies helped them to loose from their soul God of course and then buying the things of God i actually had people show up on my meetings and say thank you for putting that free post-election therapy out there because people are going to people are going to need it even ordinary nice people believed a lie and i can tell you the enemy loves deception but no matter what he tries satan will not win that's so good let me tell those two people that are watching that have never heard Kat does have a brilliant teaching in fact i'm going to ask you to give me a one minute version of of uh or one or two whatever uh what how a person is uh it's not only the election they're struggling in their life maybe they're unforgiveness tell people let's let's do that one unforgiveness how do you lose that from your soul so you get some freedom from that well actually it's the keys to the kingdom jesus talked about it he said what you loose on earth will be loose from heaven that means it will be taken out of you and you use your will to do it it's very simple you just have to have an understanding on it and then after you loose the jump whether it's unforgiveness whether it's offense whether it's addiction whether it's hate or anger issues severe grief lack whatever it is in your life that you know the enemy is thrown at you or you've been living in and you don't want it or like the hate thing that's going on you need to lose that from your soul because it says in the bible jesus is the restorer of our soul so when we choose we simply say as an act of my will okay now jesus and tell him you want him as your savior or you're going to have to do it in his name anyway because he's the one who comes and does this i choose as an act of my will to lose from my soul all hate all unforgiveness all offense all fear all addictions all sadness all oppression uh depression all suicidal thoughts all these things are going around everywhere right now any of that stuff that's in you that doesn't belong there you'll think about it you'll choose it again and display it in your emotions if you don't get out of your soul and so who is all that in jesus name this is another important thing the bible says once you've cleaned yourself out don't leave your soul empty you need to say i choose as an after my will to bind to my soul the life of God the presence of God the joy of the lord his expectation his plans his will his way and then you will be totally different and say in jesus name that's good i i do that after i learned that from you i think we first moved over on a cruise because i make sure i went on the cruise with you uh but i do that now all the time you know several times a week i find myself you know i'm i'm inundated there's a there's unforgiveness about something creeping in i will say as an act of my will i lose unforgiveness and then i'll take anything that's related to that i hate um judgment that i've judged someone i lose that whatever it is that i know that i'm not walking in the spirit i lose that for my soul and then i bind to myself it's opposite which is love kindness forgiveness whatever it relates to that and then sometimes i think hey while i'm at it why don't i just do these things that have been kind of i've thought about it very powerful because i walk around you know there's a scripture that says if our hearts don't condemn us that's really if our heart condemns us God is greater than our heart but even if our heart does condemn us you know God's there my point is i when i do that my heart stops condemning me yeah it feels like i i'm not i'm not beating myself up anymore that's right and that's important too because as you think about yourself that's what you're going to believe like the people believe the false stuff because they listen to it they listen to it so much they begin to believe it you need to walk free of all that stuff especially as a member of the body of christ we're witnesses and testimonies of jesus christ and so you shouldn't walk around angry or sad or filled with fear you know especially not unforgiveness or offense because it begins to eat away at you and pretty soon you know people might not want to be around you when it's our job actually to share the good news with people i call that and the holy spirit calls that by the way he calls it a soul checkup and i'm more now when i'm out traveling if people bash me or say hey things to me i will immediately lose the very words they just said my will to lose all the words of hate of anger of you know um unjust things that they have said about me i loose it all any sadness that came with that i loose all of it in jesus name and then i will bind the love of God to me and his validation and his expectation and you know what it's like it never happened yeah and it feels a lot better inside i mean as a person that doesn't get to go to heaven all the time like you do yeah you know i feel like sometimes maybe i i have to work a little harder because you you're with the hard disk you can't be unclean but i feel like i'm in on the trenches sometimes and then but when i do that i feel better i don't sell condemn anymore if you're i don't say oh i wish i hadn't thought that or it's gone you bind to your soul whatever it is forgiveness who had a trauma let's say 30 years ago it was a horrific trauma you saw something where a part of something was very traumatic you can lose that trauma from your soul because your soul stores everything lose the drama you had 23 years ago and you won't have nightmares about it i mean this has been proven over and over again uh even witchcraft if you operated in it or were involved in any way lose that from your soul because that's all about control it's such a beautiful thing that the father actually taught me all of this about the keys to the kingdom he said i need the body of christ to be well and whole and excited and he said i don't want them to take six weeks six months of therapy for them to get better the main thing is you it says to guard your heart in the bible that is your soul you guard what goes in there if you allow things in and it's not God you need to lose the money your soul so make sure you're doing a soul checkup there's stuff on my facebook or on youtube you can see over 400 hours of video that is on there about all different types of subjects about heaven but also about how to live a powerful life free from darkness which is what he needs to rule and reign with him if these are greater works days that we're in yeah then you need to have your soul free all the time and if your family will do that even together or separately it'll be a joy to live in your home that's good hey Kat tell people how they can get your books revealing heaven and some of that stuff tell them how to get your websites and oh yeah we have two websites we have revealingheaven.com which is where our store is and a lot of the things that we offer we also have a commission from God to create things of heaven and put them on the earth for example this cup that says can you imagine going somewhere and having this guy it says i don't do demons now the holy spirit gave me this idea said you're not bashing people or accusing people but you are pointing out that you do not involve yourself with darkness and so we have other things like this for people to demonstrate that they're with the sight of God and on the side of life and light but revealing heaven.com is our one website and also you can find out about our events there and then i have KatKerr.com where there's many hours of videos that help you teach you how to pray for your unsafe family members how to do what i just talked about many other things and some interviews people have done over the over the years that have been very significant and it doesn't cost anything to go on there or listen to any of that stuff so for those of you get these steps get on there because Kat spends hours describing places in heaven this is where you go this is what the trees do this is what they say or do this is you know the plants this is the pets who sit at the table with you right pets do all go to heaven and people tried to argue with me and the father said show them the scripture in genesis where i told um noah to put all the animals on the ark that had a spirit of life in them is a spirit man and if you go back further at the beginning of genesis when he made adam and adam had no life in his body it says God leaned over and breathed the spirit of life this is the father now the word that would be jesus made out of his body but then the father leaned over and breathed the spirit of life the bible says into adam's body and then that's when he came alive that was his spirit man so he told me to look there and then look at where noah so there are animals that have a spirit in them all of your pets do and yes they have a soul or they your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you choose and emotions you display and if they didn't have those in them like a dog couldn't decide if i wanted to eat do i like that person do i want to lay over there and so knowing about and understanding the soul is very key and that's why he takes your pets to heaven when they die your own guardian angel will take your pet's spiritual body to heaven and they'll be waiting for you awesome yeah that reminds me of my a number of years ago we had both of our dogs were you know breathing their last it was a very sad time for us and i had been sick in those days but my wife got stuck with dog duty while i was doing a conference and during that time she she went from because these were the kids dogs but the kids had moved on and she went from being i don't like dog person to loving dogs because she said as i fed them and i was there with them and the last she says i looked into the eyes and i looked right into their soul and God just flipped the script suddenly she was a dog now we're dog lovers you know because she looked in and saw the soul of this dog so God loves animals and you know i've had you told that story about rescuing a bird online recently and right after that like the next day or two a friend of mine said hey we rescued it was an owl and she went on to describe it and i said told her that i had just heard you do the same thing and i said i just thank God we put a smile on God's face when we take care of his creatures like that he does he he of course does not like it when anyone is abused when life is abused it does not because he made this world he chose what to put on this world he loves the earth actually he loves all the different races of the earth he wants very much for them to know him he also cares about the creatures it says he knows when one sparrow falls to the ground and he does care about them and it's important for us especially if we have been entrusted if we have pets and they're trusting us and they do trust and also says the eyes are the window to the soul so um she couldn't have described it a better way you can usually look at the eyes of somebody and stay and see if there's light or life in them or the opposite and so i know God does care but he needs us as a body of christ to begin to um show that we can have a life as a believer we can have happiness we can have joy we can even have fun and that's what we need to portray to the people in this world not that we're sour and angry all the time but we should care but we also can't ever compromise our standing with jesus christ thank you that's awesome i love i love all this teaching i'm glad we i wanted to touch on a couple of these things so we're going to have you back more often now than we've been doing kat now as we wrap this up tell people i assume you're telling people God's chosen trump but we still need to vote is that right absolutely you have to vote i would encourage you if any way possible go to the polls where you have always voted i'm not so uh great on having people get the mailing ballots and if you have to do it only that way you pray over that ballot that the enemy will not take it or hide or destroy it they will go where it's supposed to go so that it can count and yes we all do need to vote but i think people um before when they didn't want to wear things you know as as a leader and you share with people about the darknesses out there and what's in the people's souls they go well yeah maybe but that's been made so apparently clear especially by the democratic governors who think they're dictators they're not letting their states open they're not people even have church not letting them meet anywhere they're not letting them do anything and that's a good example that was in the heart of that governor or mayor when you elected them it didn't just appear okay they already had an agenda and all God did was make that very apparent and so it's so apparent everywhere in the news which mainly has lies i tell people if you have to check the news channel why not every now and then check fox news but you can also go to trump's own website or you know he also does twitter he has a facebook and you get all the information you need that has truth in it and i'm sure another good one to check out is kenneth copeland ministry and when their elections ran last time you could either go to the general news networks and hear all the stuff they kept they kept you know forecasting that trump would lose but they never could show that even on the actual maps but kenneth copeland who has intelligence he had intelligent people in the in the government there then the whole night of the election and he at one in the morning called trump as the winner but even though he had enough votes and enough estates the other channels refused to announce that he won and i remember at 303 a.m fox news finally came out and said trump is the winner he is going to be president of the united states because the other ones refuse to even mention it so if you want to find someone kenneth copeland ministries will be running his fair true election through the whole entire process i really want to uh i know people who know him and actually i've met him several times he's filled with truth and excitement and expectation a great trump supporter also has a lot about the historical stuff that's going on in our government that people have tried to tear about apart our forefathers who actually started this country most every one of them were christians and God said that i was with them from the beginning america is like a gift to this world because of the light that's in there and the gospel of my son has taken two thirds of the gospel around the world from this country wow kat thank you so much i know that this is going to be shared and shared and shared i do encourage all of you to share some of those there will be people that are not believing that trump's going to be uh the next president when either before or even after some of your friends who are open to hearing to say you know prophets were telling us that this was God's choice and you share this with them because there's no animosity in this video we're not speaking against human beings we're not dissing anybody God loves people from both sides of the aisle and he very much wants all to come to him that will and they can so thanks so much after we sign up i'll text you a little bit and thank you some more and let's do this a lot more often okay oh yes i think from now until the election we should do it at least maybe that's not that far away i'd like to do at least a couple of no in november for sure and maybe right at the beginning of december and i will actually be standing in capitol hill october 29th right outside doing God's forecast for the elections like i did last time almost a million people have watched that video where i took people next week trump is winning whether you like it or not God's turning this map red and he will have his way with this country and so i will be there at capitol hill on october that's good i think we shared that last year we'll share it again make sure that everybody on their lives and that's the largest people thanks again kat thanks so much God bless you and your whole staff and uh we'll see you again very soon kat all right everybody thanks a lot remember that your donations do help us your free will offerings to help this ministry keep going there's about 20 of us that keeps all this going so thanks for that and thanks for supporting Kat's ministry as well all right see you all again next time thanks again

are we on well i don't know if we're on but something went a little bit awry but i think we're on it says live so i'm gonna talk hey good morning everybody from oregon it is 11 o'clock straight up our time pacific time wherever you are this is day number two uh in the in and what do we call it the prelude to the election uh we had a different name and it escapes me right now but welcome back be sure and text your friends and family and let them know we're on if you missed the beginning please do feel free to um send it afterwards share it go ahead and share it and and tell people how wonderful it is i hope you enjoy my new tie this is my next patriotic diet you can't see it very well it's got the eagle on it and the red white and blue flag so i wore this for you so without further ado let's bring kat on hey kat how are you i'm always great thank you thank you so a lot of people don't know that she can we can see her but she cannot see us so she can't even see my tie but she's got a bobble head the trump bobble head there does he bubble yeah he's here and he's excited all right well kat let's spend a minute or two what's on your mind yesterday was day one or we could say it's ten now this is not we're doing the countdown now we're at nine what what's on your mind to share before we get into the questions well this is about the re-election of donald trump and this is day two and of course i have my celebration scarf on everybody i hope you're celebrating and my vote shirt please remember to vote but trump is very happy because guess what only got sworn in to the supreme court now we're celebrating for so many people said that wasn't going to happen God was saying it would happen he wants anyone he was for life and for uh you know for justice liberty and freedom that would be amy and so we're celebrating with her and all of her family last night i got to watch it as she was sworn in it was powerful so of course this is another great victory for all of us that was wonderful that means we need the judges who want life so we can just get rid of that whole abortion thing and abolish it that's definitely on God's timeline and so i'm here to report about what heaven is saying what God himself is saying about the elections and so like i said heaven is having a celebration right now because of judgment being put in sworn into office and that's going to change a lot of things is really going to cause a swing uh to go for uh for abolishing many different things or not allowing things i know that she's gonna she promised to do her very best to be fair and just but she is definitely a powerful born again believer so that's a great victory already before we even get to november 3rd and expect more things like that to happen because on God's timeline this is a time for celebration it's not a time for fear it's not time to prepare for the end or for civil war that will never happen and i do want to add something because the holy spirit is telling me to say it that i know some people are having dreams and visions about civil war you know about cities burning number one God is revealing the enemy's plans but that does not mean it will happen and when people get these dreams they don't know how to interpret them or they've not received anything from God about it you just pray about it yourself don't just go posting this is to help people do not just go post on facebook or youtube what you dreamed because if people don't like it you're going to get a million bashes and that's already happened to some people and the thing is this that stuff is never gonna happen this is God's time for celebration justice liberty and freedom and acceleration for the body of christ and for his plans and you can't have the day of his wrath in the day of his power in the same timeline it's not going to happen so this is a day of his son's power where we get to operate in it with him and so i'm looking forward to justice liberty freedom and great victories and so that is really kind of the report from heaven that they're looking forward and i will say this in my own city they have early voting in many different places and my husband actually visited each one of the five places and the lines were around the building wow down the street and those are people voting for trump wow that is amazing now can't let me just ask you straight out because there's going to be a bunch of new viewers today who are not here yesterday so i'm asking you straight out i can see your bobble head trump there who has God told you is his choice for this election donald j trump he's never changed that he's never changed what he said about him since 2015 when he began to speak to me about it and there's so many hundreds of hours of on youtube you can go look they're all out there uh declaring prophetically on behalf of God that he chose trump because he knew that he would do what he needed done he's bulldozing things God doesn't want he's clearing the way really well i'm either thrown out there for pets and i haven't been not talking a lot about pence but you'll hear that change about two years into president trump's term and you'll also see more of him because trump will be helping him to prepare to be president himself for guess what from heaven eight years of pants i tell people if you don't like all this maybe you should move to another country God loves everybody but in God's time he's going to have his way and jesus said pray that my people be willing and the day of my power and that's the days that we're in right now so yes donald trump will absolutely win the election for four more years that's good now people just especially if you're new but even if you were here yesterday we're asking you right in there below facebook or below youtube if you have questions type them out now we'll get to those or we'll go to that group tomorrow we're now working on questions that came in from yesterday so i'm going to ask the first one and then i've got my list here's the way i want to ask Kat when trump does something that we would call root or he's in your face or he names somebody like sleepy joe um is God suddenly shocked or disappointed that he act acts that way absolutely not he knows exactly who he's going to pick and you all know none of us are perfect is that correct but he chooses because you know God's seen the beginning in the end he knows exactly who he needs to do those jobs and my mom always wants me to remind people if you were around during world war ii i don't remember his name now the one guy that was so absolutely so rude but rescued england i'm telling you if she was here she'd be telling me what his name is some people probably already saying what it is churchill maybe churchill or something like that winston churchill let me tell you a lot of people same kind of personality as trump he was a bulldozer he was a bulldog and he was not afraid of anything but he was not quite polite when he spoke to people all used those words he probably was less polite than trump is and uh and yet both of these men knew that they had to give themselves to a purpose greater than their self and winston churchill did exactly what God appointed him to do he saved england in world war ii and God likes bold personalities and i can tell you this passionate people that means they're expressive they're fierce about what they believe in and sometimes you know those people maybe go over a line we don't like but he's not shocking God at all that means it's not necessarily okay but you get it with the package okay and he is accomplishing everything God wants and actually this is hilarious the angels sometimes will repeat the very things that trump say like they call him sleepy joe himself called well we're just going to repeat it since it was said right when when God had me prophesying up in colorado he actually said these words why would you pick a villain for a president when i have already sent you a superhero that would be trump wow so you want to know what heaven thinks they know exactly the heart of every person they know the agenda now God loves everybody right even the villains he loves them he loves us who are doing wrong but but and his son came to make us all free but you have to choose him but God also knows who's going to choose life who's going to represent those unborn babies and one thing that's high in God's list is you choose life you know it says that in the bible this day i offer you life and death choose life well the left is not choosing life i'm not choosing life now you what you can you said yesterday you've been out you stopped counting at a thousand or so you've been up to having thousands of times and here's the question i'm going to mix two questions together do you get to ask any question you want or do you have to just wait for what he desires and the other question that i'm going to put with it is people have said have you asked God um if if we're going to win uh the house and the senate now you said yesterday um we're not you don't know if we're going to win the house i just said i didn't know that and no so so someone wrote to me and said this when would you ask Kat when she goes to heaven if she would ask the lord if we'll win the house and senate how do you respond to it to something like that the first thing i'm going to say to anybody who thinks they can just walk off to jesus christ or the father or holy spirit and think you're going to remember in your head that question all of your questions will be like dust standing in front of them they are holy they are beautiful beyond description the wall and the glory and the splendor would feel you would feel like you were melting into the floor the last thing in your mind would be ask them a question and i feel the same way even though i go often i don't choose he takes me but i feel like i'm eight years old and no little eight-year-old kid's gonna be concerned with any of the matters ourselves would be concerned they're excited to be there they're just in love with the father with jesus with the holy spirit and having you go to get you so undone that you never knew there'd be exciting and adventurous places there i just know he will tell me what he feels is real important to say but he has an agenda for this country to represent heaven on this earth and to be a place where you absolutely can step into the presence of God and i know it's where people talk about the american dream our country's blessed because of God and that's the bottom line we mention him in our songs and even our our official papers his name is written on those and we're for we're for God in this country and that's how we establish it who wins and doesn't i know trump is going to win i know God wants to have an atmosphere that will be a lot more productive than these last four years that trump has had because God has a big list of the things that he will shift and change and abolish regulations things that we never expected would be gone and not in the country you will not see them anymore hear about them your life will become a different type of life over these 24 years God has planned to be in the white house so this is definitely a very key here's my key this is a key time for all people to vote you have to vote you've got to vote in our country God has his plans and he can impress people he can move on people and and that has happened before but i want you to know that all through heaven you will hear angels make comments about the fake news and here i have my book gonna push it for y'all [Music] everyone in heaven probably has that but that one right there because that's how they feel about uh the news service is supposed to be unbiased they're supposed to do only that give us the news turn and they have their own agenda also and i've been saying this from the beginning somebody is going to lose their network because they can't change stop saying what they're saying against the president and against God himself you wait to start it's going to happen someone's losing their network a news network now one of the questions that has come to me several times in on this paper is okay there are some very famous televangelists or just evangelists that televangelists have sort of a negative kind of but very famous very highly regarded and some of those turned into never trumpers or anti-trumpers they almost hate him they almost at least they despise him and they're preaching against them and people are asking me to ask you what is how does God feel about that or how should we feel about otherwise highly respected christian leaders who basically hate trump you know what the bible says about that right pray for those who are in authority and he also says in his word i'm quite acquainted with these words bless and don't curse i mean it's all through the bible especially we have us we have a greater accountability double accountability as leaders in the body of christ because we we're supposed to represent God himself his son holy spirit and even heaven and we're supposed to that's what we have to put before the people they have no right and as not good as the other side is i don't hate any of them i don't hate the people on the left i don't even hate the liberals i don't hate the fake news i know they're going to be great accountability with God himself because they speak against life to speak against you know the sanctity of marriage i go down a long list with that all these things that the bible says have nothing to do with and don't be a part of them don't partake of them and don't participate with them but when you side with a group of people that want to kill unborn babies and the sanctity of marriage out and let children pick what sex they are i can assure you God is not pleased with that especially with his leaders because they're standing before the people to speak on behalf of God and he's saying to me they're not saying what i think or what i believe what i want well the second question this next question is kind of like the first question that i'll i'll throw it in the mix back in my younger days you could be a born again believer i'm not saying you can't now but i'm saying you could easily be in a born-again believer whether you were republican or democrat it had to do with your philosophy of finances and all that there was not the spiritual component and then prayer was taken out of public school and that started a whole thing so the ques several people have asked this question um how do we look at christians or who say they're christians who are absolutely adamant that i'm a democrat and they're going to vote democrat so it's kind of the same kind of question how do how does God look at that how do we look at that when they say they're believers but then then they they identify with a with not pro-life what are your thoughts i will say this one of the reasons why they are feeling that way is because they are watching the fake news and it all comes down to your soul it really does your soul is very powerful it's what you think about and with your will you choose it those people have chosen with their will to go to the left and it's hard for you as a person to try to talk them out of it i would definitely pray God's mercy on them that they change their heart that they change what they have chosen he will hold them accountable and he said that to me in the first election i will hold them all accountable and no one who votes for not lie not to have life with the unborn he keeps bringing it back to me all the time because see these these little babies that we all lived in God he chose your birth on the earth because he needs you here for that so when something stops that from happening that is absolutely against God's plan some of these people he wants to send are highly anointed they have a defined assignment down here on the earth and when man's plans which are the enemies it's definitely hell's plan to get rid of any babies they don't want them born on the earth you might be someone too powerful for hell to handle and in these days there's a lot of very key people being born in the earth and so God is not pleased and his word already says what he thinks about people that would like to take the life of the um unborn that would be better for a millstone to be i'm going back to the word a million stone be tied around your neck that's a millstone that would grind wheat and stuff all about the size probably of i don't know a semi almost half the size of a semi in some places overseas even they grind things with it and he said it would be better your judgment will be better than if that was tied to your neck and thrown into the sea he does not want babies lives to be taken and it is called murder in heaven so you you're choosing a sign God said choose life whether you want trump or not if you don't like his personality uh you should have looked at the evidence of what he had already done in our country and i'm just telling you the left if they get in they want to stop everything that's being done they want to let people from outside this country come in with no boundaries on them which would be terrorists and murderers they want to take a lot of your money so they can make it this is just truth it's the social tree you don't even know what socialism is people if you're if you're young you have no idea what it's like to live in a country that takes everything you have and then they hand feed you but you have no power no authority no property and no way to defend yourself and these this agenda is of hell no matter how you look it's a spiritual battle and God's not going to lose now let me vote other side will be held accountable by God i want to add i want to have just because of time pardon me for rushing only because i want to get a couple more questions but now i'm going to flip this and say okay we now fully understand that God hates abortion he calls it murder we also know and i think i've heard you teach that those who are born go to be with the lord yes so among both democrats and republicans are and or anyone else any are people who have had abortions in the past and and so many of them now regret it deeply and they're sorrowful for it talk to me about God's attitude for the people who have had abortions and are now sorrowfully and they feel they still carry guilt yeah sometimes they have nightmares too because the enemy makes sure they do all babies when they pass from this world they all go to heaven every one of them there's millions of them they know who the parents are they actually forgive them for doing that so your baby has already forgiven you you need to repent for having done that when you get to heaven you will get that exact same baby back they're not going to be angry with you they've already love you they know who the parents are i always tell people if you've repented of it pick a name for your little baby in heaven and God make sure they know that their parents named them and so you will get your baby back i have uh prayed with people many times about that and God showed me five little babies looking over a portal from heaven and this woman came in the bookstore where i was having a book signing and she actually came up to me and said she repented but she had nightmares would i pray with her so i had her loose all that from her soul the nightmares and everything and she began to rejoice and i said God said you need to name your five babies which freaked out because i knew there were five she hadn't told me there were five and when she began to stand in front of me and name them i i know they have a celebration in heaven God sends for the little baby he holds on his lap they may be a little tiny thing down here but their spiritual little body up there understands that laughs that plays he holds himself and said your mother just named you this is now your name and everyone in heaven will call you by that name and they actually have a party for the little baby and so this is real God's mercy is beyond anything of our understanding and so he desires them to be reunited and your babies want to be reunited so even in all our life if we make a mess of it down here God is always willing christ is always willing to forgive those who repent and restore you to to him and christ is the only way back to the father i'll give you that for free now when i read that book um about rev your book is called revealing heavenly God revealing heaven one and two and before we're done i'll have i'll have you tell people how to get that book we were on a cruise and you were talking about people going to heaven now my wife and i had not had abortions but we had a miscarriage and you talked about miscarriage and that they also went to heaven and you talked about naming them we had never considered the idea so we either immediately i can't remember if we waited a few days but we we agreed on a name and we named the baby that was miscarried do you is that the way to do it do people yeah if you're not sure if it was which one male or female you can pick a name that could be either or there's many names that's what we did either or or you pick a little girl's name and a little boy's name and whichever one is whatever it is God will tell them that's its name that's what we we did we i feel it was a girl i think we both think it was a girl but we picked we picked a name that wouldn't work either way and so now we have we raised three children who are now adults that have given us all grandchildren but there's a there's a fourth child that is ours that we have named and when we get to heaven you have a word about how old these children will be you know what it depends on usually the mother if she wants it to remain a baby it will still be a baby and some are still babies i'd say like you know a nine months little baby uh the same age it would have been if it had been born now these babies have been playing all over heaven and with family members in heaven they're not ever left alone but you actually get to see the baby grow very slowly and this is the breath the best thing whatever gift God gave it your your natural gifts i'm talking about whether it's like a dancer a singer you know a designer whatever it is a chef whatever um it could be many different things they still have that gift inside of them and as they grow slowly in heaven they actually will get to use that very gift which is their ultimate destiny to bless everybody in heaven and so they don't they don't they don't miss anything except maybe being with you but so if if this child uh was to be i'm making this up on if this child was to be a concert pianist who also could play other kind of music too and that's what his gift was intended to be you see him or her doing that in heaven as well yes absolutely positively yes he says your gifts are without repentance and he won't take them away because his whole plan the way heaven is designed is that everyone gets to use that natural gift when they get to heaven and that's why there's so many things to do in heaven that's because everybody's mansion and all the property is designed around that gift and for free you can go all over having to enjoy these people's gifts some have like host centers like um let's say if they were going to be a dancer or they were going to teach it they have a performance center as part of their mansion and everybody enjoy it yes or they had rodeos they'd have like a thousand horses and ranches and people could come and go ahead God provides everything so nobody actually misses the thing i hear the most is my child mr destiny no they did not miss their destiny because the one who made them and put that gift in them they still get to use it that's amazing well that's our time and because we're going to do 10 of these in a row we won't go to we're actually overtime but i you know i told you we'll do 20 30 minutes whatever it takes but um those of you who are watching you've got a bunch of new questions pardon for that ding that came through i forgot to put my thing on sonnets but write your questions down and my staff will help me gather them we can't get to them all but we'll try to get to the ones that the most people are asking um so we'll talk each day about the election and then we'll ask some more questions about heaven and that'll be fun so tell people how they can get your book on revealing heaven yeah you can go to revealingheaven.com which is the name of the book and you can see all the stuff the revelations God has given me we have the books we have many other things out there that will share with you about heaven about the spirit realm about the future all kinds of things that God wants you to know because you belong to him and i also want to encourage people remember to vote yes possible vote early and pray over others that you you they haven't decided or pray over that the elections will go without any mishaps and any cheatings to healing or lying about the voting ballots they will be exposed in jesus name and it will be stopped and God will have his way in this election and may his blessings be upon you his love be in you and may the army of heaven go before you thank you so much kat thank you God so much and i'm looking forward to eight more days of this and i'm going to have lots of questions so thank you again and thank you everybody for watching and we'll see you again tomorrow 24 hours from right and celebrate celebrate all right God bless you we'll see you later bye bye

well good morning from the great state of oregon we apologize for what's going on in the northwest uh with uh portland and seattle but uh a lot of believers are here so welcome to elijah streams the way this works is the elijah list sponsors you like the streams it's all that's kind of the same we're sort of the same group so the part that you see on video like today that is elijah list sponsoring elijah's stream so uh be sure and let your people know that we're on we're about to have Kat for day five of the countdown to the election so uh we apologize we started a few minutes late so without further ado let's go ahead and bring kat in here and as a reminder she can see us we can't see her i ca i can see her but she can't see me it's what i'm trying to say hi hi Kat how are you doing hi i'm doing great really excited from getting to go to capitol hill it was amazing tell us about that what happened there i mean we we saw your five-minute video what what were you able to do there if it's not too secret i did get to me no it's fine i got to meet a lot of people that were around in the area and of course it didn't matter where i went i got to talk about trump and when i talk to people about him i act like they already want him so it makes it much easier for me he had a positive report i met people on the plane in the airports it didn't matter where i was i was continually campaigning and talking about trump and God and every person whether they worked in the airport on the airplanes over or flying or just in the area in capitol hill they were all excited about trump which shows you wow the fact that the majority really is for him but it was very powerful we saw another camera crew all set up between we were like so between um the supreme court and capitol hill which there was so much power of God people have been coming there doing meetings prayer meetings um all kinds of things about the campaign on behalf of trump and you could feel the presence of God but not just feel that the angels were all over in the sky they were around every single building there and so it was it was really powerful atmosphere so we did our broadcast and right after that this reporter came up and said can i interview you i just heard you talk about trump winning and he was from iraq is that really a christian group from iraq and he said the people in iraq love trump he represents freedom and justice of course they don't always like their own leadership but they're certainly for him and so we got interviewed talking about God's plans for america and for trump and now that's in iraq so you never know set up as a divine appointment totally hey that reminds me Kat um i forgot the other day you didn't say a word about it but i forgot to ask people to tell people how to get a hold of you and i do want people to support your ministry so i'll do this early in the show so i don't forget at the end how do people contact you and do you take donations or do you mainly just sell your your books how do you how do you work that we have two different sites because uh God had me established as a business on purpose his son came as a carpenter you know paul was in the fabrics and stuff like that God can use business people they can go places maybe not a licensed minister can and i didn't get invited many places so we have revealingheaven.com is where you go to find all the products and the rev on some of the revelation on heaven it's where you go to set up events or see events but if you go to KatKerr.com that has free with no cost hours of revelation on how to live your life how to declare over others how to understand the spirit realm how to rule and and that's the only place online you can actually give to me because you can't give to my business and expect me to receive that i can't do that but you can go to Kat Kerr.com click on the treasury it takes you and tells you all about the guardian zone those are my monthly supporters which i'm so grateful for you can become a guardian they guard the treasure the revelation that God has put in me so this is two different places out there that you can get all kinds especially Kat Kerr.com it's God's platform to say whatever he wants to that's right whenever he wants to so those are the two main places that's good so so back to dc you were in were you praying were you decreeing were you what what were you there for we were there you've already announced that that trump was gonna win so why were you there it had to be done in washington d.c absolutely it is the seat of our government that's a whole different spiritual atmosphere and what has been posted there and people need to understand when you have your feet on the ground you really can take authority and dominion i will remind you all when christ stopped the storm where was he he was in the storm uh that is a significantly um spirit realm truth you need to understand so when you're there if you live in a certain area and something's coming against you you have great authority in the spirit realm to take it down and declare not to tolerate it or to invite heaven places and he actually had me going on purpose and i was between the supreme court and capitol hill where most of the business is done on behalf of our country and release those words into the atmosphere into the buildings into the very ground that was there that God had chosen trump that he would win he would sit in the white house for another four years and those words go out like streaks of light in the spirit realm and they pierce the darkness around there so that was my number one assignment to release those words right there because i represent heaven on earth and i'm actually wearing heaven colors today because i represented heaven the other day on behalf of our country and so that was very significant but because of obedience we were able without any knowledge to be put on iraqi tv to lose people who want to see trump win and they are all actually praying for him it was just it was a it was an amazing event and so i did what God had asked me to do and the ground now has seeds of victory those were seeds of victory words of victory have to be released in the area because there's so much conflict in the area they were literally boarding up some of the buildings getting ready for whatever they thought would happen or might not happen on the election and so we got to declare over all of that which was very powerful in the spirit realm now we have some questions and um if you're ready for those we have had some people say couldn't you do more on the election and we've had other people say couldn't you do more on heaven so it's a little bit hard to to do both of those but we've done some things on the election you've absolutely said that God has chosen trump for another four years he's going to be elected my first question involves that and that and here's what i want to ask even if trump is elected let's say he's even elected with a wide margin for or you tell me my question is are you saying and and i haven't asked this before so so i'm asking it for the first time are you saying there will be no chaos after the election i wouldn't call it chaos chaos is a whole different thing chaos is uh absolute havoc you have no control over chaos so the word probably isn't chaos that you're looking for there definitely will be some disruptions of course there can be unhappy people that are in the flesh uh especially on the left or people who have already they've already been paid they've already made plans to do some destruction and to cause disruptions and anger but it can't stop him from winning i i'm not saying that won't happen because it happened in the last one but i will say this that trump is much more better prepared for it and he can't tell everybody everything so i can let you know this he's much wiser about how these people react because before he thought everybody would be happy and celebrate he thought when the election was over they would drop it but but satan doesn't just drop things he will he will drag things out as long as he can nothing they try or do whether it's in washington d.c we already posted more the army was sent there probably about a million more of the hosts were posted in that whole area if that stuff starts it will not continue very long so i wouldn't call it chaos uncontrolled stuff i would say he's well prepared trump is well prepared now for anything that might rise up like that when that stuff's going on it will not stop people from celebrating from having great victory even if it drags over into the fourth for whatever that happens if the voting thing takes that long to decide nothing they come up with if you want to remember gore bush when they had to do all the recount florida it took like a week and a half before they actually finally had to say that bush won and yet God all along was saying i'll have a burning bush in the white house and they announced the night of the elections that gore had won which was totally wrong and our people call me i said no bush is winning God wants him so regardless of what you see on the tv and i'm sure the fake news will embellish it and make it look greater and worse than it is but trump is well prepared this time to adopt to that stuff that's cool i just have to tell you you must remember that the left lie they lie and they lie big they've gotten really good at it and because they control the media they can show images even from past times and they have done that all violence and all this other stuff breaking out don't participate in it that's the biggest thing you keep celebrating do not participate by having fear or thinking you have to run out there and shoot some people i'm sure that that would love to do that rednecks just hold it back if they come what you have to do but but this is the thing you don't participate with fear and don't participate with violence because the only ones who've been doing violence are the ones who were paid for it they've already received their orders they've already been paid for their jobs they don't realize this time there's someone collecting names so i would say you get on this God keeps saying i'm on a spirit of celebration in your hearts even before november third comes if it goes into the fourth just keep celebrating because we have great victory in this day that's good now you talk about and i'm always aware that there's new people joining every day who they've not heard some of the terminology in heaven there's many beings many types of beings there's angels and everybody thinks all those things flying around are angels but there's also a great heavenly host and the heavenly host was there if that's the same word at the birth of christ and i don't know if those are angels of the host but the heavenly hosts are the armies of heaven that's why jesus is the captain of the host and you are saying that God has told you that we are to send the whole art that is the soldiers the soldiers of heaven uh the armies of heaven to fight our battles is that about right how would you say that that is absolutely right and you're also correct about the terminology in heaven there's very distinct ways they talk about the army the army is called the host and that's what they want to be called the angels now they're all tribes they're tribes of beings that God made they're all divine beings they're not immortal they are eternal i'll explain that another day when we have one of our other broadcasts but there they all belong to God he made them and he made them for purposes they're made in tribes the most of the tribes are under gabriel one-third of the tribes are under gabriel they're the cursed angels messenger angels they look like you and i with wings they look more like humans but the army God designed them and made them fierce many of them look like lions they look like creatures creatures of good work creatures are talked about in the bible like the living creatures they didn't look like you and i they had eyes in their bodies some of them had more than one head you have to think of God as the creator he made the army to look fierce because their whole reason was to fight the satanic armies and he made them before there were satanic armies he's well prepared ahead of time and they are very fierce looking and i've seen many of them and yes actually in this time they are one of our mighty weapons you know what the word says your weapons that's a plural are not natural they are not physical they are spiritual they i will say they not yet they are muddy to the pulling down the strongholds good we declare we command we command we command and then they go hold down the strongholds but if you don't have jesus in you you're not going to get anything okay you must be living according to the word the word the jesus christ christ in you the hope of glory they hearken unto the word of the lord and that's what it says about the army in heaven he was the lord of hosts he was over all the armed armies and as joint ear i know you have this hard to understand but in this time one of our greatest weapons we have will be the army of heaven and i send them by the millions into places where violence is taking place the demonic is over every bit of violence even though people acted out you remove them you remove them send the army to shred platforms they're ruling from put on strongholds they've built the spirit and it renders the satanic army harmless wow now let me ask you this Kat so you're in dc yesterday i know you i know you sent the host i know you sent millions of them God's entrusted millions because he knows you'll send them out they're not unemployed they're employed because you're willing to send them out so give me a quote of how you would word it when you send out a what did you do yesterday how did you send that host yesterday the thing everybody has to remember is none of the angels or the hosts have been given power over the enemy we have the right to rule we are the ones who get to rule uh the only reason these wicked spirits rule is because we let them get away with it we have flesh in our body we were made by God to be over this earth so you have to have flesh on you and you have to understand jesus christ said to us who are redeemed i give you power over all the power of the enemy that's very significant anytime i send them i'm standing in front of capitol hill and i say these words i take power over all the power of the enemy trying to mess with the election harvesting destroying lying about ballots bringing violence into the streets violence against the buildings i take power over all that i command the army of heaven to come and shred the planes of the enemy expose every wicked thing being done behind closed doors or openly that would bring the violence or pay for the violence i want it totally exposed go host make toast to the enemy's plans and i've been saying a number i want one million of you to do that and i see these beams of light shoot out and other people who've been around me see it that's the host of going immediately because see satan's already set up his territory he thinks it's his in washington they begin to pull that stuff down before election day comes wow and it will make it a lot less anything going on they had planned will be minimized that's why it's important to be somewhere to do that that's really really good well let's get into a couple of other questions this is the most common one i've gotten other than what i've already said and that is you you know i said yesterday or the last time we talked uh Kat are you saying you sit down with the creator of the universe and you sit down on and talk with him face to face your stand or whatever face to face and people are saying well wait a minute the bible says you cannot see his face and live so talk to me about that then i have another scripture that you need to start saying after that okay i know who said that john the disciple the beloved the one who was the closest to jesus he was like glued to him most of the time john had encounters no other disciple had because of his um intimacy with him because of the love he had the obedience he had he got more revelation than the others did so john knowing what what it said john himself said no man can see the face of God and live however i have news for you if you've ever read revelation 4 where it talks about where john was in the spirit that's a place in that time today john was in the spirit on the lord's day that meant his focus was in the spirit realm he was listening and he heard a voice remember come on saw a door open remember and guess what he went up because he had focused himself and prepared himself for that when he was caught up he saw the throne that was the father on the throne okay he describes him his eyes the rainbow was coming around him life was flowing in this was God the father saying you can see my face and live when you belong to my son when you receive christ that puts you in another whole category your name is written in the lamb's book of life all your sins are wiped away it gives you entrance to come to the father and then so this is the scripture you use now john himself changed what he would say before and the opening would tell people i saw him so that means you can see him that's true he did describe his eyes his face his his hair was like that was not jesus christ jesus doesn't have the rainbow coming in and out of him he's got he looks like a million diamonds okay he's got power coming from him but the father is the only one who has the living rainbow coming out of him he describes him and that changed john forever knowing wow i've got to start changing what i'm saying so everybody if you're a believer you can see the face of God and live and it's not my choice they catch me up i'm in heaven i've been before the throne many times i've been in other places with the father he shares plans with me it says he delights to share his secrets with his children in the bible so all this is very scriptural yes i've been in the presence of holy spirit i've seen jesus many times even from when i was four years old i would see christ and he would speak to me and so you're part of a family now when you're born again everything changes you're a new creation that new creation he makes us we have the ability to see him don't argue just say God i'm ready when you're ready that's it hey now i i didn't study this but this is from memory but it was i believe it originally was moses where he said you can't see my face and live so i'm gonna you have to watch my behind parts or whatever but didn't he later say but moses i speak with face to face yes he did and i loved it that was the other one that was going to use also yes because miriam remember miriam and aaron were grumbling and complaining about moses who does he think he is why does he think he is the only one who can see God and God came down and called them out of the meeting and corrected them when i meet with moses i don't do it in secret i don't do it in a cloud i meet with him face to face that was the God of heaven and earth there you go that was even before jesus was here because he was counted to be righteous because of moses's faith he was counted righteous of course she eventually received christ everybody does but yes you're correct he did say that and so that's another scripture that says what God desires and what God approves of he's God he's going to make it possible so i can tell you there's other people who signed too you know isaiah ezekiel ezekiel especially he saw the throne with the living creatures he saw it moving he saw the the i can't go into the side of it but he saw that wheel within the wheel come out of the creatures and they moved the throne with the father on it so he saw him so this is that's really he's good he wants you just say yes to him well i get a lot of questions about i've had a lot of questions about um how trump's reelection is going to affect europe but guess which country and people say well what does he say about this country or that country and i know you God may not tell you about any country he may tell you about everyone but the only one or the main one that keeps being mentioned i'm just going to throw it out there i keep getting this question what is God saying about new zealand now you may know nothing about what God's saying about new zealand but i'm going to throw it out to you i will tell you this there are places for whatever reason God has chosen he called me up one time and showed me his space planning and he called it space planning a grid around the earth by the way people it's round not flat i always have to say that he put a grid around the earth and some of these places were highlighted and he said great revival will come here the habitation the glory will come from here i will have these people raise the dead he has made plans already about this earth new zealand was highlighted i can tell you other places california was highlighted people vegas was highlighted to become a region of light uh florida of course one of the reasons why i'm here there are many places in america God will create regions of light and by the way we live the things we choose carrying his glory uh not participating with sin or the enemy of any way new zealand is powerful and you can tell countries that keep getting attacked yeah the reason the enemy attacks them is because he is afraid of what they will become even germany was called to carry the glory that's why satan picked it for hitler that doesn't mean everybody there liked him and so i and i know other countries depict he's picking vietnam for greatness he's picking uh the uk of course of course england and all those other countries in there that did great things for God he has a plan and it's right now he's he's touching the hearts of leaders to shape nations and one of the people who's using to do that is guess who it's trump and i know even the iraqi person we talked to the other day said they want trump to visit their country to help them this isn't a leader this is a people people people people and these countries recognize that he can bring hope for their country and they know he's not tolerating evil so that God did that on purpose to make him stand out so he will help to help because of his authority and his knowledge he will help to shift the leaders of governments and God can then shake that nation i know brazil is definitely one there's quite a few of them actually that maybe some we don't even know about i know panama is going to be used greatly by God oh wow well okay so that's amazing stuff i i i got more than i was expecting very good lots of countries okay so here's a this i thought this was a good question i've thought of this in my own words so i'm going to go ahead and ask it it says Kat says our relatives in heaven wishes happy birthday every year that's awesome but does that mean they in heaven are aware of the passing of time on earth they have no time in heaven it's a whole different way you live your life they realize events take place and God does count time it counts time by events we count it by our clock by our calendars i'm not saying God doesn't use him sometimes but he himself on his own timeline has events that are major events and when events happen things happen in the spirit realm and on the earth they're aware that it is our birthday and they will go to the a portal in heaven where they can sit down and see us they will actually sing happy birthday to you this is the greatest thing they go get a gift in heaven there's so many gifts to give and to keep for people and they put it in your mansion so every year you were apart they will have a gift for you when you arrive in heaven wow i got to ask you this you said this once and i thought really and it was the good really but i thought would God do that okay because things of this earth are dim and less than you said once this was years ago i heard you say God loves you so much he will even take some of your favorite photos that were on your wall and he'll put it in your mansion in heaven is that true that is absolutely true and my gift is actually not the stuff i'm doing this is the commission my gift is a photographer i was sent from heaven as a photographer it is my passion and when he called me to do this i i didn't have time to go take photographs and i'll look at things all the time and i was hoping that i would get a picture of that and so the lord came and said every time you want to take a picture you will just say make sure you get that and i have and then yeah but but he does that for anyone if you have very favorite things like a favorite photograph especially everyone has a gallery in their home and i was taken to someone's gallery that was alive on the earth and they had only had one son who actually went ended up by in being in heaven but i saw in the gallery with his mom and dad other children that would be born so he has some pictures already there of those who will be on the earth with these different families so God is God if you have something special and precious he has some way to make it even more special for you in heaven wow let's finish with this question we're out of time today but let's talk about you mentioned it a minute ago about the portals of heaven is there one main portal are there millions of portals and our rel you said our relatives get to watch us is this because they're the great cloud of witnesses do they only watch events and then they go back to heavenly things um i've thought about our children being born then our grandchildren being born and weddings do they get to see these things they don't miss any significant day in your life on the earth whether it's uh you know when you're married they'll see every they see all the weddings they see all the babies being born they already know who your baby is they know the name of your baby uh God's shown them a lot of your future actually when they go to heaven but they don't miss anything significant even if it's a raise in a job or for something you really have been wanting and you get that thing and you're celebrating they will celebrate from heaven and the scripture he's talking about is hebrews 12 1. because there's such a great cut of witnesses round about us guess what a witness can see in here people argue all the time they're up there they don't know what we're doing that is not true they can see you they can hear you and sometimes they're right near you sometimes they're watching from these beautiful places in heaven uh they're in my books in revealing heaven you can see one of them they're also though and in the throne room there's this massive wall you can walk up to and see things when you go to that and you think of your loved one you can see them on the earth they don't see horrific things happening to you they don't they don't see you being crushed or killed or stuff like that but they do know the day they do know that you'll be coming home they know when they they find that out too and these places called the portal so they're not kept from you or your life they're declaring the will of God over you on your birthday they will go and sing over you they'll sing happy birthday and then you throw these beautiful petals from these vases they look like rose petals and it's peace or joy and they'll throw them down in the spirit and they will fall around you and sometimes you feel somebody really close that's probably where they're at they're watching you declaring but these rose petals when they throw them down over you it brings like the presence of God and either joy or peace to you so heaven is very amazing wow so let me uh well that's a part of me for interrupting um when uh final question i gotta ask this so when they see us or maybe even when they're not seeing us are our loved ones i'm gonna make this a dual question our loved ones praying for us and how do we if so and i don't know the answer because i'm not sure i've heard you talk about this if they're praying to the father in the name of jesus for us how is that different than people saying mother mary will you pray and they're praying to the mother of jesus talk about that well another one they're not praying to mary no one in heaven prays to mary okay it is perfectly okay for anyone in heaven and it's really a conversation they'll actually go have a conversation with the father have a conversation with jesus they live there with them it's not like they have to be on the earth and pray up somewhere they're there with them they will just go and talk to them i i'm really you know um i'm excited about the blessings you're bringing to my loved one i would love them be consumed by your presence i thank you remind me to see the activities of holy spirit around my love on the angels that are around them so they have more assurance that they know what they declare and pray for heaven from heaven is what God would want for them and he's always wanting to bless us so yes people in heaven is certainly okay for them they're praying to the father son and holy spirit who are God right so yes they do that all the time and and God loves it when they come and remind reminding you that my loved one is out there uh preaching the gospel or helping people to loving people would you please bless them and that happens a lot and sometimes you get an unexpected blessing or suddenly it's probably because your family members before the throne of God saying i love them i know you love them but they're doing all this for you it would be amazingly wonderful if you could give them a gift now i just remembered i said one more but i just remembered one that i don't think made it on my list but i read it and they wanted to know they said you know Kat said we do our occupation or not that we do it for money but the things we do relate to what we did on earth but they said well what do people like doctors and lawyers and chiropractors do in heaven since there's no need for those i mean that may be too big of a question but i'll throw it out to you actually there is a big difference people have a job or they have a position they have whatever you want to call it is something you do for your living and sometimes you just want to help people and like a doctor that's not the kind of gift he's talking about no their gift would be a passion he gave them maybe they do art on the side and you don't know that or something that they love to do for fun that's their gift their natural gift he gave them and in heaven you get to use that gift to bless everybody the doctors they don't need doctors they don't need lawyers they don't need policemen um a lot of the military people who go to heaven sometimes they're actually tour guides which they love because they're still giving people directions or helping them or some of the police do that but know there's things you just don't need in heaven your job that you work every day is not what you will be doing in heaven unless you're one of the blessed people if you're meant to be an artist you're an artist that passion you will get to continue in heaven but most people are delighted maybe they were supposed to be a concert pianist and heaven you have a mansion with a concert hall you have grand pianos you can teach it if you never did it here but he put it in you you'll get to use it there i do remember you saying that morticians were doing the opposite in heaven instead of putting people down they were welcoming them is that about right they are welcoming to heaven do you think God does not have a sense of humor yeah the biggest sense of humors i ever saw i knew a family in our city the hardage family who had more funeral homes than anybody and they had such kindness and compassion that was a gift they had kindness and compassion for people and one of them i knew a long time was still living God had me make this word on a scroll it was beautiful because this guy gave himself 100 to love people and i read it to him outside his funeral and said this is God's word to you that your family in heaven on the earth you get them when they're going to heaven but in heaven you get them when they're coming they're leaving earth they're going to heaven from earth you get them there because they actually operate the welcome center so here's these morticians who got you when you were going to heaven you know and you died they helped the family because they were grieving and having you help them because they're in shock they didn't think those things would be in help and they actually it's okay you're really in heaven yes they're having fun in the streets yes they're celebrating in heaven and so it is funny this whole family now operates the welcome center in heaven so they give them they get them when they're going to heaven on earth you get them with them you know when they're coming and going that's what it's about it was that's right when you said that that was that only the wisdom of God could say you know maybe they got a little tired of laying people down and now they get to welcome them as a result of that that's perfect and coming so that's what thank you so much you know we even went a little overtime but i don't care it was fun we're gonna do day six tomorrow yeah six uh day six and a ten day countdown to the election it's actually nine to the election we're going to do the day after but this has been very popular very awesome i'll be in sanford tonight florida at um glory fire church campaigning for trump if anybody's in the area make sure you get to come there's no job good and before we sign off let me remind our viewers that we do depend on your um and these are tax deductible donations that help us keep all of this going there's about 20 of us that make this all work so thank you so much thank you again kat it was amazing this is very deep meat today i appreciate it very much all right well thank you again kat thank you everybody for watching and we'll see you again next time and God bless you bye

hello everybody how are you doing today this is day six in the re-election of trump and here we are studio q1 and of course our good friends elijah by the way steve's taking a break today he probably deserved it so guess what you're stuck with me so here we go we had an amazing meeting last night i was in sanford florida you know trump loves stanford this is a little laid back town here in florida but everyone in the town loves him and there's such energy in the air and last night it was so powerful we all came together declaring over the elections even the polling places i mean the every precinct we sent angels and assigned them there we dealt with violence that might rise up this is your right as a believer you have power over all the power of the enemy now when i say enemy i'm not talking about people i'm talking about the spiritual darkness that is trying right now to control our country and so uh i don't remember what they were called i think they probably will be on my facebook later but you know we've already discussed that right here about how to take authority over the enemy and all the things he's been doing you know especially the ballots we prayed about the ballots the nun would be lost stolen changed burnt hidden you know because when the enemy wants to win he'll do anything he can and when he finds people willing to do it everyone actually who's involved in that helps hell to get their way but they will not get their way and trump agrees with me here he is right here he's very excited about the elections and guess what eric trump is in my own city he's here today actually speaking probably right now at jacksonville beach anybody in this area head over there right now they have a few other people speaking i'm not sure who they are probably someone involved with re-election also but how awesome to have his son eric here right now and if i was anywhere else i would be there cheering him on so yes God does have plans he's not given up on any of his plans he actually shared in early 2016 about america God knew everything would happen don't be consumed with fear and there may be some people acting up you know when trump wins because of course they're they're not very good losers but that's only because God is going to have his way in these times do you know in the book of acts it actually says there are some days and times on this earth there are only in the hand of the father and so guess what this is his time to do one of those seasons when he's making america greater than before a powerful and people in that meeting last night we were all in one accord there's such power i do know right now there are actually events and have been events at the mall in washington that's usually between the capital and the washington monument that whole sea of people they've come together they have saturated that place with prayer with intercession with declarations there'll be so much God in that area on election day people will be consumed by it just coming into that area no matter what their plans are they'll be stepping into a cloud of God i love God's plans because all of this it was not planned from the beginning of this year at all but people are standing up taking their place as the body of christ aligning with God wanting us to choose life and that is going to cause things to happen in this physical realm so if you think no one's praying you better take a second look i know that there have been i know charlie champs there all kinds of people have come and have these mass meetings they've surrounded the capitol the supreme court even down in front of the white house i've met people when i was there in dc they were parts of these meetings and we're hoping i could stay this weekend but i said i can't do that i got to go do what God's asked me to do and i do want to thank absolutely with steve schultz and elijah listen all his behind the scenes people i love you because i have learned this having a studio myself you do nothing without those people because i certainly am not and steve certainly is not going to get back there and work the cameras the sound the computers it takes a lot to to run a place like this and so i'm very grateful to them i'm sure they will get great reward but part of that reward is waiting to see what happens and we get to broadcast all this we get to share what heaven is saying what God himself is saying about the elections each day and he is still saying today please celebrate that is your faith stepping out celebrating the victory of God putting trump in that white house for four more years to see great things happen that is going to affect you me and even those who don't want him will benefit from it and so i love God's plans they're better than ours right i want to thank all the people who've been praying for all of us and cheering us on i've met people who have very excitedly have been watching these every day re-election of trump meetings that were have here with elijah list and they're so excited they get so much information then they get to take it and apply that stuff that revelation that they've learned themselves so we must be doing a good job because people are celebrating they're watching right now people have met in sanford are watching right now i know people are watching from dc people watching from philadelphia from other places in america we actually had people that were so hungry last night to hear about this uh firsthand about the elections and be a part of praying they got on a bus and rode for three days that's crazy not just them but their family and i was so grateful then we had other people from other states fly in here just to be a part of that one meeting because people are hungry they want a life they want a life they have a future we have a destiny that God's got planned for us and he doesn't want us to miss it so i think as crazy as it sounds this one election this one election time has brought the body of christ closer together than any other time probably on planet earth we have one goal we have one goal and this get in office that person that God chose to be our president and and to actually get to be a part of it i'm grateful to all of you out there thank you for your prayers for trump for his administration for his platform i thank all of you for praying for his family because you know when it's you out there it still involves your family when you're the one out there at the head and you're taking charge it still impacts your family so we do pray for melania for his sons his daughters his family trump's family the God would cover them protect them but also put excitement and celebration in them too they know that they know he's God's choice and i love the his family that they come together all the time they play together they pray together he's a great example as a leader of our country so i try not to talk all day today i actually have some other things on my list that's why i am very casual right now i actually get to go out and run some errands and maybe go sit at the beach somewhere and just soak in the sun a little bit but i just had to say thank you today and thank you for all you guardians who helped to protect the treasure that God is releasing into the earth today you intercessors you prayer warriors we couldn't do this without you we we even know there are children now that have their own prayer groups for trump is that amazing even young children know what's going on they're aware that we have somebody who wants God in our country they want safety protection and even better jobs you know we already know what the other side wants they want to tear it all apart and i pray for them make sure you pray for them to know the truth and to be free because they're being controlled by the enemy and the enemy doesn't want us to have anything he doesn't want us to have a life not a country he'd like to make this a third world country where everything is controlled but they don't know what they're doing i will repeat what God said to me in heaven don't let them take your guns they would never get close enough there are so many rednecks in america they take them down before they get close to where they live and so God even needs rednecks hello are you rednecks out there i know what you're like some of my family are some and so i know it's not always easy to live with them but one comes to push to shove man they'll be the first ones out in front to defend and i also want to thank you thank all of our military who protect our country who protect inside of our country it is a massive organization but finally they're getting recognition and all the vets i have a long line of military people in my own family and i know what it means when they have to you know they retire they don't maybe have a lot it's so good to see people care about them but especially our president i never forget the day when he was campaigning in 2016 and he was bored with the campaign process he wasn't going to show up that night for the the squats and the fights going on he said i'm taking this time i'm gonna go raise money for the veterans and that little bit of time that whole thing went on he raised thousands and thousands probably hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions to help the vets even before he was elected that shows you where his heart is he's an all-american boy who was all for america and so i want to assure you heaven is very much involved in this country right now they're up there cheering us on your family members your friends who are living in heaven are watching from portals all over heaven i'm sure they are probably holding american flags and as crazy as that may sound they have a real life up there too and they're excited that God's involved in this country that has always stood for justice liberty and freedom and now God is adding righteousness so people say to you what does america seem for justice liberty freedom and righteousness that is right standing with God so whether you're on the streets knocking on doors right now even as i speak i know this is their last big push trump has people in the streets right now everywhere driving to different cities speaking in little places holding meetings in churches or going door to door knocking on doors encouraging people to vote handing out flyers handing out yard signs by the thousands i even got to pay for some of those myself so somewhere there's 100 yards out there that have the yard signs that i was able to pay for and i was great it was great to have a part in that so if you get a chance to give a donation somewhere to help all this and people go well he's got all his own money he's been using his money he doesn't even take a paycheck okay he donates it and so what a great person to lead our country forward in this time with God and with all the body of christ beside him cheering him on praying for him his closest friends are believers and some of his really close friends are prophets who actually hear God i love it that he does not stand in the counsel of the ungodly no he chooses to stand in the counsel of the godly of the godly and get wise direction from God one day i pray i will be one of those who will get to stand by his side and share things from God to him that is one of my focuses is one of the things God said he would do so i look forward to that i'm sure you'll find out when i do so anything else out there anybody's thinking about please send your questions in to elijah list we'll be back tomorrow and we will be here every day we still have day 7 8 9 10. we're even going to november 4th don't not don't stop watching after the third things will be happening and even i may be delighted by them but we will win because trump will win and heaven is still shouting that the angels are talking about it all over the place and even in the meetings may you may not know this angels go to the meetings with you and they already have angels that are there part of their ministry so all these angels get to meet sometimes for the first time they actually fellowship do you know what an angel does when they want to make a friend of another angel they exchange feathers how about that i learned that when i was in heaven how wonderful to know that they have friends too and they have uh a whole groups of them that get together even in heaven there's places for angels just to have fun and they get a lot of r r because guess what they have to live with us and they have to put up with us they deserve it too so i guess steve definitely deserves a break pray for him bless him please give to the elijah list they are the leading according to heaven the leading number one organization that puts out the true word of God and only allows true prophets of God to come on the air with them and to post and you can sign up also to be uh to get um emails from a lodge list i get them also before i ever started doing this i got emails from elijah list and they were powerfully amazing exciting so God's got his word still in this world he just picked steve schultz to be one of the leaders and the watchers of those people it's not an easy job and sometimes he has to say no not because it doesn't care about the people but you better have a word from God that brings a life hope a future and a destiny and if there's any darkness involved it will always have to say how to take authority over it this is our day to rule and reign with jesus christ right here with us he's in us christ in you is the hope of glory don't ever forget that you are not alone we pray here uh even here for people all over the world especially for people in our country especially for leaders in the body of christ if you think you're alone you're not alone if you're out there serving faithfully and you have done so faithfully this is your season to get great blessings and father i speak blessings over every leader every lay minister everyone in the trenches God who've been faithful who haven't stepped back but continue to run their race and crush the plans of the enemy that would be satan put him under your foot he is the doormat but we however are seated in heavenly places your day to be blessed your day to get revelation from God you just have to ask for it may your day be great may trump's victory be a great celebration even now in your heart you just choose to put on celebration i ask for and receive celebration God i ask for and receive your life your presence your plans your way and joy in my home right now in jesus name say i receive it and i will see you later trump is winning bye you

well good morning everybody from the great state of oregon it's about 11 a.m pacific time and we're glad to have you be sure and alert your friends some of you may not have gotten a notice uh in time to to be ready for this but you know you can replay this if you didn't get that notice but uh sorry i missed you some of you yesterday i needed the day off and then i'm back with bells on or whatever whatever that means but uh if you're ready i'm ready let's go ahead and bring Kat in here and see if she pops in here like she is hello hello your your camera's got a little soft focus on it but that's probably okay right there how are you doing kat i'm always great well i appreciate you feeling it for me to uh yesterday very much so let's just jump in what's on your mind what do you want to tell people well i know that hopefully none of you are listening to the fake news that's my biggest encouragement for you don't listen to it if you want to watch your local news maybe that make sure you're uh catching uh trump's tweets and his website and uh places you know that you can trust people to say the right things about what's actually going on because they're so afraid uh i'm telling you the left the liberals the democrats are so afraid of this election it's going to squash them for generations to come see so you're hearing from God's point of view this is heaven's point of view not men's point of view it will be so crushed and pushed back the darkness trying to overtake our country God's gonna expose a lot of it i'm really serious about the exposure and so is God and it will carry you on past november the 3rd so just be prepared that you know that that there probably may be some altercations some other stuff uncovered but trump is absolutely winning that's from the throne of God i also want to encourage you by letting you know what is actually going on in other states because you know the the fake news will not tell you what's going on they want everyone to think that biden has all the numbers well that's absolutely not true and now we have actually on purpose spoken to people from other states to see what was going on with them and even though there may be some liberal activity there i can tell you the majority of people in states of the people are excited about trump and they come for miles wow you have rallies for him even if he's not there here's a good example right here no just to show you both sides yeah we spoke to somebody who lived in new york city and actually moved because they couldn't stand it anymore because it was so liberal you know uh their mayor and they're not doing a whole lot from new york city itself and there's no movement no life you're not allowed to do anything even now still there for a second wave of the virus there is no second wave of the virus and so we talked to people who felt that way it was so awful in the city but they said outside the city it was great and here's a good example there are people who came to support trump just by having a drive rally wow and that rally went for 85 miles either of these are people in cars so how many people is that they were went from seaford new york all the way to monatoc this 85 miles of a drive through rally for trump all these people in new york so you can't hear what the fake news says you know new york's gonna go uh blue they're gonna go to the democrats that is not probably true at all wow this is one example of what's been happening even if it's a democratic state or not there are people by the thousands gathering together in places praying declaring some of them are just outright celebrating because they know that they know that trump is the person that God wants in this country and what God wants he's going to get this time so this is a real uh eyewitness account of this happening in many different places people are coming to vote early let me tell you in florida at some of the early voting places they processed 80 000 votes for trump a day wow 85 000 that's one little county in central florida and people are going went to the early polls and they're just going wild to make sure their vote gets in there for trump i'm telling you the wave the way for trump is coming on november 3rd and my mama made me wait i was determined to vote early my husband's already voted but my mom said i am showing up she's almost 90 with my red white and blue and i'm casting my vote for the greatest president we ever had and she goes and you're doing the same thing on november 3rd hopefully won't be outside too long but she doesn't care and so there's many seniors who feel the same way the seniors we even know groups of the youth by the thousands who are gathering together to cheer on trump they send him many videos they send him cards they send him all kinds of emails and stuff like that whole groups of people are sending so many thousands of emails trump reporters can't get through them so i'm encouraging from God's point of view and from the people's point of view trump is our man that's good now you actually i've answered a couple of questions i was going to ask you but let me expand on on the first question i was going to ask was you've been saying for several days that God wants us to be celebratory now about the trump win and then i've got lots of people in tents and saying how could you know why if you if you could just this could just be your opinion why do you think God wants us to celebrate now is that just for our faith is this does this free his hand what time but why celebrate now why not celebrate now we know that God is in this he's been in it from the very beginning when God has a plan he has started into that plan he's already laid his hand on this country he's made his choice the body of christ is standing up but not just the body the moral majority of the people moral majority means you want a life you have a home you have a family you want a future they are adamant i believe it's 80 20 no matter what anyone says no matter how it comes out in the end the majority of the people in america want our life they know what trump has done they know what he's going to be doing in the future and then after that of course you know eight years of pence just take it people because it's going to happen God is really adamant about taking the white house actually you don't have to take it trump has invited him to be there so why not celebrate we have a room to celebrate our entire country is being shifted by God look at this when you make a shift let's just say here's the here's here's the ground when there is a shift two things happen you expose what's been underneath and when it's it goes to a higher level so this is where God is taking us and when that happens you will see everything the devil has had all along it will be exposed and that is what God is actually doing that's why he wants us to celebrate he wants us to believe what he's saying and those pastors bless their heart who think it's going to be better for the other side we're all praying for them to be saved but anyway because God is going to reveal himself in this country without any obstacles and the body will operate in levels without hindrance from the government like we've never had before so this is the reason to celebrate and i will celebrate every single day and every day that trump is in office for this next four years dorine and i you know we were going to fast the last three days before the election a few days ago she said you know what i think we're supposed to celebrate and not fast and i said i think you are too because that's what Kats say so we decided instead to get ourselves a few treats that we would normally have a party people yeah these people in that long 85 mile line were celebrating they were shouting they had all kinds of things to make noise they had trump flags all over the place that was a mobile celebration and i've seen people doing it around our own city here blowing horns having their big trumpet line on there we're definitely a trump city here but i'm telling you trump God has put in the heart of so many people and they have seen the goodness come from him that he cares he really cares he cares about life he cares about God it's about us what else is important because the side of the darkness is not going to be good for you and not just you the devil wants this country permanently and God is saying no he's not getting it and he's saying that from his throne and they are having a party in heaven already have some treats blow the candles off celebrate with jesus that's good it's gonna win and i really am telling you we do celebrate here every day that's awesome now probably the single most common question i'm getting and i want to almost exhort the viewers that we we never want to treat a prophet like a psychic and say this is what i want to know from you and if they can give it to you there so some will ask have asked it that way and i and and you don't go to a prophet and demand to know something you ask a prophet has the lord shown you anything about that or or if you know so the question in many forms is and you mentioned it a few minutes ago was this going to be over on november 3 or was this going to go to the courts has the lord showing you anything on that he has not said to me that it would go to the courts i'm pretty certain that something is going to happen on november 4th or he would not have had me uh this is all about the re-election of donald trump that's what these uh this this is what all these broadcasts are about and God said don't stop with the third go to the fourth go to november fourth and then well we had already discussed you and i had discussed maybe once a week up until he takes office and gets sworn in we will have an update for everybody once a week one day we'll pick one day and do it to steve and i will i can tell you the excitement will begin to rise in the people it's not going to be something that's bad or dark it'll be the good the good stuff that's going to start happening and the exposures i don't think it'll ever have to go to court i think at all that God's talking about is so deep it will be so evident there won't be any you won't need to have a courtroom uh so this just stay excited it will not be weeks and weeks and months weeks and weeks and months and months of drawing out junk that is not going to happen and so this is time to to have no fear at all in your life no fear just a great future for you and the generations to come so why not let people know take pictures of you celebrating that's good to us send them to trump let them know we're celebrating i got some very powerful um texts just recently from trump's headquarters about how excited they are about what they know they know things behind the scenes they can't even say to you yet but i do know that they are actually focusing themselves for him to be in that white house for another four years wow that's good news now you addressed this other one yeah and again when you opened today about the coronavirus that is probably the other single most common question lately all week is what is Kat saying about when the coronavirus will end or what has God told you about the coronavirus if anything he told me from the very getting all this stuff happened he said they're they're blowing in out of proportion he told me people were lying to our president like the world health organization and he said that this is what God said they're not going to last long because they're they're starting to demand ridiculous things from people they thought they had the right to take over just because the president was receiving information from them go go back and see when he fired them he fired them they were saying crazy things like if you don't wear a mask in your home we can come take your children away and when he hurts and stuff like that he goes this that's it i'm not that dumb he said they're going they're out the door and he he fired him because he knew that they were blowing it up out of proportion the demands that were being made on the on trying to be made on the american people and i know that trump would have already said if he if you could he would have said this whole thing is over let's just leave it and go on with our life i can tell you if you feel like we're in a mess where one i'm done with them God says they need to be burned now i'm telling you he said that from heaven he said because they want to keep us separated and isolated i'm not talking about the president i'm not about the people who are in the backgrounds as long as they can keep you separated they're hoping to do it through the elections so we can't discuss things we can't come together oh they were upset when we started coming together at church again they didn't like it that kind of ruined their plan i'm talking about the democrats and the liberals that ruined their plan it didn't work so they're trying to keep us muffled our kids muffled as long as they can and i know our own mayor was ready to say we're just done with it and i don't know i guess he had some more discussions with other doctors in the city i don't know who they were but they said we'll probably go 30 more days something like that or a couple more weeks but i can tell you this right now there is no fear there should be no fear in you about that virus uh and the meetings we hadn't seen for we actually kicked it out of our city we're not tolerating it did you know that you're actually over sickness to your sickness yeah he's christ said i give you power over all the part of the enemy all sickness and disease it comes from the devil and he wants us to be in fear to stay away from everybody to stay out of being involved in things and everything i've done recently has been unmasked we didn't wear masks we were doing a silent protest like trump said nobody got anything nobody got sick from anything if you feel like you might be compromised wear your mask but i think anyone else who feels they want to be free from it your immune system is actually better and the health organization knows this you're better when you're together your immune gets built up and so i don't believe most of the stuff that's being said about that God said it's passing that's good that's really good well are you ready for a couple of other questions like about heaven sure i sure am let me give you a couple one of them uh is is a woman really want to know and i won't read it because it's longer but basically she wants to know where do we have in the bible that that that our pets go to heaven now we know you've seen them in heaven but she said is there a scripture with that for that um there's a scripture that God gave me himself how about that one would that do yeah that'll work that'll work he did catch me up one time when he wants to say something really significant to me and he made it quite a plain that he did take pets to heaven and there are other animals he takes to heaven in heaven people go it doesn't say animals in the bible they're called creatures i don't know if you knew that it says gospel to every creature i always preach the gospel to all of my pets but this is what he said to me he said go back and read in genesis go read in genesis where i made adam now this is how far back he's said to go go back to where i made adam with my son who was called the word at that time he said when we made adam i spoke the word adam and who was the word was jesus christ stepped out and made him and he was perfect but you know the bible says there was no life in that body it just laid there until the father leans over and breathed adam's spiritual being the spirit of life is your spiritual being he breathed that into adam's nostrils and God said he has now become a living soul that means he was alive so until the spirit man is attached like at the time of conception there really is no life but this at this point when he made adam he was the first you know he said that right so he brings from himself the father carried all of us all the little spirits of life they come under the father himself once that is attached there is life so anything with the spirit of life in it that's a spiritual body if it belongs to jesus christ if it's if it's a human it goes to heaven but if it's an animal or a creature they go to heaven also why wouldn't he they belong to him he made them and then he said i'm going to tell you the scripture to go go show everybody why this this term spirit of life is so important and that means your spiritual body he told noah in the book of genesis go back where it talks about noah he told noah put every animal on the ark that had a spirit of life in it now those are the very words he uses so what he's doing at what he's telling noah is put every don't grin at me jen he told noah to put every animal who had a spiritual body in him on the ark and and what he was saying was he was preserving them that each of these species you know two of every kind had a spirit of life have a spiritual body in them and that clearly shows you your pets have a spiritual body they not only have that they have a soul your soul is your mind your will what you choose and your emotions what you display well if your pet didn't have a soul it couldn't choose what food it liked whether it liked people or not where it liked to live it didn't want to play and all this bothered me he said so they have a soul when your your pet that you love when it passes your own guardian angel this all came from the father your own guardian angel takes your pet spiritual body to heaven and i see almost all the pets i've ever had up there and this is opening on you they're all waiting on you they know who you are they'll look just like they did except a little bit younger probably a little bit better so because they have that spirit of life that the spiritual body and it's all on them like like noah put those on the ark your pets are taken to heaven that's that's good good good good news because we've had a lot of pets okay this one um this is asked by a couple of people over the last few days and that is since God sends us down we are in him and he he sends us to this earth to be born how this and i've never heard anyone ask this question or attempt to answer it so here's the first uh why did why or why does he put some in really wonderful families and others he puts in what she says an abusive family or poor and abusive how would you what would you say to someone like that i will say just exactly what he said to me he has to defend them there are specific times he needs them them the people the ones he sends he needs them in the earth because there's something he's given them a commission to do in the earth okay how they are treated man was given the choice we are all given a choice are we not and some people can choose to do what is right even if they're not a believer they can still choose the right thing to do for their children there is a devil and the devil will go as many places as he can to pervert the parents to file the parents because he wants that passed down and the so many accounts i have heard from people who grew up in a a terrible uh atmosphere with a tear with not good parents but God got them he got them to know him he got them to serve him and today they are powerfully walking out their destiny so it's really so important for us to encourage everybody especially children because their shaping of that soul and that child is very important to God so he sent me to this earth he timed my birth on the earth he sent me and sometimes he's building a generational line for his purposes and some people in that generational line some throughout that line let's say a 200 year span some had good parents some didn't have good parents but the ones he wanted he will pass the seed of that destiny of that that family line would be passed down down down until he is ready to reveal it and have that person stand out and do things for him that actually will affect the whole entire family line and in my own lineage i had great people that loved God i had people who didn't love God and didn't want him until two weeks before they died but he got him anyway now but what was produced in the in the youth throughout these times i'm seventh generation believer and look where i am yeah i've had to choose myself to follow God and say yes to God even when things weren't the best now my family my dad my mom they loved me um our living situation was always the best but we always had jesus in it we chose jesus and even in your family line if your family didn't you can choose him you can choose him powerfully and let your children know so what God has planned for that family line won't be lost you see i have i can relate to what you're saying about even allow allowing a child to be born in a place of abuse i was one of those children i was one of six and i was my father's least favorite child uh he literally hated me as a kid and my mother as i stood over her cast his casket 30 years ago because he died at only 59. and i said why did he hate me so much as a kid and i'm weeping he says yes but when you became an adult you became his favorite which is true but the damage he had done was still real and i had to get help to get through all of that i believe he's with the lord now he got his heart right but he was highly abusive in every way including sexually to me and my sisters the whole thing and yeah that wasn't God's voice for you that was that that was your own father's decision to choose that God didn't choose for you to suffer all that but because mankind is allowed to have their own will he's not made us into robots okay we are not robots we all have a will to choose we choose the darkness and we choose the light and uh and i always pray especially for families and for children in them that their parents will know the right way and the way to raise them and to train them and i think we're coming into a whole new time on the earth where the families are now going to be in the highlight not shoved in the background and i think children will have a greater chance now even though the darkness is still there the knowledge of God himself and jesus in this generation will shift and change the way a lot of them have been living i just thank God every time i hear a testimony like your steve you chose God and you chose what was right and look what you were doing right now the enemy didn't win remember what he tried to kill you several times and now to wipe you out and take you off the earth he knew you had a divine call on your life and you still chose it and now according to God in heaven you are the number one place in this world to hear the true prophetic word of God so that was God's call on your life so even though you press in and get through stop and lose it from your soul people please if you've ever been abused say i choose my life to lose all the abuse and all the trauma even all the way through my childhood i won't keep it anymore my soul i choose to bind the life and love of God and he'll actually take all that stuff away from you and you can start like with a free soul open to God and that's when he released that revelation in this time about the keys of the kingdom which you bind to yourself that's God you cannot be taken away which you lose from your soul that the enemy put in there it can't stay and so i know that God still has that plan for your for your lives everybody out there don't give up on him that's good that's good and forgiveness enough if i could say anything the one thing that that you know i took so seriously is when i understood that God's requirement not just a request but he requires us to forgive and when i got a hold of that and i've lived a life of that i could feel myself being promoted through the years through the forgiveness and then healing can come and uh there's a some of my family versus still suffering one is a wicked witch a practicing wiccan witch but she she was horribly abused by my father pardon me everybody while i'm really vulnerable here but she still needs to get saved and and so far with you we declare she will be free in jesus name that she will be overwhelmed by the holy spirit that will prove her towards christ hold the enemy on her and break that off for her in jesus name we expect a good report about her life because she comes from that same lineage and she has gifts too that God wants yes she knows in jesus name good good thank you Kat awesome well let's do this last one on time uh uh well second to the last one because you just just give me a minute on this because as she says uh this person says has the lord spoken to ken about the rapture now i know what you say about the rapture so go ahead and say it about your rapture road well the rapture is not for now and there's some things that actually prove that it is not for now right when the rapture happens the word rapture number one does not mean rescue it means a celebration it means to be in rapture to to have an extreme celebration when christ does come back it's for a church that's not sinning and full of their self well hello yeah let's run look at the church today he's not coming there's no bride yet there's some but there's not a bride full out ready that has no spots those are sins and has no wrinkles that's the flesh that's your attitude your opinions and your rights not God's and it also says this the world will know us the body of christ by our love for each other and there may be a few places but the majority of the body are fighting each other so he's not coming anytime soon he has generations still planned on the earth the antichrist is not on the earth and i don't believe the antichrist will ever be able to appear with the body of christ getting stronger and greater the glory getting greater and greater the people only will choose satan because there's not people on the earth that are filled with God and there's no one else to rescue them from the tragedies and the perilous times it's the only reason they'll pick him and they won't need that because of God getting greater in us and us beginning to manifest and demonstrate for God there's miraculous days and times that haven't even happened yet God's not going to forget about them he's not going to forget them so don't look in this stuff this stuff is not the perilous times trust me it isn't you're still breathing clean air there's still a blue sky up top out there true home is available to live in so this is not the perilous times God wants us to be great for him roll up your rapture rogue the holy spirit says stick it in your closet you you need to get your crown on and rule and reign with jesus christ in these days that's good so i'm going to ask this last question for everyone else be sure you type your questions out below this program whether it's on youtube or the other and tomorrow we'll try to get to to more of them this this is something i've wondered about i kind of feel like i have an answer uh because God can be all places at once but she says Kat i've always wondered how jesus can have quote time for lack of another word to see everyone who loves him in heaven i know there's no time in heaven but but with millions of people who want to see him and you mentioned today just go talk to him how does that work it works because he can be everywhere all at the same time if he wants to he can actually himself because in your in your mind you say i have one body it's me this is this is here this is all i got he only has one of himself but he actually can be many different of him many places at the same time even when he's on the earth he can do that he is God there's layers of himself and it's they're all a whole of him just like the holy spirit can be everywhere all at the same time most people don't ask that question but they can be because there's layers of themselves and they can send one to everybody in heaven to be alone in special time is still him it's not not duplicates it's not little robots it's not that it's him and so he can he can be with us here on the earth he can be with people in heaven because he is God and let me tell you there's nothing like being with him face to face and everyone in heaven does love him and you can tell where he is if he is going somewhere around heaven because people will chase him even the creatures will chase him they want to be with him so don't be concerned about that that's good that's really good when i he when i dealt with this when i dealt with his everywhere at once he's omni omnipotent omnipresent omniscient all those three omnis it's a lot easier to to converse with him in in heaven as i land my bed i know i have his for lack of a better term undivided attention i can talk with him as long as i want and he'll talk back with me as long as we want and it's undivided attention meanwhile my wife on the other bed could do the same thing yes right because you have to do that absolutely true that's absolutely true however okay the more time you give him of yourself here on the earth the the clearer you will hear him speak to you and according to them especially holy spirit he says holy spirit says i'm speaking all the time so make sure that you are focused and you're listening and he said i've always spoken but not everybody hears me so we get caught up in the day-to-day life or we get caught up in traumas or fear fear offense and unforgiveness will block you literally like there's a block over you that keeps you from hearing clearly from heaven or from jesus or the father or holy spirit so make sure you have none of those in your life you don't want to keep those in your life and right now fear is everywhere deception is a no another whole thing that people choose to be deceived some of them and they don't want to hear him that gives the enemy more opportunity just like the opposite to speak and they'll hear what he's saying so make sure that you have your radar out for jesus christ and let him know i give you permission to get my attention if i am not paying attention and let me tell you he can do that if you give him permission that's really good well kat thank you for another amazing show we call it a show it's a conversation really and we for those that are joining us in this this was day seven out of ten so tomorrow is day eight uh election day is actually day nine and day ten is the day afterwards yeah i'm trying to wear a different tie every day if i can pull it off you can't see it

then share this video and we'll see you all again uh 24 hours from now we'll see you tomorrow let the show begin you

hey good morning everyone from the beautiful state of oregon it is monday november 2 and tomorrow's the election day and we're here to talk about that a great deal today even more than the other days because this is the last day before the elections i hope you all have been enjoying Kat care be sure to quickly share this with your friends or tell people or text them that Kats that we're going to be Kat on live and we're going to talk about the election a lot today so hey with that in mind let's bring kat on here she's about to pop in here in a second and here she comes hi Kat hi we can see cannot see us he's in florida and we're in i think you're still in florida aren't you Kat yes i am yeah there you go well i'm hoping you're saying i'm getting some breakout but hopefully it's good hopefully it'll the sound will be good so hey so Kat let me do this before i ask the first question i want to do a shout out a lot of people probably most people do not know that johnny enlo had a word for me and he did not say i had to do it but he told me basically it was a word for the lord to have Kat for 10 days in a row up to the elections and he had never given me such a word and that was like whatever has been 12 13 days ago we got that word and i said all right let me go to work on that and and within a few minutes we had that dance i want to give a shout out to johnny didn't and then he was telling me off camera that the lord told you ahead of time what did he tell you yeah he did actually it all started with him continually telling me every day whenever i spoke anywhere for the people to begin to celebrate don't wait till november the 3rd he wants celebration in your heart he literally had me say that many times over this is a time for the body of christ and really america to celebrate what God is bringing this is just the beginning of what he's going to do in our country he's cleaning the platform clean exposing all the darkness and setting in place exactly who he needs to be there of course number one would be trump and so he kept telling me tell the people to celebrate get rid of any fear out of them and i mean every place i spoke we did that and it was very powerful and i think it's very significant that johnny emma actually said why God wanted me to do this he said he wanted celebration in the hearts of the people before the election came oh wow i did i forgot that part he did say that i remember reading it and so God told me he said i'm actually going to put you out there in front of the people days before the election so you can keep encouraging them empowering them and letting them know what i am saying about these elections all the way up not just to the third God actually asked for november the fourth and said to please do it that way so we actually will be doing that way but johnny and lo clearly heard God when he had him contact steve and say i believe that that would be a good thing to put Kat out there to let her share with the people to get them excited and let celebration be in their hearts on wow he's already said two things God said to me so clearly this was all God's plan and i was very happy i didn't know who it would be but it was really happening if i knew that it was you stephen elijah this boy you're going to be super blessed for not just hearing what God's word was but you saying yes to it wow that's good well thank you for that well let me let me ask this next question um you know in past elections it's been very common for pastors to get up in front of their congregation they'll say something like be sure to vote it's very important to vote go vote vote your conscience vote for who you feel like God has told you and then we release this is not that is it this is not no okay and it's not what this is at all this is what you choose what God would want you choose what you know according to the word unto the heart of God what would he choose for this country well the number one thing would be life that means that you should be anti-abortion and trump is the most pro-life president we have ever had literally in the history of this country and people may not know this in the beginning when he first started iran he wasn't sure but literally somebody took him aside and they showed him an abortion a video of one i don't know if anybody knows that it was a group of pastors and people who showed him and from the moment he saw they said this is murder i'm not putting up with this i am clearly against this this is wrong because he's definitely he wants the best for people but once he saw that that was it there was no question he never talked about anything else except wanting to end abortions he wants to end them he wants that wiped out and he is definitely a pro-life president so you're going to hear some inside things maybe today that you didn't know about him but he clearly stands for life and just so you know this i want to say this that biden is actually running commercials right now that says that trump is against a baby that he wants to continue abortion and that biden himself wants to end them that is the biggest lie i think that they've been promoted because you know maybe you don't know this either they've had hundreds of millions of dollars given to their side because of these very little wicked people who want to have control of this country and therefore he's able to run all these crazy ads that most of them are lies trump's not wasting his time coming against him because he is too busy making america great clearly sharing his program this is it he has his program outlined dotted underlined everybody knows what trump has planned almost nobody knows what biden has planned they're too busy spending their money and their time bashing trump and let me tell you they're hiding things when they do that they don't want to tell the truth some of them just slip it out like i remember in the beginning when biden was speaking at a at a place and he said give me all your money i'll make america russia and i am not making that up that's a communist country so if you think that they want if i don't want something that's good he does not he's a property being controlled but he's not for life you cannot vote for people who are for death because that is not God's uh choice this day i offer you life and death and God says choose life so so Kat on that on the accountability thing you're saying some off-camera and i'm i'm mixing up what you said often versus what's what you said on camera but um how accountable are we for this voting meeting if i choose to vote for biden because he's a nicer guy i think i'm just making this out because i'm i'm all in for trump i've already voted for him how accountable am i what what is how is God going to look at that and how is it when it comes to blessing my life or not blessing my life i assume that you're talking about believers correct right you know i'm not believers because let me tell you even the secular secular people are people who are good people that don't know christ they don't know him yet they're called the moral majority the moral majority in this country they don't want abortions they don't like it they don't want it they have families they love children and that's why most of them most of the moral majority would pick trump over biden and the whole democratic party is extremely liberal and yes you will be held accountable because you choose what you choose with your will is what will be put inside of you so what you don't realize is when you choose all that junk and the lies and the hate and if anybody hated you know satan hates and they're certainly operating for him because satan wants violence he wants to steal kill destroy he wants all the babies to not be on this earth because they're all a threat to him so when you choose the left you're choosing what the enemy wants that is the devil and uh they have all kinds of people behind the scenes you don't know that are doing things speaking against america putting curses and all kinds of stuff on it thank God all the body has been praying for america and intercessors i thank you so much for standing in that gap for truth life and hope but yes you will be held accountable because you're choosing it's very important to understand when you choose something that's with your will when you know only go and vote for something and you know that's not lining up with God it cannot be good for you God will still love you that doesn't mean he's going to wipe you off the planet you may not reach the fullness of your destiny if you keep listening to the stuff from the left because it will fill your soul with it as a man thinketh in his heart or a soul that's what you will become so you need to choose life you need to choose what God has chosen himself and he has chosen trump so i would be very careful if you still have time to change your vote and you have voted for biden i would encourage you to change that and vote for life and choose life because that God according to his word that's what he wants on this earth and in our lives you know i remember a scripture where he talked about the babies that were being offered to molech israel turned very wicked and God at one point said it never entered my mind that you would do this which is a weird thing for God to say but he said that but God now knows that how wicked man will allow himself to go if God if he does intervene and voting for the other side is like offering your children to molech you might as well take those children and throw them into them if you've ever had a child born and you held that child in your arms you knew the love and the life that flowed that you had such a love for that child that's how God really feels about all of us but you know the choices we make every day of our life makes a difference in our destiny and the word clearly says what God thinks about abortion about you touching or harming one of his babies he said it'd be better if a millstone if you've never seen or visited an old grist mill or a grinding mill those stones are bigger than a car and he said better if that was tied around your neck and thrown into the sea it'd be better if that can happen to you than the punishment you will get for taking the life of babies he was saying that would be better than what your judgment will be against you so that's just like you you you better not touch his babies you better not come against babies you know why he's sending him to the earth for a purpose they're not just a little baby they have a destiny they have a commission from God when he sends them he doesn't want that life taken from them so that they can achieve what they want on the earth and there's millions of them in heaven that their life has been taken and just so you know this the top guy in new york city just signed an agreement saying that it would not be all right to destroy the life of the baby even as it's being born so if you don't think wickedness can get more evil and more evil they came up with all these reasons why you should have abortions but that is outright murder and that is how God sees it so make sure you're lining up for no other reason than that reason God wants those babies lives to be preserved and to be shaped their soul in their life so that he can use them and so i would be very careful for you and what your decision would be make sure you're choosing life and not death that's good now i i always like when we come on a really serious note like this and we talked about abortion there are people watching right now or who will see this who have had abortions and never dealt with that and never repented would you talk to them about repenting for abortions they may have had in God's grace once they do that yeah it's so important that no matter what age you were and i want to add this i always will add the more some didn't want it and i know people when they were young just got in a situation got pregnant either the parents or someone else outside of them uh encouraged or even sometimes made them have an abortion okay that's a little different than you choosing it yourself right because people wept and cried over all that you need to know this your babies that all were aborted no matter how or why they are all in heaven wanting very much to have you there with them and this was a beautiful thing God showed me that when you repent of having that done you receive christ when you get to heaven your babies will be waiting for you they know who you are they've already forgiven those who did that they've not just forgiven if the parents did it or someone else had it done they've even forgiven the people who performed it they're living in heaven with the life of God but the thing that their heart cries out for is for their parents to be there with them and spending time you get that baby given back to you you get to raise that baby it grows very slowly it won't miss its gift because the gift God sent it with they still get to use that gift in heaven so please if you have not please repent of that and make sure you receive christ and you'll have some surprises when you get to heaven your babies will already know who you are they will celebrate in heaven knowing that you've received christ that you have repented of that and they will be restored to you so would you know that that one of my uh one of the questions that came came in overnight was someone had asked when we get to heaven because we're all going to be young it's 30-ish i guess is it i haven't seen them but you've seen that but i mean so am i at 30 something looking at my grandfather who is 30-something and my father who looked like am i calling him dad and my grandparents grandma and grandpa do you know i think that God would not mind you doing that at all that's how you knew them it says in the bible you will be known as you were known that means you're gonna know who your parents were who your grandparents were uh we are our we are coming home however is God's son or daughter everybody has their own mansion you're not married in heaven you're like best friends families do things together all over heaven and uh regardless of what age they know when someone passes away like at 50 let's say 15 or 9 or 8 they will be almost that same age even if you go home 50 years later because time is not there people grow so slowly however if you were 90 or 100 and i'm sure there were people that were you your spiritual body doesn't look to me it looks like it's 25. it's that timeless age and it will never age in heaven everybody looks amazing uh you have no no imperfections in you everything is just beautiful about you the light of God comes from you your spiritual body is a little bit kind of transparent but you still live a real life in heaven just like our physical body does on this earth so everybody looks good you know what they're all excited about seeing each other and they're celebrating when people come home to heaven i know we have a funeral but heaven has a party so right now though because we're still here you who are here your birth was timed by God on this earth for these days to do great things for him not to be beat up not to have things stolen from you but who you put in power and the bible even talks about it the people rejoice when there's someone who's righteous and who is good that is in power it says that but they don't rejoice that grief comes on them when you have someone in there who wants evil who wants to bring in dangerous things who doesn't want to have accountability uh they want to oh just think about this y'all the left want to do away with all the sheriffs and the police department what do you think is going to happen if somebody like that got in there they're being anarchy for sure they want to pull the borders down let anyone from anywhere in the world come in without any accountability whatsoever this is their platform if you've never heard them say it okay that's what biden stands for so make sure you choose life and God of course wants goodness liberty justice freedom joy celebration in our country example of him in this world and that's why you need to be very careful when you vote that's good i i have never seen in my lifetime i don't think it's ever happened in the united states where crowds of 20 30 40 50 people are together chanting we love you to donald trump i mean it was described i think i was hearing it on last night that on the first go-around people came to trump's reality because they liked what they were hearing but they were curious they wanted to learn and it was that that was beginning to be a thing that they were really liking this guy this is not people coming for curiosity this time this is people coming out of absolute love for this man yes what he's already done for our country if you just look at his record he has kept the promises he gave when he first ran he kept all his promises and america i think the end of beginning like i don't know nine million new jobs in just a couple years that was long before even this fourth year uh that he had already created new jobs um made set up things so that we would be protected he honored our veterans and i have to say this because one of the other biden commercials saying that all the money that's been raised for veterans that he's that trump will take it away and spend it on wicked things this is a commercial that biden has out there that people are believing don't believe lies people he on purpose loves the veterans he loves those who are the first responders the firemen the policemen he honors them all the time and celebrates who they are and even those who retired he straightened out the veteran hospitals were where some of them were dying they weren't getting attention he his heart is for them is for every senior to be taken care of and and this is his heart but the other side is lying about these things like i said before they were accusing him of being for abortion they're accusing him now stealing money from the vets when he's done giving all this money he's not gonna do that at all the other side doesn't even care if you live as a senior so you need to know the truth i only give the truth i say what heart is saying and God always brings truth so you're right 50 000 40 000 in just the last two days in one rally 50 some thousand 40 some thousand he did four or five rallies just yesterday ended in miami at midnight and these people were celebrating in the street that he was still coming they waited they waited in every place he would just fly from one place to the other these people were celebrating that he is bringing life that he wants them and if you don't remember when he was inaugurated the first time he said i'm here to give your country back to you the people and he's serious about that well i'd say you know i i also believe because of this he's probably the most prayed for president in our life tonight maybe ever because we i never have prayed for a leader like this one because i'm thinking lord protect this man give him wisdom and we have to continue to do that even during the next four years we've got to keep him covered right our prayers do continue to make a difference do they our prayers make a huge difference and let me tell you he's actually got divine protection there have been angels sent from heaven warring angels to surround him his plane his home in miami all over in dc when i was there i saw angels lining every street in washington dc they were there to protect him to protect his administration to protect his family it's because our prayers make a difference so please keep praying for his wisdom of God the plan of God and of course we're gonna we're gonna pray for protection for him always and blessings please bless him he is his own money to do this okay he doesn't even take a paycheck and so you don't have to understand God show someone who loves this country and the people who do love him because he's helped make their lives and i'm going to add one more thing because we're talking about the elections biden has adamantly stated all the stuff that trump worked hard for these last few years he opened up the mining and made it safer of course the fracking which is getting oil and stuff out of the very uh parts of the earth the oil lines were open the gas lines were open we need this energy so we can be self-sufficient biden has already declared he's going to shut down every single one of them the day if he gets elected i'm shutting down the money let me tell you these people were not happy with them i'm going to take away the gas lines i'm going to take the oil away i'm crazy coal mining away that sounds like control to me that's wickedness it's just wickedness yeah it's just wickedness it's it's like it goes beyond just wanting to control it's wanting to destroy people's lives it's not even normal natural thinking in every any natural citizen if you ask them do you want that they're all going to say no we need the police we need the firemen we need to rescue people and yet that doesn't seem to be part of anyone in his brain uh is not even none of them are thinking normal because they're sold out to whatever it takes to get this country and control it we're doing it and so there is wickedness and i've met normal people not even christians who say do you not realize how wicked the other side is and when i'm very well aware of how wicked they are they don't want life they don't want truth they certainly don't want God they don't want us to have anything no guns no rights they want to control they want to hand feed you but you won't have anything they'll have control over everything you have this is what socialism is i lived when all that stuff started going on and when people were con very concerned they thought russia would attack then they thought the terrorists would can come and take over let me tell you they want to let them in the left wants to let the terrorists have rights and the democrats democrats paid for all the riders and the terrorists who got put in jail they paid to get them out this is true this is in this is this is crazy they've already they've already done that so all these people who are causing havoc rights burning hurting people they went and paid their bail and got them out of jail this is the democrats so they're already trying to do it they're already trying to work their plan don't take their lies don't believe any of the commercials that biden is showing they're all lies and whenever you don't watch the fake news watch the local news and by the way on election night i believe if you go to kenneth copeland's website he has his own election night broadcast showing the truth about all the things happening in the states it's a wonderful delight to see that someone else is standing up and doing that because the other side will keep lying as long as they can and i just got a really good um i got a good alert coming into me this morning from trump's people that they are winning outrageously in the swing states the voting crazy in the swing states for trump so if you think these people having these 10 000 car mobile rallies without even trump there and many states and even in israel they had their own motorcycle rally in the in the in the jewish section for trump they the the world wants him to win a lot of the world wants him to when they know that he is the person who can turn this country around and not just that they know he will help their countries and when you when you we talked about on and several would not have seen that broadcast we talked about when you go to vote lay hands on that booth inside there touch it or even if you're not supposed to touch anything else pray over this booth for the next people that come that if anybody comes to Kat uh disparaging vote they will change every believer you carry the anointing look it up in first john 2 27 i'll speak that solely first john 2 27 when you receive jesus christ you receive a deposit of the anointing it lives in you it's what christ operated in when the lady touched him of his garment she was healed it does something to darkness the anointing breaks the yolk every believer out there knows that i see you darkness so you are allowed to lay your hands if you lean on the thing like to fill it out take the pen they give you say i release the anointing also on that whole little thing that you can lean on to make sure you release the anointing it'll go into that whole thing and begin to break the yoke of darkness over everyone else who comes there it's called a secret weapon and you have it i have it steve has it we need to start releasing it that's good has the alert showing you after the election i'm talking about weeks months a year or two is there going to be um the people many people on the left that sort of have their blinders the skills fall from their eyes and realize what they were voting for what what has he shown you about those who may come to their senses after the after the fact i think that some will that really just maybe hurt a few things or they're influenced by their friends to vote for that i think that it won't take very long for them to see what how america has been rebuilt and the things a lot of the violence will stop because no one's going to put up with it at that time and people have had the other thing i need to add in all this some people are having dreams of cities burning anarchy civil war in the streets that will not happen the enemy wants us to believe that sometimes God is showing you this is the enemy's plans right that doesn't mean you're supposed to share it with everybody else because sometimes that brings fear if you have no way to interpret the dream or you want to even understand it we take authority over it but God has clearly said to me there will be no civil war there'll be no world war three that is not happening these are his days to do great things in the earth then you can yell at me although all you want to do i won't care what they say i know what God has said and God has a plan for this time and what he's doing is showing you what the other side believes so you don't get caught in all that stuff but in this time on the earth freedom liberty justice and righteousness is coming to our country the truth is coming to our country there will be people you never believed this is after the election would ever get saved but many will and guess what they'll do they'll be witnesses to what was already going on yeah this is a time for justice that means the the darkness will be exposed not just spiritual darkness but the physical plans of wicked man are going to fully be exposed in this time and when that happens the light gets greater we carry the light of God in us and the bible says even when great darkness comes on the earth that will never be greater than the light or glory of God you got to remember the part it will never be greater than God's light in us would be greater than the other stuff going on so you can look forward to you your children your grandchildren your great-grandchildren your great-great-great-grandchildren living in a an amazing place there will be a place to come america will be the place to come and find God such a good word hey let me we have a few minutes and let me let's do one fun one um because we talked about being celebratory and some people have written and commented on that pink hair and so i'm going to read you this because you've talked about your pink hair readily because the lord told you to do that which i'll ask you about but here's here's the question says God bless you i have learned so much from listening to you you have answered many questions for me i have a small question since you have pink hair can i assume God does not mind if we color our hair and wear makeup and jewelry in the bible i re read that we should not wear jewelry paint our faces or our bodies or dye our hair i felt in my heart that he was referring to something different than what i understand yes many people well they'll they'll interpret sometimes with head knowledge most of the things in the bible were said in a specific time on the earth that those scriptures especially in leviticus are related to what was going on the earth then in that time and that time they were cutting designs and images of satan on their bodies they were taking parts of their body and offering sacrifices on arnold's um you know alters to these false Gods they were the the prostitutes i'll just say it the prostitutes in those days were painting their faces like ridiculous to stand out or they had gold things threaded through the hair and stuff so when it was talking about that those days that was going on even some of it up and not nothing necessarily cutting your body stuff but even up into the times the disciples there were some that were still doing that therefore God made regulations that you should not do that this is a different time we're living in a different day and age i i have God in my heart the father son and holy spirit and i represent heaven on this earth that's why i'm sent to everybody here God created the rainbow okay it's okay the pink here doesn't change this is what God said it doesn't change who you are i'm taking what's on the inside which is celebration and putting it on the outside so it can clearly be seen most people in heaven have highlights put in by light they will actually create a way on the earth to do that on the earth down here on the earth and the whole thing about tattooing yourself you have to understand the bible says God marks people he's marking a hundred and forty four thousand with a specific mark that you will see on them he marked cain so people would not kill him he puts his mark on people when he said do not mark yourself this also is in leviticus do not mark yourself with the marks of the dead that's the whole scripture that's that whole scripture he was saying don't put marks on yourself that represent satan or hell or evil because in the beginning that's what mostly people were putting on themselves and i have to say if you're young if you're under a certain age and you live at home you would certainly have to get permission from your parents to do that but God himself is now having different images put on people to represent him it's just a generation wow now he had said is it true that there were that i don't know if we could elected him specifically but generally speaking beauty salons in heaven where people get their hair changed well you know i can tell you from my own experience that these people have a gift i not you might hear myself it would not look this good you may not like the color but it certainly is done well so there are people that God gave gifts to do hair you probably go get your hair cut or your hair done a certain place you probably don't do it yourself and if you didn't have to you wouldn't people have gifts to do that so if you go home to heaven and you're using the gift he put in you what would they be doing there they put diamond dust in people's hair uh your hair can be long or short it's whatever you want in heaven that's the way heaven is nobody does it this is a thing nobody does it so they look better than anyone else and the reason why people have gemstones applied on their hands and they worship in the throne room it reflects the rainbow of God all over so many people do in heaven they're doing as a celebration of God of jesus of holy spirit it's a whole different life selfishness and covetousness and hate rejection uh anger those don't even exist in heaven it's not in you because you're living in the presence of God your your best friend is jesus christ you don't have that in you to even do something they would be against God or make yourself more important you are there to still inspire people and to make people love each other help people love one another people have all kinds of events people want to help them do that so that's heaven that's the culture of heaven and of course we all know scripture our father who is in heaven holy is your name your kingdom come that's heaven your will be done on this earth just like it is in heaven in other words he wants us to live on earth free of all of that fear and lack and hate and judging it's not in heaven he would like the body of christ to be able to live like that wow loving you you have to spend time with jesus christ he has to be your number one but this world will know us one day by our love for each other that's the body of christ the world will know us by our love for each other so that is still coming wow well kat that's our time today so thank you so much we're keeping this reasonably short so that we'll get them back every single day you vote tomorrow right you're going to vote real time i i tried every way i could there was no time to go vote the lines were around the buildings down the

well hello there from the great state of oregon how are you all i hope you can hear me okay we had a couple sound issues today but how do you like a celebratory shirt here they're telling me it looks like i'm either at a rodeo or i am a country western singer i need a bolo tie for that i think anyway this is my prophetic deck to absolutely celebrate knowing the outcome of this race and with that in mind be sure you tell everybody uh to log on and text them or if you don't get them now be sure to share this afterwards let's go ahead and bring kat on we're going to talk about election day it's the third tuesday the third so the engineer is supposed to be bringing Kat on the engineer is not bringing her on and here she comes how are you hey kat how are you i'm excited that's how i am you are so you saw my rodeo shirt here i like it it looks very good you didn't see that i'm showing the people there's four buttons if you can see that i had to do this myself because my white or is it three three buttons anyway we're doing our red white and blue celebration today and we're gonna have fun tell the people Kat what you were talking about the lions here you're in jacksonville florida yes i am talk about the lines that were out there today the lines have been crazy all along um even in the early voting it was the same way this is definitely a trump city and people go wild every time it gets anywhere near here but we've been people been doing their own mobile rallies even here in northern city they've got huge six-foot trump flags on their vehicles and they're driving around blowing their horns and everyone is excited but the the voting precinct that i will be voting at once my mom is ready um it's right down the street from here and jen was going somewhere at 6 45 a.m this morning and the lines were at the precinct outside in all the way across the parking lot down into the next whole block and the next lot were people waiting to vote i am positive for trump and it's been like that wherever i drove today all the lines were like that i'm telling you make sure people you vote vote vote today and i do want to add something even and we've learned this from experience even if they say on the news this state has gone to buying or this states don't listen to them they don't really know the full thing of that yet and i bet i remember back when it was like gore and um bush were running and they caught florida for gore and some people left the polls don't do that you stay there you get your vote in no matter what because guess what when they recounted votes in florida it did cause bush to win yeah why aren't you don't get out of line statements get your vote in even if they call it for trump how how do we know that they wouldn't have to have a recall or a recount so you got to stay in line even if they called up for trump and you're still alive go vote and vote that's absolutely that is absolutely necessary now let me make a couple of announcements i was going to do and i forgot uh i've written these things down john some of you heard yesterday that johnny in law was his word of the lord that put Kat and i we've been friends already in doing things together but he said he saw us doing 10 days in a row of the elections and we're going to end the 10th will be tomorrow the day after the election yeah and so i really want to shout out to johnny and thank him he's a high highly gifted prophet yeah sure and he had a word that we published yesterday be sure you go on and read that word it's very important and then he'll have some contact information there i really encourage you to support his ministry and along that line i'm having julie uh several times during the broadcast she will be putting a note from me because it will scroll up so people will lose track and they'll have contact information for he can donate to Kats ministry or or where to get her books revealing heaven and and if anyone misses that tell them how to get your books first and then the tr you have a ministry site and that's probably too long to just say on the air i'm just going to say it real quick my website is revealinghaving.com if you know about my book it's actually the same name as my book revealing heaven.com is where you find out about my events and you can buy a lot of the products about heaven like i don't do demons this is one of our cups like here we make all kinds of things that that speak on behalf of heaven and God so revealingheaven.com if you want more of the uh the revelation you can go to KatKerr.com that's k-a-t-k-e-r-r com that's that's that website is totally different than revealing heaven it gives you all kinds of truths and revelation on how to live your life and it's also the only place you can actually go and give online to me revealing heaven.com you can't do that so whatever we are blessed we're excited about this election this is one of the most important elections in all of america to be really honored with you and so many people millions of people are praying not just here but even around the world for for trump for this election you can there's several people have asked me this question um and we could have hit it yesterday in fact be sure you get yesterday's yesterday's broadcast was awesome go down on facebook and go to youtube with some youtube elijah's streams and you can get it was very heavy content all the important issues um people were asking me why do you keep telling why do other people tell us we have to pray this in and Kat's just saying God's decided how do those work together or do they care how would you answer of course they work together he needs our words to be released in the earth but this is the thing you can go back and check it out in the old testament in the new testament when something was a divine time or it was on God's timeline that's a whole different time in the book of acts it says sometimes are only in the hand of God himself that's the father and no one else has authority not authority but they not necessarily know what's going to happen in those times unless the father reveals it this is one of those times go read in the book of acts go search for it but it does say some of these times are only in the hand of the father and this is a time he's assigned on this earth to take america back make an example for the rest of the world to follow after to know God and to do great things in the earth so he has decided and he's laying his hand on this country but you you do back it up with prayer while you're voting before you vote after you vote keep on praying there you go season which is a 24 season 24 year season of God but he does need us and the way we respond is by prayer and declaration declaring is as high levels of prayer i declare and decree God will have his will his way this day the trump went he chose him he appointed him he anointed him he is going to make a difference in this country that's still prayer declaring and decreeing the bible says well you dare to declare God will match that decree and so it's that's another a way to get an agreement with him and a lot of people don't know that either so i remember this is like i think it was 30 years ago a young prophetess young woman prophesied over us it was when i was first learning about this uh the lights of this has existed for 23 years but this is like 30 years ago and she said basically you stephen what what you're called we didn't know about the elijah's at the time but she said if you will prophesy this and that and she would name things God will back your act no one was preaching decrees back then nobody was talking about decrees but she was saying if you and i thought wait a minute i'll prophesy something and God will back that up and so that's the same thing that's the same if you say something out in faith that is the lord's will he'll say it's hillary do the forest gum thing you'll go okay well i'll just do that you know it's like it just comes along and says he's my guy or she's my God whatever you know and and then he'll he'll cause it to happen i wanted to mention that some of you are watching from many different countries today thank you all that write in from different countries and you ask you tell us that you are praying for our president that means more than we can tell you we don't get very many opportunities to tell the world thank you for praying but that's amazing more than any time in my lifetime people are saying to me donald trump being re-elected will help our nation yes that's right the thing what is God showing you anything about how the nations are going to be blessed the nations will be plus because when God has his choice in office and it's not just for america that he's chosen trump trump is a very international person he understands big business and that is so needed around this world some countries know nothing but war and God actually said i will bait them with big business to drop their weapons and start big business in their country so that their lives will be better and he chose trump to be able to do that he's already done it in several countries he's reached out to other countries he's waiting to go see more leaders in other countries because they want to shift their country into a better way of life and trump is very good at doing that that's what he did in america and he's going to do again and so it's going to make a major difference and God said i need those leaders shifted so he can then shape that nation for himself so this is about america today but it's really about the rest of the world and what God's plans are for many different countries and so he will be involved in that also trump will be involved in that also that's good i remember when i was stunned when he went over and people were just laughing at him and scoring him as you know they went over to north korea and he began to talk to kim jong-un i think is his name began to tell him he needed to build condos in this coastal town and begin to build up his country and i was thinking what he went over there to make peace and then i now this is really what you're saying yeah he he will help countries build businesses so they don't have to do war anymore they can start right that's exactly what God's plan is to happen i'm not saying the whole world will change but there will be major lenience that will shift that you never expected to shift people reach out with help okay he's not coming with war he doesn't want war not really doesn't want porn but he's not letting evil run this earth anymore and God doesn't like evil either because it crushes it steals life away from people the some countries even get rid of their own people and that is wrong even to God that is wrong and so God wants to shift he's got a whole new platform called shifting government leaders so he can shape the nation and trump is definitely one of those people and he's the only president that has literally walked right into north korea without all kinds of guards and army around him you know he actually looked over the line and went in and shook his hand and he was serious about helping him in big business and his and in his heart was being shifted to do big business and he got impressed uh i'm talking about kim the the north korean president uh impressed with the olympics right there in south korea and what it produced for that country so God really was touching him God by the way we'll have one korea and that will happen without a war or without communism that's God's word for korea do you have any sense of timing on the reunification when the koreas will reunite any sense of timing on that i it will not it's definitely going to be probably over the next several years because when God starts something like that it's not something you can just drop and leave on the wayside i also know the royals are going to be shifting in england i have a lot maybe we can talk about this another time after the elections but britain is going to be great britain is going to be doing great things with with america so don't just wipe them off the list there's other countries too that God's going to bring together to work together with america on different projects now i want to talk for a minute you said a couple broadcasts ago you said it a couple of times that there's some at least one or more media companies that are going to go down and you know a few minutes ago i mentioned uh a young prophetess 30 years ago this same young prophetess 30 years ago she was in the spirit she would go almost at a trance and she would be you know just hardly there but she would begin to prophesy and out of her mouth one day she said i'm not going to say the name of the company i won't say the name of the company but she said da da da da is coming down and i thought whoa because it was the only thing out there fox news did not exist at the time so you can do that on subtraction so tell me anything what kind of uh how big of a change are we going to expect as far as some media companies losing their place i can tell you it will happen within this next four years one of them will lose their place and actually a part of that will be because of the mind of the the leaders either the people who own it those who are at the top have allowed themselves their own souls to be compromised that when trump wins and he will win it will seem like it's all over to them and they have wasted all these years really for what they were called to do was they were called to do to give the news in an unbiased way and they'll compromise their own mouths and what's in their souls they can't even they can't have they can't function properly and what they were what they established themselves to do because of the hate and the corruption and i'm talking about the corruption of their own soul that they their business will begin to go down anyway advertising will go down oh things are going to start going down because of all their own projections of what they said would happen are not going to happen and they can't let go of that hate because it's in them it's not going to bode well for them and i'm sure that others will be affected but there will be one that is a major one that will no longer exist and or someone will buy it out and turn it into something else that i'm removing the seat of authority of some people who are in big business and the seat of authority of those who are politically not just incorrect but politically uh defiled that he won't have them i don't know if that means he'll just take him off the earth which he's used that term with me before and that one of those a couple of people was like castro and the other person who was i can't remember her name who's like the surgeon general on floor or somebody somewhere and they kept bashing and saying and trump will never be uh president in my lifetime and they died she died of saying that and i'm telling you cannot touch God's anointed and not not pay not pay some uh there's going to be some kind of a yeah i mean only it's like only God knows when you've said it the last time and he's had enough there's a point where God runs out of his mercy and he'll say sometimes it's just you're removed from the earth um other times you know they lose their salvation because they didn't receive the lord before they removed the earth i guess we could put it that way but what about uh has uh you know none of us saw this stuff coming with trump uh he's had three or four uh nominations to the for the nobel peace prize that the media won't even talk about and he's having all of these this unprecedented historic countries that are beginning to to talk peace and have already made peace with israel that's right i mean i i don't even know how to ask this question the question is how did he do that but obviously God anointed him but is he just doing this on the flyer has he been planning this stuff in his heart for years what's your thoughts are you talking about trump trump yeah trump always has because he's a great businessman and really is he's really quite intelligent although people don't give him that he's quite intelligent and that's one of the reasons why he himself sometimes are shocked at the hate and stuff because in his mind he's like this is to help i'm here to help i'm helping make things better and when corruption's not in you it doesn't even come to your mind like i don't have a corrupt mind i don't have a compromised mind i am not ignorant of things going on but i'm innocent of them and trump is the same way he's not necessarily ignorant of all that stuff but he's totally innocent of being apart or being what they call him but he won't stop at what God has put in his heart and that is to help and to build and to grow things and and he is real serious and when he saw opportunities when he began to look around see opportunities where he could help he stepped out and contacted these other leaders and said i i can help you i have a plan i can help you with and and they didn't say no crazy i mean the anointing is it's like it's as if trump came out of his shell or came out of the the wisdom came out of him at the same time scales fell from the these leaders eyes so they could see an opportunity because they've never been able to see it all these different republicans and democratic presidents have made all these promises and had all of these conflicts of peacemaking and it always falls apart and while he was picking up on picking on trump mercilessly he was it was like he didn't seem to mind because he was over there let them focus on that shiny object over there because he was over there making peace in israel it was crazy right he was doing something no one had done before and that's the difference in being anointed or you appoint yourself to do it you really want to do something but one God says you're it i'm putting anointing on you it gives you the ability or a gift to influence now people have that gift but they use it for the wrong reason or on the wrong side but trump's not using it incorrectly he's using it for the way God designed it to be and he picked an imperfect person i mean i always at winston churchill if you on if you were around at the time you would know he was probably one of the rudest crudest people not right uh in the world at that time but he saved england because he was bold he couldn't he was fearless he couldn't be bought he couldn't be threatened and when when God has an anointing on you then that is what helps you to get in those doors and get those things done and trump is not going to give up on this country that's something has he has the lord showing you anything as far as i believe we've had conversations but i can't remember specifics as far as inventions and cures that are now going to be able to be released because of this next few years has he showed stuff like that absolutely yes he's had me talk about that for some time uh even before trump was running for president he did tell me that there'll be five uh five new energy sources that we don't even have right now and they will come probably within a time frame because when a prophet says something it could happen like within a few days five years 10 years 15 years or 20 years usually not beyond that unless God has said this will happen 100 years from now and God even does that but this is something for our lifetime that these cures for diseases cancer will not exist i really believe they've already found the cure they don't want people to know it and i know that sounds harsh but life is going right now that those who want to keep things from us those who don't want to are the ones who reveal it and then put it in place and this is the time right now because of all the exposure we've had a lot of exposure of the darkness of the corruption uh that is out there very blatant like satan gets to a place where he doesn't care what he's saying anymore he doesn't try to hide it and that's what he's doing right now and that he wants to take over and he really thinks he has the power and satan actually thinks he has the people to do it but he does not God's people are rising up they're coming against the darkness they don't want that kind of a life they want a future in a home and they want a family and that's still the majority in this country and so the other side will not win they don't even know they're being used but they will not win but there's new inventions coming once we step into this continued season of trump and even the next years after that it will increase it's going to begin to increase trump's just going to push through get a lot done but those coming after him like pence and others great men of God will get things done much faster because trump was here because he did what God called him to do and there will be inventions we never even dreamed of having that will make life less expensive for us that will be available to people everywhere and so yeah God has got a big plan for this season and this is just another part of that of a bulldozing things to move them out of the way building up things that need to be built and providing things for america that america needs to be able to prosper and travel and especially the body of christ is going to open things up first like never before but also just for good businessmen have integrity so this is a great time to be alive on the earth and this is this is to clarify some of the that will be watching this they're waiting for the rapture and all that any moment but you're saying we're coming into a kingdom age however that's defined where where the inventions renaissance people will be talking renaissance there will be i think it was bob jones one of those said they'll even be anti-gravity they're having flying car prototypes right now that are that are literally in the air there are so this is a kingdom when what do you is i think you said this a few years ago we merged into the kingdom age is that about right yes and in 2012 we stepped off a threshold of spiritual time into a whole new time that God continually talks about and he calls it the kingdom age jesus talked about the gospel of the kingdom that was a place to operate from that was authority and dominion that we would have that was inventions and all kinds of life-changing the manifested sons and daughters standing up literally speaking to the land the sea in the air i know bob also talked about that kind of stuff the things would change immediately in those areas and especially taking authority over destruction even natural destruction on the earth it's going to all shift in this time that we're in so you can see why God can't and will not let go of the people he wants in office in these years setting it up for the next 100 years whether people believe it or not roll up that rapture rug because your kids your grandkids and your great grandkids will be ruling uh with their crown on because the word says we're kings and priests and two are God those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion he's not talking about natural kings how important is that he wrote it on himself i am the king of kings of the spiritual kings and the lord of lords those are spiritual lords those are levels of authority we haven't even seen in the earth yet but the people will be carrying it are already here wow let's do this in the last few minutes let's let me get a couple questions and people have sent some questions and there's too many to ask them all but i'm going to pick the ones that seem to have the most for everybody you talk now i'm going to we're get we're about to approach the christmas season i'm going to give you two questions that are going to seem completely unrelated but they're a little bit related you've seen chris a place where christmas wasn't here i'm going to ask you about that and a completely seemingly unrelated question is one of the ladies that asked me about christmas wanted to know what about those people who committed suicide do some of them go to heaven and have you seen some of those people in heaven even famous ones for and she asked nothing big crosby uh uh committed suicide but she said is has she seen being crossboned i'm just uh honoring her by asking the question that doesn't mean you've seen him but i have seen him you have i have seen him and and God clearly defined when you when you're a revelator God clearly on purpose defines things that are in his word especially to bring what his purpose was for putting that scripture in there revelation comes only from the heart of God it does not come from man and that's why people sometimes are quite shocked at some of the things because it reveals who God is and what his purpose is his word says it talks about taking your own life it does talk about that but God defined to me on purpose one time i was going to travel somewhere he said you will talk about the subject of suicide now that wasn't on my list to talk about it was in pennsylvania i believe it was he said but you will tell them my interpretation of that and he said first of all get the dictionary out look up the word suicide and i did and it says knowingly willingly intelligently ending your own life knowing exactly what you're doing so what is happening to most people is not that they're ending their suffering which God said the ending their suffering is different that they cannot bear the pain either mental emotional or physical that they're going through they want to end the pain they don't necessarily want to stop living he doesn't call that suicide and especially if they know him he's certainly not concerned he's not going to be unjust and send people to hell let's say you were in an accident and you were given medication and it altered the way you thought and that does happen actually in some of the media says it brings suicidal thoughts or despair it'll take you in there if you've been mentally tortured or emotionally tortured even physically it caused great drama and even in children sometimes will end their suffering not because they don't want to live God does not look at that as suicide it's called ending your suffering those people will go to heaven i saw many people in heaven and when he was teaching this he actually took me to heaven and showed me people that were there that had ended their suffering so you can take that or not take that this is revelation from God he said because you were standing for your family members salvation and i do know even well-known people which i won't mention any of their names uh one of them had a son that ended his suffering and God on purpose took me to heaven but by the way he was getting messages from christians all over it's too bad your son is burning in hell which was God was not happy about that and this is the thing the world sent this person i'm so sorry for your loss but the christians were bashing him saying his son was in hell and God said i don't stand for that so he took me and showed me this young man in his father's mansion in heaven that was being built and on it was a trophy in the mantle that said satan zero God won which means satan didn't get him didn't get that young man God did and so he said no one has the right to choose this but me that's what God was saying and he said many people will be shocked and surprised to see family members that did make it to heaven because what they did was in their suffering and not he said now i tell you someone who does commit suicide the terrorists the terrorist bombers and people who on purpose plot and play in their own life to be given or taken for destruction to somebody else that is suicide they willingly knowingly flew that plane into the towers on that day knowing they would all die that is real suicide but people who are happening in agony or torment and they end that suffering they see no other way out and that's not called suicide about christmas really quick um of course christmas would be celebrated in heaven why wouldn't it be nick lives there and i'm talking to the one who was the original but they call santa claus today saint nicholas it was really the real person he was actually a prophet i believe he was from turkey and he stood up for the gospel when no one else would he actually used his staff for more than leading the reindeer around and he actually would take out um take it out on some of these people who were blaspheming jesus's name in the town and he took them down literally i mean he had like a fight with them he wasn't tolerating anyone speaking against jesus christ and he was well known in his area for that type of a person but he also had a great love for children those in need he was a very wealthy person when he was young his parents themselves were extremely wealthy and so when they passed he got he got that money and he used it for good so he was a a a prophet of God he was a believer in every sense of the word and yet he literally did have toys made he would deliver them to the children at night in the beginning outside their doors till people were stealing them then he had the parents hang stockings and he would go in and put the toys in the stockings so this is his gift when you go to heaven you will use that gift whether you're a singer a designer whether you uh i don't know have horses at a range for people to ride on you design rodeos you design amusement parks you will use that gift he put in you in heaven to bless everybody so it would be wrong for nicholas not to have a toy shop in heaven that he designed uh toys for children that you could visit anytime and God on purpose calls it christmas town that means christ that means the mass of christ that's why non-believers or the liberal left hate the word christmas they didn't want to have it i remember one time they would call them family trees they wouldn't even call them christmas trees because christ's name was in it so stop bashing christmas people it's the one time of the year God said that people help others that they forgive others it's a time for families to come together and it does exist and yes it snows there all the time oh wow i remember my friend bob jones prophet bob jones went to be with the lord i think it was 2014. he used to say God's got a lot more on his mind than a fat man in a red suit so quit worrying about it so people get really religious and and they'll call it a pagan holiday and it's not you know if we go to disneyland and they decorate the trees there outside we can decorate trees you know that was that you talked yesterday but it was a whole different time period back then where people said well you know you brought trees in and you worship them people i've never seen anyone worship a christmas tree in my whole life i've never seen it either and actually the lights on there are supposed to represent the lights that were in the sky on the day that christ was um born that's what they actually supposed to represent on the trees God lit up the sky with lights and one massive star on the day his son was born and they do actually celebrate in christmas town in heaven the birth of christ and they have huge trees and he puts little real stars real stars on all these trees and they sing to jesus christ because he visits there often and just so people who have narrow minds or don't want to believe this you can't discount what children see and there was a little girl i didn't ever meet in california she was six her name is hiro and her dad wrote me uh she never saw any of my stuff or watch me but he wrote me wanting to know if this was true he said his little six-year-old girl woke up one day and ran up to him and said daddy i went to christmas village and they had trees with stars that same and they had presents everywhere and the snow was blue and pink and it was beautiful and and he he didn't know what he didn't know what to think about it he was so shocked so he did know that he had found that i've been to heaven he asked me i said yes she actually went to christmas she went to christmas town and that really exists in heaven and when i went to california to speak she actually made me a big candy cane cookie to thank me for confirming that what she had seen was true so there's evidence from the mouths of children that this place exists in heaven a few years ago i was pondering all that the lord began to show me another even another interpretation that not that this was the only one but jesus was the light of the world who hung on a tree and below him the light shone down and he gave gifts to men that's right from his death so it's like well it's they can't no wonder they don't like christmas trees even that even though it was probably never meant for that it still speaks to that so it does that's amazing well any last words before we're kind of out of time for the broadcast today any last words about voting or anything else make sure you get out and vote and stay excited the whole proof for doing these everyday things for you is to put celebration in your heart when your soul is so important because that's what you will live that's what you will talk about don't talk about death and destruction and everything going wrong if you really believe that God has this time set aside and honestly there's no way in the world as someone else could have put up with all the junk that trump has put up with and still putting up with unless it is a divine thing so i just want to encourage everybody to really step out in faith and come here come come come come come come come come come come i got one more little visitor here y'all this is your mama this is my mama and i want to make sure that you can see her move move

DAY 10, NOV. 4: Kat Kerr/Steve Shultz - Election Day +1!
by ElijahStreams Nov 4, 2020

or https://youtu.be/1JGP8NUiqok
well good morning from beautiful oregon great pacific northwest good to see you all i bet we know there was at least a few minutes ago there was 1500 of you standing by yesterday we got up to 3 000 one time we think we'll talk that today i know a lot of you are expecting this anyway you're gonna be all the more interested since the the election is in sort of a standby sort of a thing kat had mentioned yesterday that the lord had told her days ago that the 10-day countdown would end the day after the election that in other words we would do 10 shows the last show will be the day after the election so without further ado let's bring kat in here and here she is all smiles Kat how are you this morning well i was with God this morning so i probably doing really great well tell us about that anything you can tell us well i'm wearing what he told me to wear what uh what i wear represents what he's involved in and i'm actually wearing my prophet's robe today and i'm actually wearing the constitution of the united states oh yes you are and i'm also wearing of course parts of the american flag that represents thank you and i got your red white and blue here my stars are here yes great well what do you have to say everything's a little bit in limbo what what would you like to i'm just going to give you the floor all right yeah the first thing he said to me was when you see the ground begin to move you'll know that the lies are about to be exposed and i didn't say anything to him i just let him speak when he's saying something to me he was not talking about an earthquake per se as much as he was a landslide and if you will remember one of the things he had me say was that trump would win by a landslide now in hand's mind in their human mind they already put together what they think that means right many times as we know in the word or even just from experience ourselves especially as a prophet that doesn't ever mean what me and thinks it means and if you will go and check out and see how a landslide starts it starts with a few stones usually the smaller ones start first and then that causes the land to move beneath the rest of them and then eventually nothing can stop that landslide from taking place that is actually what's going to happen and there are many lies that have been um done many lies that have gone forth about things from the left and uh i'm not naming names God will fully expose all this himself um and it will start with a phone call that was the other thing he kept saying to me this morning when you begin to feel the ground move which means the landslide of exposure is about to begin and then he says it will all start with one phone call and i know how that works i know actually what that does mean that those who have been perpetrating the lie have been paid to commit lies or stealing or cheating will begin to get very nervous they're actually already nervous and let me tell you conviction is going to come upon some of them in the lower levels that's what he meant about the landslide the smaller rocks move first which pulls the bigger ones down and that's what he meant when he said trump will win by a landslide so there's there you go that's the difference between revelation and what man in their head thinks that means no way this can be stopped it absolutely will not be stopped from happening the great exposure would take place will be again with the few small of rocks moving that means people will be screaming and yelling and pointing fingers because they were paid off and when you use criminal activities to do your work or what you have got planned you're making the big mistake right then when you reach out to create a lie and then live that lie that lie is going to fall and it's going to take the rest of them with them that's exactly i don't know how long this will take i'm not saying it will take weeks at all i'm just saying this is what God is saying and that's why he had me put my prophet's robe on i'm speaking his words right now it will begin when the ground begins to shake when the rocks begin to move when the lies begin to be exposed and those who are the lower level begin to yell and point fingers the rocks will move the bigger rocks will move and there'll be a landslide of exposure wow like God said if he said those words to me that's what will happen and we'll start with a phone call and so you need to stay excited all of you who hopefully still have celebration in you and yes i did actually expect all of this to happen this happened i was up till six in the morning i was declaring things for God that he had me declare again and as you know i was in dc for a purpose not just to do the broadcast and so God has already got the groundwork laid for this to happen the glory has been released into many places in dc in hidden rooms in hidden places even over documents they that they signed saying that they were agreeing to try to steal this election it's already that part's been done and God is already ready for the exposure it'll start with a phone call and i can tell you you will be shocked to see how much exposure comes from that but trump will win he will be president of the united states he will sit in that office for four more years and God will have his way in this country and many people especially those who are wicked they hate the word of the prophet a true prophet because once you hear it with your ears it will never leave your soul and all those listening if you are any of those who've been doing this you better run and make that phone call while you can so that the rocks the big ones don't fall on you because that's usually what happens all the heavy stuff falls on the lower ones and that's exactly what the democratic party and those who are working with them and that those who have been hired to work with them that is exactly what will happen and so God is letting everyone know in this moment he has not changed his plans america would be greater than before he's going to do all the things he said that he would do and no matter what anyone else is saying these are his words on this day that he himself asked for on the fourth which represents God's path the third is his plan the fourth is his path and so worry on this path because the trump has said yes to him all the body who prayed and interceded we all said yes to him the agreement is so great in the spirit realm there is nothing the enemy can do to stop this from happening so sit back and watch act two of the show because the show has begun there will be in acts 3 and 4 and when he's ready for that he'll let you know but right now you're about to see act two of the show and we can just watch and see what happens because it will happen i also want to remind you all that even kim clement and other prophets who've passed on to heaven are celebrating right now in heaven they know what is about to happen he knew that trump would be president and uh and i always enjoyed listening to his words because that was usually exactly what God was saying to me and a lot of people do that but those who were saying that it is the end and they're seeing the very end which is probably several hundred years from now if not longer then you need to let people know that you don't know when that's going to happen or your reputation will not look so good that's good one prophet to another if you don't have a time frame and you don't know for sure God's doing that right now don't don't say it and so i would say what he says and i will show you what he showed me so yes the rocks are about to move which is the beginning of that landslide and trump will be president no matter what you hear even over this day in this night don't don't go from the path he has you on don't leave that place of celebration because let me tell you we're about to have a huge celebration and i plan to enjoy it along with you that is the word of God for this day even after november the 3rd and so we're just going to go with his plan and do his will his way and this is the time as he said for great exposure and the exposure will be a landslide that's good now Kat i was this morning drinking my wife came into the room and i was i had been praying this morning you know to process what was happening and she said what are you seeing and i said without going into all the pictures and how it meant i i i'll word it like this he's hovering he's hovering over this you know like a spaceship would hover over the land he's hurting like like the holy spirit hovered over the formless void and at one point he says let there be light so that's what the vision that i had in men and it's like as andreen said that's a word from the lord because i'm saying even in my saying it i'd say i wonder if that's just my thoughts since he goes no that's the word of the lord so i mean i see him just hovering brooding you know on the face of the teeth getting ready to do that do you think he just flicks a thing or that person makes a phone call does he do it on cue i think that it will be made exactly when God wants that phone call made and i'm quite sure he's already uh his presence is already being felt uh by that person who will make the phone call and once they commit their stuff to do it it's going to start everything and we'll be amazed and shocked but this is what God does with his prophets in this day they will be very detailed they will be very clear there will not be any foggy moments in their mind if they're sold out to him and they're living holy then what they say and what God has said to them you will see it happen you begin to see it happen right away these days are acceleration these are not the days of waiting 50 years or something or 20 years or something we're in a key time for God right now and he's clearly saying what he wants and he's been saying that every single day you better go back and re-listen to all these broadcasts that were done because God clearly spoke about what his plan was and he is not changing his mind he's God and i do agree because the clouds of glory that were over washington dc when i was there and all the hosts of heaven that were there i totally agree that he is he is definitely over that entire area right now and he is it's just like you said when in genesis um one two when he said that his you know the holy spirit was hovering over the face of the deep in the dark it was darkness on there and he did say let there be light and the light of God is about to shine and when it shines on the darkness everything is exposed and then it will begin to shine on us and then from us so that is what that light means the light you saw steve means it's going to expose the darkness then it will shine on this area on this land and then it will begin a shine from us also so i'm excited what do you think that's good i'm excited about what God is saying and i love it when he says key things like when the ground begins to move you know the exposure's about to happen because it will be a landslide of exposure and he always clarifies himself in the days that he is doing something in this is not for another time these words he just spoke are for this time that you're living in and you're breathing right now and so again i would give a a declaration to all those who were a part of the line cheating and stealing you better run as fast as you can to tell the truth before you get caught underneath that yeah and what about uh i noticed because i watched some of ken copeland's uh broadcast last night as you'd recommend it was very very good and there was a real positivity and they just hung on to the word what about people and i you know there's a couple moments where i had to catch myself up last night and buoy myself up because the news didn't look good what a what about people who blurred out of their mouth this is not what we thought was going to happen this is not what the prophet said when when in reality it's going to unfold is what should they do do they need to like their words they need to strike they need to nullify the words that they spoke that's very important that you do that nullify what you spoke that was not God because then you are no longer in agreement with him and even though you will enjoy the benefits of what happens as a believer your soul will be much happier if you if you struck you strike those words down that you yourself spoke because you did it in fear and you don't want fear to get in you fear always speaks when God is going to do something great and they try to they try themselves spirits right it's a spirit it tries to convince you that none of that's going to happen and then you begin to question everything God is doing so you don't want fear to attach itself to you so you say i nullify those words that i spoke of fear i'm in agreement with God i'm trusting him my faith is out there what you get you get by faith you don't get anything by fear that's true that's true and now you know some of them i think it was um well it was on kenneth copeland last night one of the speakers said it in a way i'd never quite heard it and i didn't know if i could repeat it but basically we all know the scripture that says he's not given us a spirit of fear and one i might have been the ceo of kenneth copeland said fear is a demon it's not an one of your emotions God didn't give you that it's a it's a demon i thought you know i never thought of it that way so when they when you're getting rid of fear you're not trying to get rid of your emotion you're trying to get rid of the demonic that's attacking you yeah there is a person it is it is a spirit even the seven spirits of God just as a side thing here the seven spirits of God are not his attributes or his character they are literally seven spiritual beings that serve him all the time that go on special assignments for him and people always like in their man's mind understanding they have another picture of that there is a spirit of fear there is a spirit of witchcraft these are spiritual beings they are very high level beings and satan's um and his army and i would say to anybody if you've been experienced fear open your door and kick it out do not give it permission to stay evicted from your life from your words and from your home and then you ask God to fill you full of joy and celebration and his presence because that's what we need in these days i am calling those things that be not as though they were that is a literal way you operate in the spirit realm those aren't just good words in the bible they mean something and they move something so you have to be in that same place if you want to reap the full goodness of God by standing in that place it says stand for and so this is a place where we're standing and believing what God has said and being excited that shows that you believe it and it's going to happen God's way and for all those who wish they said something later of course even later if you haven't done it make sure you loose or nullify any words you spoke against what God's plans were he is taking back this country and so it's going to happen and the other side if you don't like it better get saved for all that you've spoken against God's plan also and some people may not survive this you know i i have not that i have not followed kenneth copeland that much of the years just i was in different streams not for any reason it's just that i was in different streams and different speakers but i really enjoyed him he's he's got to be 80 something and he was saying that this was during the time it was the most doubtful last night and he was saying listen we are God's people we're going up this mountain it's called mount nemo and we're looking into the promised land and we are not getting down from this mountain until this comes to pass and i can't remember exactly his words but i thought man that just filled me and i thought this guy is anointed with this he's so unwanted his words are anointed and he also called trump as the winner he did that the last time when no one else had called on any other news source or network he actually calls it i'm just calling him as a winner that's who God wants i'm believing God's going to work his way but let's just say at the close of this evening for their for their program we're saying trump is the winner that's good and that's it that's a different teaching than most christians are comfortable with and i think probably because in the past there were faith teachers that got way up and i was commenting to dream last night i said kenneth copeland was a seasoned huge ministry 30 years ago when we lived in we lived close to there we lived in dallas texas real close to his place i'd never been to one of his meetings but but he was a seasoned leader back then he's survived 30 years yes all kinds of things and ministers who fell in sin ministers who fell with money and all of that and here he is just filled with faith it's unbelievable and you know the great thing is he's passed all that down to his children he was a wise person 20 years ago when he began to give them different positions in the ministry and then allowing them to minister he was preparing them to step up when he goes home to heaven he's a very wise leader and he definitely lives a holy life and he absolutely hears God very clearly i've been after many of his meetings in the past and he actually has my book and he learned he he got that book as a gift and he actually wrote me personally back and said how much he loved it and enjoyed it especially the heaven and uh and and i i did send him book number two so he has that too and uh jesse de plaines also uh loved the book what was that actually sent it to many leaders in the body and they all of them loved it none of them said i don't want to receive this they said they couldn't wait to get there but kenneth copeland has always been in a way another person who guided me into the truth of the word he taught on faith he was a great faith leader also just like kenneth hagin and lester sumrall and uh and i'm sure some of those helped to even mentor him i know his story need to check out his story he had to step out in faith from the very beginning and now he is still one of the largest groups still out there teaching the truth receiving revelation and standing in faith miracles after miracles have happened so i totally would trust the words that he spoke last night and you're right the whole atmosphere was there and i tried to find another another network that was speaking and it was there was no life in it there was no line and i turned it off after about five minutes i'm like no i'm receiving all that i watched and heard by the way it's already up and uh starting i believe at 10 p.m eastern standard time he is back on the air right now so y'all might want to go there when we're off when we're off the air right here yeah just google kenneth copeland ministry you'll get a link and then pop in there and says watch live click that so it was interesting because i was i was watching back and forth kenneth copeland i'd watch fox which was on my main news channel then i'd watched a little bit of them i want to know what everybody was saying and but even on fox now doreen is very discerning you knew my wife she's um she's not what's the word she's uh introvert that's the word i'm looking for but some a couple of the the conservatives were expounding their wisdom last night and she says i'm leaving the room she just couldn't take it and she went out and did dishes or something she's a smart lady and i but i had this i thought to myself i need to know what they're saying you see i i finally switched another channel i said you can come back to me this wasn't even like one of the fake news networks that i was listening to and i'm like man they had no hope about what was happening they had confusion there they weren't sure if trump was going to win or not win and then they started saying some things that weren't nice about him i'm not putting up with this i loosed all their words from my soul because it was already filled with what God had to say to kenneth copeland and what he had said to me you can't receive both sides you can't have darkness and light in you it turns into gray that's exactly what happened so make sure you're filled with the light and you have faith in you let the faith be extended because when this happens you will be so excited to know that your God had a plan all along and even though man doesn't always understand what God wants or what his plans are this is his time to do things his way on this earth and let me tell you that phone call will happen it's gonna be amazing not something that will be hidden this will be shown uh probably all over the internet when it begins to happen and i'm telling you he will win by a landslide but the landslide is all the darkness is about to be brushed away fascinating that's as fast um let me ask you a question you mentioned jesse duplantis he's one that's been to heaven i don't know how many times you've literally been to heaven thousands of times when you said you were with the lord do you mean you went to you went to heaven or do you mean and we're with the lord do you mean he visited you what does that mean when you say that in my room he walked into my room through the wall wow that's amazing now someone wrote to me last night several people have one in particular is that i prayed for years and years for him to visit me i prayed after that and i prayed to go to heaven and i heard you say i think i've heard you say that you have you didn't really appeal the lord to for these to start other people perhaps have appealed but i want to ask that question this other one at the same time are there hundreds of people getting caught up every night every day are there thousands of people getting caught what what's your sense of what God is doing as far as catching people today that there are more and more being caught up i don't know the number that's being caught up i know of myself probably maybe about a hundred different ones that go every now and then i'm not saying there aren't others go i actually was uh jesus christ came in person and gave me a commission they they didn't ask me if i wanted to do this they told me because i already gave permission for them to do it they wanted you with me and and trust me i was tested and i was trained by the holy spirit for over 20 years and then jesus walked through the wall of my home they loved to do that they walked through the wall of my home in 1996 and he said go sit down the father and i are going to start taking you on tours of heaven we want to reveal heaven to the earth like we never have before we're tired of the myths and the mysteries and the lies you go back i said that 15 years ago the same words because that's what he said to me and from that day they started catching me up and showing me places in heaven and then would explain what they were they would take me to people's mansions i would see people like living in heaven i didn't know that they would tell me who they were and what they'd done on the earth and even things i would hear them talking about what they had done with their with their family members as children and then God would give me the phone number this is God we're talking about he was a phone number of the family of the person i saw in heaven have me call them and say would you like to know what God showed me wow it's been going it's too late to tell me it doesn't happen God gives a commission and a mantle i'm a revelator that's what he calls me and i don't get bashed a lot because they don't know what that is and that God did that on purpose when i reveal things of God to the earth and people done that in the past john in the book of john's john 1 2 and 3 and and also in revelations john the revelator gave revelations of heaven himself so this isn't something new but God had a season where he decided i'm let people know what my home looks like and what's waiting on people and not just that but who he is who are the fathers who the son is who holy spirit is uh we we have relationship with them if you're born again you're already part of that family and so you need to open yourself up to receive from him i never make demands on him i actually hardly ever ask him a question when he walked through the wall i began to burn i thought it was going to melt and when when the ground begins to shake i began to shake inside because i knew it was justice people if you know if you want to know what can i say look up to God and say i want justice because we need justice in this time it's written on the steps of his throne this is totally because america stands for justice liberty would you not bring justice when all of your intercessors you've been praying by the masses over these last few months and especially this last two weeks mass groups of people have been coming together praying to God why would he not answer exactly you know that happened that was going on with my i was watching about the middle of the evening before there was a good break and i was my i was beginning to just slip down watching too much news and all of a sudden faith came into me i can only say it this way and i turned a dream and i said God is not going to refuse to answer the believer's prayers not after all we prayed he is not going to let biden be president i was just like suddenly then the shift was in me and i you know i can't exactly claim credit for it i think God said poor steve he's had enough let's give him a little faith or something hey let me ask you a quick question one last question because we're running out of time but you mentioned that God showed you people's mansions that was the one question i wrote down today that i wanted to ask you because the lady said could you have Kat tell us what the americans look like and give us maybe one or two examples of mansions she's seen that are different from one another are they pretty different from each other they are very different because these mansions are designed just for you things that you love to do or even love around you colors you love but in a supernatural way he he creates these mansions and jesus works with him to do it and i've most of them were encounters literally encounters i had where he would catch me up show me a specific person and walk me through their mansion and one i i won't forget it looked like this person was living in a safari he had what you would call wild animals all over his grounds but they were friends they were friends to this person who had passed away and uh and he actually was wearing the garb of what i would think of as like a an african king he was dressed just like that it was a beautiful robe and garb and stuff that he had on and he was walking around the grounds not showing me but i just got to jesus took me and we found him so i could hear his words what he talked about his family and how much he loved them and things that he he was so grateful to God for that he had given him and is even inside the decor you don't know what crown molding is until you go to heaven now everybody's mansion is like that some are very what i would call very sci-fi-ish like very ultra modern futuristic is the word that they use really a futuristic mansion that was all clear you'd step into this big look like a tube at the bottom and you'd say third floor and it would zip you up there to the third floor you could see all over heaven you had a star cruiser for you to do transport in you didn't even need a license that ran on light you're not going to never get detail from it because God gave me the detail so there's this african style of a king's mansion on these beautiful grounds i couldn't see the end of this person's grounds by the way and guess what you can have more than one space i say space really it's part of your mansion he's got doors that are surprises i saw suspended in the air and you're on your mansion grounds and you step through the door it's another mansion say by the crystal sea in the middle of the crystal sea and the mountains of spices when he said the place your place has many different things that you that he makes just for you because he loves you so i've seen sky mansions are called sky mansions and they can be 200 feet up in the sky of heaven and and even bands of the rainbow coming off the throne will go through your sky go through your home like clouds can be engulfed in the glory of God and they even have mobile mansions somebody's going to love this they have mobile mansion parks and yes those mansions fly those were all the people who ever wanted and never have one and it's yours and you go out and load your family up in it uh and you can go go wherever you want to in heaven and they have places where you can park on these high columns no God is the creator the creator he knows what you love he knows what you gave your life maybe away to him and never got to do certain things he will create places in heaven that look like the very places you always wanted to go to wow i remember that thing about the lions and whatever they were the wild animals years ago i heard it or it was in your book or something and i thought man i wonder and of course that makes each person makes me wonder what does God see that i want that even i don't know that i want you know because he knows whether we know ourselves that's right i told him that i would like this is just me running around but i said you know i wasn't an athlete here on this earth when i get into heaven i want to be an athlete i want to be one of the best ones and he might just say that's silly you won't really want that but you know he'll give you that silly steve he probably has already got that prepared for you and by the way they have sports in heaven because those people have gifts but every sport is played for one person and the winner in any of these sports are always jesus christ and i'm even going to share this before we go i was taken to a football game in heaven and i know people most people let me tell you 90 percent of the people are happy i'm saying this the legalistic minded who where do you get to your mansion you're probably faint anyway he took me to this this football game that somebody was playing these teams people who were football players i had a gift for playing it but you can join in you can join in these teams and play but there were three scoreboards and these teams are so uh focused is a light word to win these scores because when they would score it would go to their scoreboard that team but then it would go up to the jesus's jesus had his own scoreboard and everybody's points no matter who made them they were trying to make more points for jesus this is how they do scores in heaven they all went to jesus christ and so it's a different way to play but the intensity and excitement is still there all the angels their guardian angels are in the stands doing the wave it's crazy to think they have real life yeah i mean you get to do things you always desire to do and never got to do there's i got to add this there's no defilement there is no defilement there's no evil there's no wickedness there's no coveting there's no um there's none of that there's no sexuality you don't need people you're in love with jesus remember uh there's no fear whatsoever no fear exists in heaven no evil no darkness uh you can dive off of 200 foot high waterfalls all the way down and ride the waterfall into the bottom where the part of the river of life runs and just be engulfed by his presence so that's amazing i guess that's the time for our broadcast but thank you so much this was uh both word about the elections or the poll whatever word call it now the post elections the election that's still being decided and he's worried about heaven i know there's going to be i'm going to get a lot of notes and comments from people who said thank you and they do say they thank me every time they thank us for you especially Kat and the words that this one woman says i watch kat i watched every program i love her she's helped me become close to the lord what were you going to say i want to say one more thing because it happens randomly but yesterday i got two wicked letters oh and but we have a watchman we have watchmen they read my mail because they have to and they walk right over to the shredder your letter got shredded people those two people sent me wicked letters they get shredded i never see them i will pray for those people as they're being shredded but don't send me the stuff don't waste your time your money or your stamps okay uh because it won't come to me God protects my soul covers my soul and you'll just be you'll just be you know you're gonna get um attacked upon that attack the holy spirit will pursue you there you go one of them steve so just shred it when it comes i will they i there there's a thing that even the left did where they do that's called shadow band which we don't really like if they've been what you want to say well that we were talking this morning there's we have a version of that on youtube if somebody decides to write and write and write and curse us and say this and and slam you or slam me or slam us as falseness we just go in and i just learned this this morning because i asked my guy to go ahead and ban this person on the youtube channel and i said well i asked him how it works he said well we banned them he says from that point on they will always be able to comment as much as they want thinking everybody's seeing their comments and nobody's seeing their comments or they just keep typing so that's our version of shadow banning so if you're really coming against us and you want to go time after time thinking we're seeing it we're not seeing it we just shadow banned you so that's so good from all yeah thank you so much this has been wonderful and we'll we'll let you all know when kat and i are going to be on again we'll schedule something in a week or so get an update from her and uh we'll let you all know when that's coming so thank you so much thank you Kat once again and God bless you everyone and we'll see you again and next time have a good day God bless you you

hey hello everybody from the great state of oregon and the great pacific northwest welcome to another show of elijah's dreams sponsored by elijah list that's uh doreen and i you haven't met during so you have not seen dream on camera yet we both co-founded the elijah list which as you see right there is elijah list.com and just streams which is a non-profit the video aspect of what we're doing here we are now celebrating year 23 of bringing the voice of the prophets to you and it's kind of our pleasure very much a pleasure to bring some of the best of the best back in the early days of um as april of 19 1997 we just sent uh any word we could find that was encouraging by anybody that was breathing that's the way it was and of course over the years we've gotten better and better our discernment and we've gotten more and more uh great context of actual prophets who are received all over the world as prophets and prophetic voices for those of you that may not know the difference um the prophet would be considered summoned as the office of the prophet there's five-fold apostle apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists and many people in the as i grew up were saying well we need pastors we need evangelists we need teachers but that apostle and prophet that was done away they never offered even a tiny bit of proof they just said it was done away with and i accept that as a truth until i actually started reading the word and i said where is it done away with so about 1988 by the way is when the prophetic movement let's say the modern day prophetic movement started in 88 and from that point to this you've seen more and more profits and now there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them so well we're going to bring kevin here in just a moment um what do i seem like there was something else i wanted to uh be sure and put your questions for next time Kat will be here every wednesday put your questions about heaven where we're not doing that much of what does Kat think about this theology or that doctrine right now we're having Kat talk about heaven after we do the elections after we talk about the elections in an update then we'll ask her questions some people are trying to get her to explain pre-trib mid-trip post him and we're not kind of doing that with Kat we're talking right now about heaven it's not that she doesn't know all that stuff it's just that's not our our intended wheelhouse it's not that she couldn't do that but all right well without further ado then let's bring kat Kerr on and here she comes hey kat how are you i'm always great thanks how about you you're really good we are now in week number four of daily shows we first couple of weeks started 10 days before the election actually nine days before the election and you did those 10 days including the day after and now we're in week four and i would have never predicted that we would be going this long doing daily shows talking about the election uh there's a prophet i respect who says we're going to be uh contending he and i don't know if he used that word attending he said we're going to be at this until january 18. has the lord given you any dates you're not the one that said that it's lord giving any days no he said that we will do this weekly thing until trump is until his inauguration okay i don't know what that is i don't i don't even know in my head knowledge because you know i'm and head knowledge but i just know that that the father said until he is inaugurated not just declared as president until he's inaugurated we will be doing this weekly thing and after that we might continue to do some stuff every at least once a month we talked about that that might be more about heaven after all the other stuff happens but there are so many powerful things happening right now so i don't know if you want me to just go yeah just jump in Kat and tell us what's on your heart while we're jumping first of all let's let's uh trump say hello there he is i love it hello everybody yes yes yes i have the presidency do you have the one that talks do you have the one that speaks right the here in washington d.c yeah go ahead and share what's on your heart well you know ever since he said back on november the 4th see i do remember on november the 4th when God said his peace about all that would be happening you know back then uh nobody quite was sure about things because of course they had stopped counting which we all know why they stopped counting on the third it was so they could slip in all the lies and the false ballots and uh change things that would shift everything over to the other person's side abide inside by the way i do have something to say to him well if he's listening but i know he's got probably on there that are his spies or whatever you want to call them and i do know that he has announced he is choosing his cabinet and the holy spirit said say this the only cabinet he will have is the one he keeps his cereal in he didn't say that it made me laugh when he actually said that jimmy and then i said oh well then i guess he's gonna have a lot of fruits nuts and flakes in there right hey goodwin listen the holy spirit's not done the holy spirit's name in heaven is the drama king because he loves drama he loves humor and after i said there'll be fruits nuts and places and he said yeah there's probably even a fruit loop one or two fruit lips you know i almost today i i have a tie you can't see because you can't see us we can see you but i have a tie that's looney tunes so cartoon character i almost wore it today i'll wear it at some point you know and i was going to say because people think we're looney tunes that we're saying trump is going to be has been actually re-elected so oh he is so still president people even in even in you know right now as we speak he is still our president don't try to pack his bags um however there may be other people around this country packing bags to escape to the airport i keep telling people because i keep hearing the holy spirit say keep your eye on the airport to see who might show up there to leave not the country and that will be biden but i'm saying there will be others as this avalanche of exposure of fraud federal crimes are being committed and they have the evidence people whether you want to hear that or not or whether you're celebrating right now they totally have the evidence right now that proves that trump won on that day he already had won and then in the middle of the night and in early morning which by the way i'm always up at that time the holy spirit said to me they're just shutting down to stop counting so they can get all the faults balancing and they can do criminal activity when no one is looking he actually said that so guess what heaven knew all that was going to be but you've heard me say before God is literally using this time to expose career crime corruption in our government and in other places in high places in other places that he will deal with that justice will come if you can't say anything else say thank you God justice is here because it is only here it's not coming it is here and so yes they do have enough evidence and it's already being recorded and they have people's uh witness and testimonies who actually were involved in some of the stuff so they're in a fantasy land if anyone's in fantasyland it's the democrats and i mean leadership and i mean those people who think let's pick his cabinet with the cereal in it let's go ahead and you know pick who's going to be in there with him and every person you would never want to be in any kind of a uh uh you know part of the hierarchy in an administration that's who the other side's picking that's who he's picking corrupted and defiled people and God is against that kind of stuff it isn't that he hates the democrats God loves everybody but he knows who's going to choose his plan and he's not and this is actually they're trying to choose their own plan in God's time there you go never gonna work the other thing that i've been kept aware of are how many earthquakes have been happening in our country just in our country now most of these are low level they're less than like two you know a two then you're not going to really know much about there's been a lot of 1.5s and 0.5 but they've had them actually in some of the various states where those swing states were where they've done a lot of the stealing of the votes and changing um of the electoral stuff i mean it's gone so it's so deep and so far reaching but i do know that they have the evidence they need but there are so many earthquakes and they are still going on there was a really shift even in our ground in the earth itself when God said a shift was coming he's had me say that for about two years i didn't know he meant this of course until he told me but there's a lot of shifting going on in the very uh spirit realm in the ground in the air that God himself is involved in that you can't see but trust me he knows what's happening and he's lining us up those who will follow his plan who want life and wants justice liberty and freedom he is aligning us up to be in charge to have places of authority to have some of the biggest businesses the most prosperous places even the wealth is being reshifted around so i'm just telling you this is a time to celebrate and he God has never stopped saying that and i will not stop saying it either and you will see it happen that trump is president now not in 2024 people get that out of your head you think God needs some help God's not changing his timeline trump will be president for the next four years in the white house and he's not waiting for a cleaner guy's after saying well let's wait for 2024 because it'll be a cleaner deal by then no no he's he in fact if if trump had been elected if they had not stopped counting votes God knew they were gonna uh stop counting votes and he let it all happen because it was all part of this plan if trump had just been quickly reelected we would think we had done so well praying and God got in and all of that corruption would have just gone underground right never have been brought to the surface and people have to pay the price for all kinds of evil deeds done in darkness and God's saying it's time right for this to come to the surface you're right and the reason for the great exposure and then when you hear the word exposure that means something's going to be uncovered a God reveals the good things but he exposes the wicked the bad the defiled and because God is setting up a platform for the next 100 years there you go i don't mind prophesying that far into the future because i've already been there and it doesn't matter what you think about that either i'm a prophet when God says and shows me he takes me in person to these places and shows me he doesn't ever talk to me in symbolism he never has from the time i was a little girl he always would show me exactly what he meant and so it's necessary to have each of these four years with the person God needs in the white house he said i will be in the white house in 2016 he said i'll be there for 24 years welcomed with open arms to shift things in this country to shape this nation for God's purposes that doesn't mean we'll just be one big religious tent somewhere that means we will prosper in every single area of those seven mountains yeah you need to check out these people you need to check out johnny emlow and lance they both talk about the seven mountains these are people you can trust that are very viable that love God that know that trump has been God's choice so he needs trump now in 2016. he needs him in 2020 pence will sit in 20 uh you know he'll be the next one after trump for eight years and whoever trump uh has raised up under him and pence together whoever they know or pence will pick for his vice president will be president without a break people no vacations in there for the next eight years after pence will be uh he will be present for eight years and God in those 24 years that he needs for that platform to free us of anything that would hinder the body of christ creativity new inventions and let me tell you i'm wearing today my nasa shirt there it is the space force people and God wants space i tell you why he wants space to be uh he wants you to go check wants us to go check it out we are the first ones another first in in the world do you actually have a part of our military called the space command the space force he wants us to go out there and look because one of the greatest fuels we will ever have in this world will come from space so we have to go we have to go out there and explore wow so you're saying there's a fuel yet to be discovered that will be discovered in space not on the earth not on the earth it'll be the way it's captured that's how God speaks to me in terms of how they're going to do that they will capture it in space it would be brought to the earth uh through i'm not quite sure because you know my head knowledge is limited and God likes to pick kids to tell things to because they won't back up they won't give up they won't change what is said to them and that's why he likes to pick someone who's like a child and so i remember everything he says so he said to me the new one of the newest fuels will be something that will cost us almost nothing so our energy source seriously that will run everything in our homes guess this in our cars in remote places for the first time we better pull this energy down and run whole communities and whole of villages and things like that all over this world so that's why he needs the right people and trump even builds up to that because he's the one who called this card and said we're going to have a space force we will keep the exploration going if he had not done that then that part that is necessary in order for us to discover this new energy source it wouldn't have happened so you have to see God's perspective he sees way out into the future because he's already been there and that's how he works with me so we are having new inventions that he would not allow because they would have been corrupted and abused people so that's why he's clearing all this up and showing us uh that there can be a a time on this earth will be not not wars won't stop but they will be minimized because gov people governing these other countries will actually not want to war yeah can't there's a lot not just on the left this can be some people on the right who don't serve God not everybody on the right are are believers there's a lot of in my life i've never heard about so much occult practice witchcraft occultism actual people talking about going to these meetings where they would do occult things some of that happened from the left uh not this you know the one before the election before i think with hillary there were there were emails that got released publicly has God showed you anything that's going to happen to tap down this occult practice during the season it absolutely is going to change because when people begin to see the power and the presence of the living God it will expose deception deception is one of the greatest things that satan uses we might as well go to him he's the head of that whole side over there and uh anything that's with the occult it traps you he's after your soul he doesn't want to just control you some people like the power they feel when they're operating in that way but let me tell you what they're selling out their self and maybe even their family so you don't want to get caught in any of those practices and witchcraft will be a real legit thing one day that will be taught in colleges this is how crazy it will get they will have to become civilized it's the is the word that the holy spirit uses some of these things that we think of as being horrific you know and that we want to touch it they'll actually have to become sort of civilized not won't change who's behind all of it but in order for it to not look evil and dark they will be shifting even that on their side that it's a good thing as crazy as that sounds it will never be a good thing to practice witchcraft or voodoo uh any of the new wave stuff anything that's out there that connects it to a other part of the spirit realm that's evil that doesn't change but the way they portray it is going to change because no one will want the blatant out there like you're talking about and the thing is is people in in government offices and businesses will actually have on staff prophets or seers that will already be aware of their stuff coming against them and it will be stopped because of that as far as that part of the culture is i do know that the major senior intercessors or and or prophetic people will be hired on staff and secular companies i've already been approached before about that and i already knew God said it would happen i'm not going to do that by the way i'm not saying it's not God that you do that if he tells you to but many people will be serious after seeing the evil and the darkness and the wickedness right now that's being hidden they won't want people around them not psychics or mediums okay those belong to the other side God doesn't use psychic mediums he used prophets providence he uses seers he uses us intercessors to bring down his thoughts and his ways into this world and into our lives but there is there's a major shift it's not just let's expose all the darkness and then bring justice it's what begins to happen after that will be exciting for those who know christ and if you don't i would advise you strongly to seek him out because you don't want to get caught in some of the other stuff that will be happening down the way uh but it will be more apparent who's in the light and who's with the darkness so God is definitely erasing the grey area the great area that's always been in our country is that there is no bond and that part won't be be believed any longer in just a little while people will know what is right what is God and what is the darkness and which they want now the prophets um i can see a time coming you know God spoke to i was at jacob and and said you know have these sheep you know look at these spotted sheep while they're mating i don't have the story down i wasn't prepared to talk about it and then they that his whole herd became the most prosperous herd and and he outdid his father-in-law laban so our prophets are going to do that kind of thing in the future where they're going to tell businessmen this is what you need to do absolutely yes and i already know that i'm not going to mention any names i mean that's actually been going on for a while with these people who are really wise people who decided in business they didn't want to side with the sin and the darkness and some of these are when i say secular secular usually means not a christian not a faith thing but just sound minds and they're wise because it says those who stand in the council of the ungodly will not flourish and will not prosper those who stand in the council of the godly will and so there are people who actually kind of know what's in the bible or they know people and that's been happening because there are some businesses that have their own intercessors that come in and pray over their business and meet with them every now and then and even fly places to do this that is God's plan that's not selling your gift that's God's plan to bring his plan into the business world into the government into the medical field into education you'll begin to see it everywhere it will be very the the only bit what i can use is popular to know a christian or be a friend or christian and so that's how this how far the shift is taking which is why he needs to remove the ungodly from having control in the government because the government makes our laws they make our rules and make our regulations and as long as the enemy's involved in that you will see them slip further into the darkness but that is not what is happening now that's why the left has no chance to win yeah that's so good well that's based on our time let's jump into some questions about heaven are you ready for that i have one more thing go ahead absolutely i have a guest right here in my studio she is can you see mama she's right there a little closer there there you go we got it now hello we want her i mean she's lived almost 90 years on this earth she had 15 children everybody she's got a hundred and some family members she has a lot of wisdom and understanding and she knows what is good and what is not good when it's right when it's not right and i would like for her to encourage uh people who are like seniors they can still have a life don't put yourself in a box and think you don't matter uh God has a plan for them too i didn't say that part but i just want my mom to say hello and encourage people to not give up there you go mama right up there um the one main thing and i can't remember when we started this but it's been a number of years ago that we stopped watching the news or the newspaper reading it and i'm an avid reader so uh we stopped reading that and listening because it didn't seem like it was anything good that's right and i had to cut back on some of my magazines that i read because they were the same so we were looking for different things that we could i could read and everything else so uh i have a huge library thousands of books and she reads thousands of books my particular thing that i love is history yeah and i love reading the history historical things of our country and the different nations that came here to settle and where they settle and how they live to pioneer this land and i'm amazed i'm amazed it's our tenacity there are so many things that you can do and i'm especially blessed because God has given me 20 20 vision wow so i and i also am able to uh be a speed reader and retain it wow so but i claim the mind of christ every day just about and i've continued to pray over my eyes and my hearing i have no problem with hearing so they should not be in fear right now they should not be in fear but they should keep their mind active yes you can do this by reading and there are good programs on the tv i'm not an avid tv watcher i just i'm not i'd rather have a book but if they want to watch tv there are good programs to watch don't get hooked on this fear campaign they've got it if you look through this day after days the wonder the fake news people she's talking about and let me tell you what we've got the best president there is anybody yeah that's not true and you need to be holding this man up in prayer yes strength good help for his frame of mind and i i can't see any change in that he's so upbeat just just pray for the good things that need to be happening that's right don't dwell on you've been hearing so that's the way i stay positive in this thing well i can tell i can tell man i was ready to have you slowly give sort of a 90 year old speech and you know you're just another no wonder can't work at gutter energy you're amazing yes well thank you you know thank you so much for that encouragement you know i'm 65 and i used to think 65 was old but uh it's not thank you so much God bless you thank you have an amazing day that was so good thank you Kat that's a that was a really nice surprise well let's talk about heaven for a minute a few minutes we got 15 minutes baby uh for those of you who are just watching for the first time kat has been to heaven you said you stopped counting that about a thousand times i think and that was years ago for 20 years so to recap let me just for those that um a a visit to heaven can look like this you said once you reached up to get something at the grocery store by the time you brought it back down you had been to heaven and back and how long had you been to heaven how long did it seem like you were in heaven between that i think the hardest thing to try to describe to people is that there is no time in heaven that doesn't mean there aren't events or activities all kinds of things going on it's just that um there's not like clocks or calendars they don't count things by the minutes they're they you you have encounters like an encounter if you were caught up to heaven and they took you to see two or three places well i don't know how much time actually would go by on the earth here because it's like there's no time so literally when you're taken from here and you're there that that takes less than a second and then however long you're there it's like tom time's not counted here because literally it would be seconds that i was out of my body and my spiritual body was caught up to heaven nobody knew that i was there but i would see two or three places they would take me to 10 different places and i would see details what what goes on in this place why was it made or who was it made for uh what can we do there what did the colors look like the clothing look like what does the food taste like um uh people getting together with their family members or friends or meeting the apostles or the prophets so there's so much activity going on but it's not counted like we do on this earth it's just you're already kind of in eternity there so it's it's fantastic and so i also retain everything that i saw or heard and the whole purpose he did that was so i could share i never went for myself in other words i never was taken to see any of my own stuff i've never seen my mansion i haven't seen anything around in the area he didn't talk to me about my stuff or me it was always what what life was like there how heaven operated that's good now um i keep getting lots of questions you talked about our bodies the other day and i've got three or four i'm just going to combine them into one question okay because everyone wants to know about our bodies okay so you had said when we're there we we uh speak like um i mean we can be we can play football we can play games we can do this so we can hug we can feel each other's hugs and so someone wrote the two questions and it might have been by the same person not sure one said if um uh if God's so concerned about giving us a new body what does he think about cremation if if we're going to have a resurrection then someone else said or the same person if there's going to be a resurrection so that we have new bodies why why do we even need that if we can already do what we what we're doing now when we go to heaven if we can already play football and hug each other why do we even need a new body well heaven is only and i want to stress that heaven is only a spiritual world with your natural eyes you wouldn't be able to see it because the spirit realm although it is everywhere this physical realm is a temporary realm he made this this this earth this physical earth he made the the cosmos out there that you can see that whatever we can see with their eyes through telescopes they're visiting spaceships that's the physical realm and it is wrapped around part of the spiritual realm so that we with our physical bodies while we're living on the earth could do things explore things experience things but God on the new earth it will be physical realm and spiritual realm together as one world and so even heaven itself i know people are going to be shocked is temporary instead he'll make a new heaven and he'll make a new earth and you know i need the new earth is it won't be just God's house God's house is the world called heaven out in the spirit realm you experience adventure excitement fun of the splendor of the all that never changes where wherever God jesus is you're going to always experience that but on his timeline he has his own purposes he made this earth right now so you could have a physical body and it clearly says in the bible that um that this is a temporal place for right now this is temporary it also says you will get your body back because i promise you the part that sleeps is your body and let me tell you if it's dust in a jar God has assured me he can put every part back together so on the day the dead and christ shall rise that is your body no matter where the molecules and the cells are whether you died an explosion if you were eaten by a shark i'm not making i'm making these if you will burn up in a fire that doesn't mean you won't have your body and the crazy thing about the cremation let me take you back to leviticus all the way back to leviticus when it says do not allow yourself to be passed through the fire they were taking parts of their body off back then and burning them on false altars to false Gods and you didn't want that to happen you cannot do that and or they would give family members to be burnt on these altars to false Gods to evil uh wicked demons and stuff like that so in leviticus he said that you should not allow yourself to be passed through the fire that doesn't mean you cannot be cremated it's cheaper you're going to get that same body back but you have to remember what the bible says this mortal body the one you're in the one who's in all the caskets and all the graveyards if they're believers they get that body back it says in the day that then christ shall rise that means your spiritual body your man will come down on the day God chooses your physical body will be resurrected and it will be joined together in spirit and it will be guess what immortal it says mortality will take on immortality see your body that you have now one day will be immortal which means it can never age never get sick it can never sin now this is at the end at the end at the end when God chooses for that to happen like we can't choose when the rapture happens we can't choose when the dead and christ shall rise we can't choose when the new earth is made that is on the father's timeline but i will assure you from what he has showed me and taken me and showed me you get your body back and he knows where every part and piece is this is what he's told me i made it the first time i'll make it again and as i said on the day the dead in christ your bodies that are sleeping they will come out of the grave or out of the urns wherever those are and he will bring that body back together and join it with your spirit man okay and you will be immortal at that time your body will look amazing never age never get sick it can never get injured so what is our future it's called immortality if you belong to christ don't be concerned so much about that but yes it is okay with God if you get cremated it takes less space it costs less money you know this is what i've heard people in heaven say i'm not jimmy but i've heard him say glad i was cremated and then waste all those tens of thousands of dollars i don't need that money [Laughter] need the money don't spend by the way i don't feel a pressure didn't have to spend 25 50 000 70 000 uh dollars on some funeral so you have a big show to send them off the show is in heaven where they're going you can't take them there they're partying their shows in heaven don't try to make a show on the earth let people you know let them say goodbye if they want to and and make it an enjoyable time remember all the funny things that you did with your friend or your family member who's passed away because they watched their services yeah that's good i remember years and years ago my uncle i went i was a teenager then and there was chris he had been a pastor but they they buried him in a nice felt velvet covered pine box it wasn't very expensive it was very plain but it was it was you know dignified i remember the criticism and i kept and i remember thinking i couldn't figure out how do i feel do i feel good that they were wise and didn't spend all that money or should they have shown him respect but you know now the years later i'm going well wait a minute he was having a party in heaven while working how he is nobody could afford to buy or even make on this earth eating things and the most delicious stuff being with friends and family and the lord and the father having the time of their life you really begin to live when you move to heaven that's good that's good okay here's a question um if someone is walking away i'm just gonna admit this is my question because every i usually try to throw one on my this one's mine so what if someone you love is walking away from the lord and they're just starting to walk away does God alert among angels and the holy spirit always knows does God alert your loved ones or a praying grandma in heaven that there's an issue on earth within with her grandson and she prays or does that do those loved ones never know about someone needing prayer right now on earth everyone in heaven knows when their family member gets saved God would never keep that from them they don't necessarily know the tragedies you know they they see the wonderful moments in your life but i'm telling you if they prayed for you before they moved to heaven like your mother your grandmother your great-grandmother if they prayed over you then those prayers remain they actually will circle around you and they will go wherever you are and holy spirit is always on the watch for that moment to impress with them about christ their angels already know sir their angels already declaring they're moving in different ways it's hard to explain how that happens but God will make sure if they're being declared over especially for family members for their salvation he will make sure even at that moment of death he will be able to present himself to them because he would be he would be unjust if he didn't that's not saying every person whoever was on the earth will go to heaven i'm not saying that because you do receive christ to get into heaven but prayer is so powerful and the thing is this don't try to drag your family member that doesn't mean you can't presume and want to pray with them let them know that you love them you cannot validate their sin in other words you can't agree with it you can't say oh that's okay you always let them know excuse me you always let them know that you're standing for their salvation that they can come to you for prayer but absolutely they get a big target on them by the holy spirit and they will pursue them so they're not going to escape being pursued by the presence of God by holy spirit by their angels in heaven their family members just know they declare over you when they get there they're declaring all the time they will become a powerful witness and testimony to the saving power of jesus christ they will declare that i've heard them say that over portals in heaven over their family members so hew here on the earth i know that you are primary and important to be here to declare over them but they're not the only voices that are being heard and have a declaring also you're agreeing with heaven because your family members in heaven are also praying over that person they are okay and then these days there'll be so many things that people say well things can't change when the presence of the living God begins to invade here either with baptism and fire or the glory glory going around the earth these are key things that that have not really happened yet these are events still to happen in probably our decade or close to it and one of the reasons another reason why God is setting up the earth for things there's things coming you have no idea what that presence feels like it is powerful it is captivating and the love of God because he carried you before you came to this earth he is your real father and his heart is for you so that's so good let's do this one last question um just take a couple minutes on this because we're a little bit over time now but i want several people have asked and you answered this a few shows ago but we always have new people watching what do we eat in heaven and i'd like you to add in what jesus likes to eat because that will give people a clue because jesus doesn't need to eat nobody in heaven needs to eat actually they do it because they enjoy it okay so what do we eat what does jesus like to eat jesus loves sweets [Laughter] i knew you're gonna say that because you've heard you say it before he does and he actually loved him when he was on the earth and the holy spirit was the one who showed me that he said look at what his cousin ate because you remember jesus had a family people he had brothers and sisters uh his mom was here his joseph who watched over him and raised him up to be a master carpenter um was here so he lived with people he went to weddings he loved to go to weddings jesus loved weddings because they would have dance you know how they all the jewish dances if you don't know what they just go look some up online uh usually only the men danced it was a a fun thing that they did but they had sweets right they had flowers at weddings and they danced those are three three of jesus's favorite things he loves flowers his own personal mansion is in acres of these eight to twelve foot flowers that sing and worship him all the time that's why he's called the rose of sharon the lily of the valley it was the garden tomb people it was the garden of eden on the earth the garden tomb he he loves flowers and so he loves the aroma of them even though he made them he still loves them so he loves flowers he loves singing he loves dance and he loves sweets and the thing about food in heaven is you can have you say what you want and it appears this is true everybody visits you at your mansion they have 50 table settings or a hundred your guests your friends come in they say what they want it appears on the tables they eat it all it tastes real because it's real but it's made out of light it's absorbed in your body there's no waste in heaven so food is even better there you don't have to worry about being lactose intolerant or not having sugar having sugar is not bad and someone said i i have this is not my question but someone says man i just love chicken that's my thing i love chicken what are they gonna do in heaven well the chickens are like creatures they talk to you [Laughter] all the creatures they don't call them animals in heaven they were called animals on the earth but the creatures in heaven all have personalities including your pets and they talk to you so nobody's gonna hunt they don't hunt them to kill them in heaven God that God wouldn't kill his creatures in heaven they are made out of light all of the food no matter what kind of meat they have pizza they have roast they do have chicken they have all kinds of food up there to eat they have donuts they have desserts everywhere but it's made out of light although you can hold it's not like your ham would pass through it okay it's like this cup you know you have an ice cream cone in heaven it's a real cone but heavens cone heaven's ice cream you taste it when you eat it it's delicious there's no weight gain no food allergies it's one of the things that make heaven heaven what do you think the marriage supper i love it that they call it the supper the marriage supper of the lamb there are tables already laid in heaven they've been putting these tables everywhere all over in heaven and they're filled with the most amazing delicious things to eat so whatever you like to eat i'm pretty sure it's going to be there but it but it's not like on the earth it just tastes better is something something and it doesn't decay so it never goes bad and you don't gain weight because it's light food your spirit man your spiritual body is actually made out of light light is a substance and having your mansions are made out of light all of heaven is made out of light God is light it's a building it's a building material in heaven light is so so yeah well let me remind people to jot your questions down we go through the comments looking for your questions for the next show ask questions about heaven and how God and you can ask questions on what God does on earth from heaven whatever that kind of thing but uh some people ask theological questions and we're not trying to to make doctrines or explain pre-trib mid-tripod we're not we don't do th that's not our goal we're here to talk about heaven itself you can't Kat does say it's time to roll up your rapture rug just because that's a long ways off so it doesn't matter whether you're pre-trib mid trip or post trip it's not going to affect your life anyone listening to this is that true it's not going to affect your life during this lifetime it is not it is not it is of quite a ways away you this is what jesus said himself until we turn you occupy you know what that means be busy take authority in the spirit realm we were given dominion over the earth to speak to the land the sea the air it has been given to us i know that the the the earth and the all of the glory it belongs to christ i'm not saying that so this is why we don't get into theological questions i know jesus i know why he came here why the father wanted us to have these physical bodies why not just say a little spiritual being because then you'd never step into your destiny become what he wants okay but you who are alive right now it is not your job to declare when the rapture is coming let people think there's no time left on the earth when the greatest things of course we know God making us making the earth christ dying christ resurrecting those are the greatest things but other than that why did he make us he's not going to make you especially this country he didn't make this country to be here for a few hundred years this country will become major and by the way i will let you know this personally from God um america is not babylon you might think sometimes this is not the great city that will fall this is not the this is not babylon this is not where all the evil of the evil on the earth will be that most of that stuff it talks about in the tribulation will happen for those who think it won't guess what the rapture will happen the tribulation will happen it is 70 years that's all the time the enemy gets then after that is a thousand year reign that's going to happen people say that's not happening christ will sit on the throne in jerusalem for 1 000 years and then even after that when satan's loose from the bottomless pit here's some theology for you i know my bible then he will go on deceiving the natural people who were on the earth admitted to the tribulation that didn't didn't take the mark of the beast here's the big picture okay God's got a timeline he said satan gets seven short years to be in charge and even half of those will be deception only three and a half years will all the evil and wickedness you find the horrific things that will happen you won't be here so you focus on right now what God's doing uh something so amazing and beautiful in this earth but the things he said in the bible i would tell you people who want to take them out i warn you do not remove things from the bible that God wants there he needs these things to happen and they will happen whether you want them to or not but you are chosen in a special time in the kingdom age when the kingdom we will operate in that spiritual kingdom on this earth and people see things change rapidly darkness will be pushed back and crushed down because even that won't be gone until the earth isn't here anymore okay so you your theological understanding of head knowledge makes sure you get revelation from God that's so good they're not in your lifetime let those who will be here will be much more powerful in the spirit and so i want to encourage you you run your race you be who he made you to be don't try to be someone else because you have greatness in you that's good Kat thank you so so so much for another one remember Kat's gonna be here every wednesday if something were to of an important that God gave her some revelation that needed to get out we would put her on a second show of the day whatever so

hey good morning from the great state of oregon it's 11 a.m our time the day before thanksgiving thanksgiving eve and uh i hope you all are getting ready to have some good times with family and friends uh that's all i have to say about that and uh i i i just hope that this will be a time of great thanksgiving if i look back on this year there is a great deal to be thankful for so um yes it's been a tough year in the pandemic and all that but we are the children of God and we the word says we have to rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice so this is a time of rejoicing it's always a time of rejoicing so well listen we got a lot of content to cover so i'm not going to give any more announcements uh be sure to text your friends other than that let's bring on Kat Kerr here and there she is magically hey kat how are you hi i'm always great thanks i've been looking forward to this you know if if my questions about heaven accumulate very much more i'm gonna have to uh do you twice a week but we're getting lots of questions about we'll get to that sooner we may not cover the uh elections quite as long uh although if we have the content to do so we absolutely will but we've been doing about half the elections and half of uh questions about heaven so let's see how it goes today and whatever the lord will so yeah let me just let me just introduce my question and then i'm going to turn it over to you just before i went on the air someone told us that people were saying or asking hasn't the hasn't trump and even his people begin to concede the election what do you have to say about that absolutely not i hear from him on a regular basis there's no way he's conceding he has a very hard evidence and you have to understand just because you start with the lower courts right now they're in the lower courts uh giving evidence and then it goes automatically to the higher court which is where he needs to go that's what he's waiting on this what he wants there's so much evidence and i don't know how people are going to escape going to prison and this is what the holy spirit said to me the only transition that will happen in the democratic party is probably them transitioning to go to jail wow now i'm not proceeding no one's going to concede in that they know that they've already had a victory they have the evidence to prove that they're not conceding everybody hang on um so don't be concerned about that let's go to the next thing so so someone asked me um there was someone that wrote and they were offended and i i it's too we need to be careful how we say it things that we say but um i'm gonna ask two questions at the same time is it is it not true that God sits in heaven and laughs at his enemies even in scorn he scorns his enemies and at the same question i'm going to say you mentioned that God gave you a clip about biden and it was a scoring thing he was saying the only the only cabinet biden is going to form is the is the cabinet that he puts a cereal in and someone was offended because they basically they want God to act like a christian and then we put it that way in other words God doesn't worship himself he he he is who he is we worship him that's right he's he doesn't have to act unscorpical if his enemies are coming against him so talk about that for a minute does he scorn at his enemy actually God was talking to me about that this morning this must be really something that he wants to say although they think it's something they want to say God does have his own opinions and his thoughts and let me tell you what he says in his bible we should walk in his ways and we should have his thoughts that's actually what the bible says so if you want what is correct is what he thinks and it's the way he operates and let me tell you he is holy he is powerful and there's things that he gets involved in times on the earth and he's not letting go of it and this is one of those things he made his choice for a reason you don't understand that reason well then you need to just accept it as what God is saying that was the holy spirit that told me that by the way the holy spirit is the drama king and yes he did say that the only cabinet biden will ever have i'll repeat it for you this is from the holy spirit the only cabinet biden will ever have is the one he keeps his cereal in and filled with nuts fruit and flakes to the holy spirit the father did say this however verbally through me in colorado this is what he said before the election why would you choose a villain for your president when i have already sent you a superhero named trump and God did not change his mind and you know why he knows the thoughts and intents of both sides hearts okay we can say it's a republican democrat we can say it's the light in the darkness we can say it's good and it's evil you say whatever you want to there's a line drawn and the left does not stand for life that means they stand for death God does not want people running this country that stand for death when he's a God of life that sends life to this world so yes he does he he actually has been scornful several times in the bible if he wanted to he could take their breath away and i think he's being very gracious by not doing that and in my own personal thoughts but i will tell you i only say what he says and i will only tell you what he has shown me that is to come trump will absolutely sit in that white house now as president for the next four years i remember that uh they will be held accountable for all their crimes i remember that jesus on the earth he said they told him what herod was saying and he said tell that fox yes today i'm hearing it tomorrow and then the third day i don't have it fully memorized even jesus who never came other than this time against um secular authorities just put it that way well accepted he also said your invited sepulcher is full of dead man's bones and that was the hierarchy and the religious and in the jewish religion at that time that was his statement to them you're white as sepulchers that means they're dead people okay you're dead you're dead in your belief you're dead in the way you live your life so jesus had a righteous that was his righteousness coming out he did give his opinion of what he thought as the son of the living God and they don't like people who sin who hate who want to kill who want to control they don't side with that yes christ died for their sins they obviously have not chosen the path that God has laid up for us is to to prosper to be in health to live right righteously and to help him bring hope but not control that's good um now let me hit the other side of this so for those and this woman may be watching who wrote that question and it was an honest question she didn't really like that you know you called the holy spirit the joy he she said durham a queen but he said drama king um God has a personality jesus has a personality the holy spirit has a person and they all have temperaments and personalities we are made in his likeness we have personalities of our own God's ways are part are part of his temperament personality value systems so this is the way God can be God revealed to you that part of the holy spirit's personality his temperament is that he loves drama is that right it does if you've ever been baptized in the holy spirit which i never mind talking about what do you think drama is your language has changed your reactions have changed even the way you live begins to change we've had people on the day that when they got baptized in the holy spirit they would spin they would twirl they would roll on the floor this is a reaction of that power of holy spirit invading you when you ask him into your life it brings power it brings you get revelation on things to come it's it's it's a powerful experience and he loves not just drama here he loves the dramas he loves art dance he loves music that's why they call him now you may think in your head what you think drama is on the earth i'm talking about in heaven but yes he meets things he shakes things uh he shows things sometimes people don't expect but yes that is exactly how he feels about people usurping their authority and taking control when they have no control he doesn't like it and that is exactly what the left is trying to do they're trying to improve they won and they're already planting their cabin they're picking their people it won't happen it's just not going to happen they're making it up they hope will believe it because they know they can control you by what they say if you believe it don't repeat it and don't receive whatever they are saying is happening because the truth is this trump has already won and he's got the evidence to prove it that's good now kat we talked about uh even the scornful attitude that the lord has for his enemies and what they're doing is this possible does God scorn some of the things that like what he said about biden and at the same time does God love by me he loves everybody because every single person who ever lived on this earth came from him he carried us all inside of himself as little spirits that's where a little spirit man lived in him of course if he did not love us he would have never sent his son to suffer to die to drink that cup of every evil wicked deed that could possibly happen and nail that sin to the cross he would have never done it if he didn't love people but there's times he can use some people that sometimes he can't use them at all sometimes he they just need mercy so they don't die and go to hell because let me tell you God does have a window of time when he's doing something on the earth that he can wait for you to come alongside or you just pay consequences i'm not saying he brings the confluences you create them yourself by choosing the wrong thing no choosing of life no choosing of hope no future um no fairness okay no righteousness God can't use them because that's the way they're living it doesn't mean he doesn't love them he'll love people all the way to hell trust me because you don't have a will and they're choosing with their will what they want it's not what God needs in this world because he's making a change for the next 100 years this isn't just an election this has to do with the next 20 years in the white house and then the next 100 after that so God's made his choices and he wants his will his way concerning all of this and so what the others chose when they did corruption and crime they will pay for that uh their salves they will have justice we will have justice over all that that's really good and now all all of the prophetic voices that i keep checking with them i don't say are you sure you believe i don't mean it like that i mean i just stay in touch let them know what they're saying and people need to know that the prophetic voices we've had on here not one of them has said i'm retracting i'm thinking twice about this this is looking bad no no one says that there's a unified voice so i'll just ask you point blank have you for a moment doubted since november three that trump would be re-elected you're not talking to me are you yeah i'm i'm i'm asking you have you for even a moment doubted i never doubted it in 2015 when he told me the first time and caught me up to heaven and showed me trump in the white house for eight years eight years in a row he will be sitting in that white house i never doubted i never doubted anything that was going on i knew stuff was being i knew the indict that they shut down on the third that they were going to cheat i knew the holy spirit they're going to stick false ballots they're going to steal ballots he would tell me what was going to happen that is exactly what has happened and then you you told me i hope this is not talking out of school you see like because i asked you recently how do you know this or how did God show you tell you this and you said God didn't tell me this he took me and showed me this is that what is that how you got this revelation yes that's how he's been dealing with me he's always shown me things not to this level when i was even a little girl i could see the spirit realm i knew the operations going on in the spirit realm i got born again at age four so i've been saved 60 some years i forget how old i'm because i'm planning to be timeless just so add that one more thing to your list you should be declaring that for yourself but let me tell you he takes me in the future and shows me what is going on i've seen clearly 50 years into the future and he has a reason why he needs trump then pence then whoever pence picks his vice president he needs these 24 years because he will be allowed in the white house and it will change america so much so no he's not changing his mind God won't holy spirit won't jesus won't all of heaven is focused but they're celebrating you know why they've seen the beginning to the end and the end of the beginning they already know what's going to happen that's so good all right well you ready for some questions about heaven yes i am um so those of you who may be new or new ish ken has been to heaven way more than a thousand times you said you stopped counting at a thousand there are and i think one time recently you said you know you personally know of about 100 people who have gone to heaven i know several people uh besides you i probably if you counted them there's seven or eight people i know who who have visits to heaven so let's talk about heaven and i'm gonna start okay i'm gonna start with a question from my son-in-law okay he's a little bit new to some of this stuff and he i see i asked my daughter if she had any questions she said ben has two questions so this is for ben i love ben he's a nutcase but he's great he teach my daughter so good and he's probably the best father i've ever seen on the planet earth he loves his kids so much his two boys here's his question and we've heard this question before but let's do but from time to time we're going to have to do it again he said um ben's question about heaven uh where do a husband and wife on earth have a special relationship in heaven with each other that's question one and two is not related to that but he wants to know if if when you're in heaven can you see earth i don't know if he means can you see the planet earth he probably means can you see your loved ones on earth or see what's going on on earth so maybe i'll just throw that open for both of those questions all right um when you die the word says that you are no longer married so that's that's clue number one you go home not as it's not that you don't remember of course you're going to remember you were married you do have a very close friendship with the one that you're the your husband or wife will have close relationships you literally live live right next door each other sometimes because everybody has their own mansion you come home as the father son or daughter so once it says you it says until death do you part you even say it in your marriage vows that's not because God is unkindness because there's only one bridegroom in all of heaven his name is jesus christ and so that should give you a clue and probably maybe two years ago the father caught me up and actually showed me why he says that no one can be married in heaven and why he said that because of the purpose of his son is going to have a wedding with all of us and we are bride of christ male female all of us are the bride of christ you have to get out of your head it's not like here on the earth you'll be set aside special for him because he redeemed you he died for you and so you go home though as father son and his daughter and you each get whatever your mansion is going to be built around the passion you have the gift you have and so that's why he gives you one that doesn't mean you don't see each other you remember who your sons are your daughters you remember your family lineage and of course you're close to them but no one in heaven will be married you can visit each other all the time and no one's going to really care about the other because everyone in heaven is very much in love with jesus christ he's the number one for everyone in heaven and um you'll never regret giving yourself to him your your life will be filled with adventure excitement uh joy celebration awe and splendor and wonder and everybody's so happy they're there so that's good both questions i'm good that's so good so if someone's had uh more than one spouse's three or four spouses um and maybe they were all great or maybe they weren't you're still gonna be if they make it to heaven you're all gonna be friends but there's not going to be jealousy or insecure jealousy does not exist in heaven you're thinking in your flesh in this flesh body you have all kinds of emotions and stuff you can be influenced by the enemy by negative people no one gets offended there's no fear there's no anger there's there's no coveting there's absolutely no jealousy okay absolutely none so you don't have those because they don't exist in the atmosphere of heaven you're living in your spiritual body it's a literal body in a literal world where you enjoy things touch play run enjoy your mansion and everything but none of those things exist because you're living in the very presence of the one who made you heaven is consumed you still have wonder like i said adventure and excitement but no one is ever jealous nobody ever gets upset or angry isn't that amazing that's why it's called heaven that's good so let's say ben's grandparents are in heaven can they see him yes they can see him God made places on purpose i've been to those places several times i even have a um a sketch of one in my first book they're called they're actually called portals and people go into these beautiful buildings and in the floor of this place you walk up steps and literally look over a balcony railing there's a huge opening when you look down you see your family members as close as the ceiling of their home i will however let you know this you seen you see no sufferings no agonies you don't see that part of stuff going on what you will see is any celebrations any babies being born any marriages any accomplishments even in the natural if you get like rewarded at work if you get a new position um if you've done something amazing for God and God has spoken rewards or blessings over you no one in heaven misses any of that and on your own birthday they go to these places and look down and they actually sing happy birthday to you i love that and then they go and get a gift for you and they put it in your mansion so every year you're apart you will literally have that many gifts in your mansion to open from all of your family members and friends wow that's really good okay now this one's mine for ben he doesn't know i'm gonna ask this okay ben is a what i this is my turn for him he's an adrenaline junkie he'll ride on two wheels on an atv on a hillside he does all things dangerous and loves it and she teaches his children to do that does he get to do stuff like that in heaven he is going to love heaven [Laughter] then have extreme sports in heaven and this is the best part no helmets required and that's exactly how jesus and i've actually seen i've actually was taken to a football game i'm sure you know people find some way to blast this where do you go there you're gonna find out it doesn't bother me that you say things against us because these people have a gift athletes who are good okay i'm not saying there won't be something that might not be good whether you're recording artists if you're a dancer like boy and stuff like that if you're a creator of movies that produces something and you're doing the good stuff uh that is the gift and people know people who are gifted they want to hear them they want to see them be near them you have a gift he probably has a passion and a gift to do the extreme sports yes places all over heaven God made for that happen you can ride up these trail bikes on roads of light that go uh and crazy the places that they take you there no one can get hurt injured or die in heaven so it can be about as extreme as you want to by the way all these sports or other things if they're scoreboards where a score is kept jesus christ gets all the points this is the way it's a form of worship for him because they're using their gift they did it here on the earth and even if you didn't get to you use it in heaven so let's say in this football game there's two different teams i will say this their guardian angels are in the stands cheering them on this is you're going to love having i'm telling you and so as they play the sport that when the when one side gets the ball over whatever they do i don't play football they get a score on their scoreboard but once it goes to theirs it goes up to jesus they will be more passionate and probably more focused to win because they're winning for him and whoever gets creates more points for jesus that team gets to carry jesus across the field i gotta ask this your your son i'm sorry your husband bing we call him captain bing uh he loves to fish yeah you don't like fish at all no i don't okay so you love to fish and that is like the favorite pastime of all you can ever think about what about heaven do you get the fish the difference in heaven is this i will always say this no animals lives are given to feed you in heaven it isn't necessary uh the food is made out of light every bit of it is made out of light and you can go fishing there's even a way to go hunting but you do by capturing photos of the of whatever you're hunting and you can win unless they get you first fish can pull my husband into the crystal sea first it's an epic battle they don't use really yeah they don't use a hook to catch this fish but if he can ever get the fish in the boat i would like to be there when that happens one day because normally it's the other way around these the creatures other creatures have personalities and they're very good if you go to a rodeo and think you're going to ride that horse honey it's been there for a long time and rarely will you ever be able to win on any bowl or horse in heaven or or you can eventually do it probably i don't know how often you'd have to try to do it but you won't get hurt or injured no broken bones nothing wrong with you the people want to do these type of things and yes i'm sure my husband will fish and i always say that peter will be his best friend because that's where peter is in heaven peter is always fishing really yes i think he's still trying to catch something that's so good well that means there's golf there's all these pastimes i had to ask this this is i was thinking about this before the show are there places like disneyland on earth well how do i say this are there places like disneyland in heaven because we invented them on earth or did we invent them on earth because there were places like that in heaven we invented them on earth because there were places like that in heaven this is why and i can tell you this is why when paul was caught up in saul he couldn't even speak about it because he knew people in his day would probably tar and feather him if he ever mentioned what he saw there's things beyond your imagination even as much as we know and understand now in the earth if you want to talk about technology it's beyond your imagination the things that you can do in heaven that you could never do here but paul actually saw some of those places like if paul saw an amusement park number one he wouldn't really know how to explain would you describe that today so he wouldn't say anything he wouldn't say anything about being in the third heaven and i know a lot of other people have been caught up that didn't want to say anything about what they saw i went if he asked you to speak about it then you need to really speak about it but i was taken to an amusement park and it's just crazy the roller coasters go on the track they go off the track around the sky under the crystal sea and come back up this is what i meant you don't have to worry about breathing the water or not being able to breathe at all it's heaven so yes they've always had many things in heaven before we ever had them on the earth and witty ideas and inventions are sat down even says so in the bible every every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of lights the father of lights that was you and him okay your little spirit man is made out of light and so he's always sending them we just now are going to be some brand new ones we never have before so yes it is actually important to have fun now having fun is a night you can have fun but i don't embrace anything that even looks like witchcraft has images uh there are no good witches in the earth i'll give you that for free God clearly spoke against them even back in jesus's day and then none of them were good but that is something that will be coming to the earth eventually that you can have good witchcraft and practice it don't ever do it don't have a part a part of it it says have nothing to do with a necromancer if you go look that work it means witchcraft wow but you can have fun you definitely need to have fun you need to laugh especially together as a family but even you yourself the best thing you can do in the midst of a trial is open your mouth and laugh at the enemy because our life is in the hand of our God and people i already know some of this is happening already people are getting the most extravagant things given to them and in a degree they never thought possible even right now in this time because God sets a table that table is extravagance it's full provision it's more than you expected and he does it in the midst of everything going on around you so i'm going to tell you you need to expect and say i will receive suddenlies i will receive the goodness of God instead of thinking about all the negative stuff going on say what God would say that's so good okay that's good boy this is so good this is very meaty this is very good i'm encouraged as well okay this one i thought maybe someone was joking or or it was a crazy question then i realized it's a serious question um they're asking a jewish question and then i looked and said well sure enough it is a jewish name but it says have you any time have anytime seen anything related to israel or anything jewish in heaven did you see any jews there i would love to know about that i have seen jews there and i can tell you this they're still God's chosen people we are grafted in there's a lot of people that say that doesn't matter anymore that is not so i actually have you and me too but in order to answer that question the most powerful thing one of the most powerful things God showed me was i begin to see what you would call the star of david or the star of israel it's on their flag you know the six-pointed star everywhere well guess what it's in heaven everywhere and i would start to tell people God and he does he loves the jewish people he loves them they were the very first people on the earth ever that represented God even jesus came God called him he made a covenant with abraham that was a powerful covenant and we're grafted into that too so it's not like we're over here and they're over here we're actually going to be one one day and actually God said this is what i think about them and he caught me up to heaven to show me that jewish star and he said this actually is called the jewish race star but actually it's my own personal sign well so it started in heaven it was invented in heaven it was always been in heaven so God said when i chose the people to represent me in the earth what sign or symbol this is how he explained it to me what sign or symbol would i give them if they're representing me most of the time i'm someone that i can't answer God in my mind i will and i would in my mind i said of course it would be yours and so he showed me he took that that that six point star in front of me took it apart he said this represents the three points father son and holy spirit this represents body soul and spirit represents mankind and when i put them together that is my dream so if you think God did not love you and he gave that symbol his own personal symbol to the jewish people because they represented him in the earth it's it's still it's it's an honored symbol in heaven because it represents the father but i actually have seen jews that received christ even at their very death receive jesus christ as their savior and so i could tell you they have a pretty good probably 90.9 chance of ending up in heaven especially if they're orthodox to you and even though it's hard to keep his ways worship him him for God you still have to receive christ you're not doing that even if it's at the moment or almost the moment of your death sometimes he'll present himself to them and say do you want me now and he does that to many people actually yeah not just the jews but you did tell me once that he appeared before orthodox rabbis or in with two between life and death right those that's he did moments that's really good yes and actually i'll just take maybe two minutes to tell you go ahead quick side of the story there was this precious jewish young man who he was an orthodox jew he kept God's ways you know that he talked about in the old testament he was very faithful in doing that and so did his parents before him and i have to say that about the jewish race those who are orthodox they they don't break what they believe God wants they don't compromise in their lives they stay very true to God and that's the way they live their life so they died and they passed on and he had friends christian friends who said we hope your parents receive christ because we'd hate to think of them being in hell which unfortunately is what a lot of christians say to people when they haven't been there to see and so this young man sort of crying out to God himself and saying would you really put my parents in hell they loved you with with no end to their love they gave they helped others you know they were so faithful to you would you do that and two nights later jesus christ appeared to this young man in his room and he said why would i be unjust to ignore the fact that they had such love for for righteousness in the holiness of God himself how could i ignore that he said your parents are in heaven because i met with them right before that moment of death and offered myself to them and they received me and the guy fell on the floor just wailing and crying wow christ had such a love for those who were pursuing you know what they know to be right he he took the time and so he told him and then he of course received christ himself in that moment so you know don't ever say unless God showed you somebody that wasn't in heaven to show that you in hell i've seen okay i've seen hitler and help people he's there i've seen several people in hell yeah he didn't want forgiveness he didn't care he want he wanted to kill steal and destroy and control no that's where he's on the meat hook in heaven he's one of the most tormented people in all of hell because satan will promise people he still does today i will give you money power wealth does that sound like what he said to jesus if you take me and receive me and i do all these evil things for me when you die i'll set you up in the kingdom no he doesn't he loves nobody but God on the other hand loves you even while you're yet sinners you have every chance and i'm praying that everybody has someone declaring don't stop declaring over your family members or those who you love like a family member that they will receive cries that's wow that's that's amazing now i've heard you answer this several times but we have lots and lots of people coming on new every single broadcast this woman said i miscarried my baby what can i expect when i get to heaven you can expect to have that very same baby given back to you um every single baby and i know there's even people who don't believe this or they preach against this every baby when God sends them it's their spiritual body that has the soul in it okay and number one they never stop existing you never stop existing you're an eternal being right now if you're a believer one day you'll become immortal which means you can't sin you can't die but everyone has an eternal that means you'll live forever that's why it's important to choose where you go okay you want to go there so those babies who never did anything wrong to anybody they're innocent whether their life is taken in abortion or they miscarried them and didn't make it their own guardian angel which is sent to them at the time of conception this is how God does it so life does begin at conception when that happens that means the father has sent with the holy spirit that little baby spirit and he knits it together in the [ __ ] he attaches your that little spirit man to that little God of flesh we can't make a spirit okay we can't do that God has to and so when he does that life begins so their angel or angels are waiting for them outside this mother i see pregnant women all the time with angels around them and some of those are that babies shot the bagel's angel so when they pass the angel takes them they're aware of what happened to them they know who the parents are if they were aborted they forgive that family member they forgive them completely whoever performed the abortion and they even receive christ as their savior because they love him he heals any little hurts or wounds from them and they become very happy if the child is miscarried they were already loved words of love were already spoken to them but they also their own guardian angel will carry them up to heaven they live in these beautiful places unless there's a family member already there like a mother or a grandmother then they can get the little baby and raise it until you get there but none of them are forgotten i've seen millions of little babies in heaven that are cared for the angels rock them and breathe the breath of God on them they have places where they go and play uh like the birds come in and take them for rides you gotta remember they can't get lost either they have little play ponds that he builds just for them to play and some of them are very tiny and in my book you'll see a picture of an angel holding six little babies in his hand that's how old and so um i'm working on my third book don't ask me for it yeah yeah well by the way speaking of that uh Kat's books are called revealing heaven and and go to revealingheaven.com is where you can get those books is that right yeah so you got to get those i've read them and my my perspective of having changed dramatically and i said this is cruz before i was um i went on a cruise that you were on uh but i and but that before that i'd gone on a cruise and got these books on heaven and i read about them because my wife had had a miscarriage and we sat there and read this these things that you just said and both of us had tears streaming down our eyes because no one had ever told this that that they will be in heaven no one had ever told us that we named uh we didn't know if it was him or her boy or a girl and so we picked a name that would work either way and um so you had said that before and named your baby talk about naming your baby what like you said before it's very important because even though these little babies are all in heaven the angels give them nicknames so it's not like they're it's not like they're nameless or anything they're cared for their love they get played with the angels give them a nickname i know somebody who miscarried a baby and they've never even mentioned anything to me about it but i was taken to heaven and shown this little baby girl and the angels named her precious i actually got to see her she was precious and they still call her precious to this day that's her and they put her little name over they live in this beautiful nurseries don't look like a building a sterile building they look more like beautiful glorified like a beehive shaped thing and the creatures come in and visit and play with them they have this niche built into the wall one day i may have something i can show you of that it's a beautiful niche with the most gorgeous fabrics that are alive and these fabrics have the life of God in them and i know they gave the baby that's their own little place that has their name over it they mainly climb up and down the blankets and they have livingston coming out to sing to them they climb up and down on the flowers they're babies and and so they they play and enjoy their life the reason why it's important to name your baby if you say i'm choosing to name my baby God and if you want it to have a girl's name if it's a girl pick a girl's name and a boy's name or you can pick one that could be either the father sends for that little baby and their angel the guardian angel that was with him on the brings them into the throne room they sit on the father's lap or in his hands and he tells this baby your parents just name you wow this will forever be your name and one day you get to see them when they come home to heaven is so excited they laugh they jump up and down they play they go listen they go back to the nursery and that that beautiful niche they got they changed the name on that niche to the name that you put that's wonderful that's fantastic that's amazing well for the father loves to name things so he is totally for you naming your baby that's really good let's i guess we have time for one more question um who are the cloud of witnesses are they all believers or as i see in scripture does it seem to be those that walked in faith or this incredible faith who are the great crowd of witnesses the cloud of witnesses are all people who have moved to heaven live there and the cloud of witnesses could include your family members especially if something's going on for instance this is a good example i love examples heidi baker had built a center here in florida downstate and i think it was for teaching people to do revival or something similar to that she had a um these classes that went for several weeks and people could come then they would on the graduation night and i saw this photograph myself they had the cloud of witnesses appear in the air in in this building like a purple cloud you could literally see faces in the cloud and someone who was there sent this picture to me and when i when i winded and looked at it you literally could see faces of people i didn't know all these people but you could see them in this watching so the cloud everybody thinks well that's up above in heaven some watch from heaven sometimes he brings that cloud down here usually in the air of the building or outside so they can went to something powerful this was a powerful thing that heidi was doing and so they these people who were probably a part of some of the members that were there some of their family members probably wanted to come and see or jesus could be in that cloud sometimes and so it when it talks about i know in hebrews 12 1 right the great cloud of witnesses and so you never know who's watching you but if it's something you're doing it could be something insignificant like you have paid for this whole one center say you're paying for them to have turkey dinners and you think well this is nice of no heaven would come and watch that they would watch out of your goodness and your own giving how these hungry people were fed so nothing's insignificant to God but they definitely sometimes come down and they're watching usually when someone's getting married and things like that like my one daughter's about to be married i'm sure my father will probably be in a cloud of witnesses and my grandmother and her grandmother i'm sure that they'll be there to watch and witness that's why it's called witness guess what that means they can see something they hear it and so that's very significant that we do it says get every weight out of your way that you can run your race because this clown of witnesses from heaven are watching our lives that's so good Kat that's amazing that you know every time i learn new things i've heard a lot of these before but every time there's a there's half of them i'd like man i didn't quite know it that way so be sure you all as you are watching this either on the replay or live type some questions we're accumulating them they're backing up a little bit we try to ask the questions that seem to mean the most for the most people unless i slip one in there for my son-in-law i wanted to add real quick i think if you google heidi baker cloud of witnesses you may able to actually see that photograph oh that's great that's amazing well kat thank you so much unless anything changes we'll see you a week from today on wednesday be sure and let your people know write your questions down and we'll do this some more all right everybody keep the pain happy thanksgiving to everybody thanksgiving absolutely all right everybody we'll see you again next time

hey hello from the great state of oregon welcome to elijah streams we are sponsored by the elijah list those of you who are brand new to this the elijah list has been here for 23 years and we also started a foundation called elijah's dreams which is also the same name as elijah list ministries and that's our non-profit side of things and the video stuff that you see is all elijah streams streaming so that's that and we're going to just bring Kat here in just a second uh but let's see if i have i don't think i have any announcements and since we got so much to cover today let's go ahead and bring kat on in here there she is how are you kat i'm great really excited about everything of course what God behind the you were just at hank cunaman's church how was that it was so powerful there were so many angels present is it was just absolutely crazy but it was the air was filled with such intense excitement and i have to say for those of you who know about the dream that hank had of me um you can go look that up i'm sure that it's on his website lord of hosts is the name of his church but he had this dream of me eating cake and laughing when the announcement was made that biden had won this was this was not unreal thing that happened this was a dream hank had and there was more to it than that but because i was eating cake in that dream he actually had cake brought up on the platform it was crazy fun did everybody listen to cake and celebrate and so yeah it was a great time together they got a lot of revelation i thoroughly enjoyed watching a couple operate in authority through jesus christ commanding the host not tolerating the darkness uh in any of them or anyplace around them it was a very powerful time wow that's so good well kat let's jump in then because you talked about the elections and the elections that are still in progress or we should say trump has won but he now is is in the process of reclaiming what he's won tell us where you're at with that i'll just the floor is yours well i will let you know right now that as was said that the whistleblowers would start coming forward it started with one phone call which happened a little a while ago but major whistleblowers who really know what went on behind the scenes about all that stuff the fraud and everything um have just come forward just i think this was just the other day and it is shocking to find out what actually was going on but these people are valid people uh i can't name the government agency that we all know about that but it's definitely i don't want to give too much away because they're still presenting this stuff before the courts they're getting subpoenas they're getting all the stuff uh it's just wild of things that have happened in the different states with the elections but you need to know this for sure there is a recount going on and they just ordered a recount for new york how about that really the whole state yeah they've done it in pennsylvania i think they did it in ohio and they're only counting valid votes vote about valid ballots they're not counting the ones that were created or made up or brought in undercover i think they even found 300 and some thousand trump ballots that were hidden i mean they just found these this just happened so trust me there are things going on you don't know about just stick in there and celebrate with God in the victory that we're about to all experience so yes things are going on behind the scenes you don't know about and i'm sure certainly absolutely the news media will not tell you about this but yes things are in process and is there something to the fact that that trump is purposely stringing this out so that more things come to light is i think it was johnny endless said something about that is that your sense as well oh absolutely he is and this is the thing that happens when things like this begin to happen and things begin to get exposed all those who were apart who don't want to take a great fall they're all going to start to come forward that's why the landslide will be great of the exposure because of those who did it are going to be telling on the others which is what was all talked about on november the 4th and so yes we did know this stuff was going on and yes trump is totally still receiving people coming in and talking about things so yes he's not concerned he absolutely will not concede when he knows he has already won so don't give in stay strong and like God said eat cake and celebrate that's so good and for those of you watching especially if you're just not new today or recently we had a whole group of prophets who we've had on and to the last one they have stood firm everyone has said i know what i've seen i know what God showed me trump is going to serve about the next four years not 20 24 the next four years so we're all in on it aren't we yes and actually you know that makes it so dangerous against hell when the prophets begin to come together in agreement that's a whole new thing it is than any or others many others i know the body is coming into agreement also which is powerful but when the prophets who hear God know God begin to come into agreement the enemy begins to tremble that's so good so good is that you know last night i was praying and i God was highlighting some specific almost celebrity type people and i had i was praying in two different ways first i was praying exposing he gave me the name of this particular man expose him i'm not talking about biden but i'm just talking about another person and then i i just said revealed his and the term nakedness came he revealed his nakedness to him and then after i was saying show no mercy then i began to feel like i needed to pray for mercy so i said this i'm contradicting myself but in your wrath remember mercy that's the scripture yeah wrath remember mercy so i then began to pray for mercy for some of those being caught up in this yes and God actually asked me to pray uh probably more decidedly for all those who've been caught up who were just everyday people that were caught up into deception and therefore voted for no life because that's what your vote was for life or not for life and he said please pray for those who have been eating up the deception and be involved in the deception that they don't want to take their own life because you have to understand deception get you so uh brings confusion it brings a lot of fear and when they have been told by the other side if this doesn't happen if we don't win your life is over there is no life there'll be no existence which we know is all wise because we know that what our president stands for is prosperity health wholeness restoration celebration and that's what he wants a better america so the other side doesn't want that they want to control everybody but there will be many who go through that so please do remember in your prayers pray for those who were caught up into deception only going by what somebody said to them or what the fake news if they swallowed that and they followed after that they need a lot of prayer so that their eyes be opened understand so that they can be free when this all comes out and trump sits as a president still that they can actually celebrate that moment yeah that'd be good i i just think there's something you know that i think it was when God spoke to solomon it was in a dream basically but said because you have not asked for the death of your enemies i'm going to do all these things for you and prosper you but he because solomon you know he was the king he could have asked for his God to just wipe out and God does not like it when we seek the death or we speak a punishment that is so severe that even he would not do that so right so i think there's there's a point to remember to pray for mercy and at the same time exposure so it's got to all happen at the same time yeah we can ask for God to curse anybody the bible even says he's not ever going to do that and that's part of what is so wrong with some of the things that people make statements about we want justice and that's the proper word God said use the word justice because he is bringing justice it's going to happen and we celebrate over justice for us and those who have done things unknowingly without full understanding of it we do ask for mercy for those but there are some that God if they want death and want to bring death he said don't ask for mercy for those people and so we have to put it in his hands of course we don't like ourselves we're not going to curse anybody we're going to stay strong with what God wants for us for those who run after life and they want a family they have a family and they want to have a real life here in our country then we need to vote for those who promote that and that's their platform and that would be true that's so good well listen listen that's we that we got the update on the elections are you ready for some questions about heaven oh sure yes so let me do this let me tell people now there's a lot of people joining us every single episode we have probably tens of thousands of new people and so we keep getting the same questions over and over and people say please ask Kat please ask me this is not realizing she's answered before so i'm going to ask this this one time four questions that are repeat questions we're going to catalog it so please bear with us for these four questions then i'll ask for new questions that we haven't asked and that way when people sign up tomorrow and say please ask kat we can say go to this link and there will be your answer so that's good so the first question that everybody asked the most problem is what about marriage i was married here what about my wife especially if they've only had one spouse um and and one wrote because he thought you said last week that we wouldn't care and i think you meant we wouldn't care whether we were married or not he he thought he said well i want to at least know that i'll be really good friends or with my wife can we be good friends in heaven because we were married i'll make it short i'll make it short i'm going to use scripture the bible says that you will not be mirrored you will be as the angels are in heaven they aren't married that doesn't mean you won't have a friendship a really close friendship with the one the one that you were married to you always have a special um affection i have to say when i met when i said you won't miss it i meant the physical desire and you know in the course of marriage there are physical desires that are normal to us but in heaven in your spiritual body those desires aren't there the care uh the great affection you have oh yes you'll do things all over heaven together and this is the best part they'll be like your very best friend that's not replacing jesus everyone in heaven is just wild about jesus christ because he's the bridegroom remember we're all the bride that means we're the closest thing that will be to him will be the bride and christ and that's what marriage represents actually is uh the two becoming one so in heaven we'll all be one with christ in a spiritual way but that love is higher than a physical love but yeah your family will live right near you you remember that your sons your daughters your cousins your uncle your parents you remember that and so yes you do fun things together a lot you go on tours and do things all over you visit each other or just stay with each other even that's okay to do that and so uh don't be concerned about losing anything okay so different but beautiful so you will never forget oh that's so good thank you ken that's awesome okay you got that one and we got it on tape now okay so uh the next one is also one of the most common questions is what about my pets do my pets go to heaven yes and again i have to mention the scripture it just helps people to understand that in the bible when God told noah to put all the animals on the ark he said put every one of them on the ark that has a spirit of life in them that is your spirit man okay when God breathed the spirit of life into adam he actually was breathing his little spirit man from himself from God into adam so there are your pets have they have a spirit person a spirit animal is same thing same path they have a spiritual body and they have a soul your soul is what you make decisions with what i like what i don't like what emotion i'm going to display where you know yourself if you've got pets they have a lot of emotions so yes when they die your own guardian angel takes their spiritual your spiritual your pet spiritual body carries it up to heaven and puts it in your mansion so yes they're going to be there except they'll talk i remember you saying that they actually can talk when we get to heaven we'll be conversing with our pets yes absolutely and they talked in the garden of eden or eve would have been over the snake talking so that's restored to them so yes look forward to that be nice to your pet that's good okay this i'm going to blend these two together and i think people are asking about is there a covent cure coming people are kind and freaking out this is probably the most common question please ask Kat about the vaccine and some of them are afraid to take the mark of the beast they don't want the vaccine other people are afraid to get sick other people are afraid that the government is getting control so what do you have to say about covet and taking the vaccine or not taking the vaccine and those kind of things okay again i'm gonna just repeat what God said it is a virus a virus comes and goes i know it affects others more highly than other you know some people um i know young people almost never are affected by it and there's a whole age group that's almost never affected by it actually 90 of america has not been affected by that you need to understand that they make it sound like that everyone everywhere has had it and some doctors are writing down anything it doesn't matter what it is you come in with they'll they're writing it down that it's a virus therefore that gets recorded as being part of it but i would say this about the about the vaccine i myself am not choosing to take that number one i don't need it i don't feel like i anita at all and i think that as a personal choice i think they should always leave it a personal choice at this point according to trump it is a personal choice now if your governor wants to push it especially the ones controlling things i can't promise what they're going to say they've been doing a test mark a pretty thorough test mark on different age groups and so far no one has died from taking it so i also want to encourage you with that they've had some of the best of the best people designing and developing this not from china i have to add that there's no way that we're getting any of that or any part of it is not coming from china which actually developed the whole thing on purpose you need to know it was done on purpose so anyway i would say that's your own personal choice what gives you peace is what you pick but i haven't heard of anyone so far have taken any of that that has died from taking it so i can't say the death threat to anyone who takes it it absolutely is not the mark of the beast and you know you you probably weren't around back in the day when the flu was everywhere like crazy um let's see what else there was all kinds of these i'm talking about diseases now i'm not talking about a virus but back in the day when people had all different types of diseases and a cure came for that disease and even her kids now most of them you can take a vaccination when your child is a certain age that stops them from having like polio and um i can't remember typhoid fever chickenpox uh things that well were a lot more serious those things were so much more serious than the virus is i'm not telling you to ignore it and i think if people use normal everyday uh you know cautions precautions and stuff i think that we're all going to be okay i really believe God tells me this is what he says it's gonna pass and i think that probably means to God it will no longer exist on the earth the enemy satan wants to use that virus but fearing people to keep them away from everybody else and i know this also that in the past before this thing came everybody had friends they had family get togethers they love one another your love for each other is so important so however you can do that give a hug to your family i'm totally against people wearing masks in their own home unless they had maybe a a very aged senior that wouldn't be my mom by the way she was here not listening that's not my mom and she's almost 90. she's extremely healthy she does go out with us she does things she wears her mask and she's very happy she gets to go out but as far as the vaccine goes it's not the mark of the beast there is no mark of the beast i know there's people writing books again probably writing one about this about the virus being the mark of the beast the mark of the beast is not for now uh not at all it's probably several hundred years maybe into the future i can't really tell those exact dates i know God showed me a hundred years into the future and it was not had even not had the mark of the beast antichrist one on the earth at that time you focus on running your race right now for what God has now and you make the choice do i want to take this do i not want to take this i'm sure many people will take it like i said all the tests i've had so far they've not had any real negative reactions to it at all that's good that's good well good okay let me ask you this this is a combination of a of a repeat question in a in a nuanced uh new question about it regarding our mansions in heaven you said it puts our you know our pets are brought up to our mansion so are are our mansions already existing and are they pre-made for us now are they being made and the second question i'll let you ask at the same time is people are several have asked me what about when there's the new heaven and new earth does our mansion in heaven get moved to the new earth or what okay that's a great question i love new ones let's go back to the let's go back to the first one your mansion is being worked on from the time you are born they start working on that thing it is so detailed and it's designed around your gift not your spiritual gift your natural gift whether you're an athlete whether you like the arts whether you like to do uh building or design or i could name any kind of thing out there that people absolutely love and they're gifted in that thing your mansion is being designed around that powerful gift so people can come to your place to enjoy either maybe you sing maybe concerts or maybe doing design or even things like like um antique car shows or rodeos or um theme parks you know all that stuff's in heaven because people have gifts that's their gift and so you don't go to a separate place like i don't have a job to go to in heaven to use my gift it's all designed in part for instance i knew a a dance um a dance instructor who actually was one of our daughters first dance dr she was had one of the first christian companies the father's company in our city and when she passed i was taken up and shown her mansion as part of her mansion she has studios where she teaches dance she's really she has a big exhibition place where people can come and see dance uh beautiful dance nothing defiling when you i know in your natural mind sometimes you think that what about this what about that there's nothing defiling in anything that happens in heaven so her whole property which was huge i mean this place i think probably sat like 10 000 people and yet it was part of her own mansion she had other parts of it that she lived in and due to the things then i've seen the same thing for people who who raised horses for people to go on rides up in the mountain spices and things they had a ranch with a thousand horses and they had all these barns to keep them in and beautiful things for people to enjoy to go there and all that was part of what God put in them the reason why he didn't take your gift away is because he designed it for you to use in heaven to make everybody happy excited and bless them that's okay and then what about what i need is when your mansion's done you are going home there you go he times it exactly so that when you pass now if it's a child for whatever reason doesn't doesn't make it through then they are taken to if their grandparents are there or great grandparents are there they go stay with them so they're not left alone somewhere he made me add that so but your man just when it's done you go somewhere you know it's interesting because someone asked a question that was on my list for today if i could get to it but now that you've just opened that door so the question is you said i've heard you say before when your mansion's done you're going home yeah and the question came to me how do i know if this death in my family was the enemy took this life or it was my time to go and that's kind of related because you said when when the mansion is done you go so how does that all work most of the time that is somebody who would already have been an adult like we all know the story of marissa it's written in my one of my books revealing heaven she was 13 when she passed away but her whole purpose to be on the earth was to love young people for God but when she was caught up to heaven she was staying at her mother's mansion that was being designed and she lived with her great grandfather so she would go back and forth those places she lived actually with a great grandfather but would visit her mom's mansion she would actually put things in her mom's mansion her mom is still here so God knew the day she had to come home because she was chosen to be the youth leader over all the youth in heaven and it was their time to begin to practice their part in the mirror supper of the lamb which is still years away but they wanted to start so she was caught up at age 13 to be a youth leader in heaven so there's many different dynamics to why do they go when do they go if you know they're in heaven you need to celebrate i know that you miss them really especially if they're young but they're living in the life and the joy and the celebration of God they're with other friends and family members they're not going to be alone but normally if you reach the path of what they would call like 18 21 and you pass from here you're going to your own mansion in heaven and again you won't ever be alone there you have all kinds of friends and family coming by so he doesn't design a child's mansion to be finished uh it's still being worked on it's like he didn't all of a sudden finish it and then stick a three-year-old in there all right they have uh friends that stay with so their mansion will continue to be completed until they are at a point where they can eventually probably go there it may even be after you get to heaven that they actually get their own mansions if you're oh the new earth okay you're not going to care about that he said you knew heaven a new heavens and a new earth there's a clue what's here now oh God moved to heaven you leave it all behind anyway right when you come and get your body back you won't even then be living on this earth this earth will one day be replaced people struggle with that God the maker of everything will make a new earth it will be our home heaven is his home this is our home but one day he'll make one big enough to hold all of us and it will be our home and you will love whatever's there whether he moves your own mansion there or makes you brand new ones you're going to celebrate that's good that's good now i've got several questions that people want to know if they get to be buddies friends with their guardian angel and once they're going to have another guardian angel maybe he has 30 different assignments or 50 you know so they want to know if they can be special friends with their own guardian angel or how that works if you know you actually have a you're you have a main guardian angel you always have one that's the closest to you that covers you watches over you depending on your assignment that God has given you on the earth you may have five you may have ten guardian angels but there's always going to be one that is sent at the time of your conception that angel is waiting outside the mother for that baby and to be presented into the earth and from that time the angels with you your entire life and yes you do get to know that angel in heaven you don't have to worry about worshiping angels in heaven you're in heaven okay nobody's gonna worship angels in heaven you will get to know the one who watched over you and you actually get to go see this little individual movies of your own life lived over minus all sin if you've been forgiven but all the funny silly things you did and also all the times that angel rescued your life you will find that out when you get to heaven so there's many exciting things besides living in a mansion you will get to know your guardian angel when you get to heaven now lady wrote and said you know she understands that when you have a miscarriage that that baby goes to be with the the lord and the abortions as well but she said i've had five miscarriages did God keep putting that same spirit back in or and therefore there was only one or do i have five children in heaven waiting for me that is a very wise question that very few people actually ever asked and um sometimes depending on who that is that God's sending from himself if he needs that child on this earth at a specific time some people are going to freak out over this just get over it God God and he's done in the past if there's somebody i know somebody that that happened to that he sent their child to be here during a specific time this was just a few years ago and uh and in the baby miscarriage and God sent this is what he does he will take that little spirit because it's usually really early on he'll take that little spirit and uh and put him back inside himself and then when the parents try again sometimes he will put it back a second time because he just seen them here and uh but most of the time you've really miscarried if you're miscarried five times normally you have five children in heaven and i guess we'll all find that out when you get sure that's good now i you know i like the new questions because you know the the old ones we keep repeating it but that those were great questions let me ask you another one here um someone wanted to know and wrote today or yesterday he said i want to know when Kat goes to be with the lord he wants to know about that different father son and holy spirit are they different personalities different voices different looks and is God chatting does he like to sit and chat with her or is he all business is he strictly business and the lord jesus is chad tell me how tell me what you can tell me tell us what you can tell us personalities because they do have different personalities now they're images that's a different thing they absolutely have different personalities and i want to start with the holy spirit the holy spirit loves drama he loves the arts he's extremely creative he's a poet sometimes if you prophesy or something it'll be in poetry form and holy spirit has that that personality he's exciting he's adventurous and and uh and he's uh he knows everything of course because he also is God he's the third member of the trinity so that's the side of him i see a lot i probably hear him more than the others just because holy spirit really inside of me when you ask him to indwell you he really is in there okay and you you get a lot more understanding and revelation when the holy spirit is in you then when he walks alongside of you when you're born again he comes here and walks alongside of you that's what the bible says but when you ask him to indwell you he moves in you become the temple the holy spirit that means that's his abode now holy spirit has unlimited layers this is his image it look they all look like him they're all him but when you ask him uh will you please indwell me he takes a layer of himself and sends it to live in you he still has himself it's just that's why he knows everything everywhere the father is a father he's the most kind loving member of the trinity even jesus himself said there's none really good or the greatest of all is the father he even talks about that himself and so i would say kindness just comes from the waves of love and yes he wants to talk to us but he talks to us like children and when you were a tiny little thing in him he actually even then hold you in his hand he'd sing over you he'd talk to you he'd say funny stories um that's the father's personality although he is still all God and he is holy but jesus christ and people that he is of course kind and loving but look at his personality when he's on the earth he's in his glorified body he is the ruler of the three of them he is the king uh so here's a kind and loving father who carried all of us who knows the most about us then here's his son right here who came who who dealt with death itself who wiped up hell and stripped things off of satan he's the lord of hosts over all the army in heaven i'm talking about jesus christ the ruler the king but flames of fire in his eyes and people still love to run after him in heaven to be with him but he is definitely the ruler so they have different personalities and usually whatever it is they want to talk to me about like if it's about dominion or authority that's going to be jesus christ if it's about exciting fun things to event and things that the great things like celebrations or moves of God on the earth that's holy spirit really the father really catches me up more than the others to show me himself his heart his ways his thoughts his purposes for each and every one of us how much he loves us and has great plans for us and so much so he made a way for us to come back to him in other words when we're on this earth we're born everyone's born in this fallen earth and of course there's sin involved in our lives or or darkness involved in somehow not saying you absolutely went after that but just living in this atmosphere and with people who are not godly you're affected by it so when you receive christ his sacrifice on the cross it wipes all of that out of you and you're as righteous you have a way back to the father actually the viewer of the father and so that they each have a purpose of each separate purpose but they can still step inside of each other and be one and so the father the kind loving but he can't tolerate hate or evil that's why he kicked satan out and the one-third of the angels who fell he didn't want darkness in heaven he didn't want anything about it there so that's why they were all kicked out but but he loves everyone in this earth even the left even all those doing things that they shouldn't be doing he does love them but that's why he sent his son they need to know his son and they would change that's so good well now you had you talk about that our loved ones can sometimes look through portals in heaven i can't remember if you called it something other than a portal but where they're able to look down and see things like weddings and births and special things but my so my question is and you can add anything to that the question someone wrote to me is they said since that can happen and they can see the good can i i guess this woman wanna know can i say to my loved one my mom for instance i love you so much mom i'll see you soon or is that or is that or is there no you can't do it acceptable to do that um people do it anyway um people if you're buried traditionally like in a cemetery or something i can't tell you the number of people that i've talked to that are gone and some people like to make benches next to where they were buried knowing their loved ones would want to come it's not you're not worshiping them okay it's not like the day of them where everybody's you're not bringing food for them to eat you're not you're not piling treasures up you missed that person and loved them you had a a soul tie with that person it is absolutely i even tell people look up and say hello and on your birthday on your birthday they will be and they call these places the portal and in my book book one you can see one of those probably online uh at one of my websites revealingheaven.com you probably can see uh one of those places that i was actually in where people come in this beautiful beautiful building and they walk up a stairway and look over that balcony they can see you right where you are like like as close as your ceiling like there's a portal right now open over me and uh sometimes i'll every now and then i'll see my dad up there or someone else i know up there uh i don't worship them either but i will just usually throughout the day or when my dad had a special day he said dad i just want you know i love you and carrying on the things that you started i have i love people for you i help you i know that he knows that already but it's certainly okay to say hello i miss you i love you i'll see you again maybe you know your family members riding the roller coaster hey i know you're writing them up there because those people people love those things and the thing about having an understanding about heaven it helps you on the earth to realize it is a literal place and a place that one day you will be together with your family and these memories here of struggles or hard times you went through they will become like dust okay and because you'll be living in eternity at that time your family members don't want you to remember let's say they were really sick or in bad shape they don't want you to think about that they want to remember the times the happy times and by the way they're whole right now yeah i mean i i have said because i didn't know if i could address my father who went to be with the lord 30 years ago but he had been an abusive father and then he found the lord but i have said to the lord would you be willing to go and tell my father i forgive him but i hear i'm hearing you say i probably can say dad i forgive you yes absolutely you can say that you can you can say dad i forgive you i'm so excited you're there with jesus i'm so blessed that we'll be in eternity together wow because let me tell your family members in heaven are saying hey jesus can you give a gift see they're doing that i will even say i mean i have a couple of my siblings that passed on to heaven i'll say jesus why don't you go give my brother a gift tell him i love him and give him a gift and jesus will do that but see they do that in heaven and they'll go to heaven to a jesus they'll go jesus i know that my my sister needs a new car who's this falling apart would you please make sure she gets a really good car and then you end up getting one you're not even sure why it happened probably your family member asking jesus wow that's really good well that's that brings me into our last question we're looking at the time here but when you get to heaven and this one has been asked several times people have calculated they're probably going to be billions of us with the lord we're all eternity and how are we how am i going to get to know jesus personally when there's billions of us uh talk about your ability to make personal connection with the with the lord whenever you want to or only from time to time or however that works i'm so i'm pretty sure it's whenever you want to one of the things you get with your mansion because if you didn't know this already jesus adores flowers he thinks besides us it's one of the greatest things he made he loves flowers he was called the lily of the valley the rose of sharon he was uh was the garden of eden that he created to put adam in him it was a garden tomb he was buried in he loves flowers and so um uh absolutely people would actually in heaven they bring flowers up and even on on the throne room step so he still has things that he loves and that that are favorites to him so i'm trying to remember what the question was well basically when he can if he can be everywhere at once here and he can be everywhere once all the more in heaven and anyway the secret garden you get next to your mountain ninja he gives he personally gives you a key to that garden it's yours anytime you want to be with him one of the ways you can is you go in the garden and he comes really every time he comes and you're right he can be because even now he can be everywhere all the same time uh he can do the same thing in heaven no one's left out but there are times when he is like in a group of people or walking through heaven especially people who just newly arrived he will go right through the people who are part like the red sea and they already know what's going to happen you go right up to that brand new person and personally welcome them to heaven and then he steps inside them and turns around and looks through your eyes and you feel so different about everyone who is in heaven you love everybody in heaven because you're looking through and learning his own eyes and then he steps out you're never the same so yes you can develop a greater closer relationship with jesus christ when you get to heaven with the father the same thing there's ways you can be alone with him even holy spirit and so he's they're not going to separate they're not so high up that you can't be with them their whole desire is to be with you that's so so so good okay man we could talk for a couple more hours like we did that time on the cruise we went for four hours i think with all these questions but thank you so much i think we're scheduled definitely next wednesday but if we get we get you before then we may try for that too but whatever works out but i encourage you all to write new questions that have not been asked and put them there we'll try and find ones that the most people are asking and then we'll ask Kat not always once a while there's one that's so good i just have to ask you know one lady i'll just ask this is like this one wasn't a question that everybody was asking it was a question that this lady wanted to know is snow different colors in case there we go taffy colors no different colors of snow in heaven yes absolutely one of the things that is very different about heaven is because the father the rainbow flows from him ways of it go all over heaven sometimes they'll pass through your own mansion and everything in there turns the colors of the rainbow but there is a place in heaven called christmas town why is it there because nicholas who actually was a real person who lived on the earth who gave gifts to children i believe he lived in turkey he was actually a prophet in his day that defended the name of jesus christ and that's what he did just for fun and so that was his gift remember so christmas time because he grew up and nick lived in the snow we love that whole area so there's a place in heaven that it snows all the time you can't frost by it you can't you know but of course the temperature is totally different it's cold but you're not freezing there is snow and yes there's different places that have rainbow snow or blue snow green and kids love to make snowballs and thumb they still do all that they can ice skate they go for for sleigh rides and this is the thing that's a little bit different everything in heaven is alive even the buildings in the river and the trees but the snow is alive so about heaven and creativity in life what you build out of that snow like a snowman it would come to life and so heaven is the most amazing beautiful place that God has ever made and it's for us to enjoy when we go there thank you wow that's amazing this is really rich today i can learn a lot of new stuff today so Kat thank you so much God bless you for taking the time just tell us about heaven you know somebody have gone and they come back and say well it's too personal i don't want to share it and i'm thinking well thank God Kat came to share because you know um it's my commission my commission i'm caught up and shown so that i will share the show that's so wonderful well thank you again kat and uh so i always forget to check into our guests for tomorrow my apologies but we have a great guest tomorrow you always do and what we do we will be seeing you on about 24 hours thanks again kat stay awesome to being your husband and we'll see you again soon thanks everybody

well good morning for the great state of oregon usa this is steve schultz with the elijah list we sponsor elijah's streams which is our video our non-profit uh wing of of the elijah list and we are now in year 23 of bringing you the voices of the prophet so we're connecting you every day by email so you can always go to elijahs.com right there on the screen subscribe to our free email it's always for free we do take donations into the ministry but uh we never charge you to get on the list at all uh and then uh i think we're gonna just jump right on because we're we're happy this time we've only been having Kat on wednesday lately but we got her today on friday as well so really excited about that we're going to talk about the elections and lots of questions about heaven so without further ado let's bring kat in here and here she is how are you doing kat hi i'm great that's good some people have made me know uh we can see you but you cannot see us so once in a while if i'm inserting your question i might accidentally interrupt you because you can't see me open my mouth so yeah i hope you're fine i want to ask well let's ask about the election and then we'll get right into the questions um however long what kind of things is the lord showing you about the election well you know the one thing i have learned about God is that when he makes a decision about something and of course we all know he's been from the beginning to the end in the end to the beginning he has been through all of this already he's seen all this he knows what's going to happen and so when he speaks directly about certain specific times or events or or things going on that's very powerful that he has blessed us to let us know this is what will happen these are my plans regardless of what you see or what you hear this is what's going to happen and he has clearly said over and over again that trump would win now uh in this time he will sit as president for the next four years he never changed that and yet here comes the virus you know here comes this vaccine thing that everybody's talking about here comes the left it looks like they're winning like you know a house on fire when all along of course we know what they did and so does most people already know that there was cheating and fraud done and all that and God also said on november 4th he said these words before any of this stuff happened that we knew about it he said that when the ground begins to shake the great landslide will begin which will be exposure of the fraud the lying the cheating the stealing in the election and he said it will be done and justice will be given so that doesn't mean no one's going to get away with it it doesn't mean no matter what they have paid they probably paid hundreds of billions of dollars out of money from these rich wealthy people who who hate God and hate most people so that the left would win they all knew this those who were involved in they know what they did but they're acting like nothing happened because they're hoping we'll give up well guess what we aren't giving up and neither is God he clearly said to you you believers out there this is gonna be okay trump is gonna win and they will all be exposed and the exposure is crazy right now it has not stopped they are coming up and they have more places that had cameras that showed people bringing suitcases in the post office i don't know which one uh when they shut down and said no more counting tonight they slid them out they already had them prepared these were fake ballots made up for for biden and they also at that time stole some that were actually trump's and they did this undercover they thought they didn't know that they were already being filmed and not only that people in these places who worked in these places have already whistleblowers are coming up from everywhere because they know even though the the head of the left because the head of the democrats are ignoring what's going on or they're hoping it won't really happen but the people who were involved in doing some of the crimes are not coming forward and confessing so they already have all this let me tell you there's things going on that's so shocking they haven't told anybody yet but they have the evidence so you are not here to be filled with fear about anything if you're a believer God did not give you a spirit of fear so why are you afraid but he has given you listen to this spirit of what is the first thing power did you know you have power over all the plans of the enemy and all the darkness around you use you do not tolerate that stuff you don't tolerate fear or confusion or any of it you kick it out of your soul kick it out of your home this is a time for celebration because if the God of heaven on earth saying this is what will happen and he said before it was known you can take that to the bank no matter what you've gone through what you think you're gonna go through don't let your mind run wild with the thoughts of the enemy or any of the other lies that are still being put out there and let me just add this the vaccine will not kill you and God just added he said tell him it won't kill him because it's going to take like i don't want to take that but the fear is still come to the end means running wild we just had a call from somebody saying i don't want to take that vaccine it's going to kill me there's going to be trackers in it they can trace wherever i go my dna will change none of that is true the people who adamantly are trying to work on a good vaccine are not people from china they're not people that want to have our destruction they sincerely want to help us and it's already been tested by hundreds and hundreds of people so i would say this if it is your choice to take it take it i don't need it i don't want it okay but i can just tell you this they're afraid that the whole the whole world's going to go to nothing and everyone will be destroyed i went okay so God's plan is to make us great in this day have those some of the best inventions ever given we're going to be accelerated in this country to be examples of God and life with God and so these are powerful amazing days we haven't even started manifesting we're not even doing the works alone the greater works and yet in this time frame of the next 24 years that God has got powerful plans to set us up guess what for the next 100 years so you're not all gonna go die run go live in the hills to escape something horrific these are the days of his son's power and you need to say that anytime a thought comes you say no i'm not tolerating thoughts from the enemy these are great days to be alive these are the days of his son power these are not the days of his wrath and so you're in God's hands so you have no more fear there that's my statement about me there you go that's awesome victory rally trump is planning a victory rally i won't tell you any more about that well he was doing something in atlanta is that today or is trump going to atlanta it was one of those places will be there first and then trump will join i'm not sure what point people join but i believe pence is already there and uh i'm just saying you you will be so delighted these really are days and i would just say what God says celebrate and eat cake right there there's your tradition today celebrate and eat cake people that's good that's very good well let's jump into some questions about heaven for those of you that are brand new Kat has been to heaven you said you stopped counting it a thousand times i asked you off camera today me this is the only question i prepared you for the rest of them you don't know what's coming i said people keep asking me how often you go to heaven and use your answer surprise don't tell people what you just told me yeah it's a lifestyle because he chose i have a commission he literally in person gave me a commission jesus christ did to go on tours of heaven whenever he and the father felt like doing it so that i could share it with you all on the earth to give you hope to give you joy that death would have no sting that you actually will know about the place that your loved ones have gone and are living with having a real life there and so at any moment there is no time in the spirit realm so he could take me ten times a day and it would be like here but he could show me many different things and that includes taking me back to the past or into the future or in heaven right now with everything that's going on sometimes just to show me what they're doing in heaven but many times is to see from heaven's viewpoint what God is doing on the earth and so there is no time frame anymore it used to be in the beginning he would take me at least once a week then it was several days a week then i got where he was taking me all the time and then sometimes in the day sometimes at night i don't dream so i never go in a dream i don't have visions i have encounters that's in real time actually in heaven or him here on the earth and i'm a revelator that's what he calls me that i have a commission to reveal heaven to earth well ken are you sometimes in conversation with somebody and you're gone and you come back and finish the the sentence is it can it happen that fast it has happened it's actually happened with me sitting on the front row and some church somewhere waiting to speak and he'll catch me right up uh and show me things in heaven and then put me right back right back on my body and then i'll get up there and share what just happened to me so it has happened it has happened before that's good well i have a bunch you can't see it but there's a lot of things here there's there's a lot and i try to ask questions that people are asking the most times that have not been added but some of them are are even i would use the term cute because i'm going to ask you about clothing in heaven that's the one sun that happens to be on the top of my list here and a bunch of people keep asking what do we wear some of them are asking do we wear period clothing do people wear their 1800s clothing do people wear their native american clothing and then this 12 year old caitlyn wants to know can i wear sweatpants in heaven there you go um i will let you know that's all about comfort girl i understand that i love to be comfortable most of the stuff i wear not you know not on the platform or not in front of the camera i love baggy warm fuzzy things so i understand about the sweatpants and i'm sure somewhere in heaven they have them because i do know this it sounds crazy i've seen people in blue jeans heaven has their own brand of blue jeans so we're not going to get rid of those people and tunic tops and pants most of them match beautifully some have designs some have things this sounds wild doesn't it some have music coming from them uh some of them change colors because somebody can't make up their mind what color they want to wear and that's the truth two minutes for those people can't do that so every kind of time the one thing that's not there is okay number one you're not going to be naked scratch it off the list because yes i've had people having that no this is not the garden of eden okay people like ride roller coasters that would be very uncomfortable because you're in a your spiritual body but it's a literal body in a spiritual world and it would be very uncomfortable to do some of the things that we get to do there if you had no clothing on so no nobody runs around like that you know um like i said it's not the garden of eden and they have you have in your mansion you have a room probably maybe two thousand square foot room that has your apparel in it and all the assessments and all the stuff that goes with that everybody has a staff in heaven that's one of the reasons why i really i have five yeah i have like five here that i've got you know used for different things uh most of the people in the old testament always had a staff now i think it was that a necessity in the new testament a lot of people use them when they even go hiking or walking now but i use mine for spiritual reasons not sometimes when i'm declared for something like if it's ruling and raining i have one as a crown on it if it's something like just uh coming against the enemy i have something else for that if it's declaring and decreeing things and new regions so get a step get a step okay let me stop talking while you're taking that drink it was interesting because this morning in prayer i was talking to the lord and i i said lord i'm sorry to the father because you've been really painting a picture of a loving father and i'm saying father do you use sometimes blue jeans in heaven and he started laughing and he said i've appeared many times in blue jeans on this earth does that sound about right it does it does so there's many things there's also beautiful things like they have huge events where everybody you just like a king you know uh or well just for this just for the sake of it i will say a queen they don't really have queens in heaven we're kings lords and priests and that's another female but you'd wear things that are so beautiful beyond description and a lot of these have gemstones that came from the heart of the father himself gifts in heaven and he puts them like on your robe your robe of righteousness so everybody's always running around in heaven to see who's wearing what that doesn't take away from the holiness of the awe of God he wants us to be like little children and he gets excited when we get excited not just in heaven but even on the earth that's so good kat and then they're actually on my list these are quite in random order people keep trying to get triangulate on your answer because you've shown them 100 years in the future and they're saying some prophets are talking about times are wrapping up and they're they keep quoting matthew 24 which says this generation will not pass they connect it to israel and they're saying therefore it has to be this generation and that's only already been a generation and you have that same matthew and this is just me talking about that same matthew 24 says this gospel of the kingdom must be preached in the whole earth and then the end will come how do why do they look at that other part because number ones people just want it to be over and they want to escape and yet God has a timeline and i can tell you we've got quite a bit of time left on that timeline but he actually gave me um revelation on that scripture it also talks about that stuff in mark 16 when the disciples are asking him when he said you know these different things will be happening they say well when will the end come when will we know when the end will come and that's when he gives that you know that famous word that says there'll be wars and rumors of wars and uh uh you know the people will rise against the other land against land and i'm trying to remember the other thing it said oh kingdom against kingdom right and then he goes on to say all these other things and he says but the end is not yet even he told the disciples the end is not yet but that scripture that says this generation that word generation that says this generation shall not pass away into all these things be fulfilled i know about that scripture and he said to me that word generation is the key that word generation in that scripture means a group and type of people it doesn't mean a time span but everybody looks at a word in our natural head you think you've got that figured out well that means 20 years that means 30 years no no there's different things he says throughout the bible that you would think mean one thing like the violent take by force that doesn't mean you're being violent that doesn't mean that the word suffers means more than one thing in the bible the word suffers could mean suffering but also means um uh suffer the little children to come unto me come unto me call them to come unto me so you see what i mean the same thing with generation the word generation can mean a grouping type of people it can mean a time span or it can mean an age it's actually sometimes that gender or generation means an age a group and type of people or just the regular time span that you would call a generation but that one in that scripture this generation this group and type of people uh will be here on their weather on the earth the end cannot happen and let me tell you the more powerful we become in him as these generations go by we need to get that place where we speak to the mountain and it jumps into the sea we need to get to the place we speak to the land the sea in the air and it gets healed those are the manifested sons and daughters they're just now and i mean just now about to to begin to appear on the earth and i say that because people will know and see these things that they'll be doing it'd be wild beyond your imagination the authority that God has given us but when we step into that it depends on our lifestyle it depends on our relationship with the father with the son and holy spirit some people are called and appointed to do that so he's not ending this world before God he's not ending this world before it's done and even even after the whole tribulation by the way that is seven years i will say that again it is seven year time span not in your lifespan no one alive unless God keeps you here will be here you'll already be in heaven and until we the body that's operating such power and authority pushing back darkness and and ruling and reigning the spirit realm until we are removed the antichrist can not appear why nobody would need him nobody would want him the reason he gets to appear is because there's great devastation at that time in the tribulation and there is no one to rescue the people at that time and i firmly believe that the body of christ will not be on the earth when that happens unless there's people who get saved during that time and so your your your assignment anyone who's hearing this your assignment is not to plan the end your assignment is to take dominion use the authority christ gave you help to shift things in these nations and be great for God he didn't call you for that he didn't call you to be here during the tribulation or the perilous times because the day of his son's power has to happen the manifested sons and daughters have to happen the wealth of the wicked has to be given to the justin the righteous all these things have to happen and it's going to take generations for all this to work itself out that's good so don't be afraid of anything you're here on the earth for now because this is an important time it's a great time it is a time to celebrate that's good well i have this next question in my stack here is a question about women it's not really about heaven but i thought i would go ahead and ask it because i've never heard you address it that i know of because i'm a woman who grew up in leadership but after marriage and attending church we currently go to there seems to be no place for women in leadership or the five folk is there insight from Kat about how to understand apostle paul's teaching about women authority and leadership within the body of christ i would appreciate it yeah well i always love to be asked the one question there's people that say that i have no right to speak on a platform or say anything on a platform and i go well number one you do not understand the scripture that says women should remain silent in the church many times again because of head knowledge for man i i live by revelation what the father says and shows me is what i speak about and one of the scriptures he gave me was that scripture where paul was saying those things well back in the day when paul was here okay in the temple the women were always made to sit in the very back and i know orthodox jews and they all confirmed this they sat way in the back not up front only the men were allowed to sit up in front in and they still uh the men of course have the say even now in the jewish household it's just the way it was ordered by them and uh and so what would happen was the priest who was speaking that day in the temple the the women couldn't hear them they were way in the back with all these children they didn't have children's church back then people and so they would yell to their husbands this is actually what they did jaime what did he say and then you do 30 40 women yelling that won't you say i can't hear him could he say something louder and so that is why paul said women should remain silent in the church it was about the culture of the day it was not God saying from heaven women have no right to say anything he wasn't saying that so man took that saying what was said to spoken about the women and turned it into a law okay that is not true that is not what that meant it was talking about the culture of the day and many times if you would check out the culture even in some of these scriptures in the old testament like things in leviticus that were said and other things you would realize that is addressing the culture of that day so they wanted the women to be quiet and they say speak to your husband after you get back home that should have given you a clue they weren't up there trying to take the microphone and say anything they were trying to find out what the priest was saying that their husbands could hear and so that changes the whole outlook on that one thing that people have used to beat women up over the head and yet you look at how powerful the women were in jesus day there were more women that followed him and ministered around him all the time i know he had his 12 disciples i'm not saying that they're not important but you know what the women did all the supplying of things and helping and did that type of thing and yet jesus said the best place to have isn't necessarily serving anything is to sit at his feet and listen so mostly women can't have authority and yet God says we women and men are kings and priests unto unto their God i think as uh at least as many prophets or providences if you will uh are in our stream the elijah streams elijah list and so it's not an issue with us but this woman's talking about what her church they have they seem to have no place do you recommend for women they say well my church doesn't allow anything like that do you recommend a change or what do you say to somebody like that tell people this if God sent you there if he's if you if you heard him say to you i am sending you to let's just say for instance i'm sending you to the leesburg assembly you will go there and serve and you will love people and you'll have a position like maybe an intercession or something like that and i'll have you there for a season now if God just sent you there you may have difficult things understanding just keep praying and interceding because eventually he will put you where you can really grow and prosper and use your gifts some churches are still stuck in the idea that women don't have gifts to offer except for maybe children's church or maybe praying and yet there's some of the great in the body and the spirit some of the greatest most powerful leaders we've had in the spirit so i would i would say this if he didn't send you there and you chose there then pray and ask for a place look just check them out make sure that they're you know not freely sinning because that does happen in a lot of places now and they actually preach that find the place that preaches the whole council of God lets you use your gift recognizes that God has put something in you that can be used and given but also make sure that you're willing to be under authority before you can be in authority that's good we all have and men have to do that too man we have to be under authority before we're in authority as well so it's not like a special requirement for women we had to all be under authority you know and God can't trust any of us if we had not first sat under authority it's just the way it is and some people think well my gift is so good i'm gonna go bless them at this church with my powerful gift and they want to get up and prophesy over people and everything i've had this has happened trust me and the pastor would come and say i'm sorry but at this time we don't really know you we don't know your heart so we'll let you work over here for a while and you can just be under and we'll observe you and see how you do and then the twist come we'll probably extend that to you and some will walk out the door and say i'm sorry my gift is too important well you know it doesn't take he doesn't take your free will i mean you can do do whatever you choose you have to be willing to pay the consequence if God didn't say you know i'm i'm releasing you or something i'm i'm not one that ever tells people you can't leave but you should know if if you have peace from the lord to leave it's not just the act of the will uh okay here's a question that's come up a couple of times even on the same day somebody was writing about being single and they're asking about is there a special let me just read it are there any blessings in heaven for those who are single and to remain virgins before they went to heaven i have a lot of godly friends all in their 50s we are all in that category so i was curious i feel singles are really forgotten and marginalized in quote unquote church today but i don't think they were historically marginalized what would you say about that i guess it's a question if there's a blessing in heaven for that i don't know that there's a blessing unless God asked you to remain that way i think that's your voice and if that gives you peace and that's where God's got you this is it you have a lot more time to spend with jesus i'm telling you i always thought my whole life i wouldn't marry i just wanted to be alone with jesus and he laughed every time i said that so i'm just going to tell you if he's if he laughs at you that means maybe you're not on the right track but he adamantly would ignore it every time i said you know i helped to raise 12 of my siblings that and when i when i grew up i'm just going to have a really a really nice apartment with me father son and holy spirit i'm going to work in big business and those were my plans and half of those plans were Gods but God would laugh every time i said those words and and then finally came the day when he said no you are marrying this person i have chosen for you before i sent you and i need holy seed in the earth so you're marrying and even though it wasn't a burden but be open to what God is saying and there are some that he has reserved to just give themselves to him but as far as it being uh like a special gift for remaining celibate i don't know if that exists in heaven i know this you gonna care about any kind of rewards a special thing anything you are so undone about being in the presence of the father and jesus christ and holy spirit you'll be like a kid you'd be so excited about being there but you won't escape getting rewarded i can tell you what God says even in this day for all those who've been faithful and stood in the gap and not given up and well you know it's okay if you fall down just get back up don't give up God says this to you you've gone too far you can't go back it's too late to escape and great that word is for everyone a believer let's see how um people let's see how do i want to ask this um i'm going to put it combined a couple of questions into one question because there's several have asked it so rather than read one they're asking if somebody barely made it to heaven by the skin of their teeth he is expression i like the thief on the cross at the last possible second when they were on their deathbed they received christ they went to heaven do they receive less rewards do they have a lesser of a mansion and they're wanting to just know about that i i will address one thing first as i just said there are people that get out of transports when you arrive to heaven you're taking in a transport many different ways sometimes just a delight for you sometimes christ picks you up in his own chariot sometimes you go in these little old looking biplanes or you going like rocket ships because God knows you would love to have that experience but when you get out there's a place you disembark that's outside the gate it's a beautiful place and people literally saw them get out and kiss the ground and i'm not making that up i am not saying that there are some that kiss the ground of heaven because they go everything i really my mother you know thank God i made that choice at that very second so there's always people like that but no matter what you end up with and there will be people so highly honored like intercessors who prayed in their closet four moves of God you know gave things help people everyday their life gave their own food away and stuff like that uh and that happened a lot in the past right now it's more about giving part of your life like words of hope and stuff like that it's more like that's important to say things to encourage people and give them hope but it is true that your rewards won't be the same they couldn't be now i do know that he gives the same love no one is kept from being at the throne of God and i've heard people say before i've heard people say oh you're kept in dog pens you get little hobbles no one's allowed i've heard them now it's not saying that happened that's what they believe right right there's levels you have to go through before you can even approach God that is not so if you receive christ no matter how rotten you were in your life you receive christ you get in those gates you're in heaven you may see the father any time you want to you are still concerned with this passion is love you are delighted everywhere you go in heaven because people really love you and care about you but i actually was taken and shown this one person my sister-in-law who works with me i saw her ex-husband as he died i saw he i by the way my brother and my sister-in-law prayed with him right before he died he received christ right at the last moment and i saw him in heaven and his mansion was this huge a beautiful beautiful a frame like four stories high right on the crystal sea where the forest are and uh i didn't know anything about him and he was like fishing i saw this dog that was like speckled color and i heard him call that dog pepper this person didn't see me so i saw all these details about this life he he was so overwhelmed and overjoyed with the love of God that he gave him such a place now let me you can imagine some mansions for people who really serve God or love people it could be the size of new york city one mansion wow so this person of course didn't get something that was like a king or whatever but they were grateful they were filled with joy that God blessed them and they loved it and i found out later from from from margaret that he loved to fish that he had a pet dog named pepper so how about that i didn't know that and so i was explaining what he looked like the things i heard him saying about uh thank God people were praying for me thank God that for the blood of christ that i am here so but it is true the more that you don't work to get to heaven but what you do with him in your life you are absolutely getting rewarded uh you will get rewarded and uh but everyone has access to jesus christ everyone has access to the father and the holy spirit is just everywhere in heaven that's so good well here's a question maybe this one and one more question for today a couple people have asked this so i'm going to kind of paraphrase both of them well here's what about barren women although i work with children and it's a comfort due to circumstances i was unable to adopt the children i always hoped for my husband and i have been married for many years and have tried with doctor's health to have children i have believed for healing but it never happened the grief is so deep on many levels those who have lost babies have them waiting for them in heaven but i have no babies waiting for me i feel forgotten and then she goes on to say and another one asks and they're kind of they're blending them together they want to know if God would allow them to go to heaven and adopt one of the babies that didn't have parents coming or raised one of the babies that's an interesting question i never heard it even asked there is absolutely a place in heaven and i was taken there and they call it the reserve and it's millions of babies you can go there you absolutely can adopt one in heaven really like it's your own yes you can do that and God because there's some unfortunately in some nations there are some that the the the adults just don't make it for what they believed there they never had an encounter with uh with even the gospel that's why it's so important why he says until it's preaching to all the earth the end will not come i understand that because there are people especially from the past times now a baby could have been aborted or whatever like 50 100 years ago on the earth but those little babies would still be little babies and so he has this beautiful place all the babies play and they laugh they know one day that they will have a parent because you have to remember they're aware that they didn't have a parent when they got there they knew that their parents weren't going to come but there's no grief in heaven so yes if you want eight you get my blessing i'm going to choose how those ain't when you get there it's absolutely possible for you to to have babies and children to adopt them in heaven wow okay well let me ask this uh let's do this last one this is a little bit for fun i have no idea how you would answer this i kind of suspect that i do but we talked about your pets going to heaven and adam's going to have it i think uh so one person want to know if there's dinosaurs in heaven because they go and the other person wants to know what if what about those animals that were sacrificed for their food and for the sake do they get to go to heaven those same animals now how about that that is another person who's really hearing holy spirit so um and i could include several different instances like especially those but uh i'll just add this for free i know you're talking about food animals that are killed for you to have food on the earth right now what about them another instance is those who were sacrificed at the temple uh and back in the day you know when the jews did that when they did the sacrifices what about them they were innocent and those all of them are in heaven all of them are in heaven and i i found this out just a while back but i didn't really tell people that all those animals that you've been eating they all do have uh they all all those creatures have a soul they have a spirit they all went to heaven it was like they were of maybe against their will being given their life for us to have a sustenance on the earth and so yes they do go to heaven and sometimes i feel like they go to your mansion if there was one whole animal that probably gave its life for you and you ate that i keep telling people you're going to be surprised how many cows and chickens and other things it's funny to laugh but this is gonna have a lot of turkeys and chickens in my place there'll be a lot of turkeys roaming around i didn't think about the turkey that's funny that's that one's really fun so um anyway um not the only that's good well okay well let me ask one last one here um uh there was a man he wrote you don't have to use the turkey thing because everybody has a turkey you know or whatever so get ready to have it there's a christmas song that goes there's that christmas song that goes everybody knows that turkey and i always think i know a few turkeys and some mistletoe sorry okay now this person this one actually is a pretty serious question and we'll end on that and hopefully i don't know how you would answer this because he was uh compassionate but you could tell he was having a desperately hard time for decades with this issue of being encouraged so he was sort of like incorrigible he was uh he could not find a way to be encouraged if he got to heaven and so loved ones and he found out when he got there that some loved ones didn't make it and they went to hell he said i cannot fathom how i could enjoy heaven knowing that they went to hell do you have anything on that i absolutely do have something on that and it's all about their will uh on the earth your whole focus is normally as a believer to get your family members born again to get them into heaven and they probably had many many many many many many many chances to receive christ the thing is this that i tell people that if you prayed for them if you prayed God i pray that they will come to know you that they'll be in heaven with me God uh that you you know it says in the bible that you shall eat the fruit of your lips it says if you say something believe in your heart um and don't doubt that it shall come to pass there's several scriptures that are really decorations for standing that this is what happens at the very moment of their death jesus christ will present himself to them or he would be unjust for all the words you declared over them and a lot of them will be there if you prayed for them so you we have prom we have a promise given to us by God because we serve him we love him we belong to christ we do have promises for us and our family and loved ones but the other thing is this if you absolutely knew when you got there number one your focus in your life in heaven is definitely jesus christ all of your family members even though you love them you will not have the same kind of love that you have for christ so i know you don't understand that unless you were there which is why most people when they get there don't want to come back it's not they don't love you is that that passion they have for him is so great he is their life he becomes their life although you have all of having to do things christ is is it in heaven the other thing you have a great understanding of is that they had a choice it wasn't like they didn't get a choice and you understand the acts of somebody's will unfortunately most people when you get to heaven you understand that that grief isn't there there is no grief in heaven and again i will jump to another scripture because people always say well what about this one that talks about the tears when when he will wipe away the tears now that's about the judgment seat of christ no one's asked me yet that is not about you'll be sad and devastated that family members aren't there that grief is consumed up in christ's love you're not going to mope around heaven suffering in agony and grief because somebody didn't make it and there will come a point in your own existence when he said he will wipe away all tears and the former things will be remembered no more at that point in heaven you will not remember them and i know you might think that's harsh it's just the way God designed it but by this time you will have been so consumed by understanding the father his just his mercy and his grace but there will come a point that you won't remember those people who didn't make it and that's God's mercy for you but when you first get there i'm sure that there'll be times where they might come to your mind but right there along with those thoughts are the comfort and the joy of the lord so i know in your human understanding and in this physical heart i understand what you're saying but you don't understand about being there and how different it is with the love of God there so you need to be comforted now you will not be in torment nor in grief over over anything when you get to heaven but keep praying that's good that's really good and i i think we'll need to be hearing over the years more and more teaching that we should be praying our loved ones into heaven now absolutely yeah because God like you said God would be unjust if he didn't make every attempt to answer that prayer you know do not let this person be lost we pray that for our kids you know to be saved in christ we believe they all are but you know uh even if they walk away we're not gonna just quit praying even if they were to walk away we keep declaring and decreeing that they would be with the lord that's right no matter what they say to you now they may be adamant about not caring they don't want God they hate him they can say all they want to they're still being influenced by the enemy that doesn't mean that God won't find a way to get to them and this is the greatest part you may not even know they did it before they pass when you get there and that's one of the first things jesus told me that people some will be shocked to see that their family member made it although they were the ones who stood in the gap and prayed for them and therefore jesus won't be unjust you must remember he has the keys we'll talk about that another time of hell death in the grave and what our words say and how we make a stand makes a big difference your faith and your in your belief for that and trusting God for that most all of your family members probably all of them will get to heaven as long as you've declared over them now when you declare them like father i declare that they'll come to know jesus christ i declare that they will be with me in eternity and they will become the living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ i declare that in jesus name amen that right there is one of the things the holy spirit taught me to say over my own loved ones you have to really mean it when you say that but then he said then you can't go around talking bad about them so if you've done that make sure you nullify all the words you spoke seriously say i choose my will to nullify all the negative words even though they write judgmental critical words i will not have those words remain that i spoke against my family member because i'm making a stand for their salvation so good wow this is good i know a lot of people are going to really really be encouraged with today's show wow what a broadcast kat thank you again thank you so so much tell people again how they can get your books on revealing heaven and other stuff any of my products we

well good morning for the great state of oregon i'm steve schultz with the elijah list founder and president ceo chief bottle washer all that with the elijah list and the elijah list has been 23 years in the making we've been here online or by mostly written form and then the last few years we've done the video um and tv so we are the the television portion of what we're doing what you're watching is called elijah's stream so we're keeping it in the elijah family the elijah list family and we're going to have Kat here in just a minute before we bring kat Kerr back on um i want to remind people several things first of all be sure to subscribe to our youtube youtube channel we like youtube we like what they do for us but we also know that uh they could squash this at any time and decide that we're not living up to their expectations they can take us off the air so if that should happen uh go to elijah list.com the there's there's the button right there go to elijah.com you should do that anyway and subscribe to the elijah list if you have not subscribed so that we can always contact you if the channel changes or if we have to go on another network um beyond that going to elijah you may some of you may or may not remember this but if we were to get kicked off for any reason at all hopefully we won't go to rumble rumble.com r-u-m-b-l-e like a bumblebee only to rumble so all right well without further ado let's bring Kat Kerr here and here she is hey kat how are you i'm doing great thanks you're looking chipper there in jacksonville florida right and this is your home studio is that right yes it is and the weather is beautiful outside that's good it's not too bad out here too it's a little nippy in the northwest but the sun is partially up so well Kat let's jump right in we'll do some things as it relates to the election and we'll talk about that for a few minutes and get an update and after that we'll go back into more questions about heaven but this is uh some people think this is a very important critical uh drop dead deadline type date where the electoral college meets and votes what are your thoughts on that whole thing happening today of course because we live in a physical world that has its own government and the way things are run in our country they're going to follow that you know of course as being normal but we have something added to our lives we have the supernatural added to our lives because there may be the supreme court but we actually believe in and know the supreme God and he's going to have his way in this in this time and in this election so of course we will see what they come up with and of course it's always wise to pray that God's will be done and that you know the holy spirit move upon that whole bunch which you know he can do that's what he does best and so i i'm excited to see what you come up with but i'm more excited about what God is saying and i know there's days and processes we have to have but God goes beyond that and he always has in the bible in the old testament in the new testament and even today he does things that changes everything whatever that's going to be i will assure everybody no matter what the outcome of that electoral vote God is still saying to me trump will sit in the white house for the next four years and of course he is never wrong i do want to say that i admire everyone the moral majority here in america that has stood for what is right who want justice liberty and freedom and you have been showing up it has just been crazy that tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of people that have been flooding washington dc to make a stand for trump and not just there but in many states across our nation and this is even wilder there have been meetings and groups and rallies and other countries who aren't even americans who are rallying for our president many of them are praying and declaring over over america God will have his way and that is exactly what will happen so we'll see what happens and you know i know people have already made comments well you know they've already thrown such and sex out of court that doesn't matter to God i can tell you right now this is his time on earth beginning a divine decade and he's going to put in that office and it will be also it is the will of the people the people we the people are standing up and saying what they want and i'm actually blessed that they're doing it denominations for the first time in existence of this world are coming together laying down the differences the body of christ is joining together to rally around our president and of course what america stands for God made this country and he's still involved in this country so we'll just see that's what i always say that's my statement yeah that sounds good now God says i go what God says and what he has shown and many of you also understand this is a time to not move what you believe for stand and stand therefore and see the hand of our God now one of the most common see people have talked about the lazarus was dead story the abraham and his son isaac story the the esther and mordecai story but the single most common one that i've been seeing both in this format that we're in the video format and in written form is people keep talking about coming up against the red sea and the red sea the only way out is the red sea has to part are you getting that kind of revelation too oh absolutely actually God has taken me back and show me exactly when that happened and if you look at what was coming against the jews okay for the first time they were tasting freedom remember that they had been let go pharaoh had decided to let them go so they were already leaving in freedom and taking great wealth with them as they went and they were all excited here they are marching right and here's moses God's man of the hour and he's got his staff and here they come up against the red sea well that was enough right just to see the red sea right there okay they can't swim across you can't get several million people by the way is how many were crossing with him that how is that even possible to do that and then behind them all of a sudden pharaohs change his mind here comes the army here comes the pharaoh's army coming at me and they are determined that they're either going to get them back or wipe them out this is they've already got this obstacle they got the one in front of them the red sea and then here they got pharaoh's army chasing them and yet when moses stepped out and they stayed in faith when he stepped out with that staff that red sea parted even beyond the time they thought when there was no time left this is what you got to remember there was no time left to do anything not in the natural so here i'm at here comes the supernatural hand of God move that red sea parted and they walked across on dry land people it wasn't mucky there was no water the walls of water actually stood up by their self they're all trying to figure out in their head how this could happen it was God and so here they are now rejoicing here's victory for them they're crossing over on the dry land and here comes pharaoh's army not giving up so here it comes again you see the enemy will try to stop you and put fear in you all along the time that you're standing to see the hand of God move to have that victory and justice that we want they want they wanted it to and all of a sudden the last one gets across and again the hand of God moves and here comes the water crashing down on the entire egyptian army they're all drowned there's no way they can do any harm to them and of course it's never a good thing that people have to give their lives or die but wicked people to pursuing to take them back or to kill them their heart was to destroy or retrieve them and so they're the ones who lost the darkness lost here's the light here's the darkness they stood and waited on God he moved his hand they got across he moved his hand and he did away with their enemy so i can tell you this is exactly where we're at the same kind of scenario and they rejoiced and celebrated that God their God had delivered them and i can tell you in the end of all of this it's so important to pray to believe to care to declare and rejoice you must have victory in you that's called faith before you see it happen but we will see the hand of God moving all of this and in the end we will have victory trump will sit in the white house for four years like moses got across and the people all got across with him we will have justice in this entire situation so stay excited everybody that's good now Kat i've had a couple people that are not among our prophets i have many prophetic brands and prophets and and i sit on the acp roundtable and all that so i'm not talking about any of that but there was a a couple of gentlemen that i knew years ago and i looked at their sites just out of curiosity if i was a strong like you Kat i probably would say i don't even care what they say but i did look and i noticed that the accusations that's flying um if i can put it that way and i don't want to give it too much airplay but just they're saying you guys are all trying to make trump a messiah you're worshiping him like God you're trying to say he's your spiritual leader how would you respond to that claim i would say this God is the one who chose him above all the odds that were against him to ever be chosen as a republican representative to run for president okay from the beginning the enemy our enemy is satan but he uses people he uses people who are either deceived or just um or are actually just consumed by him to get his way and from the beginning he's tried to stop trump from being there but God has been with him and many of the prophets know he was not just chosen he was anointed and appointed by God to be president for eight years in this country so that God could turn this country around and in every way trump has never said he was their spiritual leader he himself honors God and he's even made the statement i am not God and i'm not getting into that so he looks up and he says to God i am definitely not you so he knows he's not God we know he's not but God he bonded our hearts together to stand behind someone who's never in the history of our country been so uh uh you know slammed and bashed and falsely accused and shredded over and over again with with the whole left being against him the media obviously has been against him and now others have joined that whole group don't ever join the side of darkness they will lose and so he has bonded our hearts to people but when he said they'd love him they never said they were worshiping him people when they find someone who's going to help to rescue them in this natural realm we need a leader who is strong who can't be bought who can't have fear put in them cannot be controlled and that's actually why God chose him as a great business person who would turn our economy around strengthen our army our military honor those who deserve to be honored care about every single group he loves america this is what God says he's an all-american boy who's all for america and so clearly God has chosen him he put up with all that stuff for the last four years and yet is still willing to go forward with the plan he has to make greater than before and God wants that so nobody's worshiping him we do honor his position which a lot of integrity and honor has been lost in the democratic party they chose that their integrity is just about shot and i'm telling you they do anything lie cheating steal i don't mind saying that because they do it and this is the thing we all know it the american people we the people know what happened they can't hide it they can't lie about it which makes us love president trump even more that's called honor in case you know what that was that's really really good well that's very very good now we will have you back on a wednesday uh of course we have a q a in a minute here but we'll have you back on so for those of you that wonder what what's the rest of the week i think tomorrow we'll have stephen uh springer and he's got some had some good revelatory dreams that some of us have even been praying into Kat will be back in on wednesday and i can't remember at the moment i think jeff johnson's back on thursday and i can't remember who's gonna pray so these are great great great people and by the way one last thing i our own breaking christian news i saw the headline today i didn't get a chance to read the article yet it said that uh the president melania trump gave a christmas message this morning and thanked God for sending his son jesus here so that that's he's not our spiritual leader but he is a spiritually minded president yes he doesn't love God he's a kind of maybe we might even say he's a baby christian but you know i i love baby christians you know their their their faith is simple it's not complex that's right and we don't have all the religious trappings with baby exactly i was going to say he has no religious baggage people that's so good well let's jump into some questions about heaven for those of you who may be new Kat's been to heaven more than a thousand times probably several thousand several people you know the apostle paul was caught up to the third heaven the scholars do believe it was him he was talking about and i now know nine or ten people who got caught up to heaven fairly regularly i think kat is probably the one that i know who goes the most often but she's agreed to answer questions about heaven and lord's shown her many things over the last at least 20 years right Kat yes yes so here's the first one from 11 year old i'm going to give you two gig and you told me once that she loved questions from you know teens and pre-teen kids here's one she wants to know if she can play video games in heaven and she wants to know if the if there are billions of people in heaven how will she find her friends well i'll answer the last one first when when is your time to go and to me it's always a celebration when family members have died of mine i have had a party and celebrated because i know that's what they're doing in heaven they will be waiting on her that's how she will find her friends they'll be waiting on you your family members are waiting at the gate your friends are waiting at the gate no matter how long it's been since you've seen them so that's one of her first answers the other one is this our God is the greatest creative being in existence he loves to create that's where all inventions it says every it says all the witty ideas they come from heaven they're sent down to this earth they go into the mind of man and whoever grabs that invention or idea and they put it out there first and they're the ones who have it and you better be ready for a flood of those to happen right after all this mess is over and trump has been inaugurated i will tell you this the ideas and inventions will multiply and increase and things we've never seen before in the earth so God's a creative God he makes fun places in heaven there's profound places in heaven there's awe and splendor and wonder in heaven you're overdone by the presence of God is with you everywhere you go you can actually go and see the father see the son or even see holy spirit when you get to heaven you're not kept from any of them okay if you were counted righteous and you are taken to heaven and that's where you're going to live you have access to him but the things you don't expect are the fun and adventure that's in heaven why would he not create them he can make anything that he wants to and as i just said the amusement parks and all the fun things on the earth those ideas came from heaven now whatever who gets that they could put defilement in it they could do things in those even in the movies hello there's movies in heaven where do you think that came from God loves to tell stories except those movies don't have to be rated there's nothing defiling in them there's no profane language but the most adventurous exciting things you've ever seen but the other things they do have an amusement park where the roller coaster goes up and leaps off the track goes across the sky it goes under the crystal sea so there's a lot of adventure and there are whole lands now we're not the person who said that is disneyland we have different we name places on the earth you know why God names places in heaven there's a passionate paradise where you find out about the love of God and the worship there is so phenomenal but there's cartoon village where you can go into this place in heaven and become a cartoon i hope i'm tweaking your head and there's a place called there's video land where you create exciting adventurous videos and then you get to be in the video you and your friends are going to be in that video so not only can she watch decent fun exciting intense amazing videos she can write them and be in them so all of that just to tell you that that there's God is not limited to his creativity and when he takes you home to heaven whatever your gift is whether it's like a builder a designer a worshiper an artist or maybe you have rodeos or you have antique car shows all of that is in heaven that's good always tells me it's 50 50 50 profound and awe you get so undone you just feel like you're just going to become one with God and you fall in love with him you fall in love with his son you fall in love with heaven it's your home it says your citizenship is in heaven and no one regrets who lives there ever going there wow now um okay boy this i'm going to jump towards another question that i have in this stack here i got a big stack here uh one of them i'm going to jump off on this from this because you want to know about video games and someone wanted to know i said i'm a programmer well they use programmers in heaven and you kind of almost touched on that just now they your gift is going to be used in heaven okay but it will all whatever it's used in uh because you live on this natural earth and you have your natural mind you're using right now you have to understand that God can make and create amazing things without any darkness involved in it if your gift is a programmer i promise you you will have your home mansion and all your property will be designed around your ability to program it's just that what you call software is something that's actually alive and i know that you to receive that but there's ways and things they can do in heaven you could never do on this earth you don't need wi-fi you don't need i forgot what even you call some things you don't need solar energy you don't need electricity you don't need any of that to design and create amazing things and because there is so much it's beyond technology i don't have a name for it but young can do things just like that and use that gift because that's why he made you that's so so so good um okay now i'm gonna uh on today i'm gonna only ask and ask one repeat question and then the rest of them are new questions this one keeps being asked with the new people that joined they haven't heard you answer this and it's been asked about 30 different ways so one of them today was i know a person that was a friend of mine and he accepted the lord and then he lost his mind and he ended up committing suicide is it possible he's in heaven or what about other people who committed suicide i'm going to let you answer that question again you know that answer is so important to the father he actually came to me when i was going to be writing my second book and he said i have to show you this so that you have a revelation and a great understanding of it and he said what if people are experiencing on the earth isn't always suicide although their life ends he said go first he had me go to the dictionary and sometimes he'll do that just go get the dictionary and look up the word suicide and you see what the what that meaning is and actually the dictionary says suicide is knowingly willingly in your right mind taking your own life and God said what people are actually doing is not ending their life they're wanting to end their suffering and he said that is not suicide he said if they're out of their mind if they have no control of their emotions other physical abilities of their mental abilities if they can't in their own mind see anything but ending that suffering then when they do that that's not suicide that doesn't even go along with the term suicide or the actual meaning of it they're not knowingly willingly intelligently doing anything they're not in the right mind they have no control or they are suffering in agony whether it's mental emotional or physical suffering beyond reason and cannot handle it they want to be with jesus and so they're ending their suffering they love their family they don't want to stop living they just can't stop that and he was very adamant he explained exactly how to talk about it and then after he did that he sent me guess what to pennsylvania was the first place that that revelation was released and several people in there had just lost their loved ones for the same reason and they were laughing and crying at the same time God said i would be unjust if i sent them to hell when they had not committed suicide a suicide bomber this is what he said a terrorist or a suicide bomber terrorist that is suicide they're in the right mind they willingly knowingly are going to end their life on purpose and many times it's to hurt somebody he said that's suicide these other people are ending their suffering and yes i will receive them in heaven and then he took me to heaven and showed me three he never stops with just a simple explanation with me i'm a detailed person so he gives me detail then he took me ahead hold on excuse me i gotta have a drink been chasing and yelling at having fun for my grandkids and a lot of them so it was a lot of fun anyway so he wanted to make sure i understood so he would tell me about a certain person and he would show me them in the spirit then he took me to heaven and showed me where they were living what they were doing things they were saying about the family members on earth how they they they really hoped that their family knew that they were in heaven and that God had been just and kind them one was the son of a well-known person i won't mention anybody's names but he had been in mental torment for months until he could no longer bear it and he was even a strong christian but if you've never been in that place of despair and you need to know this just because if you get upset and you don't do anything about getting rid of that you can go into oppression don't let oppression get a hold of you and in this day there's a lot of it oppression if not dealt with goes into depression if that is not dealt with it goes into despair and despair is what happens what people experience right before they they take their life if at any of those times that people can understand if they lose those thoughts from their soul they choose to lose it in jesus name and we've done this with people they never took their life it was gone like it never happened so God does have a way he wants us to live on this earth and be happy but those who do take their life because of the suffering this young man went to heaven God came took him to heaven and it was taken through his parents different mansions and shown pictures on the wall of siblings that hadn't been born yet as them captured for the first time i saw that i saw where his family's uh mansions were built they were built in the mountain of spices which is at the foot of these massive mountains you go up and it changes it's like fall all the time but the leaves never fall off it's a beautiful place to go and see things and now i knew nothing nothing about this person other than that he had taken his life and this was one of the ones God used to show me that he was just and on the mantle of this young man's mansion it said satan zero God won and what he was saying with that was God was just he knew he was a believer he knew he was under torment that he could no longer handle or deal with it and then he just wanted to end his suffering but he was living in heaven i saw things he was doing things that his family they would do altogether but he was doing this wonderful beautiful things in heaven i was able to deliver that message to his parents they were set free from grief unimaginable grief and they could actually celebrate that he was living in heaven and that God had been just and the other two situations were very similar but he was wanting to get he even had me put it in my second book it's in my second book of second volume of revealing heaven he said this will be one of the most important chapters in is how to understand and separate in your mind what is suicide what is not and how just and faithful God is oh good so good well this next question i was surprised how many times this has been asked especially this last week for some reason there maybe there's something in the spirit realm where people are dealing with this but the question is not that different from what we're talking about except they said what about a person who was born mentally impaired or who became mentally impaired or who became medically impaired who could not necessarily even process the way you and i would to say would you like to receive christ maybe they wouldn't even understand what it means to have a savior receive christ and they're wanting to know how does God deal with that how do they get to heaven and not go to the other place well there's one scripture a lot of people either never see in the bible or they just go read and go past it there's many you just read and go past it because you don't understand it but in the book of romans there is actually a scripture i think somebody was asking a question of the disciples or somebody i don't remember who asked the question but God said i make myself known to every person [Music] in their spirit there's an understanding even people who will claim to be atheists let me tell you if you're in a plane going down the first thing they scream is that jesus happening literally they were yelling out to jesus and these are people who before have been just you know abusing his name and just bashing him and they thought the plane was crashing they began to scream out loud to jesus and i actually was able to i took authority over the whole thing it was just a wild thing uh demons were trying to kill me because i was going to a place to unseat principalities and let me tell you satan doesn't want you to mess with the stuff but God was sending me on that assignment you have to understand that was an assignment from God it didn't work the plane didn't crash but when we landed people began to huddle together and say do you realize if it wasn't for God they heard me yelling that we could have died could you understand our life would have been over and these were people who didn't even know him who all of a sudden wanted to know him it does say in the book of romans i make myself known to every man i do know when people are born with those um handicaps whatever you want to call them that after a moment listen to this after a moment of death jesus christ comes in person and you can bash me and accuse me it doesn't bother you wasting your time okay i've already been there seeing it it's too late to say i know how just and merciful our God is because they didn't have the chance God gives every one probably many times the many chances to accept his son and because they never were in a place to do that your spirit man is perfect your spirit man is not handicapped that might sound crazy living inside your physical body if you're a handicap if you're if you're blind you can't hear in in your spiritual body it hears it sees they've even had some blind people be able to see through the spiritual eyes and see when there was no sight in the physical eyes so your spirit means perfect so when somebody passes no matter how sick how what what sort of a situation they're in is is like their bodies depleting or whatever it's doing it's dying it's in a horrible situation when they die that spirit man steps out perfect and jesus comes to get you and so but he does meet with them at that moment of death as they step out of their spirit of their physical body he will come right then to ask them if he they want to receive him so they will get a chance every person gets a chance yeah kat since i've known you my my whole thinking process has changed i'm gonna try it on like this uh see what you think about this when i was raised in a very fundamental religious background my picture of the father of God i didn't see him as father i saw him as God and i saw him as looking for every technicality to to keep me from heaven every possible way that could that i could fail the test he was watching for those so he could you know i wouldn't have told you he's really doing that but that's what my theology was teaching what i'm seeing now at least it's this is my language it's not scripture it seems to me like i was looking for a technicality that he gets to take you to heaven it seems like if you ever received the lord if you've ever asked him in your heart if you if you wanted to but you couldn't how would you respond to that is he looking for ways to get you saved he absolutely is always as the spirit of God just just flowed all over me and like i feel like electricity on me right now because God loves it you said that he loves people see him that way he is doing every single thing possible even in the spirit realm even supernaturally he'll send the right people across your path many times he's rescued people and kept them from death so they would have another chance not just to not die but to complete their destiny he sent everyone here with a purpose and it was never a bad purpose he doesn't make people evil he doesn't want harm he is not involved in violence and he despises violence he doesn't want violence and so of course in every way and there's promises in the word and that was why he was willing to send his son he knew that he had to have that sacrifice where people could go and accept a cleansing of all the sins wiped out of them completely when you receive christ it wipes it all away it doesn't hide it it's like you never did it because God isn't willing for sin to be in heaven what is in your soul your soul stays with you when your spirit man steps out of that body your soul's in you your body decays your body gets cremated or your body goes in the ground which by the way it will be resurrected one day you're going to get your body back it'll look a whole lot better i holy spirit says give it to them for free they need to understand that you may not like yourself if you don't like yourself that's not God speaking to you it is the enemy trying to convince you that you have no value or worth that is the biggest lie hell even in this moment of the great division and separation God loves everybody but he gives us a choice he lets us choose but even beyond our choice he will do everything possible that he can as God to get you into heaven his word says he desires that none should perish he desires that the vilest sinner be free from that sin so nobody can point fingers at God and say he doesn't care he's an unjust God if he was unjust he would have never sent his son and evan is watching everything but you were right steve God does everything possible if you have strong family members believers praying for your salvation he also will meet you at that very time of death to ask you that same question if you ask God things and don't doubt in your heart that they will come to pass but you believe it will come it will come to pass so don't stop praying for your family members for your really close friends he has the keys to hell death in the grave and he will do it whatever he possibly can there are still some people believe it or not they don't want to go they just don't they their souls corrupted this is not somebody who maybe couldn't have responded these are people who willingly knowingly choose satan and his plan and don't want God he'll even try to win them but sometimes that doesn't happen but most of the time you'll be surprised to see your family members and your dear friends in heaven because God does love us that's so good so good Kat no let me ask you this because it keeps being asked over and over and i don't think i've ever asked you on camera because to me it seemed like okay everyone knows the answer to that it's so obvious but it keeps being asked so it's not obvious people are saying when i go to heaven can i have a young body that's not fat or old or and i'm thinking don't they know that so i'm gonna just let you and the other what questions asked similar along that same line as they say when a child goes to heaven does he stay in child or does he grow up in heaven so those two things about our age and our body and our our appearances let's talk about that for a second i know one time i did a survey when i was doing my first book we we did we sent out 400 surveys and it was the same question if you could ask God one question about heaven or eternity what would it be and i mean we sent them to bars we sent them into prisons we sent them into um like um all every kind of religion we would send some to each of those we actually did personal interviews and surveys with people when we got all 400 back they were split up into three groups and that people think that's crazy the number one group of course was will i be known will i be near my family will people know who i am the second one was will my pets go to heaven out of all 400 one-third of those wanted to know that and the other one was how can i win someone to christ that doesn't know christ what do i do to help get them into heaven so it was about relationships they wanted to know uh in that relationship what do i experience when i die is that painful do i go to weird places is it going to be scary and because there is people don't have knowledge of that that's why God has people catches them up so they can tell people when you die your physical body continues to grow in this natural world time goes by and heaven there is no time you're living in eternity when you get to heaven nothing ages it even says that in the bible nothing ages there's no mold there's no military there's no aging in heaven of anything not even you so when you die if you're let's say over the age of 20 whatever now most people look like they're in their 20s in your spirit in your spirit man when you pass if you're like 99 your great-grandma looks 20 years old when she steps out of that physical mind her spiritual body um as she remembers you she still knows you she's it's so excited knowing that she's going to be moving to heaven there is absolutely no fear there may be fear up to that moment of people not knowing but the minute they step their spiritual body steps up there's a guardian angel waiting to take them the fear is gone and there's peace yes but there's joy unimaginable joy and excitement when a baby passes so your answer to you is you will not look oh nobody looks old you look beautiful your hair all of you will look beautiful and amazing in heaven when a baby passes whether it's aborted or miscarried all babies go to heaven no matter what some religions believe God sent them and he takes them back to heaven they stay in beautiful amazing places until their family members get there those babies already know even if they were like maybe a month into the pregnancy and they miscarry that is a real baby and it has a little baby's spirit body and it can laugh play understands it knows who his parents are and can't wait to stand and wait till its parents get to heaven and so that baby most of the time will stay very young in other words 60 years could pass from the time somebody miscarried and they get home to heaven they get a baby given their very baby that they lost that wow the same baby is given back to them and it grows very very slowly in heaven you get to see its gifts develop um you don't have to teach how to read or write or or sing or dance that already knows how to do all that so you get your babies back if you had eight miscarriages you probably have eight babies waiting on you and this is what God said if the mother of the baby pictures that baby as a baby it will be a baby if it looks like it's a toddler it will be a toddler and so it has a lot to do with what the mother desires uh when they get there but and i've seen people go home to heaven and they had miscarried children i saw them like three or four years old sitting on the steps of their mansion waiting on them to come home and be together so your children are not lost they are not in pain they're living in the most amazing beautiful place where God is jesus the angels help to take care of them and your family members get there they automatically go to be with them until you get home that's so good well we have time for one more question i could do and then we'll do more on this on wednesday as well so here's the question um a person is going through life and they do kindness is here they show kindness to a person on the street they long forget about those things are there are there rewards in heaven for specific things that you've even forgotten that you've done God is a rewarder of all the kindnesses and the love you have shown sometimes it's a smile literally a smile can change the not just the mood of a person but the way that they're feeling inside maybe they're having a bad day maybe they're in fear maybe they're not feeling well or maybe they're just afraid and yet you show a kindness like um hi uh i just want you to know that God loves you or hello are you having a good day or just how about hello do you need help and just to act kind of acne you're getting rewarded for that if you've fed hungry people there's no way you will escape i don't care if it was 60 years ago 70 years ago my dad lived his whole life showing kindness to everybody even his enemies he loved them we fed so many people and and we help people find homes i mean we moved them in here's a family with all these kids right and he moved people in for a while we helped them find a job we helped them find their family members we prayed with them to be healed this was my life growing up to love people no matter what color their skin was no matter where they were what the situation in life was we love and care for people that is the heart of God and let me tell you my dad has a huge reward in heaven and i'm sure he's happy that he's got these rewards but i promise you he is probably sharing them with people and yes every kind act especially he he writes it down he has a book of remembrance and they're actually written down so your little grandma who probably nobody ever knew prayed in three moves of God fed the neighborhood probably has some of the biggest mansions in heaven so you cannot escape being blessed and rewarded in heaven that's so good so good well kat that's our time my goodness we could go for two hours not get bored on this but uh we've got more questions feel free to send more questions and we probably have a hundred so that we're catching up on but send questions in that you have below you do it on facebook do it on youtube i get some sent to me by email but they'll get to me one way or the other and we'll try to get through the ones and we're trying to ask the questions that most people are trying to get answered um some of the specific things will say have you seen this person or that person probably not going to be asked because everyone's not asking that but you did say Kat one time we'll do an episode about the people you've seen in heaven many people i mean from oh gosh well i've seen people like queen esther king david i've seen the disciples i've seen the prophets like met them and and actually have been to a couple of their mansions i know what they're doing right now in heaven i've seen many people like from the past like you would say maybe from the 20s or 30s i've seen celebrities i've seen revivalists i've seen all kinds of people from around the world that were known some that weren't known and so there is i do have a lot of revelation on that and God was just showing me this is his heart that he does care he does want you to make it and right now in this time you know what he wants you to do he wants you to celebrate like our justice is already here it's so good happen we can't escape being great we can't escape america can't escape being great it's God's desire for america to become an example of a place where you can come and find God and find liberty and freedom because that is his heart for the world so stay united don't step back good that's so good path of celebration all right you'll be so happy uh when that happens the victory will be great that's so good kat thank you again so much i just really have words enough to thank you because but on behalf of all the people who you just made their day with these answers i just thank you for them as well so all right everybody so thank you again tomorrow is steven springer and we'll see you again tomorrow bye WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE! - Episode 5 by ElijahStreams

there's a notification there's a bell one the subscribe button and the third one i get i keep forgetting to write those down if you click all three of those so that we can be sure and notify you one way or the other we don't want to lose track of it all right so today is the Kat Kerr day happy wednesday with kat Kerr let's bring on Kat right now and the engineer is asleep you're doing okay can you hear me why yeah i could i didn't hear what you said for a second how are you doing today i'm doing great i was just kind of listening to God for a moment so that kind of blocks everyone else out oh that's okay you can you can block me out any time for that well um so here we are wednesday two days before christmas we always start talking about the election which is currently in progress yeah tell us anything you want to tell us about the elections before we do heaven's talk oh yes well God is still laughing and that's a good sign when he the way he's laughing now because he knows what his plans are i can only continue to tell people to celebrate there are waves of celebration about to hit our country and it will either make people very happy or they may be convicted about some things in their life that's just the way it happens when God begins to invade a place and i can tell you what they are planning inauguration for president trump regardless of what the other side is saying um and so God's plans are four more years you've heard me say that i won't change that he's not changing it people don't think in your human mind it hasn't happened yet so i guess it's not going to that's not how God thinks i can let you know this country is going to be changing for the greater and for the better and so are all of your lives you should be excited right now that you're alive and experiencing what God is doing in the midst of all of us and so thinking the platform you've heard me say that also because unless God changes what he says to me i just have to say what he says that's good for any time of expectation and new things coming there will be things changing obviously because of stuff we've gone through but they'll be for the better but one thing that won't change that God is always running for america is justice liberty and freedom and a lot of righteousness that's good that's so good Kat well you know and and i know you don't watch the news very much on purpose i know several prophetic people who are that way the guy just says don't watch the news it doesn't mean you never hear about the news because i'm sure you you know the certain amount of current events but as one who doesn't watch the news someone surely told you gee that thing didn't pass with the supreme court in texas and now he's is at the end of his pathways uh to the presidency and what how does that affect you if someone says he either has no more pathways or they don't see another pathway how does that mean you have God's path everybody God's path is not man's and it's okay to try everything you can according to the rules the guidelines what we've always done but God has a path of his own and when we're in a time of him doing something in the earth it will be done differently and that doesn't mean you lose hope don't ever step back don't stop saying what God says we have great victory headed our way and it will be so tremendous he let me experience a wave of that i got so undone i wanted to run out in the streets and just shout so there's one pathway you are not considering that's always been in the bible when God would do something it was always something no one ever considered could or would happen and that's right that's exactly what he's going to do and you may wake up shocked one morning or before you go to bed shocked and stunned at how rapidly things change direction when God puts his hand on something that's so good okay i receive it we receive it that's really good very encouraging okay are you ready to talk about some questions for heaven about heaven oh yes definitely always now everyone now as you those of you who have been watching be sure you get the old ones you know it's easy to find all the ones with kat Kerr on it because she's got that same pink hair on all the videos so if you go to the youtube channel you see all the ones with the pink hair and you get all the questions some of you are asking the same questions that have been answered sometimes twice or more than that and you're saying i'm desperate for this answer those answers are there so be sure and and go and watch the old videos we're trying to ask questions that the most people need answers for if that's too specific and we do put a few specific ones on there that are that are almost personal in nature but they're the kind of personal questions that would answer a lot of things for people so yeah having said that Kat the first one is and i'm going to do two from this gentleman um he said you talked on on one of your videos about ezekiel 28 the ancient paths and he said you read from the version that was the closest he wanted to know which version you were reading from if you you remember which version of the bible i i have several versions of the bible that i read i don't read every one of them um of course some people make you know you always uh will get some kind of rebukes or just rejoicing no matter which way it goes i'm not going to change okay i'm you're not going to change me so you can either accept it and receive it or just go your way and find what you want to find but i love the scofield bible it's one of the few bibles it talks about time time before man was made you might want to check it out it's a very very old bible and i have it's about this thick people because of the stuff that's in it a lot of revelation was put in there by scofield and it's one of the few things it talks about like i said they'll talk about the earth when you turn the light out the first time and then the second time um verse two between one and two what happened it talks about that in the scofield bible a lot of things so i can tell you i love scofield and i inherited that from somebody i also love the everyday bible which was made i think before the amplified was around it's been around for a while also and of course i read the king james it's some things that should not have been changed in some of the new versions of the bible and they they just didn't change them and i for instance there are unicorns in heaven i've seen them many times and it's mentioned nine times when i say in the bible look in the king james bible i think it's psalms 92 and psalms 29 i think that's two of the places and uh why is that important because God that's what he rides if he rides he rides his unicorn and there they weren't they're not on the earth now of course not and some people would call it a rhinoceros there's many different things that people change because they thought they just got it wrong okay way back one so i do like i will read the amplified of course that blesses everybody i don't read a lot of the brand new brand new versions of the bible because they just took some things out and make sure it has the whole council of God when you go to buy a bible and if nothing else get one that's got several versions in there the niv the uh i know they won't put the scofield and there's too old um and the amplified the king james i know those are always good standbys um but you know what i think we'll get it really right when a revelation just begins to flood this earth revelation reveals the word of God the things of God God himself heaven itself eternity and so you don't want to miss out on revelation we may have to write a revelation bible and that would mean every revelation i ever got and the scripture that it reveals we may have to do that one day just to make it to be made known well that's good now you know you brought up the unicorn and i'm going to jump ahead to a question because you touched on it and i don't know the answer to this does does the unicorn have wings because people several people are asking me do horses in heaven have wings and can they do people ride on them or does everybody have or can i have a horse with wings what are your thoughts you can have any color of horse you want whether it's rainbow colored whether it's platinum i mean there's every kind of color you have to understand the rainbow comes from the father he and his son they made everything uh there's trees that are teal i mean there's things you you'd be so shocked and delighted to see in heaven you can have as many horses as you think you can take care of now when i say take care of that means you know you don't have to necessarily feed them so they can live you don't even have to clean them they don't get dirty in heaven if you're going to have a ranch where people can come and ride then you'll probably get a thousand or more you can ride horses that fly okay and some have wings and some don't have wings they don't need wings to fly and so in your natural mind because you've never seen these things it's hard to conceive them but you must understand that heaven is filled with splendor wonder beauty mysteries revealed and uh the truth is everywhere in heaven and just like hair color this is heaven culture on my head that's exactly where it is i didn't choose this God asked me literally to have pink highlights in my hair so i would stand out and people could hear about heaven how beautiful wonderful it is he does not care if your hair has color in it that doesn't change what's inside of you and the holy spirit said to me all we did was take what was inside the joy the pleasure of God celebration and we put it on your head so you need to understand that you can breathe under the crystal sea you ride through the sky on your worship or on light beams you travel around heaven you step into a light kiosk and it takes you to the other side of heaven like faster than a second so there's ways to travel ways to to do things in heaven that just don't on this earth but the more you get it gets you excited the possibilities on earth as it is in heaven he says that to me all the time there's changes coming where the cars yes they will fly one day probably before you die and uh we will ride on rails of light like for a train not on tracks like metal tracks you cannot understand how great the inventions that i haven't even been here yet it's not going to end which is why God is keeping his hands and his plans for america oh good now you jumped ahead again i started to go i'm going to keep track of that travel one because i did have several people i was going to ask you about they said well how do we travel do we just fly do we just appear where we want to be do we take vehicles i can imagine people who love race cars would want to take a race car people like helicopters like me would want to take a helicopter but on the other hand if i could fly maybe i would just do that so talk about travel a little bit more there's so many different ways to be transported and i know a lot of the things you've seen like a star trek's a good example i remember back in the 70s you know when it first started i was undone because i always wanted to be an astronaut some people don't know that about me and in the 60s that was the first time the possibility came that's when man walked on the moon for the first time uh and those things about space exploration were just starting back then and being a senior in high school my plan was to be an astronaut they weren't taking women back then but i always wanted to see the unknown now i'm not talking about the spirit realm because i've seen the spirit realm all around me the whole time growing up and there's ways to travel there too but yes you can step into a place in your own mansion i don't know if i've ever talked about this everyone has like an open portal in your mansion in heaven when you step and you say where you want to go and instantly you're there so yes you can do that in heaven you can ride almost any kind of transport when you get your mansions depending on where they are built in heaven the valley of the the falls you know or if it's in the mountain of spices or if it's in where the sky mansions are mansions built on top of the crystal sea under the crystal sea and the rain forest i can just keep going on and on about places so your transport might be a little bit different personally that you have now i know in the sky mansions you get a star cruiser it runs on light there's no kind of fuel like they have on the earth they don't use coal they don't use like even solar energy they don't use any kind of um gasoline or anything like that it's all frequencies or light that operate whatever you you fly or drive i mean you can do all kinds of ways to get around in heaven they even have group things uh transports where you can go they even have something called mm's which i thought was quite delightful uh we were taken off at an airport one place and i don't remember where it was but it had this tower that came up and had like a big bubble on the top and the holy spirit says to me well i'm looking out the window oh that looks like an mm and yes he talks to me on time and i said m m he goes that's the mobile mansion the rvs you have on earth no rv yes you do it in heaven only you fly them they have sky parks in the sky that's when you you park your scot your mm and then you just come on down you know walking through the air down to the ground or you have a little transport you get on something like a bubble something i don't know what some things are called um kids traveling bubbles all over heaven they step on the pedestal a big bubble forms around i mean you could be three and do this okay you're not going to get lost a lot of groups of kids do that you see their little bubbles going around heaven in the sky when they get where they want they get closer to the pop the bubble and that's how they get out so you can ride dinosaurs in heaven they're not good with vicious or or mean you can go to a place where all the children play and the merry grounds are living animals that you ride on how about that no pole stuxes and plastic thing uh it's so different in heaven you can just like i said you can shout glory to God and a bridge comes a rainbow bridge comes out of your mouth over the crystal sea and you can walk over there now obviously you could just fly but people have many different ways they transport around heaven and they choose what they want to do at the moment and so it's delighted it's a beautiful place none of your family members are sad they're not upset with you they're so in love with jesus christ if anybody can go somewhere with him that's the greatest pleasure they get to do he has his own mansion he deserves it and he has all kinds of events in his own mansion and when you first come home to heaven he'll invite everybody you ever wanted to know like the disciples of prophets but you're the one who is brought there to meet all of them so all kinds of ways well that's going to happen jumping again to another question i was going to hit later anyway and then i'm going to come back to question number two so here's the question our everybody has all these friends and relatives family members and new friends and acquaintances and who knows what other kind of associations or clubs or organizations but how does how does it the person wants to ask this question we wanted to know are there compromises what if the whole group says i want to half the group wants to go to amusement park and say well i'd rather go there they want to know if there's such a thing as a you know sin free compromise where people go ahead and don't do their thing and do something with someone else because someone wants to do nobody really nobody's everybody's perfectly fine with whatever you decide um if there's somebody new who's come home to heaven and you haven't seen anything some of them will show up and say oh we want to take you to see this we know that you would love it you want to go there and then their friends find out and everybody just joined so it's not like there's no arguments let's say that there's no arguing no coveting no jealousy uh nobody gets nobody gets angry so this is what they do if they say let's say there's a group and they're going to decide on something you'll do both there's no time limit there's no time in heaven you can go enjoy let's go on a big ship across the crystal sea and sing with the whales and the sharks you know glory to God and we can go hunt for treasure with um i'm gonna really get you now um henry morgan on his island in heaven and whether you know henry morgan the pirate yes he's not called a pirate anymore in heaven but he you know that was his gift right buried treasure he has an island that's his own and people can ride this huge sail ship no skull ball no skull and bones okay uh you ride over there and you get a map it's a spiritual map so the treasure could be elevated it could be hidden in places you wouldn't know your whole family goes and when you get the treasure you get a prize it's a good thing but in let's see henry morgan was determined that people would know he received jesus christ he put it in his last will and testament that he would be living in heaven when he died so he's there that's fantastic you know we are going to do a whole show on on uh all the people that you've known or at least a lot more uh okay back to question number two if you can believe that we we're about seven questions in and here's question number two this this gentleman had um he gave me four pages single space there's no way i can even summarize it except to say except to say almost 40 years ago he fell in love starting with uh sort of like a teen challenge he was a counselor they fell in love they were going to get married and she ended up with cancer and before they were to be married long story she died and he knows it went to heaven so here's his question someone told him that he and he want he felt to believe it but he wants to know if it's possible someone told him way back then that this wonderful person who was to be his fiance or was his fiancee uh then became his guardian angel and he wants to know that is that possible and question number two he wants to know he's picturing this big mansion that he would get he's a believer he's seeing himself as all alone in this mansion and feeling lonely so you do not have a chance in heaven nowhere to ever be alone i think you look for a loan sometimes just confusing quiet but you're never alone people want to know you even if they never met you you'll have visitors all the time to your mansion and um okay you're the girl the person that you had loved God wouldn't do that to us okay hello uh there are angels those are spiritual beings we are physical human beings we came from inside God the angels he spoken created them we have different lives given to us different requirements that they follow they're never married in heaven they don't have to be married and some of you may say they're the lucky ones but you know what but God sends him an assignment with an angel who has a different personality some are serious about being holy and living that way and some are actual comedians angels and what he does is he sends them together so it rubs them just like but she would not be your guardian angel because when we go home to heaven the the body of christ we'll be using the gift like let's just say that she was a designer or she created jewelry or she wanted to be a florist and that's the passion so when we go home to heaven our entire mansion is designed around the gift he put in us and those gifts are without repentance that means that's how heaven operates that's why there's so much to do is when someone else comes home we all enjoy that gift let's just say maybe they teach dance they do beautiful dancing ballet and stuff they would have as part of their mansion a huge studio maybe a hundred students teaching them a performance stage to have huge performances where people could come and watch and enjoy it so he would not make that person a guardian angel if somebody wanted to be a florist and all they ever wanted to do was grow flowers my grandfather is in heaven and he grows flowers that sing they change colors he lived in the arizona desert but grew the best roses he possibly could now he was in secret service as a job that's not what he does in heaven but the passion he had for that is what his whole his whole mansion and all his grounds are designed around being a florist and they design these six foot flower arrangements they put them in your mansion to welcome you home they sing welcome home to you why would he take him and make him a guardian angel your own guardian angel you had on this earth when you lived on this earth will become almost like a friend and you get to know them you'll do stuff together you're not going to ever worship them nobody worships anybody but jesus the father and the holy spirit so your own guardian angel uh has always been your guardian angel but he won't assign someone to you um he won't assign someone you love this move to heaven to watch over you now that guardian angel that you were assigned when you were conceived is still with you they actually take you home to heaven when you go home to heaven now your loved ones whether you were ever married or not if they love you they'll declare over you they'll ask jesus to give you gifts and things that you need uh they declare over your family members to know jesus christ for you to step into the the desire in the future and the call in your life he has here for your earth you're saying you're saying they're in heaven now declaring now for these things yes yeah okay good all right uh good so i've heard this is the question i've heard there are sounds in heaven we've never heard nor experienced in worship is do you have anything you can describe i don't know how you describe a sound we never heard what does sound like their music or worship well i would tell you one of the things that's different about in heaven especially with the angels in the father the father has layers in his voice you know the bible says that he sounds like many thunders or many waters because people who were caught way back then didn't know how to explain that they didn't know that um they had layers in their voices so when the father says something it sounds like maybe a thousand people saying something um if angels sing in choirs in heaven and stuff like that and i know the worship angels the ones that were under satan were kicked out with him the 130 God were worship angels that's why satan hates it when we worship because we replace them and he doesn't like that but an angel sings and i've heard recordings if you go to um if jen was in america i think it's jason upton and he has i think it's the album called fly and on that album you literally can hear a real angel singing and responds to the worship that jason was doing um to God and you hear this angel begin to sing with him and it sounds like many but it's one angel you i tell you the presence of God gets all over you so worship is different because it's not just a sound it's the way that the that the songs are released some are released from the wings of different creatures sound uh the forest things they have their own voice the flower thing my own voice it sounds different than ours they sing different songs this is the thing the father is a songwriter it says things in the bible it says he sings over us and so he has his own songs that have never been heard on the earth before and when you come home to heaven if you're someone who sings for him he will give you this treasure box and you will see the song come out of this treasure box like a garment and it will begin to wind itself around you at the throne and that garment will sing one of the father's songs everywhere you go in heaven this is one of the rewards you get that there's no way on the earth you can even conceive of this happening you see music in heaven you don't just hear it or feel it now this one comes to me right now i'm just going to ask this for myself on earth from time to time when the anointing will hit i will have tears of joy or tears of emotions that's all towards God are there that kind of tears in heaven or are there no tears can you have joyous tears you have to i always go back to the word okay when it says that he will wipe away the tears that means you will never cry again that is at the very end of the bible that's where it says you know the former things will remember no more he'll wipe away your tears people cry from joy of who they simply tell you you won't be able to help but cry it is a happy cry it is a joyous cry when you see family members you haven't seen in yours you can't help but grab them and hug them and you weep with joy so that yes part of our expression he doesn't take that away sadness or regrets you know or maybe rejection you don't cry over things like that it's always like a celebration cry so good okay this one keeps me asked are there different rankings of importance among the saints in heaven or some people have a higher rank i guess there's they're trying to find words to declare you know are some people higher higher of higher honor or higher rank in heaven there would have to be because of what they gave of their life the rewards are different now everybody's so happy to be in heaven let's just say somebody got saved on their deathbed well they wouldn't have a whole lot of reward if they got saved right before they died but they still have a beautiful place to live they are so happy they're there they're happy for everybody no matter how great their mansion is no matter what kind of beautiful rewards are inside they understand that this person gave their life for things i'm not necessarily mean they died like a were shot with a gun to save somebody i'm talking about their serving that they did it says to be the greatest of all you must be the servant of all even though he now calls us sons and daughters and not servants uh a let's say a missionary he went to the mission field for 20 30 years and and gave up all the luxuries and what we would call just even um ordinary things that you need to take the gospel to love people to help people my grandmother did that she has a great mansion in heaven and when i've seen her mention it is beautiful and i'm so happy but you know what she's a humble person you know what she's glad she has a big one she can have a lot of people over to celebrate so yes when you do something kind for somebody and you love people or you give something maybe to feed somebody or something the father takes gemstones these are uh these are stones of revelation the stones of fire are inside the father when you get born again he takes a stone of fire and puts it in your spirit man that's what gives it light but when you do things for him on the earth your robe of righteousness some of them look like they could hang in a gallery because he will gather these gems from himself and as you do these things throughout your life he applies them to your robe these are so so beautiful you couldn't even afford to buy one if you could on the earth and you walk down the streets of gold and people run up and go what did you do with your life did you feed people did you take them into did you help lonely people did you pray for people and you didn't even have to say anything because people realized they gave their life or something of course their mansion is going to have more i love the one song i don't know who sings it but about um where you said what you said would having to build your manager or something it's i can't remember the name of the group but uh that God's gonna reward you and you can't escape but no one on this earth may know you but if you've fed the same person or even some of the creatures he cares about them too not more than people but if you had a heart of kindness even if you were a gruff person maybe you didn't say much nice to people but you still were helping or giving uh you have great reward in heaven you know you don't have to be billy graham you don't have to be oral robbers you don't have to be mother teresa it's what kindness you show to others is that's true reward let me forget your family you gotta love your family even if they're not not yeah yeah you know that just has created a new question to me and i've talked about my mother now my mother uh she's a believer she'll be with the lord when she passes she's 86 she believes and i've mentioned this before she believes i'm lost her theology is wrong she doesn't believe in this stuff but now let me because of her theology she has a very strict picture of God he's he's exacting i mean she wouldn't necessarily describe that in her own words but she would say yes God loves us all but he's got these absolute requirements so she's had a lot of unhappiness but amidst all that unhappiness she pours her life out for prisoners for the sick for the less than i learned a lot about how to the love people less than my station to my mom talk about that what's her reward going to be like she will have a great reward in heaven she's one of those type of people i said that they may not necessarily be nice to everybody per se or treat you maybe what you think people should treat it's it's what comes from her heart she obviously cares because you know what she is loving for God she's loving those people for God what she will do steve is one day if not now then in heaven she will run to you and tell you she realized that she probably could have loved you more but she's so proud of what you did for God and she's so grateful that you didn't give up and turn away from what he called you do they they get so happy when they go to heaven in the realization like wow i missed it about that but they don't feel like regret like sadness from it but what they will do is they'll declare over you continually that God presence increase that the gifts he gave you increase that you get to do signs and wonders as a manifested son or daughter of God they want they want you to be known as someone who knows God who loves God and is right on the path he wants you to be honest that's just good news that's such good news i know that's going to help a lot of other people too but it sure helped me well okay this one keeps being asked everyone so many people want to know what language we speak in heaven i guess i can't remember if i asked you this before i said english is it spanish does everyone speak their own language and everybody just hears it as if it's their language they've asked it about every way from sunday trying to get the answer to that well i'll take you back to the bible again it says in the bible every tongue there's a language tribe a nation is represented in heaven that means there's people from all those places around the world they spoke different languages they probably dress different than they probably even live differently but in heaven it'll be like your friends it really will be and no matter what language they choose to speak okay they don't lose the language that was part of their tongue or tribe or that wouldn't be true the bible wouldn't be true they can speak their natural language everyone understands it everyone you don't have to have interpreters in heaven the one language that is kept mysterious i don't want to say secret is mysterious is the is the the language of angels they have their own and i'm sure that if it's some time in heaven that might change maybe when we all are on the new earth or something but there are times i hear angels having discussions that i don't understand them and then they might turn to me and say something right in heaven and i know they speaking to me in english so the angels know every language on the earth but they have their own it even says that in the bible so and the related questions because it was asking next to this one is when we you know you said people can our loved ones can look down and see the good things that God doesn't show them the painful thing you know weddings and important things but they want to know when you speak in tongues on the earth can your loved ones sometimes understand what you're saying in heaven i don't even know if you know the answer to that but i think because uh tongues is not necessarily um it's well it would be a mystery to people down here but i have even been present in movies when movies not movies meanings i've been present in meetings and i heard people speak in tongues and someone else in the meeting who wasn't interpreting that now you know that's a biblical thing to pray in tongues in the day how did anybody got up and just spoke for God as a prophet but they would say they would speak in tongues and there'd always be one or two in the meeting they would give an interpretation of those tongues and that's how a lot of people heard from God many years ago and some places still do that but i've been present when somebody next to me knew a language like a foreign language and somebody was speaking in tongues and they knew everything they said because that was a language they already knew so i'm sure in heaven when people hear people praying in tongues that's not a language of angels probably everybody in heaven knows exactly what's being said but the one who doesn't the one who does not know what tongues are is the devil the devil cannot understand it it bypasses his mind he can't get an interpretation on that that's why it's a powerful thing to have as a peer language when you pray a perfect prayer you pray in tongues you say i'm praying about my brother who's who's maybe caught up in witchcraft or something or i'm praying for my brothers in the army and they're all under attack you begin to pray in tongues God knows exactly what that is he can send angels out to assistant or take care or deal with that but the devil does not have a clue what you're saying which is why another reason why the devil doesn't want you to be even have any association with the holy spirit and that whole thing is speaking oh go ahead you start to say something else go ahead well i was just gonna say so speaking in tongues is an outward it's really an outward witness that you have received holy spirit in your life however i do know people who invited holy spirit sincerely and passionately but didn't have the speaking in tongues for some time but he moved in i'm telling you and they could actually prophesy and say things to people so back in the day you would get almost beat up at a church all throughout yeah you'd be there for three hours praying just to force you to you know if you're not praying in tongues you don't have it if it's something sincerely you ask for he's not going to say no that holy spirit if you invite him to indwell you it's powerful because he's not walking along here when you're born again he walks alongside you the bible says well he moves from here in here and you become a temple of the holy spirit so holy spirit is a third member of the trinity he brings power in your life and boldness in your life and you have a language that the enemy cannot understand i had a he was like the head elder of a church um in dallas texas this is like 30 years ago and he may speak in tongues now at that time he didn't but he could prophesy the the mail out of you he knew exactly what that was going on he'd read your mail to use that expression so he very likely could have received his prayer language after that i just at that time he didn't and it was corrected my theology just a little bit that you can still prophesy you know so anyway okay next one and i think i understand where this person's coming from i don't think they mean with sadness but the question is do our deceased loved ones others who are with the lord do they miss us i and i don't know what this person meant by i'm sure they don't mean oh i'm so miserable without them but do they miss us how would you answer that i think they probably mean do they ever think about me do they ever think about me anymore am i just like gone out of their life so i'm not i'm not there's something invisible of course that never happens one of the first things they want to do when they leave the stone room is they go to these beautiful places called the portal you go up these steps they can see you as closest to ceiling in your home and sometimes you feel the presence you might smell their clone or perfume if they bake brownies all the time you might smell brownies that usually is a sign that they're actually listening or declaring over you but um people love you more when they get to heaven than they did on the earth so no um they're not ignoring you they're not so happy up there that they're not aware that you still live on the earth and you're not close to them and i think because you're not right here if they're a family member you you actually create a soul tie between people that you have close relationships with so when they're gone that's normal to miss them and yeah they wished you that you were there because they want to show you all the wonderful things there but it's not not like being sad yeah that's good okay a couple more quick ones we're we're quickly out of time but uh this could be i've always actually wanted to know this and i've heard every possible theory so i'm going to ask you maybe you don't can this question can Kat ask Kat who melchizedek was who was melchizedek really some say he was christ some say he was an angel what do you say i'm gonna tell you the truth okay i'll take that i've seen melchizedek and melchizedek is different from many other beings in heaven now we all know father son and holy spirit they have always existed the trinity has always existed what you may not know is melchizedek is not someone who lived on the earth and died and went to heaven he was assigned to the earth for a while or he could not have met abraham right he also had flesh he had flesh that wasn't like our human flesh but he had flesh on him and he made God made a whole tribe of angels they're called watcher angels that God put flesh on them melchizedek's eternal position is to be the father's personal high priest that is his position and he also when he was on the earth was known as the king of salem and it says this about melchizedek he had no father no mother no beginning nor end this is literally what the bible says about melchizedek because he he's he's from heaven he's always been with the father he's always served the father he has flesh on him because that's just the way he's always been and he is a king and actually some people can take one saying in the bible and make a syllabus trying in their own natural mind to understand that and they talk a lot about it says in the bible jesus was made after the order of melchizedek and people come up with all these really big long words to describe what that means this is what it means the word that was the word's name before he was jesus christ the word had flesh put on him remember it said that in the bible the word became flesh there's one of the signs of melchizedek he was the king of the jews there's another sign jesus is our personal high priest there's revelation on the word of God so jesus was a high priest he had slash it was put on him he was the king of the jews so that's king priest and flesh that is the order of melchizedek that's why all the angels who were made in that tribe had flesh put on them they had high positions in heaven they were at one time sent to the earth to help educate man and some of them left the bounds they were put in to come here but melchizedek is God's personal high priest before the jewish nation was formed because remember abraham had something to do that before the jews became a thing he sent melchizedek to the earth to collect ties why because something was uh was not i don't want to say ordered but it was a protocol to approach God for something melchizedek represented God in the earth there was no one else to speak for him not in a position that was from heaven so that's what melchizedek did abraham paid ties to him how could he see him if he didn't have flesh so that's what melchizedek still does he is the father's personal high priest and he always will be and i i'm i'm hearing a question people are going to ask and they're going to say God the father always was and it sounds like you're saying that kissing always was because if the father always went because it always was but God is of course one billion percent sinless so do you mean i'm going to put it in my language do you mean melchizedek was his personal assistant or do you mean he was a priest and if he was a priest what does the priest do to a sinless God i don't people are gonna say well what does he need a priest for he was his high priest he would he would light some of the the things there in the throne there are lamps not just the seven lamps representing the seven spirits of God are actually seven spiritual beings people they're not just lamps that are burning it's not just God's attributes or his character's characteristics God himself has those that serve him the seven spirits of God serve the father melchizedek is a priest a probably a very high priest in heaven probably the highest priest there is besides jesus and he serves the father in the throne room that's what he does if the father sends him on an assignment to the year for something he'll still send him but he is his personal hype he worships him okay all the time but his heart is open what the father needs for him to do he does that that's what a priest does okay good okay last question boy the time just zips by all right since you mentioned the jewish uh king of the jews the question has come up several times now today are any jewish holidays celebrated in heaven ever and i'm going to add to that and are any holidays of any kind either known or unknown celebrated in heaven oh they have different events that they have i would have to say uh i can't use the word time because i've learned in heaven you don't even say the word time okay events are some are already set in place uh like they have special events when somebody knew come home from heaven and then they have some for different things happening in heaven they have events they do absolutely um practice the feast of tabernacles i know i was there one time when they were doing that it's still a practice in heaven that be not every feast is practiced not every jewish feast and i know people go well that's a jewish tradition it was something the father had the father chose the jewish people to represent him the father gave the jewish people his own personal sign and symbol which is the star people call it the star of david that symbol is all over heaven it's on these angels that are in the throne room that worship God it's on the throne room wall because that is the father's personal sign and symbol it's something that represents him in heaven and so when God chose a people he didn't have anyone here before when he chose a people to represent him he gave them his own personal sign and symbol and that signing symbol represents one thing if you take that star and you take it apart let's say here's a here's a triangle and here's one this one would represent father son and holy spirit this one will represent body soul and spirit this represents mankind when you put them together which he did right in front of me in the throne room he said this is my dream it is us and man forever as one and so for the first time when he had the jewish people represent him and he gave them decrees and stuff that they had to follow in order to be counted righteous to call them uh call God their God and talk about the father uh that he had their guidelines they had to live by leviticus is full of them so anyway that's what that is it was his he gave it to the people who would represent him in the earth and yes there's still precious people to him and um so that's what that is so um your question is yeah very much so and and you did say one time that there is a christmas town but you also have clarified over and over there's no time so it's not like the time goes around and it's time to celebrate christmas but anytime you want to go to christmas town yeah celebrating that event all the time all the time and one of the reasons it's there is because nicholas is there we could get in all that christmas is coming up i would definitely do a broadcast about that um on my facebook on christmas day but yes they celebrate the birth of christ in christmas town okay and how do they do they put stars on all the trees represent the star of bethlehem are on all the trees in christmas town it's the one place that snows all the time in christmas town but nicholas had a gift back i think it was in the 4th century i think he was from turkey and he took his own money and wealth he also had a high position i think he was a bishop and he would tear up people with his staff if they defamed the name of christ and they touched his sovereignty and his holiness they answered to saint nicholas okay he wouldn't stand for anyone saying that jesus christ was just a man he couldn't stand that and yet in his heart he had kindness for children and he lived in the cold climate so there's christmas town in heaven by the way christmas means christ's mass is still about christ that's why that word's in there don't go legalistic on me and you know you're going to find out when you get there anyway and so it's a place you go gifts are given to everybody jesus spends a lot of time there designing toys because guess what nick does nick makes them he gives them out to all the children who come to visit there people go sleigh rides you can go skiing because that's something that you do if you were on the earth and there was snow you're not going to freeze to death but it's it's a little bit colder there than other places so christmas town does exist and so does um there's a place called wipeout where it's like summer all the time and people surf on 100 foot waves and it's you know God has a way he designed heaven and he took his some four of his favorite places he said i took a shadow of them and put them on the earth as a season that's why we have the four seasons so good Kat i wish we could keep going but this is a longer one even than normal but i wanted to get some more questions in so i would really want to encourage all of you watching there's all those go to youtube go to elijah's streams on youtube and you can see all of Kat's videos he's made every single one of them talk about heaven they're all all in the last month and a half whatever it's been we've been talking about first the election then we go mostly about heaven so i hope you enjoyed it can't remind people how they can get to your two websites or your two two places well revealing heaven.com is about the corporation i have uh we have a commission from God to reveal and create heaven on earth and that's where our story is you'll find all kinds of revelation we have all kinds of products that represent heaven on the earth and i always show this to people this is for example uh the holy spirit gave us a way to talk against the darkness but not bash people and he said to create this it says i don't do demons and that makes it very there's a lightning bolt that meant they were kicked out of heaven right that's when lucifer was kicked out of heaven and so the holy spirit designed this to represent when people see it that means you don't partner with the darkness that means you're not tolerating or participating with satan in any way whatsoever and so that's the things that we create things that you can hang on your walls or things you can listen to um we're putting more and more out a lot more probably apparel will come up this next year and so whatever we put out there will represent heaven uh being on this earth and that's revealingheaven.com if you want to get more spiritual revelation you can go to KatKerr.com which is a website that God had me he said it's a spiritual platform where he can freely speak about anything he wants to there's a lot of things that you can watch and listen to and learn how to live heaven culture on the earth and it's the only place i always say this i will not send you things asking for money uh there's other uh facebooks that are not mine they're called Kat Kerr and they'll probably ask people to be i don't even know how you do that that to follow i guess and then to give money for certain things that's not real let's do that calm if you want to give online that's how you do it not even on revealing heaven that's where you can purchase things but i did that God did that as a safety measure so people would know if you see a site let us know you know let us know email us and say you found one and we're always having the fake ones put down because we don't want them asking for money when it's not us usually they probably keep it for themselves so KatKerr.com and revealingheaven.com and a public facebook page and a public youtube page is what i ask the public facebook is the the word the the theKatKerr it's got a blue check mark you know that's her because that means it's verifying so theKatKerr those are the third all right everybody thank you a quick reminder that there's about 20 of us that keep all of this running and we're at the last few days in the year if you can also consider us in your year in giving there's about eight or nine days left and where you get your tax deduction that helps us and we thank you very much and we'll see Kat probably next wednesday all things considered yeah if the schedule works out we try to do wednesdays for sure all right everybody merry christmas thank you everybody for merry christmas to all of you into youtube Kat all right everybody we'll see you again next time by the way we won't have any more i just was supposed to say this no more this week because the holidays are here and so we'll be back monday all right everybody thanks a lot and we'll see you again bye-bye you

well good morning it's 11 a.m here in a great state of oregon i'm feeling much better today thank you all for those of you who prayed for me yesterday i was quite under the weather probably should have canceled but i didn't want to cancel those you know nate and christy but thank you for those of you who prayed me through it i appreciate it very much so we are in year 30 a year i'm sorry you're 23 of bringing the voice of the prophets to you and we want you to be sure and let me see if i can point subscribe to the alliance list there if you have not already so that if anything happens we can email you and let you know what's going on also we send out daily uh emails 365 days a year we send out emails of prophetic revelations so this is the tv portion of things we also have the written portion which is if you subscribe there you get that as well also be sure and subscribe to the youtube channel if you have not um i think there's three different buttons there's a subscribe button there's a notification button and there's another one i keep forgetting that what it's called but there's three different ones it shows you at the beginning of each broadcast it kind of does walk you through that but if for any reason we were to get booted off youtube we will go to rumble so remember that r-u-m-b-l-e like bumblebee only it's rumble and that's where we will go next if for some reason they could kick us off we hope they won't do that we like youtube but sometimes they kick people off so all right without further ado let's bring in kat Kerr here i know you all are looking forward to her coming here she is hey kat hi how are you good to see you today yeah it's great it's always great to share with people so i'm excited that's so good now you're slightly off center but it probably doesn't matter they can oh there you go that that works good like that so perfect so Kat we're we're at election time we're in the middle of election the election has not been decided yet tell us anything you want to tell us about the election before we get into questions about heaven well um the father spoke to me yesterday and he of course is still saying trump's winning and you can't look at the normal way things would happen because we're talking about God we're not talking about men or their mindset or even their normal i guess procedures they go through so i am not moved by what the electoral vote said i am not even moved by what happens in georgia uh when they have to do that i'm moved by what God says and i do want to say something because he's very adamant about us making a stand and keeping that stand and i know some people have already backed up you know what you can't just give up or back up because things don't go the way you thought they should this is this issue with man and always has been with God when they think it's not going right the way they thought it should they think either God forgot he changed his mind or maybe he wasn't sure about what he said i mean i know it is i've laughed all day long a lot about and God actually is laughing but you need to know he is making a list he loves lists he has many books he writes in but he told me to say this he's taking note of who steps back especially in the christian leadership especially wow sobering well you know he has said adamantly that he's setting us up for the next 100 years between these 10 year decades these two decades 20 30 and 30 20 40 he's doing some very major changes to set us up to manifest and demonstrate supernatural signs and wonders and during these 20 years will be some of the greatest creativity and ideas and with the ideas we've ever seen God is not concerned with what the other side is saying he is still saying trump will sit in that white house he purposed it back in 2015 was when he told me that would happen and he said it would be for eight years and he said i haven't changed my mind i don't know why people are acting like i have now this is from God himself he said but i am making notes about those who step back who say they speak for me and those who don't want to make a stand and believe and trust me for what i have said especially if they heard God say trump would win he's not changed his mind something's supernatural it will definitely be a suddenly that he will do although it's okay to go through the process he's not against the process or the normal procedures but he has said since the 4th of november that the great fraud would be exposed and excuse me and justice would come so guess what no matter what anyone thinks or anyone's decided it's going to happen and so he is taking notes of those especially in the body of christ in the ministry and the leadership you better pay attention because God is serious whoever doesn't step back they will have the greatest time of celebration of anyone else because they stood with him in this time trusting him no matter what happens they know what God has said will happen and when you obey and when you make that stand and you don't step back and you stay excited great blessings and a broader stronger platform will be given you to speak for him but but those who do not stay and keep their stay in and they back up and not do they just back up they try to get others to agree with them that the other side is one he said they won't have a voice to speak you know decades especially God has always bragged on scripture brags on abraham we called the father of faith because he believed that even if he had to follow through and and slay his son which God told him to do he knew God would if it need be God would raise him from the dead that's why he puts it all the way up to that point and God brags on him to this day we call him the father of faith because he he hoped against all hope that God's word would be true and we all know also that moses was required almost to do you know moses was required to take uh the jews on that long journey but the first part of it was to cross the red sea and so man here's a man we're talking about a lot of people don't understand moses i understand him a lot but uh he was raised right in egypt he was raised as a royalty in the egyptian household he had privileges he had authority he knew pharaoh he knew his um one of his best friends was you know pharaoh's son who entered by being fair in the time when he was tested and every time pharaoh said no we know what happened things came against egypt God delivered him but still and all that he still had to lead them knowing the egyptian army was coming so here's with over one million people probably maybe two million but you need to understand people over women he had to take with him encouraging them saying it's going to be okay God's delivering us out of egypt's hands we're going to be set free and guess what they took the silver and the gold from egypt with them so here they were taking the well through their stand at the edge of the red sea and you know here is here's moses waiting to see what will God say and these people behind me begin to complain because they're in great fear see fear came it always comes when God does something great and you have to step out and stand in faith look how long moses had to wait before the red sea thing and then even after the red sea well sure is what when he told him what to do what happened here's the army after him to take him out or to drag them back and moses was trusting God the whole time moses didn't say i'm giving up and i'm running he never said that he made his stand and the miraculous happened and they crossed on dry ground not soggy ground by land and here comes all the army after them to slay them and they get all the way to the other side and God moves his hand and here comes the cnn to destroy the egyptian army which would have taken out the jewish you know would have taken them out and he had to stand this is one of those times and a lot of people are relating it to at the very same time so in the bible when God was going to do some major changes or shifts for the better the enemy always comes against you you always try to bring fear you'll have people that will argue with you he will make fun of you none of that matters to me i'm going by what God himself has said and he burying near future people running into the streets and celebrating because they were forced to say trump won that's so good that actually brings me into the question uh it's on my list to ask you uh about you know these are not all questions about heaven or questions that they hope you will know but but one of the questions that's being asked is what does it look like in heaven or in the supernatural right now is there a battle going on or is there a bunch of activity in the heavenlies where fighting is going on between angels and demons or what what's going on or is it all just peaceful and the lord's laughing and that's all oh no he is laughing because he already he's seen the okay he's been from the beginning to the end he knows how this will end heaven itself so i gotta gotta correct that heaven itself is not under attack heaven itself is not warring but the armies of heaven certainly are okay doing all kinds of things i myself send them on assignment it's our right as a joint ear with jesus christ and i have sent them continually not just in america but around this world to uncover every hidden lie stealing lying deception fraud all of it openly that it will be known and seen and as God said to say justice will be given justice has also been sent with the army of heaven and they're pulling down strongholds of the demonic controlling the left controlling all kinds of factors involved with this and uh they're not going to escape i'm saying the fraud and the people cheating alive they won't escape and some actually ended by living a life of crime because they said yes to the crime you can't partake of the darkness and think you can just get away with it or or your life will just go back to normal but i'm telling you the army is busy millions all over america uh millions flooding washington dc in the senate in the house in the supreme court they're everywhere and they impact what people say and do uh they can release things of God into these situations so let me tell you they are totally engaged with this whole thing do help make sure that trump will win in the end and justice will be brought so they're very busy they're sent on assignment everywhere concerning the dominions regarding protect evidence to expose more evidence to have people begin to say things like some people have the fear of the lord come on them they begin to they'll begin to squeal and yell louder than you've ever thought and i do know somebody high up i don't know who it is i don't know who it is but a lot of the smaller individuals who did crimes have already talked about it but somebody higher up will eventually give evidence that no one can refute so i'm just saying you hang in there you celebrate because when you show God you really believe him even the walls of jericho i could go on and on they celebrated every day did these crazy things God said to do it didn't matter where in the bible God said do this and it will be okay well he's evil enough to stay in agreement with him to celebrate the victory before it happens call those things to be not as though they already are is what he's saying you're going to live the scripture people and you're going to see great victory come out of it so good now second question that's like that people several have asked this they said Kat said that the the angelic the spirit beings can't really be the people the angels on God's side can't be hurt or harmed so they're saying how then can they fight the demonic realm who are also spirit beings are they also not able to be harmed so they're asking how does that work there's a difference on which side you're on absolutely satan's army can be wounded and they cannot be healed he tries to patch them and depending on what they're made out of and what they're doing but let me tell you i've seen them wounded i've seen the missing eyes i'm talking about satan's army and every battle what happens with the host with the army of heaven don't you give up on what you sent them for or believe for because sometimes they have to turn around and go back mine aren't going back i'm saying they won't they will keep going and going forward with what they have been commanded to do they're an army they need orders they don't they don't take requests okay don't give them a request you have to they have to have orders from headquarters and we are part of that now since we're joiners with christ but you can't step back and what you're making is stand for it says if you step back you're not fit for the kingdom doesn't mean you won't be sent into heaven means that he can't use you like he was using you so whatever you don't don't step back but yes the angels are engaged and yes the enemy can be wounded i've seen like i said before i've seen them being dragged by some of the army of heaven to to be sentenced because of the in the courts of heaven and uh so all kinds of activity takes place they're a real army they have real courts in heaven they have one in heaven itself one out in space outside of heaven and there's a lot of things you don't understand but this is the thing we trust God when he says something and when let me tell you when eighty percent of america already believe trump is the winner God is getting a lot of participate participation from the moral majority probably more than some of the christian leaders because they already know that they know they know what is true and they're not being influenced by other people saying you need to give it up they've already been through it all this time they're not going to give up our backup but heaven's army they don't get wounded they get weary they have to go oh they do yeah the host of heaven they'll get weary from fighting sometimes if it's a long long battle the more you pray the stronger they can fight and that's the truth so don't stop praying and believing you don't have to beg God can you agree with what he wants and you encourage the army to keep fighting and because you know hell doesn't want to let go the devil doesn't just want the presidency people he wants the world yeah oh he wants the whole thing hey now i remember you telling a story about after jesus was crucified he descended into whatever we call it hell or where there was a divide and you said he some of the the evil beings were they were melted is that am i saying that right they melt some of them melted their part of it right [Laughter] when jesus's spiritual body left the cross he descended into abraham's bosom or paradise it was the same place it's where those that God counted righteous because they believed in him they didn't go to hell like abraham isaac jacob i mean i could name all kinds of before christ died on the cross before he died people didn't go up to heaven when they died if they were if they were counted as righteous they were kept in abraham's bosom it's in the middle of the earth it's higher up than hell you can see to the gates of hell from abraham's bosom there's a great divide uh and no one can cross over no one ever crossed over that was where hell was supposed to be reside that's where the wicked dead went but those that God counted as righteous it said when he when jesus went and preached the gospel and he led captivity captive that was when he actually preached the gospel in abraham's bosom he went there preached the gospel when he was done with that he himself which was miraculous in the south crossed over to the gates of hell and waited no one had ever done that before here he is you know the son of God in his spiritual body and he knew he had to go there because he had to take back our authority from satan because adam had given it away and on the third day yes so christ had to wait there in hell they came and took him they didn't do anything to him in the beginning they were afraid God would rescue him this is absolutely true and in colossians it's sad you know on the third day christ stands up and satan is ready to show off in front of all his hierarchy he's invited all of the hierarchy the principalities and powers off their thrones around the world in the spirit realm so they could watch they could see their leader torment the son of God all of this was all known by God that this would happen so christ stands up but right when they were to start their own show christ put a show on in hell and it said he spoiled principalities and powers forever and he made a show of it openly there's the show yes he did melt some of the faces fire came out of his hands he tore up satan he took every gemstone off of him God put on him he took keys of hell death in the grave away from him which was very significant so he put a show on in hell they weren't expecting that and they will not be expecting this great victory that's coming right now there is going to be another show put on in this earth first it was God in heaven when he kicked all them out when satan and one third of the angels were kicked out christ put the second show on in hell when he took absolute authority um because he had a right to they can't keep a righteous man in hell and then he of course after he did all that was when he ascended back up into the tomb he got his body back it was glorified and after that was when the disciples came mary came the stone was rolled away so this is all revelation but it is in the bible so let me tell you we're about to have a great show put on you better get your i love what they said somebody sent out um an image of of trump with some popcorn and he said are you enjoying the show you better get some more popcorn because the second act is about to happen and that is absolutely the truth i remember you saying i think it went back to 2012 God began to speak to you and you'd correct me if i'm wrong but God said let the show begin was it am i saying the year right was it about 2012 well he God will always announce things several years before he does it but i know that he got stronger much stronger in 2014-15 he was having me say that everywhere okay and then he even had me say i actually did a whole um a whole meeting on let the show begin and God said let the show begin that was right uh before the elections and all that stuff started in 2016 and God did say trump is part of the show that's so good well i have a list of other questions so let me go these are in completely random order as they came in and and my apologies to those who are watching we have now several hundred questions behind so we just can't get to them all but i'm going to get to as many as we can but here the next question on my list is what is it like in heaven on jesus birthday well you know most people in heaven they celebrate the day they came to heaven just so you know that people celebrate the the time that they left this earth and moved to heaven you're young again you're not old time isn't really kept track of time is measured by events and so the event of the birth of his son is celebrated in heaven they celebrate in christmas town and all of heaven celebrates it they do bring gifts to christ everybody wants to give gifts to him anyway they make sure he gets a hug and they rejoice over the fact that God was very victorious and triumphant and sending his son to be born to have a body to have authority in the earth you have to have a body to have authority spirits can't really rule without us allowing them to or them using people to do that but in heaven they certainly celebrate the birth of christ and everyone remembers the glorious time they probably re-watch it because there's ways that they've recorded things in heaven everyone can re-watch the whole birth when the army of heaven had to come and sing at the birth of christ uh that was a sight to be seen when gabriel came to announce it you know this is the glory outside the manger in the sky the glory in the sky that happen and they all love to see that especially the army of heaven they love to see that because they remember that was not easy for them uh they don't necessarily sing and people think every angel sings every angel is not a worship angel they worship but it really was it was required of them to come and sing for his birth and the army was the ones that were chosen because the ones who got kicked out um were the ones that that lucifer was over that 130 angels were kicked out of heaven they followed lucifer and a creative being instead of the creator but they certainly celebrate the birth of christ i keep being asked over and over can i re-watch the one the angels came and sang bethlehem can i re-watch my birth can i really watch what life was like on the earth before i was born can i re-watch uh these events that jesus took place can you can you do that everything that ever happened in the bible was all recorded so everybody can watch any of that in heaven they have certain places you go to see it it's some it's amazing you can even watch as a place called creation lab you can go in and watch God when he made the physical realm and first the plan is there and from there on you can watch all the activities that happen in the bible but you yourself you have your own theater and people can come and see your life from the time leaving heaven until you were knit together in your mother's womb until your birth watch your life no sin is involved in that but all the silly fun things that you got to do growing up everyone can go and see that and a lot of people love to do that so yes God records things he recorded like all these events going on right now he's recording them so make sure you're looking up at the camera and smiling okay now i keep being asked this question over and over and i keep saying i'm not going to ask this but i'm going to go ahead and ask it because people keep asking can we pray people out of hell i don't know if this is catholic doctrine or why they're asking that but they want to know if they can pray people out of hell i'm pretty sure i probably have a clue about what they talk about as purgatory there is no purgatory and i'll probably have a lot of catholics argue that's okay i love them anyway they're going through what the traditional one's always been tradition has always been however i'm not saying you can necessarily you cannot pray people out of hell that have been there for you know a year five years ten years that is not possible but if you ever made a stand for your loved one's salvation to know christ to not miss their destiny to be together in heaven with jesus and you for eternity and to know him as their savior if you make that stand then christ can use the keys and i rarely talk about this but but i've been given permission by the father if somebody asked christ there's a reason why he took the keys away from satan it was was it hell death in the grave or you could say death the craven hell however you want to say it doesn't matter what order you put them in those are three keys and they do something and they were taken away from satan so he could no longer manipulate those those are all about synchromens increments of time that they can be used and they were never meant for him to have and so christ took them when he was in hell on the third day he took them back and those keys because of our declarations we make over our family members give christ permission at the very time of death and you know i forgive anyone who bashes me i'm sorry i gotta say what the father has shown me at the very time of their death before they go anywhere step out of their body christ has the right and permission to meet with them and say do you want me now and then our testimonies given by people around the world before i even spoke about this um i knew about it but i didn't really speak about it in the beginning where that actually happened to them they were actually descending into hell and jesus came and took them out and talked to them and said because if your mother's prayers and her not giving up on you i have to ask you if you want me now these people know that they're sinners they know that they're that they are uh condemned to hell because of them not receiving christ and so they have that moment that they can make a decision you can do that but you cannot go rescue people have been there for years that's just not going to happen those are time frames of death when you right die uh before you're in that grave and before they've got you in hell those are time frames sometimes they happen at different when there could be a few days within there i just know this you better be praying for your family members now why sure why are you about this it's not something you want to argue about it says if you declare and believe a thing and do not doubt in your heart you shall have whatsoever you say and that means that you as family members are people who love these people like family have the greatest authority in the spirit realm when you pray so instead of fighting with your unsafe family members tell them you love them but you're going to pray for them don't get drawn into fights or arguments and then you separately go aside and say God i'm making a stand for the salvation of my family member i do not want to see my dad in hell i want my dad to become a christian so i'm making a stand for his salvation in jesus name he'll he'll be a witness and a testimony to the saving power of jesus christ that we will spend eternity together in in heaven and you make that stand and then i'm sure after that happens the devil will try to use that person you pray for to be even meaner or nastier to you because the devil is trying to make you drop that declaration the bible says what you dare to decree or declare it will be what established unto you so the devil would like to take your words away don't let him do that do you make a stand for your family members and jesus said you will be surprised to see who actually makes it to heaven it will be because of your prayers and he said that to me the first time he caught me up to heaven you know and i i've told people on this platform so this is not secret i've said it several times you know my father was extremely abusive both to my sisters and to myself and yet i know he's with the lord now because we pray them in and in his case he received the lord on his deathbed he called for the pastor he actually was a pastor but he wasn't really a saved man but he called for the pastor and got his heart right and i knew he went to be with the lord and what people will need to understand and maybe you can address this when my father went to be with the lord 30 years ago he left behind a big mess and to this day it's a huge mess can you talk about that for a minute how about the person who's gone to be with the lord and you know there's that scripture that says their works do surely follow them well in a weird way my dad's evil works are still following him on this earth even though he's with the lord what do you have any thoughts about that i'm sure that he's probably up there declaring and believing that they will learn how to lose all that stuff from their soul the way the best way to break anything that's affecting your life usually it's trauma that you've been put through because of a loved one and usually it's the hardest i guess i'd have to say the worst hurt you'll ever feel now i have godly parents my mom is still with me my dad is in heaven but my dad was like my best friend he loved even his enemies and i'm telling you he was slam bash trash made fun of and you know what he actually like it never happened which is what bible says and it's hard because you're hurting in here and my dad didn't even know about losing all that stuff from your soul so you didn't have to carry it around with you he made a decision i'm not going to be used by the devil i'm not going to take what he's saying i know he's using these people i'm going to choose to love anyway and people who've been through that i my my greatest prayer is they learn about the keys to the kingdom that what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven that that that wicked thing that was done to you or that harmful hurdle thing that was done for you you don't have to keep it inside of you the word says that you can loose it you lose it out of your soul because what you experience what you watch what you hear what people say to you it goes in the layers of your soul and that's why you keep thinking about it that's why the enemy can use that trauma and he'll replay and replay and replay it you can stop that by not keeping it inside of yourself but by losing all those cares all those hurts those wounds those traumas those crushing harmful words that keep you down to keep you crushed in a whole God doesn't want you to live like that the bible actually says cast your care upon christ because he cares for you but you also can loose it from your soul and then you bind this is important you bind the things of God can you imagine if you go watch extremely violent movies for 10 years how much violence do you have inside your soul right you listen to profanity all the time it's eventually going to come out even if you don't swear because you're storing it you lose the junk out of your soul and you jesus name and then you bind the things of God at any time in your life you can say i bind God's love his presence his purpose his will his way his creativity you know what no one can take that from you so good you don't just let the past go you let it out of you you let it out of you then it's not in there to bring you turmoil and after you've done that if the enemy tries to bring you back say no thanks yeah that's good got it out i'm not taking the junk back i'm living my life for God and then every day every day when you get up you say father i ask for grace for abundant life and he'll send you fuel from heaven all this changes you is called heaven culture when you have a culture you don't need to keep anything i don't care if something happened to you i have prayed with people that 30 years ago were horribly abused by two or three different husbands because the stuff so they get rid of that when they find someone else who's the same way that's why people do that that's why a criminal goes back to the same crimes it's in here but in here you will think about you will choose and you will do it again so get that stuff out bind the life and the love of God to you and then you will be powerful you be victorious and you will be free the truth will make you free so God never intended i have to add this God didn't put you with somebody because he knew you would be tormented he sent you with somebody because it was a purpose and a family line that he was wanting to complete and he chose you to be that person he didn't make that person wicked they made their own choices the enemy the enemy doesn't love any of us he doesn't love even any of his own so if you know people like that help them to choose to loose that junk out of their soul and and choose christ bind the things of God to the soul and they're like to me to people they say it's like it never happened to them that's so good now i keep being asked this and this list and i've got here's i got a lot a lot of things here you can't really see them out but there there are at least three or four questions that are the same question they're saying if i had a guardian angel which they believed that they did how then did it become possible for that abuse to happen or why did the guardian angel who's a guardian allow that i mean there's probably no easy answer for this uh i guess we're not looking for an easy answer but what what would you say to somebody who said if i had a guardian angel why did he let that happen i think that they have boundaries that they also have to keep they can't number one they can't attack people and i know a lot of people would like for them to attack people uh so there's boundaries set when they're sent from heaven on your behalf and i will say this when the most important things that can happen is for a young person even your children teach them right away about their authority over the enemy most people didn't even know they had authority and so a lot of them if they suffered under that stuff they would run away or they would try to escape in other things when they got older and yet God never intended them to go through that so that wasn't God's purpose we we can pray for people to know God and pray that they turn from what their wicked ways which God talks about in the bible and yet their mind they have their own mind their own will and they choose all the time and sometimes the reason just not that it makes it any better sometimes that happened to them and that wasn't necessarily a family curse it's something they experience that eventually shows up in their life make sure it doesn't show up in yours i can say the best thing about all this is you don't have to carry that stuff on in your own life or with your own children make sure you're not doing that you can still bring glory to God and though you've been through a lot you can still bring glory to God don't walk around beat up like no one cares about you because God does love you the angels have boundaries and there have been times when they have just rescued them completely and just taking them to another place or help them to get to other people for help but because God made a decision when he made man will i control them or will i let them make their own decisions and let them choose their own life he didn't want a bunch of robots we're not robots the angels aren't robots guess what the angels had to choose too and so we make our choices in the earth and let me tell you uh there's a lot of people that wish they had done things differently in heaven the thing about being in heaven is no one has grief and i know some people think that people should suffer even though they receive christ but that is how far reaching the grace is if you repent like you never did it that's why it's important to repent because he couldn't let you come to heaven carrying all that stuff in you so if you know people if you know children that are under that attack pray for them you send your army over there to help on their behalf because i know kids who are 10 and 8 who are living in places like that that aren't tolerating the acts of the enemy and they have the army of heaven coming to pull the demonic away from their parents wow if they were born in a time when this was possible to know and it will be well known one day that they do have authority over the darkness it says so if they're a believer i got saved at age four and knew i was saved and i learned early on that i didn't have to tolerate the things the enemy but also learned i couldn't participate with him so yeah it's this is a deep question i don't even think it's theological i think it's a life it's the way you live your life and what you choose to live and these people who didn't repent for it i know where they are and i've been to hell and seen hell and i'm telling you it's never worth it to give yourself to the enemy and right now it's not worth it either so God can remove all of that like it never happened to you and just like the little babies who are waiting on their parents and praying that their parents make it to heaven even if they aborted them they want their parents so i always tell people when i get a chance please repent of that and when you do die and go to heaven if you repent receive christ you get those babies back they're not going to be angry they're not going to be going to be in love with you because God's grace it's all about his grace but he doesn't control us like the devil wants to control God requires surrender but the devil wants to control and so you remember that now on on a person i have several questions on this Kat where someone has said um either recently or in this list where they go you know i've forgiven everybody for everything that i can think of but i simply cannot forgive my father or my mother for what they did i just can't do it talk about that for a minute what are the consequences for that i think you mean the one you mean not being able to forgive right yeah yeah the bible is very clear about and there there's a line and there's always a line in there it's not like if you're out of anger or out of attack if you say you've just done too much i can't i can't handle the agony or the suffering so i'm not ever going to forgive you that doesn't mean they'll stay in that place God understands what they just went through i think if they died at that moment even when they went to they would still go to heaven if they knew christ or they had an opportunity to receive him at their death i'm just saying that um there's a line it's just the same thing with suicide not everything is suicide sometimes it's just ending your suffering not ending your life it's the same situation uh unforgiveness is something that just moves in and takes over you and that your will then embraces so your emotions can say things and you can even think things but it has to be your will you choose with your will to not forgive and more people are not in unforgiveness they're in suffering they're in suffering and they're in agony of what happened to them they can't talk about it they'll hide from those people they don't want to see the face of those people because it causes them pain and suffering so i think only God knows who has unforgiveness in them and i tell people if you have it you have to get rid of it so what do you do you don't involve your emotions you're already in a turmoil about all the stuff going on maybe some people are still being verbally abused by these people um i would try say try to limit your your time with them you know let them know you love them you're praying for them but you don't have to submit yourself to continue abuse from them but you can't go around you know who you're making happy the people don't care most of the people don't care because if they're already in a violent state their self they don't care that you don't want to forgive them and uh you're hurting when you say those words but you don't want to let satan win and end up with both of you this is what you say it's always what you say your words are so powerful um your words are probable you just say God even though my flesh does not want to forgive them you say these words i choose as an act of my will to forgive them anyway and in his name i'm trusting you to line up my emotions with the declaration i just made and people will be shocked you might have to say it more than once if those saying things flow back again you say it again but you're not saying it from the emotional turmoil you're not saying it from your turmoil you're saying it your will what you choose with is what you will do is what you will say and i've helped many people get rid of unforgiveness and they will connect i'm choosing to forgive because an act of my will i know God doesn't want me to have unforgiven so i'm not keeping it i choose to forgive my father whoever else that my father my uncle whoever that was that abuse you you say their name i choose my will to forgive them in jesus name and God will go and write it down the day you said that that's good and you will begin to lose the holy spirit onto that person because when you have unforgiveness it's almost like a chain not just a soul tie a chain is formed in the spirit which makes it almost impossible because you're making this i'll never do this i hate them i don't want to do this a chain is there it's not just a soul tie which is almost like i would say it looks sort of like threads woven together that ties you together whether it's a bad soul tie or a good one it's so hard to break it when it becomes that hardness of your heart gets in there it looks like a chain a solid chain you don't want that to happen choose what you will to to forgive the people forgive the company who took your job away forgive people who are ugly and hateful to you say it as an act of your will and God will make sure he begins to do something on the soul and the soul that person you the only way that this the other thing's important you may be the only reason they ever get to heaven if you don't hold something against them it gives God the right to pursue them that's really good now someone's actually several people have brought up the situation and they said i know family is so important to God and i've now forgiven this person or persons am i now because family is so important am i now supposed to be spending time with those family members that did that that's the question i will tell you this if they're still abusing you know even though you've forgiven them they may not have changed at all like i said before spend limited time with them you can let them know that you love them but you can also let them know that you're praying for them i'm not saying you go back to them now that you've done that so you can get abused again don't do that good God didn't ask us to come to this earth and to have to put up with abuse he did good things and great things for us don't stop praying for them but until you see a a noted change in them let them make the effort you're not holding anything against them send them a gift send them a card let them know you still care but you do not have to go before them all the time continually so you can be still beat up that's really really really good okay one last question we'll keep it on the light note some kids want to know because my children want to know how noah built the ark if there was no heavy machinery in that day i don't know if you would know the answer to that he he gave noah so much revelation that he actually developed things that we didn't even have yet in that time and you know he's done that more than once in the earth by the way he's given greater revelation even now he does that some people just get great revelation they're called inventors or creators and noah had devised a system that God gave him because you know it took him a hundred years 100 years to build that ark and and and the whole time he was building it he was being laughed at by the wicked people who said it never rained let alone flooded before they were making fun of him all the way up to when the ark doors were closed but he had revelation on how to shift weight and what to use to shift the weight of the beams and stuff that he would need to be placed in there and of course his sons were there to help so i would have to say he didn't have help from the nephilim uh please don't watch the movie the new movie was made a few years ago the shows you know noah had help from the nephilim the great giants came and helped him no they didn't do that it was by effort alone that God asked him to do that and when he asked you to do it he gives things that you need he might not give to other people in this situation but he absolutely was successful and it is about shifting weights and balances my dad used to build so i understand that the most ordinary person might not but he was successful and this is the thing let up even under all the barrage so that's so good hey Kat tell people how they can get a hold of your website you got a couple of websites tell us tell them how to get ahold of them heaven.com which is the name of my books and that was just the most convenient one to pick if you go to revealingheaven.com you find out about events you find out about all the products we have that represent heaven reveal heaven or we have things that ideas like such as this it says i don't do demons there's the copper that cop that lightning bolt reminds the when they were kicked out of heaven on lightning bolt so you know we we don't necessarily want to make things to bash people we don't mind bashing the enemy and reminding you he's already lost so you can go and find out that kind of stuff or you can go to KatKerr.com and find out more revelation you can find out declarations to make for your family over all kinds of things and that's God's spiritual platform to say what he wants to when he wants to and it's the only way if you choose to give to me uh you may go there to KatKerr.com and uh i don't have any other place out there so if you see other facebooks and say Kat Kerr this can't create that and they're asking for money that is not me that's good good you know ken thank you so much this has just been amazing i learned every single time i i can't wait to hear the answers a lot of these questions i wouldn't have asked myself because i thought well i don't know if i really want to know that but every single time i do ask it i think i learned something so thank you so much for being such a great teacher and a detailed person as we've talked about before so God bless you thanks again kat and so we're on uh let's see i'm supposed to tell people what tomorrow's show is donna rigney tomorrow donna's been to heaven many times as well so you will enjoy donna tomorrow so thanks say thanks again Kat i bless you and we love you give our love to be yours in jesus name be blessed be free be excited because God's got great things coming that's so good God bless all right

well hello it's steve schultz here with the elijah list it's good to hear you or see you it's wednesday if you're down under it's thursday but we're here talking january 6. this is that big event day in washington dc if you're in the united states and both houses of uh the congress the senate and the house are meeting together to talk about this election so we'll talk a little bit about that with kat it's good to point out to you all that uh generally speaking almost never including today i don't talk to kat ahead of time about what she's going to say what remarks she has what stance she still holds or doesn't hold anything like that we just take it as it comes and so um that keeps it kind of cleaner so you know we're not in the back of the saying what should we say today so i'm about going to be just as interested as you are in what Kat has to say today we're really in crucial times uh some may remember that chuck pierce is prophesied that we won't know the answer until january 18. we won't know who or what specifically and his dates have been quite accurate sometimes you don't quite know what you will see on that date that you know something really significant that you can point your finger will happen on that date related to that issue so these are going to be really interesting times be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel so far they have not kicked us off so we still like them as long as they like us on the youtube channel you just go to youtube and then under the search box type elijah streams either as one word or two words it will pull us right up there's a way to subscribe there's a red button that says subscribe um to the left of that there's a thumbs up just hit the thumbs up hit the subscribe and then there's a bell to the right which says you want to be notified when something comes on from us so okay what else do i want to say we are in year 23 of bringing you the voice of the prophets and uh 2021 is going to be extremely active no matter how this stuff goes and turns out there's going to be a lot of fresh revelation that's coming to you so don't expect that once this whole thing's decided that things will slow down they'll probably speed up i think that's probably on what i have to say on my list today be sure and tell your family and friends about us and so without further ado let's bring Kat online here on the table see if the horn is on and there she is good to see you Kat people should know you we can see you but you cannot see if you're just looking into a camera so yeah i accidentally interrupt you one time is because you don't see me opening my mouth so well here you are on january 6th and i asked jen about two minutes ago before you came on has has Kat looked at the things that were going on on tv and she said no not really she doesn't so i i kind of like that because it means you're not looking at the news and reacting to the news whatever you're going to say is going to be what you say not related to the news is that about right that is correct it's only what God says that i respond to sounds good well without further ado then let's go ahead and whatever you want to say in relation to the elections and where we are today the floor is yours okay that works as good as uh doing right now i am wearing heaven's colors today these are revelator colors you see the eyes that represent the living creatures around the throne of God no one up there is in travail no one up there is in fear they already know what the outcome is going to be this is the outcome [Applause] hey karen you don't know this you don't know this but you said you told me once the heavens colors was teal was kevin's favorite color during picked out a teal shirt for me today and a child that has teal we pretty much match and we didn't know this that's kind of the way God works with prophetic people these things are just regular everyday things but they fall into place just like God wants them to so and he's absolutely right there is nothing pre-planned except that i come and sit in this stool at my media desk if you are hearing from God all the time if you've been to heaven so many times you lost count and so i i hear God every day talking about this why would i watch the news with fear with assumptions with um lies we know that already and i won't say this we will have a new network that people can trust and so i'm not sure when that will happen if God gives me a date then i will give you that date but i can tell you this trump is one he already has one and God keeps reminding that don't say that he has to he hopefully he'll win God said he has won and so he has one and everything is going to be revealed and like chuck peter said he has a date that's great usually God will tell me this is going to happen then he shows me it happening and i don't mean it happening why would i be moved by anything out there and if you're standing with God by the way he said keep standing don't lose your stand don't step back don't get in fear don't get in doubt the enemy wants you to be there the enemy controls by fear and obviously so does the left i only hear things every now and then if my staff mention something but actually none of them are allowed to even talk to me about anything from any source of news media or anything or any other people out there i'm not allowed to listen to it God wants me to have none of that in the layers of my soul so he can feel me what he has to say and what he shows me and then there's no cloudiness in there okay what you get is straight from the throne of God and they are celebrating in heaven why because one and you may not see that in the natural but everything happens in the spirit first okay it's not the other way around things happen in the spirit first and then that impacts this natural world and when you say when you say that that God shows you he takes and shows you what happened this can you describe what you what you mean what did you see in either your natural eyes or your spiritual eyes what did he show you specifically when i say he showed me i don't mean he gave me a vision i don't mean he gave me a dream i mean he took me into the future that may be word to you why it happened in the bible it happened in the old testament i know that john the beloved was shown things from the past and he was showing things from the future what about revelations what do you think that word means a revelation comes from the heart of God it does not come from the mind of man it doesn't come from something that's been written down unless somebody got revelation and they wrote that down so revelation is from God himself he is sitting on his throne jesus christ is right there next to him and millions and millions i could say billions of angels especially the army has been sent here and right now for all of you who are in dc there are actually this is going to be really something you there are 50 billion angels there wow not million not million nobody has a number oh you know i don't think God's given anybody a number of how many exist i just know that God has a whole lot more than than what lucifer God or satan controls that's why he has to use people okay satan controls people and when he finds a group of people he goes wild this is a thing i have learned about satan when he thinks he's one he gets very sloppy he gets beyond bold he gets crazy and he will begin to make those people that he has influenced and have convinced through fake news media and other sources he has convinced them no matter what the evidence is against them that he has got satan has convinced him they've won and so they'll start saying crazy things they would never say in public they would never say uh to a news source and i do know that some of that stuff is happening just crazy stuff that they're they're making up and they've already got all their plans made guess who has plans God in heaven and you know you heard the gavel the last time okay God is definitely bringing justice he doesn't change what he says when the bible says there's no shadow of turning that means several different things that means he's not changing his mind he chose america for himself and on in 2016 he actually came and laid his hand his entire hand on this country and he said i'm going to turn america red that's what he said i'm taking for myself for the next 24 years i will be allowed permitted and welcomed into the white house so let me tell you do you think because of all this rabble and all this stuff going on do you think he changed his mind do you think he can't make things happen go back and read your bible some of the greatest days of celebration and when i said he showed me he took me forward in time not it wasn't a long time forward in time and he showed me when that announcement is made that trump is the 46th president of the united states and that announcement will be made i'm not saying it'll be made today you know that doesn't move me right it's okay the due process and what we feel like we have to do or what the courts feel whoever says they're not greater than God he showed me people running out of buildings in towns and cities and all over not just america and they were shouting and they were blowing these silly horns so if you can find left over in clearance somewhere you go get some you will need it i saw people celebrating they were grabbing and dancing they were laughing out loud not in just america but around the world you may not know this but if you think God is going to ignore prayers from this world that are for his plans he's not ignoring that he already had the plan but when people come into agreement for what God wants which is justice righteousness liberty in freedom there's a great celebration in the spirit realm in heaven there's terror in hell and i can tell you hell is terrified and even if they don't say it God has told me some of the hearts of some of the left terror is about to overtake them wow some of them already realize they're not going to get away with it see they can't show that but they're about to tell it so let me tell you i really am here to encourage you and i will be coming on myself later on today several times a day just to encourage everybody in dc anybody who wants to listen uh God will keep saying things throughout this day he knows that people are there he knows they're there to pray to declare to worship and let me tell you it delights his heart and all the hosts that are there can hear that they're probably dancing right now so you have to go beyond what your natural eyes see or your ears here and really understand that if you belong to God he has number one not appointed you under wrath he has not appointed you to even be here in the harsh times when they do come i've been taking over 100 years into the future literally caught up and taken to that time and the tribulation had not happened the perilous times had not com y we've been living in some of the greatest days the earth has ever seen and that's what is about to happen right now God is literally exposing it all so he can clear that platform and set in place the ones he trusts and the ones he's going to use in these days to be great for him so kick fear out get your celebration on get ready for one of the biggest celebrations the world has ever seen and actually the father told me last night because i'm always up late at night he said this will be one of the biggest celebrations that has happened since christ went into hell on the third really stood up in hell and wasted the principalities and powers in front of satan and stripped the gems off of satan and took the keys to hell death in the grave away the greatest that was the greatest horrific thing that could have happened well they're about to get really really hard and their plans will become dust so keep that in your heart no matter what you see here here today God said don't start shooting people i know all you read next this message is your God the God he made you redneck and all don't shooting people to think that you can change and handle it yourself you say this though he isn't saying you can't protect yourself right not against america having guns and having weapons to defend themselves i can tell you the hosts have weapons right yeah they do military oh go ahead steve no no that was good i i i was saying i'm gonna say i have a couple sons and laws that i love very much you can only have two and they they're both great they both are gun toting bible bible quote and gun toting you know and uh one of them lives on 80 acres i think i live on a big spread with 20 acres he lives on 80 acres you know and he's like he's a farmer and he works also for a major oil company they're very successful and our oldest daughter is married to him but you know the guys they you know they're comparing they they're blowing my mind the other day the two sons-in-laws and they copy me which is fine i like being part of the company on what they want you know they went and got ammo they don't really expect to be in the war but they want to be able to protect themselves yeah and you know what i was saying would show me something and i'd say well you know be careful don't feast on the violent fights that you see breaking out here and there don't feast on that i said maybe i need to be a little more aware but you probably need to be a little less aware you go yeah you're probably right so you know you're a good guy he's a good guy you know no i have i have generations of family members that were in the military probably every branch of the military and of course even my husband the marines and let me tell you he's a tough guy he doesn't say much yes he packs heat my husband packs guns he he does no matter where we go he's licensed to carry and guess what so is margaret okay my gun wow i have the biggest guns of all they're 150 feet tall and i have many of them around me who they actually have orders from headquarters to take anyone down that if they think that they're going to touch me and that's not bragging that's telling you the truth so God said i would not even be allowed to pray for mercy for someone who thought that they would hurt me so the guns i have and that i carry with me you can't see them but the enemy your spiritual enemy my spiritual enemy he can see them and anyone is an army from heaven you have the same ones around you and God's day is changing things to be more spiritually aware but powerfully spiritually aware of who you are in jesus christ i'm not saying any of this outside of him i'm saying it's because of what he said i give you power over all the power of the enemy but you rule in the spirit realm which then impacts greatly what goes on in this natural realm and if you think i've been sitting in a corner somewhere reading a nice little book you're very wrong i rule all night i take my staff and go in the middle of the road at three a.m it's my birthday and i send that army everywhere and let me tell you they've had a lot of activity and no one will escape being exposed so just rest assured even though it may not come up the way you thought it would or you wanted it would doesn't mean that something is going to it's not going to happen it will happen and i saw victory already in the streets all over this world it's going to happen that's so so good so so so good such good news you know and i i have a little bit obligated to see some news but it's it's the least amount of news i've ever watched but because we do nike christian news i have to be a little bit aware but um but you know i i keep turning it off and turning it off and my relationship with the lord keeps growing so there's a direct relationship are you ready for some questions about heaven oh yes i am i'm just so excited about everything else go ahead go ahead well if there's anything else you want to add be sure and do it is there anything else you want to say about where we are right now there was one new revelation God gave me yesterday yeah go for it go for it say God i'm talking about the father you know he trained his son correct and he does still train the father does train he trains his sons and daughters and uh when you go home to heaven you go home as his son and his daughter and so he doesn't ever stop that relationship of being our father but if anybody knew anything it would be him and when we line up with God's plans then we're covered but he was talking to me about the keys to the kingdom and i rarely ask him a question people say ask him this i'm not going to do it he fills me with revelation okay and if i have a thought or something that maybe i may say it just briefly like like yesterday i was saying is there anything else that i don't know about the keys to the kingdom that would give us power in ways we don't understand good question this was the father's answer what you will allow to happen on the earth i will allow but what you will not allow i will not allow he said that is part of the keys to the kingdom that you have authority and my son gave you those keys this is for all believers he gave you the keys to the kingdom how valuable was that kingdom the greatest value of anything in the earth in existence is the kingdom why that's where your power is that's what your authority is and he said you need to start saying i will no longer tolerate the lying cheating stealing witchcraft violence illegal activities in my government i won't tolerate it i no longer will allow it to take place in jesus name that is my ruling and that is what i have to say about that what you dare to declare he will match your declaration so instead of running around saying all this other stuff especially those in dc you make sure you're saying that you can point right at the capitol wherever you want to point at you make that declaration your words have power they have power in the spirit realm but also in the natural realm and guess what will happen fear will begin to fall on all those doing those things if we don't stand up standing up and not moving doesn't mean you're being silent that means you're making a ruling because you're kings and priests unto your God those rulings are heard all the way into heaven they will begin to impact all those people doing that because you are saying no and that's those are spiritual words they're like missiles you're releasing from yourself because we were made in the image of God so this is a brand new revelation and i have never shared that anywhere before is still using the keys to the kingdom you operate in the kingdom you rule in the kingdom so you make sure you're saying that if someone says what's going on i'm not tolerating that happening satan's not taken my country it belongs to God and i'm agreeing with him so so good so good yeah there there's the justice thing and by the way uh you know about sending out the host which you talked about you know i learned that from you a few a month or so ago we had a breach and we never have anyone that breaches our security we don't really have much security there's a gate but and you should have seen take off after you know sending the hosts out to protect that not another thing has ever happened since then i mean i sent host around every you know place in the gate on the gate around the gate around the property you know on the neighbor's property around the county you know i was just placing you know i didn't want anything close to you if you have invited heaven's army to be your body your mighty weapon they are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds that's in the spirit realm you post those hosts around you on your property when you go somewhere you ask them to do traffic control and you'll never have an accident i know we live that way when you're going on a trip send them to take the plane send them in the airport send them where you're going and i started flooding dc two days ago with the army of heaven to keep people from being harmed now i can't control the flesh and if people get in the flesh [Laughter] just repent for getting in the flesh but if you already do command and army and there's actually millions of people that do and you can shake your heads all you want to why argue you want to die no i'm sorry not a joke though it's not a joke in this day because you can see the darkness getting stronger but it will never be greater than the light or glory of God that's in you but part of our weapons is that army from heaven and they will fight for you and some won't just fight in the spirit so i'm just letting you know things are going to rapidly begin to change for the God and for the better in our lives but don't ignore the fact that you have that army i post mine continually and they go with me everywhere i go and you will begin to see them in the sky over your home they don't go back to heaven they're with you the whole time you're here and we will have to do maybe one time which is one of the things because we're not going to stop doing these i don't know that we'll do them every week stephen i already had decided God had decided but we'll take one session probably train people how to invite the army of heaven really train them how to send them how to command them and to protect yourself and your family all the time and you know i'm i'm not really a seer i do have seer events but i don't walk in it all the time like you do although you know that's my goal but i prayed for this property for years even before i met you we we just used to pray angels we didn't know about the armies we didn't know about sending the hosts once we learned the host then now it became a more targeted setting the armies of heaven around in doing that i've had some people drive by who didn't know what this property was you can see it from the main highway there's a little bit on the hillside not really high but a little bit of a slope and we're right in the middle because there's farmland around us it's not even our farmland and then they would meet me later and say wait a year then they find out you're the one that lives on that property right in the corner and such and such they go man i drove by that and i saw the the complete hillside filled with angels and fiery you know angels and and of course i was clueless all i knew is projection was was with me you know i didn't see that so i just really want to encourage people whether you see it or not doesn't matter you know what you need to do is you need to send the host to heaven so well let's ask a couple of questions here um these are kind of in random order let me just i'm trying to decide which way to go i do want to say this i just need to say one more thing go ahead um chen will hold notes up in front we do still do old school because i'll be going 100 miles an hour of revelation and when you've had even recent encounters with God like right before i came out here i was shaking the presence of God because it is his purpose for you to hear what he is saying and he means everything he's saying and one thing he wants to do right now is he's going to validate vice president mike pence he has not changed his mind about pence and if you haven't heard this on on the inauguration day for trump i was one of the people because they had like three or four different prayer breakfasts but in the one i was in i was actually the one chosen to pray for uh president trump and vice president pence and at that meeting when i opened my mouth out came God's words and he said trump will sit for eight years in the white house and after trump pence i have chosen him he will be president for eight years after trump and then after that whoever mike picks as his vice president that person will sit in the white house for eight years i will have 24 years of God consuming the white house guess what he hasn't changed his mind and he wants people to stop bashing vice president pence because those are thoughts the enemy's giving you and he doesn't want people to think that he's been validated God in this moment is telling you he has validated him he chose him and anointed him he's been a believer a long time he doesn't have the same character okay it won't be quite as a show as it is right now God is not changing his mind he validates pence his family strong believers lies are starting to be told about him and people are always asking me and i say why have you asked me when God already said what he was going to do so yes pence can be trusted and he is very close to president trump and they meet all the time not just for business but their families do things so many things together and i know people and i'm not ever going to say their names but i know people who are with them all the time and let me tell you pence is already presidential looking but he he is term until after these four years are over and trust me he will sit in that white house for eight years so get used to him being there there you go Godzilla you know i'm glad you i'm glad you're starting to interrupt me because what you didn't know is that's where one of the places i was going and i i have on my list three or four things and i call these people throwing away their good questions that they could ask about having their salvation out of our route to say what happens why do we need merchants and things like that and on my list i have put some things where i feel like they're just kind of throwing away their their questions that they had because first of all it takes us a week or two to get to your question and they're asking questions about a couple days from now so they're here's my list is bigfoot real what's gonna happen with pants are these rumors true about parents and a bunch of those um what's gonna happen congress meets today because that one got to me today and i just brought it up for um an example and then i even wrote down this one i mean i might be mildly curious about this but but i'm not sure it's your purview you're welcome to tell me you'd happy to answer this one says whether our ark or the ark of the covenant be found and so i just use these examples don't necessarily they may not be thrown away if Kat wants to answer some of those but i see people burning their opportunity by asking questions that probably is not what where you want to say so anything there you want to answer i would just say i think that that there are somebody there's people out there probably the right people who already know where the ark of the covenant is and if they're who they're supposed to be they won't be blasting that from the housetops you have to understand there are some things that God shows people on purpose to prayer or to cover or to even to protect sometimes and i'm sure that there are somebody out there probably possibly some of the jews that know where the ark of the covenant is and he's not telling me and it's not my job to know i just know it's very real i can assure you it's real i've seen the one in heaven that the one on the earth represents except the things on that ark uh that of the ark of the covenant they're real like the it talks about the angels it talks about the seraphim that their wings touch over the ark of the covenant i'm talking about the one on the earth okay and heavens are a lie they're living and they do cover over the things of their powerful things that God declares there and things that happen still there in the ark of the covenant the one in heaven uh but i can tell you this that God has many people he's placed in covert operations if your mind has never considered considered i'm not saying you have to become one although he may ask you to be one in the spirit there are covert operations surrounding everything that's going on and i'm talking about for justice i can't talk about those things and i'm not going to tell anybody what they are i can just assure you i know it's happening in the spirit i know what the outcome of everything will be that there will be great celebrations in the streets and i'm not the only one that God is showing this but he does show me that there that trump will sit in that white house for four years whether it's now whether it's in february and this is what he has said it doesn't matter if you if they show you them sifting bite in there i'll kick him out clean it off and i will put trump there so you have to understand in your mind you have to stand when he says stand and stand therefore that means you're going to trust and believe God this is what's going to happen when it happens and you've heard it from many sources your faith will explode it will grow no it won't it will explode God said no he said it will explode because you will have seen the fruit of your own lips and your stance that you made but God just said to let them know this there are covert operations happening now and because you hear certain people say things and you're shocked about that person i'm not talking about there isn't evil going on everywhere there's liars and friars everywhere and that's what God calls them but there are some who've stood firm and have been asked to say certain things to appear something so that's why you cannot take everything you're seeing and throw in one stew pot and say this is what's going on and so you might you don't want to uh step beyond what about what uh the bones or boundaries that God has given us ourselves here but there are some covert operations going on that no one in the trump administration is going to talk about and these are people because i understand you know there's a few people that probably need to be removed not not pence or any of them like that there's a few people that probably will be fired i know some that will never be fired but i will just say this there are friends of theirs overseas in certain countries that are friendly that have appeared to do something or say something so they can get uh information and that's probably the closest i can get to any of that so you don't think this is all there is right here this is what there is you don't understand covert really good covert activities there's stuff you don't even know that's here not even the left i know i go to the left okay i think this is your left whatever whatever it is okay there's things they don't know about and you know still at all when you're in the middle of deep covert operation so pray for all those who are in that place that God has put in that place that the president has possibly put in that place um there's just things i have always known for many years before any of this stuff before any of the stuff even started happening and so i'm just seeing you know prophecy take place or things that God has shown me himself i'm seeing them taking place it's going to be good it's good well that's it and that's that's exciting because i see the enthusiasm and the excitement in you and i can tell you know stuff that i would love to know but it's on a need to know basis if we don't need to know we don't need to know the only thing we need to know is God is good there's love and dirt forever and he laughs he sits up in heaven and laughs because he knows they're they're inspiring me so good lovely okay now we can move on there you go okay let me ask you we'll ask a few questions here um i'm only gonna usually if someone writes me three or four questions i picked the best one because i'm so far behind it's not fair to this one i'll ask you because one of them is for a child and we try to make exceptions for that and we allow silly questions for children yeah because they want to know or what we think are some of these questions um this this is a serious one she said she knew of a woman when she was sad she attempted to suicide and then she in she had a dream that the lord showed her hell and there were she says in this two children in hell out of the billions of souls she says i'd like to know if this is at all possible that these children were in hell it is not possible in any way whatsoever and this again is a the more you get into the spirit realm realities and that's what God calls them the reality of the spirit realm both sides are there it's not this earth but their activities are around the earth in the atmosphere uh the spirit realm is everywhere it's the original realm there's even highways and wasted when i say highways i'm not talking about a road like outside your house i'm talking about beams and waves of light that travel everywhere in the unseen realm the unseen realm is bigger than the scene realm and there's more activity there in the unseen realm uh so you need to be aware there's so much going on you don't see and right now there's a lot of stuff going on on our behalf on america's behalf so you need to be uh rest assured that that God understands everything and he's not ignoring people but this is the other thing you do need to know that satan does have some power he's the prince and power of what the heir talking about the air you breathe he's talking about the spirit realm okay he hasn't been thrown away away somewhere forever eventually when time is no more that doesn't mean you won't exist that means we won't have to count time nobody will age none of that will happen we'll be stepping into that glorified part of our lives and there will be no evil no evil not anywhere not any plan that God makes for us to enjoy not on the new earth um uh satan will not be allowed on the new earth he will not be anywhere on the earth or the new in or inside the new earth he'll be nowhere he can't stop stop existing let me get a drink this is a question you need this answer but God has been from the beginning to the end and when he says that the beginning is before the natural physical realm was made the end is when the natural physical realm won't be used primarily for us he's actually going to blend the spirit realm and the physical realm it will be one realm where there'll be no evil at the end of everything i'm talking about after the middle millennial reign and by the way it's gonna happen people sorry if you don't understand it God's given his son that thousand years on the throne satan will be thrown in an abyss during that thousand years and will not be on the earth at all and so don't wipe it out of your bible because you don't understand or you think maybe it's something else but there will be a point where it will be hell won't be anywhere near us uh the lake of fire which is there i keep telling people uh all satan gets in the end is lakeside property and it's gonna be really hot okay because holy spirit is funny and he's the drama king he had me say that that's all he's going to do he be will be if you're getting in the most hated being who will have no power in that lake of fire that is eternal every wicked person so every wicked evil person who never accepted christ rejected christ for whatever reason will be thrown there okay and they probably can beat him up i don't know i just know he'll be the most hated being in all there because everybody will know they were deceived by him but they still chose him so that is the end end for satan up until the point where that has happened then he will be on this earth except the thousand years he's sewn in in a pit an abyss but the spirit realm there's so much activity going there but there's mock places you have to understand how can satan have the second heaven the second heaven is not up in heaven it's a place between our sky and heaven spirit realm and satan kind of rules his little kingdom from there the thing you need to know about that is i mean he has this mock palace mock palace that looks pretty crummy and um and he sits on his thrones it's on a throne of skulls because death is his thing right and that's not to give you fear i'm just giving you truth this is revelation from the father what he showed me i saw that place when you worship God guess where it has to go through his little kingdom gets busted and blown up all the time because your praise is adoration but it's also a spiritual weapon against them and it's going up to God and satan can't stop there so his place gets bashed up all the time and so but what he can do is he can create things in the spirit realm and if you don't test the spirits which is why the bible says test every spirit in other words if an angel comes and says i'm supposed to take you somewhere you better ask that angel are you speaking about the spirit of the most high God who sent his son jesus to die for the sins of this world if you don't ask that being that question they could be fooling you and what do they do they will take you to a mock place that you think is heaven and is not and you'll see people there that would never be there wicked evil people but satan also has created a mock hell and he will take people to the mock hell and he will show people kids there christians there and these people will ask this being why are they there well they wore blue jeans they had makeup they were jewelry that is the biggest help yeah love this stuff you need to know this really goes on so just because someone had a dream and they were taken somewhere and shown something doesn't mean that was a valid place there are no children in hell no kid no little because there are no kids in health and i happen to know it happened to several people and some people this is what they're told they'll be brought back and say it is now your job to teach and preach this truth everywhere but it's a lie why did they get away with it they didn't test that spirit and i want to hold every pastor accountable you better ask somebody who wants to give a testimony like that did you test that spirit that came to you and took you there if you've not seen jesus christ yourself i met him in person there are some that can even mock his appearance i mean they can think it says satan can appear as an angel of light and he can fool you that's why you need a relationship with jesus christ so you will know the truth and you will have a little red flag saying this is not true but it doesn't line up with the word of God then you better not be a part of it okay this is this is truth that people had to know this for years maybe you were never told this so satan has his little mock kingdom has his mock hell he has his mock heaven so he can take people there and bring separation in the church arguing in the church and other things can be told to these people like they'll think that they're talking to God or they're in this mock heaven that have like buddhists and other people in it uh mary mary will never be called mother mary i'm just letting you know they don't call her that's mother mary in keep being asked that was on my list for today so go ahead and address that people keep asking me what do you think about all these people praying to mother mary what does God think about it and i think that God has a little bit of mercy on some people if they love him especially if they receive jesus christ he understands sometimes just through their their the way they've been raised that people did that i've also heard this i've heard that mary appeared to some people and say stop praying to me and if she could tell people she would say that because you have to understand you think she made one of the greatest sacrifices she did and he said she would be highly honored among women but it never said she'd be worshiped and this crazy thing you need to know this too since you're asking about the future there'll be a time in the future on this earth before all the stuff ends and all that stuff happens uh i've seen you over 100 years into the future people it's not ending roll up your rapture rug stick in the closet for some generation down the road uh we have to rule and reign with christ but but mary is not worshipped in heaven i've had to tell catholics that they loved him that until i said that part uh no she's not the bible says highly honored she's everyone loves mary in heaven uh they want to be with her they want to talk about what it was like raising christ and when they escaped into egypt and she'll tell you stuff like that but she won't allow anyone to put she worships jesus christ and at the cross when when jesus said to his mother mother behold your son john john behold your mother he was letting mary know i can't die as your son i have to die as your savior that doesn't mean they don't have a special relationship but mary is not worshiped in heaven so the prayers go right from her to jesus christ i can tell you right there oh that was gonna let me let me ask it this way so first you know this happened this is a true story we had these charismatic catholics they loved the lord they knew a lot more about jesus christ and grace years and years ago and my dream was pregnant with our our son and she laid hands on her dream's little tummy and said and she just trusted us i guess because she was in the same home group and i didn't know this was coming and she said blessed mother mary we pray that that done she prayed a blessing for this little baby so like here's my question so what did that look like from heaven's perspective where did that prayer go i'm sure that mary was giggling okay mary doesn't hate people that do that she understands that is something that they were steeped in especially family family lines and this is the crazy thing some people who know the full truth and don't even worship mary anymore they will honor her they may keep some of her little statues around again having a statue of mary uh you're not feeding her food and bowing down to her and people may not like this you have to have a balance okay having a statue of mary isn't sending you to hell if you love God if you love his son if you honor the sacrifice he made you receive him as your savior people get up to him they go this is what they say boy i missed that one didn't i i don't know teaching that um to people you know if you're in a place right now in your life or you're trying to decide run after jesus christ fill yourself with jesus christ spend time with him how do you do that shut her door and say all right jesus i'm meeting with you and if you do every night at the same time and you don't stop doing you talk like he's right here you talk with him like he's right here guess what's going to happen one night you're going to come in to talk to him and he will be there he hears our words he knows how much you want to know him but people who don't care and you're just walking out your life like oh this is just a this is this thing i have to do no it's not a task it is a love thing to want to know jesus christ he is everything he is everything i mean if it wasn't for him we would have nothing we wouldn't have coke we wouldn't have prosperity we wouldn't have relationships restored we wouldn't have healing satan can't heal anybody but this also will happen you you were talking about the times to come and we may have to do a future thing just because you know i'm talking about maybe 40 50 years into the future it might start before that that things are going to start they will start changing things many things for the better but satan's going to have to come up with a better plan than the one he's having right now because it's not working and he will always come up with something what we would call would be new which would be he'll try to convince people that witchcraft is a good thing and this is what satan does if satan puts sickness and disease on people he can remove it he can't heal people but he can remove that to prove that somebody oh that's interesting you need to understand you can't keep ignoring the fact that there's a spirit realm around us and there's activity from both sides i say this way you can't be ignorant you don't have to be ignorant of those things they do happen they've been happening for years but because satan is making a push right now to take over which is not going to happen okay there'll be major countries that you will be so shocked to see that shift to jesus christ so these things are like here waiting right they're waiting and God's like i'm cleaning this junk off of here i can't have this stuff here so that's why there's so much he's exposing he exposes before he cleans it and sets things in place but i can assure you that mary doesn't want to be worshipped mary's got good friends in heaven and she's met a lot of people and loves people she loves to talk about the you know when christ was born in the manger that really did happen she loved to share those stories with people but i've the more i've talked to catholics and all this was down to one thing there'll be a time on this earth that mary is not worshiped in the catholic religion how about that there's going to be a major shift i don't know if it would be the pope or just different priests that start to do it but they will begin to teach jesus christ for a season for a season i don't know when the season is now if it's 20 years and i don't know there'll be a season where jesus christ is just everywhere and people will know he's real they'll know he's not a lie God's also erasing the gray area that says there is no God because when this stuff happens people you're going to know we have a God who cares and he is going to move his hand and you're going to know it and what the reality that will be was there to be so many people saved at when this happens and trump is sitting in the white house so many people will run to get saved because they'll realize oh there is a God because only God could do this and they'll want to know jesus so if you can see the picture it helps your life and i want you to know that God thinks about you continually he always has me tell people he loves you he has great plans for you he's not doing the bad things to you you just need to make sure that you're on the right side amen okay so let's go on amen well now that our time is up but let me let me finish with this little boy's question this is the second question first of all it's good news i'm sure to her to the mom who's now she knows it's not possible for a child to be in hell ever so that's good she's my little boy my little boy is a seer and he really wants to know quote do teddy bears go to heaven he's a very wise person and you know every time i tell another truth there's always going to be people that will bash it ignore them and you know just i do want to say this and i've taught people who have been following following revelation you know i can say follow me it doesn't matter God gave me the pink hair so i couldn't hide i'm not into finding people to worship me i don't have time okay my humility was born in me and helping to raise all my siblings i knew it was never going to be about me and i'm okay if it's not but it has to be about jesus christ i'll say that there will be things in heaven you will be so delighted to see now when God had me start talking about your pets being there because that's his choice of course some people raged against it but i have to say this 75 of everybody was delighted and i happen to know my one brother was ministering in um lockdown he was literally ministering in um the worst kind of the prison i can't remember there's like five layers of bars they lock oh death row my my brother would go minister on death row okay he has grace for death row and for seniors no one in between don't call me okay and ask for don't ask him for counseling man he'll get his gun out and say we'll dangle you over hell he really would but death growth people and there was a prisoner who was on death row i'm not going to say his name you know who is so evil and wicked and my brother is so filled with God he's not afraid of anything and he would go they say don't stand by the bars there's like what i'm trying to say maybe five feet between you and the cell with these uh these the worst people on the earth that were caught and put in prison he'll get right up by the bars and he will not take his eyes away and he'll say do you know jesus christ the son of the living God who has power over everything and the one who rules you should not have you if you want to go burn in his hell and he'll start talking about hell he said you can go there but God's letting you know you can still choose him you can still repent and he will still take you and then my brother will begin to prophesy about things that happened when their children when they were children and at one time this one prison his favorite thing and this got this when he was a child he had a horrific people who were raising him but his favorite thing is most precious thing he had was a teddy bear and this little teddy bear had one eye because i don't know what happened to it but something happened to it and he's telling this prisoner this this prisoner has been killing murdering everywhere he's telling him his life this is what God has to say to you your teddy bear that you love that your dad shredded the pieces and burnt in front of you and your heart was broken that that actually hardened his heart so we never loved anybody after that it was the only thing he loved God said he wanted him to know his teddy bear would be in heaven [Laughter] this is my brother prophesying from God your teddy bear will be there the teddy bear will talk to you it will be like a little friend because you loved it when no one else loved you that bear loved you and he said so i'm taking your teddy bear your teddy bear is in heaven it has both eyes and he'll be waiting and that prisoner broke wow he held my knees and weeped openly weeped openly about all that and he received jesus christ before he was he was still a little elected with that prophecy oh man i mean that's like from hate and evil because he was possessed the demons left him when truth came they left him and yet my brother who just can stay with the straightest face ever when he talks about it he doesn't talk very often trust me you won't see him with his name on a venue somewhere you don't want that i mean but but the things he's seen happen in prisons because he's a prophet and he'll my God opens uh walls up and takes my brother into an open vision and that's how he shows him things so i'm not the only one i have come from generations of seers of people who have experiences like that and yet we still have family members that are messed up so don't think my whole family's perfect oh trust me some of them could care less about me some are happy about it some think i'm in it for the money these are family members and you know i've got 150 right so cut me some fly now most of them are happy but my brother does this and he would when they would send them these Gods would come on a prison visit to these big um prisons he would have most of the people they'd send out these little salvation cards here's your five salvation cards see if you can win five prisoners my brother would end up by getting all the salvation cards because everybody was coming to where he was in that yard you can imagine here's all these wicked horrific people coming to hear him give truth about God out in the courtyard of these prisons there's guards everywhere uh but my brother's got big angels that's amazing my that's me and i i would have never thought in a hundred years animals if they mean something to you yes they will be in heaven that's amazing i would have never thought that's that's beautiful that's beautiful that i mean that's huge because i thought i don't know should i ask this question look at this guy got saved with that that is amazing i'm just listening another and it's something about um it's about the new heaven and where they're talking about in the book of revelation it talks about you know the no more tears the dry waters and all the stuff and then the new jerusalem will come down and it talks all about that but it says something and it's talking about the new earth and it makes this statement there will be no more sea and people think that means there won't be any water well you're wrong because the father carries the river of life it comes from him it doesn't come from somewhere out in space or somewhere in the spirit realm even in heaven it flows literally from his being it's part of him wherever he is that will always be there so uh there sees there's a difference you need to know by the way there's a difference in the sea and an ocean okay because there's seas all over the world um a sea is a tributary off of the ocean somewhere it's a waterway it's a sea like the sea of galilee it doesn't connect with every ocean in the world you understand what i'm saying so wind seas the red sea the sea of galilee all these are individual they're huge bodies of water those are seas and when God made the earth the first time he made it like heaven one land mass and one ocean was on this earth at one time until God split up the land masses when he did that the seas were created that came off of this when you split up the land masses there wasn't just one massive ocean on the new earth which i have seen there is an ocean and that flows from the father from himself there'll be no more seas separating the land mass on the new earth there'll just be one one motion around it so there you go there's your answer oh you know that's interesting because i was gonna i didn't know that and i was thinking about in heaven i actually had this in one of my questions down my list not necessarily for today but it was the last i i wanted to know can there be are there crashing waves and warm sands that i can sit on in heaven but several people wanted to know this and sometimes it was connected with the ocean sometimes it was connected with your mansion they said can we nap i thought oh first after my own heart i love a good nap especially on a warm sand with crashing waves i love a good net does anybody nap in heaven i think they probably rest and close their eyes and they can have beautiful experiences but as far as your body being tired you know people sleep right i don't sleep by the way i think i can't remember i think about the bed at eight now maybe eight a.m so i'm up like 20 hours a day and sometimes i'm just for several days in a row but um but some people like that they just want to lay down and rest now i had one experience when i was taken up the heaven and there was this the water was like emerald green normally it's got colors of the rainbow in it even the crystal sea itself has colors of the rainbow coming up out of it but there was this beautiful place that was taken and probably a passionate paradise which is where people who love jesus christ and they get to sing with him and stuff like that it's a beautiful place but there's these waterfalls now the waterfall isn't coming off of a body of water just coming out of nowhere so there's streams in heaven there's brooks in heaven beautifully but this place is special it's where you meet i don't know how to say this it's where you meet peace it's where you meet con uh there's a there's a spirit of comfort everywhere it comes up and wraps up around you one of the places that happened was i was shown this this this creek or beautiful spring and this water was flowing from this waterfall and out of the waterfall steps this most beautiful angel and she is in charge of the waterfalls in heaven she stepped out she was filled with green light almost like it was twinkling light and her voice when she spoke peace and calm came and she told me to lay down on the water and i did and i began to float and i had my eye shot and i saw beautiful visions of other places in heaven and there was such a peace and calm and i could hear her voice still although i had gone some ways on this stream and finally um jesus came and got me said i have something to show you but i'll never forget that so you can experience something like that but this is the way there's so many places in heaven one day i don't i could draw individual maps but i just can't fit them all together but there are places in heaven where it's warm uh there's a place called wipeout surf park um parks whether it's for trees for singing flowers or uh all kinds of things but there's a place where you can surf on 100 foot waves 200 foot waves and that water off of the crystal sea and crashes 200 feet down and makes these mega waves and there's warm sand so yes there's a car i don't know who it was i know it was jesse duplantis or so you know there was a doctor richard evie that had gone to heaven so one of those books i had read some years ago maybe it was rick joy i really don't know who told the story they didn't nap but they said i i was by the ocean or by a sea and i laid there and i just closed my eyes and i just like it was like a rest not because they're tired yeah it was like a meditative just wonderful he said he said there was no time he said i understand there's no time and if i had to put a time on it i feel like i laid there for about 2 000 years that's what it felt like that was his description because you absorb things into your spiritual being and you don't even think about time because they don't have clocks or calendars up there uh God does things by according to events you need to know that i know according to the jewish calendar God set dates and things and seasons like that um but in heaven itself things are done according to God has a timeline and wherever he has a dot on the timeline it's the events it's not like he's ignorant to everything else but there's things he wants to happen on the earth we're on we're on one of those dots right now on God's calendar and it's a great victory you need to know that but um but as far as you being concerned it's okay to have lots of questions about heaven it's just the most amazing place ever but there are places you can sit and kind of rest a recline and you think about things you can even have friends come and have conversations with them and sometimes they may be listening sometimes they may not be listening but as far as you being exhausted that you have to sleep that doesn't happen but there are beautiful times of i don't even know what you would call it it's like this place even though you're there you go to this beautiful place and see these beautiful things while you're relaxing yeah very nice to remind people how they can get your books on revealing heaven yeah i forget all the time i actually have a book focus on sharing that's my main commission but they can go to revealingheaven.com and i have a business because God told me to have a business to make profits for the kingdom and i can make a profit he's fine with that and then i have times i do go and minister i do want to say this anyone who sends me if you want to bless me and send me something make sure you just make it out to Kat Kerr because the banks say you're not a minister you don't have a church they won't let me do anything with it so i just thought i'd throw this in there for free just make it out the cap curve you know if you really want to bless me i don't ever ask people to do that but some people can't help but they've been so changed and their life's been changed but the other thing chris forgot to say was God has many places he created in heaven for everyone to enjoy to explore to have adventures one of my own sisters not any of them you know they think that you soul sleep so i'm just telling you it's family people okay it's family yeah you think when you die you're so asleep you don't do nothing can't wait for her to die but i haven't known not really no i get that because i was i was raised exactly that same way so it took me i left it about 40 years ago but that was what i was raised when you die you lay in the malt john brown's body lies the molding in the grave or something your body your body sleep your spirit man would be like taking you alive sticking you in the coffin your spirit man never sleeps in your soul is in your spirit man that's what makes your decisions in your choices so when you die that's why it says to be absent from what the bible is to be present with the lord that means your spirit man we just own it you go and live in heaven your body dies and you will get it back one day you can't avoid that but it's gonna look really good it'll still look like you i encourage people you're gonna like it you're gonna like you're gonna like it also hey also when you when people you heard uh Kat say you could give to her don't you they don't they have to go to KatKerr.com now if you want to get or they can send checks in the mail i have in my address my p.o boxes on there but a lot of people just don't trust the internet but you can go to KatKerr.com k-a-t-k-e-r-r dot com and if you want to give online that is the only place because right now there's fake facebooks there's Kat Kerr facebooks that i didn't make and most of them are there just to help advertise the revelation but some are there to make money and there's a new one right on there right now on facebook brand new one who's taken my i don't know how to call all the stuff my background and even my face they've even put some of our Kat and steve videos on yes so but they're asking for money or they're trying to give money away which is just it's a it's a scam so i won't ask you for money but if you just want to give go to Kat Kerr.com go to the guardian zone click on the treasury click on the treasury on capco.com and it'll tell you how um you can do that and i'm very grateful uh that God does that but most of the time i forget to even say i have books i have dvd cds i have revelation calendars we're about to release the new and the fire and the glory that explains what the baptism in fire is what it looks like there are all revelation images on every month you'll see something you probably never saw before or didn't understand before because God has us do that it's not about a calendar you look at and throw away it's the revelation in it that's priceless that's really really good so like our cops they don't do demons right here that makes a big statement okay and as you can see i have a pen here that says it you know what this will start conversations in the grocery store more than you wore that or one of those in israel i remember you you had something that said i don't do demons if you are around right well we're way over time today but it was worth it so thank you everybody thank you Kat again and Kat will be with us next wednesday uh tomorrow is a new prophetic voice that you haven't heard his name is manny i can't pull up his last name right now but african-american guy God gave him is either 2018 or 2019 he brought him to the future oh is that blank Kat yes that's man he did say you administered at his place so you know him yes he's also part of the voice of hope that's been around for probably 30 years and so there's even a radio place and i did many talks and interviews and he the guy was just changed like crazy change but God actually gave him a real encounter people you need to make sure you don't miss that because it is so powerful the year 2022 he was taken to i told him literally he was taken there it and so it's powerful see it and be standing wrong in dc now remember you're no longer tolerating evil or wickedness witchcraft of violence i mean i added all in it we're not tolerating it in our government or in our country in jesus name make sure you say that before you leave all right thank you so much Kat we love you God bless you all and we'll see you again manny's on tomorrow God bless you we'll see you again you

and i understand jen had said that kenneth copeland phoned in and said he was looking for it he actually hasn't met you in person yet but you've had some contact it sounds like yeah when when the whole broadcast was over we had our own little meeting amongst us and so that we could all just chit chat and fellowship a little bit but kenneth actually did call in and thanked all of us for doing a great job and there was a powerful response i think like 51 countries were watching right now wow probably 100 000 people there was a lot of people who want answers they want to know what God is doing right now and of course that's what i talked about i i was not prepared to share with them do part of what their stuff is their stuff was important if you didn't see that broadcast you need to seriously go and watch it and i'm telling you leaders all over the world were watching it and a lot of them were contacting me all night long and it was only because they were a little surprised about what God said but basically God was saying you know that um things are about to happen very suddenly and that he would not allow evil to have our country and he also confirmed very adamantly that he was not done with trump that he was on trump's side and that he would be for the next four years but there was even more than that uh there are things going on behind the scenes that people aren't aware of so don't make your judgments by what you see in the normal news i'll be nice to them today maybe they will walk us off everybody i will say this everybody has a right to make a decision with their own life but it would be nice if you had unbiased news to make that choice with but we don't have that right now in this country and we have a lot of resources now online that you can go and check out we may end up by putting a list up here a little bit later letting you know what some of those are but um there are activities going on that are not seen in by the news or by anybody right now and there are activities of our president who in no way whatsoever conceded i have to say that i do know that there are activities that will you will be hearing about in the news and of course i just letting you know you'll hear about them from the other news don't don't take the other news seriously different even conservative outlets are now reporting and we saw it that that trump had said or at least they said he said i i will now cooperate with a peaceful transition to biden now that's what they say he said in so many words so let me ask you this way why do you say he hasn't conceded uh when he said that because there's things going on you can't know about okay i understand that i hope you all understand the hidden meaning in that because there is one uh we're about to have some actions take place in this country don't be alarmed about them God was very uh forceful when he said that he would no longer tolerate the evil trying to take his country and he caught it my america and uh to get ready for the landslide and he again said when you feel the ground when you when the ground begins to shake get ready for the landslide of all the falsehoods and the other activities that were wrong that happened i'm not going to get really blatant about that you already know what those are but God has said when you feel the ground shake get ready for action to take place and justice to come and uh and whether you know it or not today we had an earthquake in america no i didn't i didn't know that where was that it was in alaska 4.4 a magnitude uh get ready for a lot of that to be evidence not anything destructive but God's wanting to know that's his evidence that the ground is beginning to shake and therefore you may watch for the landslide that he talked about as being a good thing a good thing for everybody and because of that happening there will be actions taken and decisions made by our president who is by the way still our president and of course the other side thinks they've won and everybody knows that and they're getting crazy and they're not getting very smart uh one of the statements God made last night that i loved and i was not prepared for any of that because you know when you prophesy and it's him speaking you don't really know what he's saying until he says it of of course and it was very very powerful it was so powerful that it stunned most of the speakers yeah and they weren't ready for that they weren't ready we're not written we're not prepared for what God was going to say although it was powerful powerful stuff and uh later when everything was over kevin copeland did call back in and thanked me for releasing great faith into the whole entire situation even into that ninth um meeting what took place in the broadcast was shifted into God's plan and what his plans were and what he was about to do and that always brings hope to people if you know something about what's going to happen i've known for some time what would happen but God now is speaking very plainly about the things that are going to happen so those things we've been praying for and believing for waiting for they are about to happen and that is good news for us we the people and uh so just get ready for that but that was just God's evidence of that word being true when you when you when the ground begins to shake and it shook today 4.4 magnitude in alaska and some people don't real didn't realize that either yesterday or the day before i think it was on the sixth when all this was happening you're right well there was one in the red sea there was one the red sea had an earthquake and a lot of problems were saying that this whole thing is about a red sea experience to the church that is true there was also one in oregon um but the main one was today uh and that was that's happened so far after God spoke that was the 4.4 in alaska in our country which is a sign that things are starting to happen that will bring justice you have to remember that God said justice would come and he meant that and so i can just tell you what i've been telling people all along and if you noticed if you watched it you saw that i had my piece of cake that also was quite a shock to them they were reporting others yeah they didn't know what to do with that you need to know they were talking about some of the actual real activities that took place at the capitol which was not um an overtake by by the people who came to support trump and celebrate with trump and and back him up there was a mass of people i think they think a quarter of a million people were actually there in dc the other day i'm sure they never would have shown you that on their news but there weren't that many people there and everything was peaceful and it was powerful and then they started putting in the fee that they wanted to be put in for people to see in here and there were reports even in newspapers that trump's people were taking over breaking into the capitol and taking over that was not true at all and that was actually shown uh in detail of what actually happened on that show last night so make sure you see that show make sure you watch it it's called right it is if you go to the facebook we i don't say we stream it but you can you can play it from our site or i'll click the link and it'll take you so yeah it's there make sure you see it was it was going in one direction and then when they asked me what i had to say God spoke and he said that happened at least twice that God twice said something very powerfully another time he had me hit my desk as hard as i could hit it when he was when he was saying something because we were shooting from here from right here and the presence of God was so strong here you couldn't hardly walk back in my room because i spent so much time with God earlier four hours actually so i was still with him when we started that that whole broadcast and if you watch it you'll have a lot of hope a lot of excitement in you so as you see activities i'm just letting you know as you see activities happening around this country to probably bring someone bring us some protection uh that is not to bring anything against us in any way is to help to protect us and that's what i'm gonna say about that uh i know people are trying to say you know that um there's gonna be anarchy in the streets and burning and looting well there is that it'll be from the other side it will not be from anything that the president is doing but the president is a very wise person he is in texas he is in a there's like a secret bunker thing it's not like to keep him from being attacked from war it's where they can make plans in secret and knowing here what's going on what you know that has to happen if you're making plans uh to help the country and that has always been trump's focus don't be too concerned about the people that you think have abandoned him and have come against him don't be too concerned about that i will always say this if there's a covert activity and you tell about it it's not covert that's right that's right one of the things i think they're awesome we're quite shocked at uh at me except of course hank hank just grinned the entire time um until he had me at his place he knows i'm not gonna be normal or say anything normal but if God speaks he he knows it's God and uh so it was a powerful powerful night but it was the beginning of something you need to know that that wasn't just another broadcast and they were even saying that afterward kenneth vidcon and thank me he said i've never met you but i can't wait to meet you that was his content that was good and the last time i saw you with that i mean you've always been the anointed person that you are but every once a while the spirit falls on you or comes out of you and that prophecy and prophetic starts coming and there's like don't don't mess with Kat during that time we were on the sea of galilee when that hit you the first time that i saw it like that and i'm going whoa you know and so that happened last night hey uh hank cunaman jumped in a little later they they went back and forth between the guests and hank towards the end said i want you to know she's been in my church and there's very few people and i'm gonna paraphrase it because i don't know those exact words there's very few people i know that have that level of anointing that i feel on this woman something like that that basically yeah he was validating me and of course you know he himself is highly anointed he is also a show person and don't speak against them because in this time God is putting on a show and he will you show people that means they're very open and very uh specific they're not afraid of the face of man and if God says to say something they're going to say it and they will make a show doing it and i will remind you who else did that in colossians it said on the third day christ stood up and he uh spoiled and ruined the principalities and powers in the midst of hell itself and made a show of it openly so guess what God's a show person and so is his son and i'm just letting you know the show is continuing and this will be the good side of it and the God side of it it will be clearly seen and known that when this is all over this entire world will know there is a God and the entire world who was watching all this were getting excited and God also talked about the when he showed me he actually just said there will come a day soon that the entire country this country will run into the streets and shout and celebrate because of the great victory that has been won and he said not only this country but around the world they will be celebrating so that should give you a clue this is God himself saying this so i can tell you that's what you need to get ready for and if you're not happy about that get in your prayer closet or get some prayer okay let me let me let me tell the people yesterday i gave them a list of some names it was fairly early after this whole thing started to become our really red sea moment where we realized okay this is it all natural uh things are exhausted and let's just say most of them are and i gave them a list of people that were still standing for trump because some of have apologized have begun apologies there's like an apology chart i'm going to ask you about that for a second but the names i read jeff johnson said it's not even cl it's not only not over it's not even close to being over obviously i read Kat's name johnny enlo prophet named manny who we'll have on later we we rescheduled him or we are rescheduling him to that you add the names hank kuniman lance waldow dutch sheets tim sheets and there's more i just don't have them off the top i was on the acpe private texting art or round table and i can see there's a number of people not everybody but there's a number of them on there that are still contending for trump so obviously we don't speak against prophets we don't even speak against prophets who are speaking against prophets that's right but i want to ask you in general um what attitude people should have about and towards those who have begun their apology chair most of the apologies are filled with humility i'm really sorry i got this wrong i'm trying to learn and what are your thoughts about that i think that they will realize that they didn't have to do that at all when God has done doing he wants to the thing is this in the mind of man they have this mindset of when they think something should happen i'm not even talking about the prophets right now i'm just talking in general if you've never had to make a stand for something for and i'm not saying it will take this long but this is a good example if you've never had to really stand and not be moved in any way for a year for 10 years for 20 40 years if you've never been in that place where you had to do that and you know what to stand means guess what standing means you don't step back so those who are stepping back and trying to say well maybe i missed it or i just did miss it they're getting a lot of pressure from people on the outside because in the mind of the other people not the prophets they believe in the natural this has not happened when it should have happened well they certainly were not considering God's own timeline nor have they considered him because there was almost nowhere in the bible when he was on time according to man that's right God is not missing it God is never late he is right on time just because it doesn't line up with your time frame i've also had to face a lot of that stuff i just laughed at the people said i love you i'm just going forward with God there's nothing i have nothing to apologize for um but i will pray for you so i'm trying to be serious about this at the same time but there's such celebration on the inside of me the excitement on the inside of me because God is moving and so is our president things will begin to happen quickly probably in the next day or so i'm just saying make sure don't let fear overwhelm you or overtake you if you feel like you need to make a few provisions that's fine to do it uh there's not going to be the whole shutdown of all the whole financial community and all the food's not going to disappear and vaporizing to nothing that there will probably try to be as much as normal uh done here i'm talking about from the president's point president trump's point of view there is no other president right now and you need to realize that people can say what they want to but right now he's still officially president of the united states and he will try to maintain as much as he could to have our lives be as normal as possible but he also will not let anyone come in and attack us or take things from us or harm us in any way because his heart is for us and so is God so pretty much God was kind of letting people know the fraud is about to be exposed in great detail and there's going to be i've been saying this for some time watch the airports because that will begin to happen also some will jump their ship i'm not talking about the the i'm not talking about the right or you know or God's plans or anything i'm not about the other side there's people on the left we begin to realize things are failing and crumbling and i can say it all day long and a lot of people are also understanding even some of them that they have no foundation there's no foundation to any of their planet just come see comes ha we just have to we have to let people think there's violence out there we have to let people think that the you know the right is all wrong and we're the only ones that know what to do but they don't really have solid plans and i will say this criminal activity is all about them it's about selfishness it's about greed so everybody's in that whole thing for their self none of them are in it for the good of this country that's why they never talk about that they don't have plans for that and in their mind if it's been deceived or compromised if the cell's been compromised they can't even possibly think those kind of thoughts of good only control and that is going to end quickly it will not take months for that to happen uh there are options that our president does have that will actually keep him president for a while i probably can't see anything more than that so don't look at it as being over are you kidding the acting is just about to begin and like God said are you supposed to fear you're supposed to be trembling you're supposed to run and hide he said to eat cake and celebrate and he actually had me do that right there during the broadcast when they said you have anything to wrap up with and i have my piece of cake waiting right over here and i said actually i do because God said you've prayed you fasted you've interceded you stood in the gap so right now it's time to eat cake and celebrate i brought my cake out and once again they had a stunned look on their face except yeah jean gene bailey had it he's like he didn't know what to do with that he's a neat guy i really like it from afar but he didn't i could tell he didn't know what to do there hank wasn't surprised no because he brought it right to you when you came to speak at his church is that right he did he actually had cake waiting on the platform he thought that was the greatest thing ever and actually people who watch me on a regular basis are all over the world eating cake and celebrating i think that's wonderful and so does God you trust God in this time when you yourself don't know what to do if you don't know what's going up but you have given all the God and sowed your life in prayer and helping others and and and keeping people calm and keeping peace and assuring your family that God is going to uh be in charge and he is people say he's not yes he is it says the lord in the fullness thereof the the earth and the fullness thereof belongs to the lord yes he trusts us to steward it but guess who it still belongs to so i just want to encourage you there will be activities taken over these next few days they may start today they may not start today but our president is deciding which action he's going to take pray for him to have wisdom and he does have wise people around him he does have God people around him and and he is really seriously now knowing this that something will have to be done to stop the other side from just thinking they own everything when they don't this place belongs to God this time literally belongs to God for his plans and his purposes and God is adamant about that and so trust him if you believe in him trust him if you don't know him you better run to ask jesus christ to be your savior and get a spirit of celebration on the inside of you because you yourself right now probably can't do anything more than we have stand behind president trump care about each other consider your neighbors and pray for those who are deceived who don't know what they're doing and that they at least know jesus christ because God has plans for every person in this world uh we all came from him he sent us here for a divine purpose and timed our birth on the earth and they all kept saying well i think God knew what he was doing when we were all born here i said he timed your birth on the earth that he did that from the beginning and so getting a lot of God and at one time a lot of revelation especially detailed revelation and then from God himself is quite uh quite a thing to to be a part of and i am honored that God uses me but i didn't get a choice because i've already given permission to God to say anything he wants to whenever he wants to and i'll do whatever he tells me to do that choice has already been made and instead of waking up normally at noon yesterday he came in my room and woke me up at 11 55 a.m yelling yelling will prevail and i mean he said really loud and then from that moment for the next four hours was sharing things with me to the point where the glory was so powerful in there i i didn't want to leave but i had to because i had to do the other broadcast so i just want to encourage you what God is very much involved in the things that will be going on in the decisions of our president to bring america back to God back to the plans God has to make america greater than ever before i want to encourage you just stay in that in that in that position of celebration and excitement that yes things are going to happen to change everything back to what God wants and it will be greater than was before so stay encouraged and be assured that God is not ignoring anyone or anything he's quite aware of everything as we get ready to go into some questions about heaven yes i'm going to ask you a question about God visiting you but there's going to be a lot of new people since last wednesday because Kat's been on every wednesday but we're bringing her on today because it's these are crucial times we need to get it really straight um so a lot of people coming on do not know that Kat has been to heaven thousands of times but more than that you've been with the lord innumerable times and you just alluded to it i was going to my my first question on the list was could you tell people what that was like obviously there are things that you can't say what is it like when the God of all the universe walks into the room shouting i mean you've told me a couple times that you were shaking and trembling after four hours so tell us what that was like and then did you just sit there listen the whole time i'm actually still trembling i my hands are still traveling because there's still um there's still uh a good portion of his presence here and even when i was trying to lie down i tried at like six seven eight eight thirty my husband was waking up and i went um i'm trying to just rest here and at least rest but uh but God was everywhere in my in my room those who don't know uh right now we actually live in our offices he made us turn our home into our offices which is literally taking over our shipping receiving the studio i'm sitting in right now is in what was our home our front area is our reception area and so this entire whole facility now belongs to God because all of this belongs to him so i am accustomed i can't say it's ever a normal feeling i am accustomed to him doing that without any warning whatsoever to me every now and then he'll let me know um i'm going to come to see you tomorrow but he normally doesn't do that he shows up and especially when he's ready to start doing things he just walks in he starts speaking to me like i gave him permission right so i tell people the time please tell him i give you permission to use me any way you want to you need to say something that will draw him to you and that that shows him you're serious if you speak it your words are powerful if you speak it you're making a covenant with God to to allow him to use you and it may be the most unusual things it may be inconvenient uncomfortable that's probably God absolutely out of this world some of the things that he'll make you declare for him but this is it when he finds someone he can do that with he will do it on a continual basis so yes when he walked in yesterday my eyes flew open and i was wide awake he actually turns the ringer off on my phone because everybody knows i never turn my ringer off and uh it was only off the other day when i when i had done the the um uh the the thing with you you know the broadcast with you i had turned my ringer off uh but i had turned it on later because i was talking to people like four in the morning the other day i was talking to roy fields people who know i'm up late that i know will call me to have conversations but that ringer was on when i went to bed but it wasn't on when i woke up he had turned it off i looked down and many people had tried calling me and God said do not call them back and do not look at your text he said i want to tell you some things and then he began to just share things with and he actually had me text my family and say please do not interrupt me do not text me do not come in do not try to call me on the phone God is with me yes they're used to that they're used to that happening isn't it you texted me too i i've never seen you do that but you texted me too and i thought whoa okay i'm not going to interrupt her you know but but it was an awesome thing standing on the outside or being on the outside to know that the God of the of the universe is sitting there in Kat's room talking to her yes he was and he was pretty adamant about what he had to say and um i did not know in the beginning what was going to happen he said you will text greg um not grow you expect you will text gene bailey and tell him that i am with you right now and that i will call you back later because he had actually tried to call me i didn't even know what it was about and a few seconds later he goes can you be on my show tonight at seven o'clock see this is the way God opens a door out of obedience of doing that that's how i got on now kenneth copeland's victory channel that's how i got on flashpoint uh because i obeyed God he said you text him right now and tell him this and he he wasn't gonna miss that it wasn't it was not the original plan to bring me on there but they're all really glad that they did wow your acts of obedience even the small acts now i God trained me in very small ways in the beginning but got me to the point where it didn't matter what he said or or how he said to do i always obeyed those who are willing and obedient shall eat the fat of the land that means that you'll be a part of the great things of God people have many different interpretations of that that means you'll be a part of the great things of God and you will have the prosperity and the joy of the lord with you all the time because of your obedience even jesus said pray that my people be willing in the day of my power well this is not the day of christ's breath this is the day of his power where great things will happen so but when you're in a moment you're very honored all of you that you're alive and a part of something so epic that God is doing they'll talk about this for a long long long time about the goodness of God and what he did and what our president did to take our country back for us so you're not going to miss it uh i wouldn't go by what the normal the regular news is right now but even that heads up that's going to change that's very good it's going to change but there will be a network that will actually speak the truth and give unbiased opinions and it's coming and uh so you need to rejoice that you're alive now don't let fear control you that's all the enemy if you're in fear then someone's listening to the enemy and if your friends don't understand what's going on just say trust God i am if you don't have anything else to say trust God i am okay that will bring hope to people there's simple things you can do you want to if you like you want some cash other than make yourself feel better then go ahead and do it and just let people know you don't have to be in fear this is not a time of torment or extreme lack of extreme suffering it is not those days and so he has not appointed us he's appointed you to be great and to be a part of greatness that's good well countless let me ask you a few questions and we'll get into questions about heaven and when we talk about heaven then it transfers many people especially if you're new to this then someone wants to know about their guardian angel which i'm about to ask we try not to duplicate questions but we'll ask a variant of the question which i'm about to do and then sometimes that gets into what did the bible mean when it says such and such so it kind of all connects that really this really is about questions about heaven but these things do connect so i'm going to ask you two questions at the same time from two different people this one said i know i've heard some people know the names of their angels meaning their guardian angels does Kat and how can i find out the name of mine and the other question was um do we have the right to either ask our angel to do something or should we ask the father or ask God to to ask our angel to do something so they're trying to figure out this whole guardian angel how personal how utilitarian i guess so what are your thoughts i will start with this God is the one who sent them all right and your guardian angel comes at the time of your conception they don't just eventually show up sometime down here from the time you're conceived they are sent and they're waiting outside of the mother for that child to be born and they are with you from that moment all the way to the end of your life and they literally will help escort you home to heaven so you're not going to avoid being around them and yes i do know the name of all my angels i didn't ask them just so people know that that's up to you if you feel like you want to i don't know that they will respond it just it depends on the boundaries God has set for them and some people are different than others they think differently they respond differently and certainly um they're not to be worshipped everybody knows that and but some people think you should have nothing to do with them which is a little silly they're with you all the time it's perfectly fine even before i knew my angels names i'd turn around and say thank you for putting up with me you might say that that would actually make them laugh because we are humans okay and let me tell you this they have personalities and they have their own little likes they like different colors they like different things they would like for you to spend more time with God they would like for you to make their life easier by not choosing darkness whatever you do don't use hell's language and don't use profanity they don't like it and that is healthy language but if you ever wondered if hell has a language yeah it's called profanity but your angel was sent to guard and keep you and people think my angel never did anything i will assure you of this and i do know this when you go home to heaven one day you will get to know your angel okay you'll get to know a lot about them and they're going to have a lot of questions for you i always tell people that but there's a place you get to go that is like mini theaters now that you can't picture a movie theater it will play entire life minus the sins if you've repented and you want and there will be no sin in it but all those crazy silly things you did growing up they will be there in living color and you will see your angel with you in these mini movies and you will realize how many times they intervened on your behalf and kept you probably from either making a big mistake or your life being taken so those things uh you'll find that out later but more and more in the days we're entering into the world would become more and more spiritually oriented meaning the veil that's already very thin between the spirit realm and the physical realm at one point will become really super thin and many people will see their angels and they will know their names um i don't know that they would they they have like i said they have a boundary put around them like there's so many things that they would be allowed to say to you or maybe even go with you to do something other than something that you would like to go do with them they may or may not be permitted to do that and sometimes they won't respond even if you do see them that doesn't mean that they don't like you that means they're focused on what they were sent for uh but i do know do you know my angels names i don't always call them by name i'm always thanking them for protecting me for obeying God when you sent them that they care i will tell you this they care very much about you they're always for you they will defend you sometimes around other angels because they know if you're acting up you're doing a wrong there may be other angels not necessarily ones assigned to you that'll say hey you must have a mess on your hands being real right now okay these are real beings real personalities they do have a place of their own in heaven they're not just shoving on the hill somewhere um some of them even have pets in heaven and so oh try to help watch over your pet too and i can just let you know they're busy trust me they're busy 24 hours a day they don't sleep they do get a break everyone has more than one because one gets to go home for rnr while the other one is still with you and so that's probably about the most i'm going to talk about them right now but they're very very they care very much for you but when you do things like obeying God or just saying a kind word to people you absolutely delight them that's awesome you know and about i'm going to ask you the next question here but i'm just going to throw this in a few years ago because i'm not really as a seer that you are you can't see my angels so and i tried to hear his name or say what's your name and i just couldn't hear it so i finally i said okay you're not giving me your name so from here on your name is stan until you tell me differently so you'd be surprised how many people do that and the angels actually laugh this is a funny thing God gives everybody a nickname that that name you get when you get to heaven on the white diamond the white stone is not a river rock it's a diamond and God puts a new little nickname for you that just you and he know God's all in the nickname so the angels are perfectly fine if you give them one uh my one my one older brother which you hear me talk about a lot he talks a little bit differently to his angels i think they have to have triple grace to be around him but yeah he's definitely personnel a different personality than me most of my family rooms are very different from each other but we were all taught to love people no matter who you were or where you were from my dad told us about love the love of God he loved his enemies and it wasn't necessarily easy if you were a warrior growing up in my family that wasn't the easiest thing to see your dad just beat up with words and everything and then he kindly turns around and asks people would you like to go get a coffee and donut i really think i have something interesting some of my brothers weren't happy about that i just went right along with my dad and that's why i have love in me some people think i know i'm fierce against evil i'm fierce against the darkness i do uh i do i am a warrior in the spirit realm and my brother doesn't think i wore at all i don't want to go kill people however he probably would not mind if they were bad so triple triple busy i think he's got about nine or ten angels whatever well let me ask here's the next question i'm just gonna read this as a shirt this one says i think it's a woman i can't actually i don't know because i don't have a name my dad was abusive verbally and mentally he was sick for about one year before he passed in 2018 i hope he repented before he died how can i know if my dad is in heaven well the number one thing is this did you ever pray did you ever pray and stand in the gap from and said God i'm just believing that my my dad is going to become saved he's going to give himself to jesus christ so his life can become my testimony and a witness now i say that that would be even in heaven because people who get saved even on their deathbed they can't wait to testify when they get up to heaven about the graciousness and the goodness of God and they will even say my family members were standing for me i probably had no no chance whatsoever but because of the goodness of God in christ that he met me at my death and i received him there's no way i was going to miss doing that and i remember the first time christ caught me up to heaven he actually told me this before he brought me back one time tell everybody to not ever stop standing for their family members it gives me permission to pursue them even to the very end of their life because i have the keys now to hell death in the grave and if they will make a stand and not turn from that stand then they will be delighted to find their family member in heaven so that should be a christ answer for something so there's great hope and a great promise we have as believers that isn't given to other people so make sure you're making that stand for your family members it could be somebody you love like family and sometimes it's the only way they actually get there so and then this person is talking don't go talking bad about them right and this person who asked this question let's say he or she thinks to himself thanks to them so i i don't know if i ever did that that doesn't preclude 10 or 15 other people who may have been praying for the same person right who could have accomplished the same thing yeah so yes the older i get if they're the more older i get the more i realize that God's looking for excuses to give if i can put it that way he's looking for excuses loopholes legal loopholes you're not even considering that there's a scripture that says that God will keep your family and keep you up to a thousand generations i have family members that i know uh probably three or four generations ago five generations ago that stood in the gap for all of their family members up to a thousand generations they would have the opportunity to know jesus christ these were really powerful people and i know my grandmother my dad's mother was one of those people i would hear her pray and she was staying in the gap for all of her children all of her grandchildren all of her great-grandchildren her great-great-grandchildren up to a thousand generations would be a living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ and she was making that stand right then and there for as long as it took as long as they were here that they would come to know christ you may have had someone say that about you or say that about your family jesus will not let their words drop to the ground so so so good okay here's another one if somebody is saved and they didn't give the details which is fine if somebody is saved but they're not living right and of course we don't know what they mean by they're not living right there's so many possibilities if they're saved but they're not living right will they still go to heaven that was the question i think christ is the one who has to make that decision i think this is what God said if they receive my son even as a little child i put a hook in them not like a fish hook but he puts a hook around them that he can if necessary pull them into him even if it takes all the way up to the point where they die that they made a decision at one time in their life for christ and he has the right to take those words and do something with those words if you yourself did that and you're wondering i can tell you right now you may as well this is what you should tell people in churches you may as well lay down roll over and give up because jesus christ is going to get you why not leave a good testimony of your life here on the earth and not waste all the way up to the time when you die and people are very very happy that they didn't waste their life but i do know and have heard people in heaven that actually got saved on their deathbed or at the moment they died and they are the happiest people in heaven they don't care if someone's attention is bigger than theirs they don't have a trash bin to live in they have a beautiful place to live in that jesus gives them but they understand the mercy and grace of God and they're happy for everyone else if someone has a massive mansion because of their life being poured out or just being kind every day of their life you will be highly rewarded by God no one is jealous no one is sad in heaven and they will rejoice continually to see people get the rewards and they're so grateful to God that they didn't go to hell so there's no sadness in heaven and even though you remember things up to a certain point when time is no more all those old uh memories will be taken from you and it says the form of things remember no more that's at the very end of the bible because people celebrate parts of their life and they can remember parts of their life they had on the earth that were fun they were exciting they do remember the goodness of God every time he rescued him even though they had given up and wanted to throw their life away he wouldn't let them do that so God is definitely looking for every way he possibly can to get people into heaven he's not an unloving God that wants to send people to hell he just can't let evil into heaven that's so good yeah that's true okay now this Kat this one keeps being asked over and over so i'm going to finally get i'm going to give you two questions blended together uh because this just continues to be asked if there's no sin in heaven how is satan able to rebel and sin causing it with sin causing his downfall and he says non-believers keep asking her him or her this um and then the the second question is even if God gets us all to heaven and there's no sin how do we know that this won't happen again that some sin is going to be found in somebody no that won't ever happen [Laughter] when you're when when you're born again all of that sin is wiped out of your life like it never happened God doesn't remember that in your life and uh if you make it into heaven by through some people have to repent go for a while don't repent God i would rather just keep going forward i don't waste time having to do that anymore i got to a place in my life where i decided i'm just going to stick with jesus and he's it and that is the best place to be in but because of God's mercy he does and let me tell you angels that fall don't ever get a second chance i can tell you that and the thing about sin in heaven was there never was sin in heaven before lucifer it said iniquity was found or born in him he is the very first one who fell from the place God had him in chose sin and chose wickedness wanted to take over heaven and wanted to now he couldn't throw God off the throne because he wasn't a creator he couldn't create but he came to the point where thought i'm smarter than him i'm taken over and he began to deal with wickedness even in heaven God knew everything that was going on he allowed every single angel to be tempted that's why you have to be tempted that's why when you're born you have to make a decision for christ and but he never got a second chance there is no more sin in heaven there's no chance of sin ever being in heaven or in eternity number one when the end comes those who never wanted christ will not be allowed anywhere near us that where the where the lake of fire will be will not be on the earth near the earth anywhere about it nobody will have any power there there's no chance of anybody ever getting out of that we will have a sinless eternity and this is the other thing is on the day that the dead in christ shall rise and you get your glorified body you can't sin once that happens there's no sin not even in your anywhere in your makeup or your thinking and so when the day the dead and christ shall rise that's your body your body sleeps when you die but your spirit man in your soul they are together they go to live in heaven and there is no sin up there there's no fear no sin no control no regret no rejection it does not exist in the atmosphere of heaven when lucifer was cast out with every single wicked angel who goes uh lucifer over God every one of them were thrown out and so therefore has been thrown out of heaven and that's why you have to receive christ because it wipes it out of you nobody goes to heaven with sin in them it's totally removed so you don't ever have to worry about the ever showing up anywhere not not now in heaven and not on the new earth or anywhere in eternity there will be no sin that's so good contact okay here's one uh this one i i tell people i keep trying to ask the question to you that the most people are asking this one keeps being asked yet have you seen what people have gone to heaven and said there's actually warehouses in heaven with completely healed body parts is that true does that exist and how is that accessed from here what's the because i've heard of it myself and i've even i this is me talking now i remember praying that like send the parts in heaven that i need i can't say that yet that i've seen that happen for me so i this this is not my question but i added that part to it i've actually been to the body parts warehouse several times so yes it really does exist and they have every kind of body part that God has ever made and they're alive so i i'm going to keep your mind and just do something to your mind right now so i tell people take your natural mind and sit on the shelf and just here with your spirit i'm talking about heaven i'm talking about where all creation took place and the one who made everything is there i can even take a moment to explain this the father how this creation thing happened was the father and the word worked together that's why it's a three-in-one it has the ability to go inside of each other go places and do things this is what they did before the earth was even made and so the father would go somewhere where there was nothing he would speak what he wanted and the word which is christ the word would step out and he would make whatever it was God wanted now the word says when God made it he looked at it and considered it if he liked it it remained if he didn't like what he had said he wanted then it disappeared so you have to understand there was a process so they made everything together it wasn't just one doing it but that's why it says there was nothing that was not made that wasn't made by the word because he was with God God spoke the word that he wanted what he wanted and the word that's why it was his name stepped out and made it and then of course later the word came and died the third the a member of the trinity and then after that he was known as yeshua our savior our lord our king jesus christ and that's another question i'll answer for free people say what does jesus want to be called any of those as long as you call him just call her right um this is this i think she's asked this a couple of times but um no it's he mark a guy named mark wants to know he knows that not everybody gets to go to heaven and visit heaven but he wants to know if we all did that if we were all going and visiting so that virtually all believers armed with the knowledge that we have in heaven how how would you think we would be living i i understand this question he's going i hear i see what he's getting he's trying to if we see all the right things that God wants to see will we come down here and be just like on fire for God i guess he's asking oh you mean if you've been up there and experienced it with that change yeah i think i think yeah he's asking how would we all be living if we all saw what you saw i think it's a lot happier really okay you'd be happy almost all the time uh and the holy spirit just told me you didn't finish the last question whoa what was that oh what was the other parts warehouse side track i've been to the body parts warehouse they actually have a procedure they use now as far as you asking and getting here i won't answer that i'll answer the part about what the body parts where household looks like they actually have a huge reception area it doesn't look like a warehouse like you see boxes stacked like in a storage unit or something it's very classy it's very well designed most of the things that hold the body parts are clear and transparent you can actually see eyeballs rolling around you can see the lungs lungs breathing really i'm i'm a girl i am a girly girl i don't like things like that i never took whatever they called it in the in school where you took body animals apparently oh yeah at school they made what is it called yeah the other the biology where you had it you had uh yeah oh no i would use i took three years of earth science i'm really good about the about the stars and the heavens and the planets i had a lot of understanding how grass is formed that part the weather i'm very well educated don't know much of anything and don't want to know what goes on in my body if there's a dead toad i'll say God just let it go to heaven somewhere but i don't want to look at the dead toad okay and um so but you can't escape it if you're in the body barracks warehouse and i've heard almost everybody say the exact same thing they were taking down these beautiful hallways they go in certain doors where say all the eyes were kept or all the lungs the feet the hands they're like alive people and i'm talking about physical body parts okay you can't bring a spiritual body part down and stick it in your flesh body and think that's going to work okay your spiritual body doesn't need body parts why is it so hard for us to access those Kat why is it so hard to get those parts down here it has there's so many dynamics to all of that i would just tell people don't give up because more and more and i will say there is a season coming probably not this first decade i don't know about the second decade but the father did tell me their plan is to one day empty the body parts warehouse and that means there'll be a time on the earth where people won't have uh you know maimed or missing or not working body parts and i don't know how close that will get towards like the end because up until the end happens and we're talking about perilous times tribulation you know a few years and then if that part's over that part's over to the millennial rain comes and uh so i do know there'll be a time when the there will be no people lacking body parts and when he said that i didn't know if he meant the body of christ if he meant the whole world i didn't understand that so there will be mass mass healings where some of those healings are entire uh bodies of people whether it's in a tent meeting or if it's a stadium heating meeting there'll be times when everyone in that one meeting everyone who's there gets body parts replaced that is coming and i don't know if it's just God's timing for that i don't know i do know it's happened many times i actually do know people that had gotten new body parts and and actually was in the meeting where that actually did happen and so don't give up thanking God for this is what i always tell people don't ask every day you ask and then you show your faith by thanking him that it's coming and i know that does for some reason accelerate it coming um i know people serve God love God anyway ones who can't walk they don't have legs if their legs are missing but i have seen angels bring body parts and put them in the person they come in a gift box this is crazy in this place really there's a requisition that does make its way however an angel or somebody brings a requisition to this entrance he gives a requisition for the body part to be released they take it in there they register it then they go and get the body part they bring this gift box to this other angel their courier angels they're part of gabriel's group and then the angel comes down to the there's a whole tribes of them not just one and they will walk through the person with that box whether it's a new heart new lungs a new spine they walk to that person they go up the other side and the box is gone and that body part has been put in that person i do know that's how they do it so i can help that way but every kind of part is up there in this place it's really huge and every time i'm taking i try to avert my eye even in heaven even in heaven not in your head rolling around so but they're already alive it's not like they have to be made alive they're alive and living when they're put in you so standing straight thanking God for that that you're expecting it don't get discouraged and step back people will even laugh at you i do know somebody who for six years stood passionately stood for their for them to have new legs they could hardly walk and people laughed they brought shoes to church with them every every service saying i'm going to wear these home and people got where they ignored them but they didn't stop saying it and one day they came they had like a church function fellowship and right in front of everybody there God came in and gave two brand new legs to that girl and she walked out wearing her new shoes so i'm just telling you it does happen and because of these days of greatness not destruction because of the greatness of God that we're entering into these great days of glory you will see it more and more happening and people who've been waiting and thanking God for 10 years well probably maybe not even 10 years sometimes it's just going to happen immediately sometimes they've been in an accident lost body parts by the time they get to the hospital God's going to shock doctors and they'll already be replaced in the person's body that's amazing well kat i had you and i agreed we'd get you out of there by quarter after because you have another appointment so we're right there do you want to um tell people quickly how they can get your books on revealing heaven and and your other side about Kat Kerr yeah uh my main website is called revealing heaven.com it's also the name of book one and book two that i have written about my encounters in heaven with evidence in the book that it's true

program and all that so i think that's it so without further ado let's bring kat Kerr online here and there she is hey Kat hey how somebody needs to raise your camera just a little bit there that goes well i hear you're not getting very much sleep these days what's going on everyone is getting excited and which is a good thing i'd rather have them all contacting me because it's a good thing happening then are we going to white be wiped off the face of the earth has God forgotten about us you know has he changed his mind is anybody going to the dark side is i just know i understand why God can trust some people and some he's still working on well what kind of things would you like to say about the election that is yet still in progress right now well everybody thinks it's still in progress i'll wink i'll tell you about all you're going to get me as far as that and i should give everybody a lesson about covert activities not talking about this one another clue when you have a covert you cannot say things people let's picture you as as somebody of importance in some country and all kinds of things are going on and you have to call in your covert team to do stuff okay are you gonna broadcast what you're doing where are you what's going on what is the time schedule absolutely not you just have to have a good poker face no i'm not saying to play poker let me tell you people who take one thing and they go wow i would never stop being excited and i'll tell you why because of what God said if it's his plan you can't abandon that plan because it didn't happen in your time frame right most covert activities they they do guess what they have a plan but it gets changed five times so what good would it be if they were going to tell you and there's so many parameters about being successful in that plan if you've got a lot of people that are involved a lot of things that have to be prepared uh even if you reach the point where it's really over for the other side you can't announce that until you've got everything in place everything is ready to present for justice to come you can't be telling people about that guess what you trust no matter what it is this is good life lesson you trust you trust God if you're a believer and if you're not you just trust and hope that something is going to happen if you have confidence in and who's in charge then that should help you some but just because it doesn't happen every day all day long it doesn't mean they're sitting on a log somewhere playing parcheesi okay because some people kind of act like that and i know people who've never in this time in this generation especially no one in certain generations have had ever had to taste or believe or trust for something really important that would impact your entire life but we are in that time right now but the good thing about this time is God really has a say in it and your prayers it's like your prayers are like fuel okay it's like fuel and when that fuel reaches a certain level that's it the action can take place well i will tell you in this situation that has happened i'm not saying to stop praying start thinking when you feel in the spirit if you don't know if you don't hear God if you're not a prophet and i need to tell some of them and the other one's all gone you know who you are too and let me you still have time to jump back on the train if you if you if you step back anytime during this thing thinking it had all failed or you were wrong or for heaven's sakes God was wrong get back on it before it's too late you'll be so happy you did because you'll be on the side nobody will listen to when this thing is over the ones who've stayed with their stand with God the prophets who stayed and stood and didn't go to the darkness who didn't who didn't they didn't give up you'll be so accelerated by God because he knows and has shown he knows already but he has shown to this world who can we trust who can you trust to hear in any time not just when in a time of crisis but in any time of your life don't lose your place on the path and God is really serious about this he's saying this to all the prophets don't lose your place in the path where you were because when you step back you know what the word says you're not fit you're not fit you're not in that place of hearing him that place of intimacy that place of integrity you have to get back on this train and saying yes God's going to complete it he's going to finish it yes i believe everything he said will happen and so i really want to encourage you you still have a very tiny window at this point to get back on the side with God saying you know everybody you have to learn to trust God he has spoken his word he said that there would be a landslide actually almost everything he said has happened already uh that there would be a landslide when that already happened okay i'm talking about you know the red wave whatever you want to call it i'm trying to be really um not careful with my words but uh i'm choosing them wisely okay we want to stay here so you can get information right now so you have to understand what God said that would happen that happened of course then you know things came in and people try to do fraud and stuff ah that's gonna go down and i can tell you this and now God is still saying has never changed what he said if you don't realize and remember what part of that was go back to the lodge list look on november the fourth and see what God said on that day that that thing he said that would happen is happening right now while you're sitting there whatever you're doing it's happening so celebrate you know celebrate that God's having his way righteousness will still be in the white house for four more years so there you go there you are let me know cover is different than every day i got this list to do here to go here's my school assignment it'll be this way every day it's not like that life is not normal and some people can't handle not normal okay well if you're gonna do wild things for God you better get used to not normal it's all good everybody yeah that's good okay one of the things that i observed and this this just you know as we all went from november three ever all of the um the vast majority of the prophets who had held that trump would be elected be health firm for a while and then what happened is someone started saying and pointing out that hey you all didn't notice it know this but even if biden gets elected trump has can legally run one more time and all of a sudden people started going oh that's what God meant he meant that trump will will serve two terms one then and one in 2024. that is what happened and there's those those emails are still passing around saying that's probably what God meant no that is not what God said period he never said that he said he would run two consecutive terms he would be in office when he first announced before he actually won the first time he will be in office for eight years then announce the next eight years and we can go into that little bit if you want to okay nobody in that size going to the dark side either i'll just say he said eight years for trump eight years for pence and eight years for whoever he picks the vice president there i've said it he never changed it and just because in your head what you see or hear whatever news i hope you're not listening to the fake news uh there i said that to you uh you need to know who you're listening to because what you let put in your soul right in here is what you will believe if you listen enough you wonder what in the world is wrong with my family members that they're so hateful and mean and uh vile when they never were before they compromised their soul as a man thinketh in his soul that's the core of the heart of your being that is what you will be are the abundance of the heart that your soul you will speak that stuff that's exactly what's happened we're going to have a great big soul checkup when this is over and if we can loose all the junk of their soul and bind the things of God to your soul and then you might be back to normal okay or maybe even better than normal but i will let you know it's who you listen to even the prophets you cannot listen to man and take what they are saying because it looks possible yeah well God is not the possible he is the God of the impossible okay right and so he made his statements very clear about what would happen who he chose and guess what he you may have changed your mind friends may have changed your mind your pastors may have changed your mind of the prophets may be true guess who didn't change their mind God the one who's been from the beginning to the end you this is a good if nothing else get a good lesson out of this well there's a lesson that we have for you to trust yeah i always say that this is every time you know we we're at the red sea we might be partially waiting in the we may have stepped through the waters i don't know and then at some point the waters collapse on the enemy whatever God's enemies are i'm not stating who that is or deciding who that is i'm just saying the prophets have been more prophets have used the red sea analogy or metaphor or para whatever and what we're going to and what happens is i imagine when they when they came to the red sea when the children of israel came to the red sea it didn't occur to them that they were trapped because they just thought they were going to get to hang out and worship him until they see the soldiers riding towards them it had no options you know it had to be completely utterly impossible you couldn't say for instance well there's another path path if you go way north there's a bridge up there 50 miles you cross the bridge and then someone says oh that's what God meant amen go up cross the bridge and then you're on the other side see so and i think that's what happens is we're trying to give God a break to tell him how he can get off oh yes God doesn't need to break people he only knows how it's going to happen what he needs from you is trust you trust okay we have prayed probably more than ever before in our life some people prayed for the first time in their life those are good things unless it's a prayer like dear God in heaven this is a mess come and rescue us come and take it out it not taking you out of this world it's staying and staying there for and that's what where a lot of people are but i can already let you know we have totally moved forward without you knowing it i'll just leave it right there so yes the the point of um is you could say it's the point of no return but nobody needs to return to try to go back and do something okay unless you got off the rock got off on the wrong path no God is on purpose doing things the way he is to expose as much as he can expose and i can just tell you this without you knowing it and other people knowing justice is already being dealt and you will know it you will eventually know all of this and you'll be so glad that's what you celebrated ahead of time now when i said eat cake i didn't mean a whole cake some people have taken everything to the extreme you know you need a little brownie eat a little cupcake eat a cookie not the whole pack i got a little cake but for me it's ice cream is the temptation ice cream with either butterscotch or caramel and whipped cream that's my cake okay well listen we gotta get on to the good stuff i just don't even know it's already okay it's already okay uh you need to get your go get your party hats your little party horns i've actually had some people who realize in the spirit they know the shift is happening and they've actually been texting me i'm getting party hats you know they still may have some on clearance from new year's please go and get them you'd be so glad you did you know about three or three days ago maybe uh i would say what is today maybe monday is probably was monday there's a guy whose name is known i won't say it because it's a private conversation but he said steve i've been feeling deliverance off of this nation for like a month or two months is a long time lots of deliverance and he feels that he's he's got the seer anointing or discernment anointing he can feel the demonic deliverance coming off of the nation he can feel it and he said i woke up this morning which was a couple days ago two or three days ago he said it's it's stopped and the lord said you've entered a whole new era and he said the warfare was over so i thought wow so but we i waited to see something with my natural eyes and so far i haven't oh i can just tell you this uh one of the greatest things you'll ever do in your life is to stand and trust God and let me thank you you think this is a long time no 10 20 30 years 40 years and not removed okay not be moved okay it isn't going to take that long these few days and weeks that we've been experiencing this um is worth it it is so worth it what you may have had to give up or change or or you know i know that wonders a good thing it was wonder about God you know there's wonder and splendor in heaven which means you're amazed at what he has you're utterly undone and that's how people will feel when this all comes out but trust me um we have a pretty smart man in the top seat right now and a lot of people may not think that but you're gonna find out how much we do and uh the fact that God is still a part of all of it to him and even in the moment when he he wondered if there was anybody with him he knew God was with him and so i just can uh encourage everybody out there this will come out the way God wants if he will rescue if he will rescue the world with eight people praying what do you think he's gonna do with millions of people intercessors and worshipers and uh people who sought the face of God and laid down and prayed and believed God what do you think he's going to do it's going to be fantastic that's what i can tell you well ken are you ready for some questions about heaven i am but i just thought this is cute somebody sent this to me hey that's good that's well done small piece it's a small piece of cake okay that's good well for those of you who are maybe new Kat has for the last 20 some years has been to heaven and visits many thousands of times and uh so she's always receiving revelation so she's not coming here without it with an empty soul or spirit she knows the things of the lord and she's here to teach us a lot of things about heaven and sometimes that spills over into questions about what happened on earth and so those so if you're ready i'm going to start uh Kat you said that you like it when children ask questions so i do this lady i think it's a lady wrote so my 11 year old daughter asked me to submit a question for kat she wants to know how quick it is from the time you die to win your get to heaven is it right away do you have to travel to get there if so does an angel or jesus meet you wow that's a really this is why i love kids see they're not in there in their head trying to figure out does this even happen they're excited okay they believe keep that faith of a child that's a good tip that's why they have fun that's why they can that's why they can forgive quickly with things just drop off when they go through things well let me tell you what there is no time there's no time in the spirit realm and really even though there's eternity you don't feel time going by it's it's like that it's just as if in a blink let's say a wink and that time i winked that could be from here and in heaven however there are some people that want a tour and he gives you a tour a tour of what he gives you a tour sometimes around the earth so you can stop by maybe they won't see you but you could just uh i'm going to give an example a friend of mine was picked up by jesus in his own chariot his chariots not just jerry flames of fire coming off of it the horses have flames of fire it's a show and it's a power show but sometimes he'll pick you up in his own chariot and he'll take you to some of the favorite places you went to uh maybe you want to want to say go by and even if they don't see you wave or even say i love you like if parents aren't there grandparents aren't there if your best friends aren't there and i do know that has happened many times to people and then he takes you on a tour of the cosmos now the cosmos is still the universe as you go past through the planet you can see the star fields all these beautiful things um it doesn't look black and dark like from here when we look up through the to a telescope there's light all around as you go plastic the planets create light the stars create light it's like the light show you've ever seen and then you get to go all the way up through the cosmos up until you have a place where you disembark in heaven and you get out of that chariot unless he took you in listen to this a starship a star cruiser an elevator uh all kinds of ways you can travel from here to heaven sometimes it's what people would really love a world war ii biplane okay giving you truth this is why it takes so long to answer the question there's so many ways and kids just love to go very unique ways because you can still dream okay and by the way dreaming and imagination is not a bad thing God God imagined this world and everything he considered in his heart it's okay to have imagination especially to create so you go on these wonderful journeys you don't feel like you're dead that's important to tell you that you've never had so much life in you when you step out of this physical body and the spiritual your spiritual body looks just like you steps out you feel like a child if you were really old this body you're young you look like you're in your 20s so let me if you're 99 and you step out and you're in your 20s your grandma's not going to want to come back and i tell people don't worry grandma back if she's had long full life just let her go and so you're excited you see your guardian angels for the first time if you never saw them they're going to be right there with you even if jesus comes to take you they'll go at the same time sometimes every now and then he'll bring somebody with him like maybe a best friend passed away or maybe it was somebody that you really love passed away and they were in heaven every now and then this happened to one of my friends he would bring them with him to take you you don't know what excitement and joy and adventure is until you have gone there so this is what people really confront they step out there's their family member maybe there's the guardian angels or there's jesus there waiting to take you and you step into this thing you go right through the walls isn't that cool you go through the wall in your spiritual body and then you go through the cosmos and see sometimes you'll go by star fields sometimes the rings of saturn um since this is italian spring i like to really see all this when you get up there there's some of the greatest things you've never seen in your life when you get up there it's beauty it's splendor it's wonder it's fun it's adventure all of your friends who are in heaven are waiting a lot of your family members are there the prophets could be there if you had pets they'll be there and then you all get to go into the throne room and jesus walks you up the steps of the throne and says here i'm bringing back your son to your daughter and then you really start to have this huge celebration so that's exactly what happens wow very good well you know you talked about jesus bringing you around that reminds me that it's on my list today i'm going to move that question forward because the person asked um i think it was a woman and she said um i know now when i pray on earth because God is omnipresent i can have him to myself because he's everyone can have them to yourself you have your intimate relationship and you can be praying and talking with him while someone else is and she wanted to know so what is it like when i get to heaven and he's got billions of people there i'd like to have myself but now he's in we're all here together and he's going to want to be without how do i how can i how much relationship do i get with the lord you get even more relationship with him really number one you're in his home right and you're being welcomed home you're the new person i'm telling you the problems will come and take you off somewhere to spend some time with you or they'll just come and visit you you this is one of the most beautiful things i found out about heaven is uh in your mansion you have a secret garden as part of it and people i don't like flowers there's more than just flowers there's not about the flowers you won't even think what you're thinking those thoughts and you're undone no matter what he gives you or takes you in heaven but as part of your mansion no matter what that looks like it could be really ultra modern supernatural under the crystal sea wherever it is you have a secret garden and he gives you a key when you get there when you want to be with him any time you go into that garden that's a part of your mansion and he comes to see you anytime he can be everywhere in heaven anywhere in heaven all the same time because there is no time i know that's hard for you to understand you have to wait to get there but it is true he can be with everybody all at the same time you won't see hundreds of thousands of jesus all over heaven but when you wherever you are and you want to be with him he'll be there and the father also the father also spends time with you so no it's even um i can't say better because it doesn't matter when you're with him you know what really matters is that you want to be with him right now here on the earth how do you do that you say it i really want to know you i want to get to know you i want to spend time with you i tell people go in a room somewhere if you can find one alone and just shut the door and say i'm here i'm going to talk to you i want to get to know you and i know your heart i want to know your ways i'm so excited that you're my lord it's not always about asking for things or you're in agony or suffering or you're afraid and i know all those things happen why not take some time when you don't have all this stuff around you and just just because there's time instead of watching something why don't you go say i want to be with you you know i did that for 20 years in a row you don't have to wait 20 years it was something he was training me in and now i step anywhere i hear them all i hear them father-son i hear them talking usually separately at different times but their heart is more for you to hear them and know them than your own their heart wants that more than what your heart wants wow yeah that's that's hard to grasp because you think you know that scripture says you know you'll seek me and you find me when you seek with me seek me with all your heart so i that's left me i love the scripture but it feels like the onus is on me to show him that i want him and i i guess that probably is true but you're saying they want the connection more than you want it they do they really do we have so many things going on in our head that can distract us and i'm not saying there are even bad things just living life you have to there's things you need to do and take care of or be a part of or you have to you know listen to people learn something you have to work somewhere any matter when i went to work if i went to work and i had a break i'd go talk with him somewhere uh it was just my focus my my my heart so desire to know him more but i didn't just sit around thinking it i did something about it i used to write down i would write down in a little book tonight i'm meeting with jesus and i know you may if you're young maybe you say that at seven or maybe after your dinner's over just go take five minutes in your room and go i'm right here jesus i want to know you more that's good i like you know how if all of heaven was talking to jesus he would stop and listen to you saying that because you're reaching out to know him and that so delights his heart so you think most people think he's up there he doesn't care no he's waiting for you to say something it's really like that you know when i was uh i would go back about 20 years ago i was beginning to realize because i had more kids that our kids were at home at that time they're all raised now but with the household i would i was discovering that when i went into the bathroom especially my master bathroom i had more revelation in that room simply because i was distracted and i would tell my home group someone made me a really nice wood embossed you know with a burned in it says revelation room and so i have a thing well outside my bathroom right now it says revelation and my staff i think elijah has heard that story so at the office they put on the door revelation room because i actually had a a particular one that was that was dedicated to me because they were extra bathrooms so they they put this on the one that was right across from there but that's very true it is really even for me even for me because you know my life is increasing in having to be connected having me that God desired me to be connected with other people have conversations with other people uh i always save time for him um like lately i've been probably getting to lay down around 8 30 or 9 30 in the morning having been up for 20 some hours um but even then you know he'll wake me up sometimes and say something to me find a room and i tell people really literally people we used to have prayer closets and back in my day growing up i mean i was born in the 50s people hello that means i've experienced a whole lot in my life i've been through a lot have to trust God for a lot so i didn't just get this way from just waking up one day and going yay i get to do all this and see all this no i was tested i was tested and and God would train me and talk to me and show me but i still had to experience life but really clean a closet out now if you're about 10 or 11 don't go throw all your stuff out of your closet on the floor in your room ask your parent to help make some room in there and make sure you can leave the door open a little bit if you need to go in there and find a little spot but the bathroom is this crazy it's right no one's in there with you right you're on yourself give two minutes to jesus when you're washing your hands at the sink or go in there just to say hi to him no one's going to come in and bother you or interrupt you and i always call it the the unspoken throne room that's good i'm sure the line's having a good time it actually does put the lid down put a towel on it and sit there and they don't no one's gonna come in there and bother you okay it's kind of crazy that's right how about here the more more the less stuff you have over here and your focus the more you're going to hear him clearly that's so true so so true well here's another one related to a six-year-old the mom is leah and she says my six-year-old daughter has been talking to what she has said is an angel named rose but i had someone tell me the angels are only male is it possible this is really an angel she's speaking with well i don't know who told you the males were only the angels are only males i don't know how that could possibly be because you know a lot of the things the way he made the angels they're made in tribes and they don't all look like they don't all look like you know um i don't know some things make me laugh out loud there are feminine and the word is feminist not male or female it is not it's masculine appearance and feminine appearance and there are absolutely some of those beautiful things that i've seen are feminine in appearance and they have the mannerisms and they they have long beautiful hair and they take care of like the flowers and the gems and stuff like that but they also are over things like sending out war shields and down to earth and i mean you can't always say because this feminine can only do that oh don't you dare say something to that like an angel there are feminine angels and i have seen this mom and i do know some of their names so uh that could very well be they need to learn i don't know a six years old probably old enough to know that if one ever comes and says you're supposed to go with me you need to train that child either to come and tell you that so you can say go tell that angel are you from jesus christ who died for the sins of this world now a six-year-old can learn to say that and they should really because it says to test every spirit that's not just like the the character or the personality of a person that's not what we're talking about we're talking about literally spiritual beings um and if they're still if they're starting to see them now that's important for them to know that if it says come and go with me or they want to say here take my hand and go then i would encourage them to ask that question uh the angels can't lie they can try to fake i'm talking about the other you know it says satan can appear as an angel of light and you're gonna slow down with my voice it says he can and he can he still has powers he still has abilities um but some of the angels that work under him also can do that and they don't do it um to make you afraid they'll take it places that aren't real and maybe bring you know deception to people so it's important for them to know yes there's angels in heaven who work who work on our behalf that God sends an assignment your guardians are right here around you but don't let the enemy try to fool you now on the hand let's say this is an angel from heaven and they're they're sending uh either words of wisdom to the child or maybe they need comfort or something like that comfort is actually a being in heaven it's a spiritual being and does look feminine a feminine appearance in heaven and so there's wisdom there's all kinds of them that are actually a being but there's definitely feminine angels yes there are maybe they haven't seen them and if people haven't seen a particular thing they think it doesn't exist and haven't there's so many you'd never be able to see them all i can just say that oh so good well good that's really good okay now this almost sounds like um this could be a kid but it's not it's a woman named martian she's asking who builds the mansions in heaven does jesus give the blueprints and then people who were carpenters bricklayers et cetera who do the building or what how do the mansions get built who does the blueprints and who does it who builds it the blueprints are always done either by the father or jesus and they actually have a boardroom in heaven where they draw out plans i've seen these plans where they've designed now their plans aren't like necessarily on a piece of paper they wouldn't necessarily be on something like you would see like this they're they're the lines are drawn in light so almost like a hologram that they they'll move their hand in parts of the mansion and it's not flat it's like a three dimension thing that they can see as they're designing that's the design of it framing it God's framing it and uh and jesus though is a master carpenter and yes every now and then what he does is he'll usually build it whatever it is he'll build it but to embellish things or to put things in it to furnish it i'd have to say other carpenters or other people would who are going to design something maybe they built fountains outside the home but it says that the builder maker uh no human hands built them and so you need to understand that that's jesus's delight the father's like in my father's house his house is a world the father's house is a whole world called heaven and some people don't know that either so when a mansion is being designed it's being worked on your whole life by the way they're working on it where they've decided to place it the things they put on your property they put inside uh there's doors on your man can you step into that takes you to another whole place that is also yours they design things are for these things are for fun or for delight and so they work on your whole life but i will say i do know this when they're done you're going home it is a sure sign God has caught me up many times and said this is this person's home we're almost done not quite done this person was going to grow vegetables now how about this vegetables in heaven for everybody to eat and enjoy and love and we're all done except plowing the field the home the mansion was totally done and i saw them plowing this field that looked just like earth but it was spiritual like heavenly earth and they grow very quickly but so that's a sign that when my own grandmother was about to go home to heaven i saw my grandfather who was a florist in heaven and he was designing this five foot flower arrangement and all the flowers sang so this arrangement would be like a symphony and he was putting that in her place and i told my mom i see your father putting this arrangement in your mom's place she's gonna go real soon and she went two days later so i do know when it's done if a child goes home of course their mansion is not done they will they'll still be building it but until that time you will live with a family member in heaven so you won't be alone wow now you touched on something i was going to ask so it was a part of my question i'm going to get to somewhere in my stack here uh you said this person's husband was a or someone was a florist in him someone wanted to know so do we know you don't work to make money you don't work to make a living do people have occupations or vocations not to make money but because they and not to get up in the morning to do because they're always nobody sleeps i understand so do people have vocations occupations jobs that they just do because they love it's called their gift that's what you're looking for you're working looking for the word gift every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of lights those lights he's talking about aren't stars that's what you look like a little spirit of life like you had a little body you lived in God you moved in and out on him on the rays of that rainbow that comes from him and so he already knew when you were there back that far when you lived inside of him before he sent you here and you together your mother's home he knew what you would be would you be a carpenter would you be a dancer would you be a designer would you be a baker would you be a jeweler would you be a mechanic nothing breaks down but people have car shows and they make everything look great and wonderful and they run on light i mean this could go on forever so i'm just letting you know it's what you put is your passion the thing that makes you click like i'm a photographer and it doesn't matter whatever else i do even this being a revelator for God i love that but my passion is to create photographs it is my heartbeat all day all night and i'm good at it i didn't have any professional training it was in me God said i'm sending you here you're a photographer guess what when i go home to heaven come by my studio it doesn't cost anything i will have all kinds of ways new ways to take photographs and even produce the photographs i saw them hanging all kinds of photographs and art hanging in people's mansions so maybe you're an artist maybe you will sing maybe you'll create music uh maybe you make amusement parks so that is a gift it's never work ask these people if they do work my photography it could take hours it's not a job it's a delight so that's what you get to do you lot you are that gift he made you and even little children they grow slowly they get to use different measures of that gift they're not going to lose it and then when they grow finally to what God would say is the timeless age they have they'll have their own place eventually they'll have their gift to use for everybody to enjoy and so that's what you do you do what's fun and what you love that's cool well that that makes that brings up a question that i'm going to ask you is is there such things as a as a mall where you shop you don't have to pay for anything but all the people that are making all these things they put it in the mall and you come in anything like that or do you just know the person you go to his house a lot of times because people love to fellowship in heaven uh number one worship God and even that looks a little bit different it's called living worship everywhere you go you worship everything you enjoy when he's made of you that's called worshiping him the second thing they love to do the most is fellowshipping and they love to meet people see people everybody's got stuff your mansion is designed around that gift but they have festivals why do you think we have festivals they'll have festivals where people can bring a lot of their stuff out there into wherever the area is huge festival's going to be no mosquitoes no rain to ruin okay no dirt that's good it's like a festival that's made out of light that's the only way i can say it yeah everything's about the glory yeah everybody bring all their artwork they have a one called the galleria an area in heaven where all different events they will bring all their beautiful art whether it's pottery jewelry you know glass whatever it is wood whatever it is they make things out of they'll bring all their stuff to give away but a lot of times i saw a jeweler's store and it was made out of this massive gemstone let's say maybe about eight ten stories high with all the facets when you came up to go in a fast that would open up like a ramp you walk up in it and all the display of this jewelry some was in the air floating some was on beads of light for you to look at but anything in there was free and people were buying gifts to put in their family members homes so when they got there they could have a gift so this is just one example and he could he would go he would harvest uh the there's a gem depot and the gems come from the the crystal sea where it flows from the father off the throne and all these gemstones are carried in it so they harvest they have people who harvest them i even know who they are the people listen to this this is God's sense of humor i hope this is okay but it's really worth it if you if you picked up trash for a living that didn't mean it was your gift on earth we we have a we have to have we have to work to have a living right in heaven you live to enjoy your life you live in heaven to do what you enjoy so those who had to pick up the trash every day down here they get to harvest the gemstones out of the gem depot this is for the jewelers the builders the designers uh to come and collect them to go and do and make things with so isn't that a tip somebody's joking they're very good somebody jumped up with me and goes i'm a trash man and somebody else jumped up with it i'll be your best friend in heaven now a minute ago i think you accidentally misspoke because you said everything is free and then people you said people come in to buy a gift for their friends do you mean people come in to just get a gift yeah they select it they come in take it off the show they just take it off the shelf and split right they don't have time and they gift up yeah nothing is so is so normal in your normal head to just say things the way they were on earth yeah exactly talk a whole different way if you're going to talk about heaven there's not physical things there but they are literal but as far as receiving anything whether it's going to amusement park and riding whether it's having food to eat there it is it is all for free it's given to you so no you don't you don't have to buy anything there's no money okay this we probably have time for a couple more quick ones here um i'm going to read this i can't read it all but what does it mean when a departed loved one appears before you as a spirit my dad who passed away in 2008 appeared out of nowhere while i was driving his eyes were shining like i've never seen before it brought me such a great comfort and joy this was short it was shortly after the devil attacked me mentally tried to get me to commit suicide my dad was wearing a shirt i knew he loved that that i later found in his closet and i guess he's asking she's asking what does that mean and i suppose he's asking is that okay as well i would have to say it happened so many times and people have so many testimonies uh even in it could be a time of maybe danger and for for some reason you wake up and you see and they just uh whatever if they said something it would be something short i i would say that's definitely God God allows that he permits it if they ask you know their if someone who's just going to heaven say can i please just briefly appear to let my family member know i'm okay and this is wild sometimes they'll be wearing their favorite thing they may not be wearing in heaven but when they appear to you some people can identify with them but the thing about the light shining from their eyes is absolutely yes when you move to heaven the light of God shines out of you so that would be yes i don't know why or when or how he chooses i do know that that's true i do know that sometimes in a moment of maybe danger people have seen a parent appear to them and say get up get up or wake up or get out and then they would disappear and they would realize maybe there was a fire or something so i i can't give you a complete revelation on why he picks or who he chooses i will say that does happen and the enemy of course i will tell you this when you receive something great an encounter or something like that from God treasure it and i would tell people write it down the enemy will come in to try to steal it from you and rather than struggle or be attacked just turn around and say you're not stealing from me get out you have to tell the devil just to get out okay he didn't have a right if you're a believer to attack you or harass you he doesn't want you to have that joy and he doesn't want you to think it's even that's real heaven's real so it happens quite often with uh people and in the beginning the enemy would try to do that now i laugh at him if he even tries i i laugh at him i'm not being bragging or anything i'm just saying i know it's just too late to try to convince me that's not real and uh so that was a real encounter if that did happen to somebody yes that was probably their family member that they saw interesting okay so um let's see okay so this person gene wants to know she heard you say our pets go to heaven she's then heard you say our pets talk i can picture my a few cats and dogs being smart mouth to me and say what were you thinking but she wants to know she wants to know what do they sound like do they sound like human voices do they sound like you does the dark quack like a duck no no no they sound like they sound you need to number one i is some questions you got to take a little bit of explanation because i will tell you exactly the way this is what i do i tell you exactly the way God showed me or the father showed me or jesus showed me it's always the same exact way he he told me the father said when i created creatures he calls them creatures uh dogs cats lions anything anything that's on the earth roaming uh i guess uh because i've even heard dragonflies speak in heaven so i can't say not insects by the way there's no mesquite there's no flies up there they all went to hell anyway but but he designed in the creatures or the animals make up the ability to speak in the garden of eden they all talked to adam he called them by name why would he say name he didn't say horse come here he gave it a name why how do i say that God gives everything in heaven on earth he gives them little nicknames or names so adam had conversations with the animals in the garden of eden okay that was on this earth that he did that and then he made eve okay she probably never stopped talking anyway so just like on the earth when adam fell when they fell and they turned their back on God he took away on purpose the ability for the animals to talk he didn't want them cursing him or them suck you know they're not guilty of that they uh animals and creatures they have no guilt um of that they don't have to repent of sins okay he made them when they die he takes their little their spiritual body your pet has a spiritual body he has a spirit of life and he takes that to heaven in their at your mansion inside or outside but yes they do have conversation i've seen it many times and they have different personalities if your dog likes to bark a lot they'll probably never stop talking in heaven uh if they really want to be real close to you be with you i'm i'm not making any sense this is the wildest thing that your pat will be with you forever so be nice to it right now [Laughter] for any reason this is true too if my pet or one of my cats have been made afraid i don't know from whatever i lay my hand on it and i say i lose hell off of you i'm not having fear in you and then i'll say i i bind the love of God to you uh my mom had a dog that was afraid and terrified of lightning as long as she said it was afraid it was always afraid but when she learned this truth that when you impart life to something it changes it she began to tell her dog all right here's the peace of God it's gonna be okay that lightning is gonna hurt you peace peace i put peace into you guess what the dog stopped being afraid so yeah animals are not more important than people they never will be but he does care he knows when one sparrow falls to the ground he knows and creatures are important to him too they're part of his creation and so i would say God does not like it when people are abused and he does not like it when animals are abused at all so yeah absolutely okay so here's a last question um i keep being asked this and i keep thinking ah she won't want to answer that but here i'm going to merge them all together as one question or one maybe simple maybe complex you know jesus said i've lost none of these except the senate perdition that the scriptures will be fulfilled sounds like judas was lost he betrays the lord but as before he commits suicide he says i've betrayed innocent blood so people are saying did he get saved because he repented okay okay he was not this is his thing he was never sorry for what he did okay i think he was sorry that he was caught there's a big difference no he allowed himself at one point in one pi point judas knew he was being uh led and uh moved and affected by satan he knew he was and he was dead set on forcing christ to be something he was never called to be and he not only that he gossiped about me back by them he stole from the treasury people i mean there wasn't much good about him really he had every opportunity while he was with christ he went places he saw the miracles is this crazy it's almost like the angels would have a new God on the throne was the creator they knew lucifer was created and yet they chose his words and his will over God so that does happen even in people down here and he just gave himself to him why why would christ have said that to him when they were having seven he said go and do what you must do say uh satan was using um um him judas and judas knew he was being pushed and pulled so even at the last supper and here's christ explain what will happen to him you would think judas wouldn't be moved but his soul had been corrupted no he still went out he still got the army he still did what was what was wrong he still did it now jesus had to die on the cross but judas chose those things to do those things and he is in hell he's in hell and hell seeing him there with hitler okay uh hitler's in hell if you ever wondered yes he's the most tortured thing in hell that's just a tip for everybody uh the more evil you are on the earth and satan said when you get here i'll give you all this power and everything he's never changed that lie no he just mocks you and tortures you more than all the rest so if you're over there doing evil for him thinking i'm going to be put in a high place that won't happen it's not going to happen so judas had every chance during the years he was with christ to repent and say i've had these wicked thoughts and then he reached a point when christ didn't want to set up his kingdom on the earth right there because jesus kept saying i have to die i have to do this stuff he wanted power judas wanted power he wanted authority he wanted more money so he's thinking if jesus is greater i'll have more to handle and i will be more important it was always about him it was about pride and no he did not he did not repent as in repenting for my sins repenting for the evil i did i think he was more repented that he got caught wow wow well kat that's that's our time that's so good so so good i always say you know because they have a big stack this stack keeps growing you can't see because i'd have to flip it i never can flip it and there's a whole bunch more i have to pray out so well we'll hit some more next week uh can't tell people how they can get your books on revealing heaven and your other site too yeah i have sometimes i'm talking and i'll forget my name i know okay my name is Kat i know i have pink care sometimes i forget that too so God pick somebody who you know um my my mind isn't filled and crammed with man's thoughts i don't listen to the news that is not good that doesn't promote good things i don't listen to it okay i find out what's going on usually my husband or somebody will let me know number one i want to say this even celebrating right now when everything comes and you see the fruit of everybody's prayers and standing in faith what God's doing for this country for the president and uh and that justice you'll see so much justice brought don't forget all of it a couple years later down the road remember you were intimate with christ it brought you closer when things get busy and exciting and all the new inventions come don't don't just put jesus on the shelf i just want i want to let you know every day get up ask for grace for abundant life and he'll give you fuel from heaven make sure you're kind to people that goes a long way in heaven when you're kind to people make sure you share the truth don't try to force it down people but always remember to share it okay this is just a tip for your life right now in this life in this moment say something encouraging to people if you're out in the store or something like that mask will be a thing of the past eventually he said he's even going to take the virus off the earth because these are days of great celebration remember what God did for us in this time and what he did for our country these are great exciting days epic days people will talk about for a very long time of how the hand of God moved and and so many people more people will believe there is a God be grateful you're born right now remember you have things some people don't always consider other people they might need a little help they might need a smile uh you'd be surprised how much a little goes a long way with people a note you know i know you're going through something i just want you know i'm praying for you or just

hi steve schultz here we are with the ligest streams today a lot of times you're seeing us on the live shows that are actually out of my home today we're in our actual studio and we're here with kat Kerr good to see you it's about time we've gotten together i know i'm excited to be here so it's really great to talk about what we decided to do today is we're going to talk about heaven and what i want to do today is hit all the main questions and we sat down yesterday and began to make a list it's way too long but we'll see where it goes that we're going to do a second show for those watching we won't even finish on this show so watch for the second one so i'm going to start right off by asking you um the question that some people ask how many times have you been to heaven i lost count after a thousand times i i just gave up and stopped counting but it's been 25 years this year is it thousands then it is thousands yes and how how are you defined between going to be wherever heaven is versus the lord walking through the wall i mean is it like is it just as many times he comes through the wall and talks to you or what i think it's probably more being caught up to heaven in the beginning it was right now i think it's a lot of walking through the wall he just walks through the wall i mean just like if you could that you would just walk through the wall it's that real it's not like he's a little wispy thing remember the lord is actually in his glorified body so he walks bodily through the wall and just will talk to me sometimes he sits next to me sometimes it's the father it is usually if the father walks in it's not to sit down and have a conversation if he's going to have a conversation he'll catch me up to heaven if he's going to say something important to me like write something on the wall which he does often he walks in he'll glance at me and walk over to the wall write whatever he wants and then he'll say take a picture because it'll be gone after a while really and then he'll stand there explain to me what this is and why i'm doing this and then he'll just walk back out what do you mean take a picture do you mean take your actual camera and take a picture yes of the lord's handwriting yes he wrote the last time he did that he wrote the next 50 years of my life on the wall and what i would be doing and the platforms i would be speaking from he's very detailed and i'm a detailed person which is why he uses me to do this so i know i've heard you talk about we'll get into the heaven thing in a minute but what are you going to say how does your answer when people say well i thought the word said that God said no one can see me and live well i have to tell you this that's probably more about your flesh that you know we die to our flesh right a lot of people don't understand that that's your rights your opinions your attitudes when it says to walk in the spirit not the flesh he's talking about that kind of a thing and i know anyone who's been caught up to heaven and saw the father they were never the same but you also have to understand that even in the word john himself in the book of john said himself no one can see the face of God and live he was talking about the father but what did God do in revelation what did he do in revelation 4 he caught him up caught john up remember he's on the isle of patmos he was in the spirit which is a place and he heard a voice he saw the door open and he was caught up before the father's throne the father is the only one who has the rainbow coming from him it describes in a revelation right and that's who john saw so john actually did see the face of God and this is when he was alive and was caught up in his body taken there and there's that place in um you know the lord is rebuking um i think i don't know if it's miriam but he said with moses i speak to him face to face that's right as one man talks to another so he in genesis exactly what happened uh when he came called them out of the tent of meeting and he was rebuking them because they were complaining about moses thinking he was something special and he was the only one who could see God and God clearly told them when i speak to him i don't speak to him in dreams of visions i speak to him face to face so there you go i think it has a lot to do with what the father desires and if it's the father who does it i obviously don't call him from heaven to come off his throne he comes down because he has something he wants revealed or wants me to know there's going to be a change in what he's having me do and each time he catches me whether it's up in heaven or comes to me is something really important now i'm i would have assumed and i've known you for what ten almost ten years seven eight nine years and i would have assumed before knowing you that you must have sought the lord for months or years to please help me go see heaven one day i sought the lord because i loved him and i did it for 20 years but that didn't change or didn't really cause what was going to happen because God said he chose me before i was born to reveal heaven to earth and to create things off that look were in heaven and put them on earth so it was my it's a commission i have so it wasn't that you begged him and finally i never asked once to go to heaven i just wanted to be with the lord i wanted to know jesus christ more and every night between midnight and 4 for 20 years i would meet with him in the beginning he didn't show up but i acted like he was there i would just tell him i didn't complain about things i didn't give all my needs i just really wanted to know him and i'd say how much i loved him that i would love to be just like him i wanted people to know his heart and i wanted a relationship with him and one night maybe months into all this he walked through the wall for the first time in my home i got undone i thought i would melt into the floor because of the the love that he carries and so it was it was amazing and from that time he came often but i didn't stop doing it and then in 1993 he actually came and said something to me that they were going to give me a new thing to do and to prepare for this new thing and so for three years i really sought him he trained me in different things and then in 1996 he walked through the wall of my home again while i was doing dishes and uh and that's when he said the father and i are going to start taking you on tours of heaven and from that day he took me and they haven't stopped so you're going on and it increased a lot so now it's almost every day sometimes several times and i've heard you talk about you were shopping one time you put your hand up to take an item and between the time you took reached up and came back down and you had already been to heaven what it would seem like about 45 minutes or something like that absolutely because there's no there's no time in heaven there's no time well so you said one of the main questions that people ask you is is there a literal heaven and i'm thinking well why would they ask that but that's that's it what do you what do you think it's a viable question they wanted to know if it was a place where they would really live you know it talks about mansions in heaven in the in the bible i was raised on the word of God from the time i was born my dad was a very precious person who loved everybody i'm one of 15 kids so but i chose to spend time with my earthly dad like i did later with my with my heavenly one and so he taught me about the word and so i was accustomed to what the word said and things so so this is a literal place there's a literal place a little heaven and i learned very early on that your spiritual body inside of this natural body this physical body you have a spiritual body that looks just like it except much better your spiritual body doesn't age it grows to a certain point and then after that you're like timeless so when you die out of this physical body which goes in the ground it's what rest your spiritual body is taken to heaven either by jesus in chariots uh or just caught up by your own guardian angel and you're taken to heaven and it is a literal spiritual place it's a planet it's not a flat place in the book of john recently there's a sense of around yes around things so forget the flat earth people that's really so heaven is interesting a planet bigger than our whole galaxy and there's such life even in the atmosphere even up in the sky of heaven there's a life going on and you have a literal mansion he wouldn't have said you didn't so you're going to sit on all of your beautiful furniture probably made by jesus these mansions are not made by human hands and they have some under the water well i'll talk about that later i know he mentioned the mansions but you have a real mansion you have a real life you taste the food you walk on the ground you don't walk through the trees this your spiritual body in a spiritual uh place like you live here okay so it feels it feels like you're in your spiritual body but you're saying if you walk up to a tree you could touch the tree you can climb the trees climb the tree if you wanted to probably be talking to you while you did that you eat real real food except no animals are killed it's all made out of light but smells like steak pizza chicken whatever and so you live a literal life and you get to use the gift God put in you like if you're a baker you're a baker in heaven jesus will visit you a lot he likes sweets and so you have an actual life in this mansion in heaven that's amazing well let's let's go um and one of the questions people say well what happens the moment i die now you already kind of mentioned that but there's okay you're you're dying and suddenly you've taken your life it doesn't matter where you are or what situation you're in you could be very sick could have been sick a long time your spiritual body will begin to lift out of the physical body just like in the movies because you see people just step out of their bodies your guardian angel is there and what happens begins to happen before you many times you'll see your guardian angel before you step out of that body and they're actually saying come on let's go let's go we have to go and sometimes jesus will be there and he'll be saying saying it's time to go come on and people sometimes resist a little bit but eventually they're going to come out and the minute they step out they're whole there's no sickness there's no age no handicaps whatsoever the life of God flows i think the life of God comes everybody talks about peace there's peace but there's joy there's celebration there's excitement you know you're going home and yeah just do you it sounds like it comes to you pretty quickly but you don't know what first kind of what's happening it sounds like for a moment well but this is the thing you think is strange you come out of your body you see your body laying there okay and you go okay how can i be there when i'm here and you instantly feel yourself because you're a spiritual body right but you can feel yourself and people are surprised and they go man i feel good and here's family remember saying we want you to come back if you're 99 you're not going to come back okay and then either jesus your guardian angel will take you on up to heaven through the cosmos literally you can go through and see all kinds of things to the cosmos sometimes people are taken by their pa their family members homes just to wait even though they can't see them yes they are their family members on earth yeah almost as if to say goodbye yes absolutely when you talk about the cosmos you said something recently and i don't know if this is always true but the way you described it is when we see things about outer space and star trek and star wars there's there there's the black space and then once in a while there's a planet you said at least at one point God would take you on a tour in in the the space was not black it wasn't black and uh now when he takes me i'm in my spiritual body i'm not in this flesh body so in your spiritual body you see things that you didn't even know were out there but he takes you like through the nebulous up to the planets and they are filled with light it's light it's light because you have to understand you there's a spiritual realm in a physical realm but they're like together at the same time in your physical body you don't see all the light that's in the spirit realm but in your spiritual body you would see all of that light and so it's like a whole different thing going through there in your in your spiritual body and most people do get to go on a tour around the cosmos and i say the cosmos because the word universe means by the big bang theory oh okay and i think in a lot of the ancient writings they call it the cosmos they call it the cosmos in heaven and that means by God's design you you told me one time and different things mean something special to to to different people what you told me kind of sounded special to me that God would do this kind of funny thing and without telling the name of the family because it was a real family there was actually pictures on the wall of somebody's mansion from their time on earth that seems really weird but also kind of cool yeah they do have a gallery you do have pictures of your family members but this is the thing in the people's mansions are pictures of babies and people that aren't even born yet really i don't think i got to tell you that no you didn't tell me that this one person's mansion i was taken to you they had a couple of brothers and a sister that i knew of and their pictures were on the wall but there were other siblings and they hadn't even been born yet and in the holy spirit said these are those who will be born and are not born yet it's like i could not and i couldn't fathom to me it was like really because there's a few pictures from our kids or my wife especially when we were young and we had these great pictures together and you're saying God would take some of those even though one day the elements will burn up with fervent he's going to take some of those photos and it'll be waiting for me in my mind absolutely yes that is so to me that's cool someone else would say i don't want to know anything from if your house was burned up in a fire and all your precious things like that were lost those same pictures you used to treasure he will have in heaven for you that's unbelievable talk to me or talk well about transportation there's got to there got to be a lot of different ways to travel around remember i keep reminding people i'm not talking about earth okay earth is a shadow in heaven which means it says in the bible that heaven is a country in the city so that's why we have city areas and we have country areas it's because heaven does and the transportation they have kiosks like it would maybe 12 people could step into it's like a big frame like thing and light is shooting out and you step into the beams and they will take you to the other side of heaven instantly that is one way i've i've experienced that another way is when you begin to worship your your worship is visible your song the words are visible ribbons of color intertwined with your words when you worship and you're caught up and you actually ride on that worship all the way into the right up on the worship that you just that you just as you're singing you're riding on that worship and there's like ribbons of color like when people sing now in a meeting i see ribbons of color coming out of their mouth the same thing with instruments and because i'm a seer so this is in the spirit realm what you're creating and heaven it's a substance something and you can see it on earth now right yes like i gotta ask this because i was talking to someone in the studio before that and uh before this program and we were talking about there are times when we worship God we don't even feel like worshiping but we know we're supposed to worship because he's worthy of our praise so that's like a sacrifice of praise and i have felt like to me it must not be worth that much because it's not flowing from me i'm doing it as a sacrifice maybe it doesn't sound so beautiful right but it's coming from your heart and uh and you're honoring God in the highest way in your worst day in the highest way yeah in the highest way because when your worst days you're worshiping him anyway you're very dangerous against hell when that happens now when worship happens on the earth normally it it is collected number one by angels a lot of times but it also goes up through the atmosphere and it's put into the bowls before the altar of God and it creates an incense well that sacrifice of praise is the most beautiful incense in the throne room when someone's doing that but it also creates a weapon as you do that when you say that you know i i you're worthy anyway you know you are my God and i will not serve another you are it missiles come out of your mouth and they go up through the second heaven where satan has this little mock kingdom set up and you actually blow up parts of it i mean really it explodes they have to try to rebuild all the time and so you're very dangerous against hell and your worst days we should always worship God especially i mean literally this has never been taught taught to me so i mean i'm i'm just going to say back to you what i just heard when i'm having a cruddy day and i feel like doing nothing there is this massive like atomic nuclear power if i say if i say lord you're worthy anyway i i just feel empty but nevertheless you're worthy you're saying missiles are flying out it's like missiles of light they fly out of your mouth straight up to heaven and on the way up to heaven they hit satan's little mock kingdom in the second heaven and literally whatever is in the way blows up it will blow up he's got these mock streets of gold that look horrible he's got his uh trophy rooms he's got there he's got his throne sits on a mountain of skulls literally and it blows whatever's there is going to blow up so he's already patching and repairing everything and so he didn't think that he didn't think anybody would worship God if he was trying to rule over them or crush them down and and you're saying that that actually is also a sweet smelling aroma to the lord roma i've been in the throne room when people were worshiping and i knew somebody was having a really hard time the in the aroma increases it's like it comes into you like life you can see it like wafts of light and oh my gosh the aroma and the father's just receiving that praise it's very precious to him that is amazing you know that's i had heard this concept of it being important to the lord when i and elmer wrote we we published a book called transported by the lion of judah where she was writing on the lion and God took her to a place where there was this very i'll just the term was very dry not very powerful worship but they were doing the best they knew because they didn't have the what we might even consider the full gospel and the lion said this is one of my favorite places to go because i can't even fathom it's like everything's turned upside down that when it was the hardest to worship and the driest God is like loving it and appreciating it the most because we're looking at times like that i'm looking at someone up there dancing in the spirit and they're flowing and going and you think why wouldn't it be nice to to worship like that but God's looking at it differently so when we go to heaven my first question is if i get to heaven and someone that i love let's say one of my brothers and sisters because a couple of them are not serving the lord right now and let's just as a just a what if what if one of them never chose the lord and didn't make it am i going to be sad for the rest of eternity because i know that they didn't choose there's a few dynamics to that that everyone needs to know number one if you pray for them adamantly to know christ it gives christ the ability at the time of their death to ask him if they want him many times you will maybe think they didn't make it but they did and the very first trip they took me on that was something jesus explained to me however if for whatever reason they did not make it that is not something that would cause you suffering i know that's hard for people to think but when you are in heaven and living in the very presence of God himself and jesus christ any sufferings any kind of pains they don't touch you it isn't that you wouldn't care but at that point in your life you would realize and understand like everyone else on the earth that had a choice to make and it just wouldn't cause suffering however nine times out of ten they're probably going to make it because of your declaration and your stand for them and that was the time when jesus said make sure you tell everybody to never stop believing for their family members to make it it gives me permission because of your words what you do day or decree will be established unto you and if you're standing in faith for that then even at that very second uh even if you're not there if you're there and you can't see he will still meet with him and say do you want me so i have like right now as we speak i have probably four siblings that aren't serving the lord so you're saying or the lord's saying yeah if i if i'm standing in faith for them saying lord i want my siblings i want and i name them all i want them to know you i'm standing for them i'm trusting that you're going to say you're saying i could pretty well trust that God's saying i uh yeah i'll take that i'll see you i'll see because he can't let your words drop to the ground the bible talks about that your words how important your words are so important your faith you're releasing faith on their behalf for their salvation and there's actually something he has me teach people father i declare that my loved one will make into heaven they will be a living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ and they will not miss their destiny with you and but you don't have to say those words but those are really good words to use you're out of your heart saying God i want them to make it please let them be in eternity i don't want them to be in hell i'm standing in the gap for their salvation if you say anything similar to that prayer then pretty much he's going to meet with him at their time of death and he has the keys and i can't go into a lot but he has keys those keys are to hell death and the grave and those were the ones he took away from satan just to give everybody a reminder talks about that in colossians and that's why he rejoiced when he got them back because that gave him the ability at that time of death the keys of hell death and the grave he had the right to do that if you were standing for their salvation i have and you know i'm my life sometimes is an open book because i just say it because it is but like okay my two sisters who are not serving the lord can understandably be not serving the lord because they were molested over many many years yes and it was it became known by everybody way long after they were adults nobody knew yeah okay so now probably even because of what he did they're not serving the lord one's totally into a wiccan witchcraft the whole thing um a lot of people do go to into the darkness if they've experienced a lot of that so so they went that way and i can stand for them but here's the here's the thing here's the rub the one who did the damage to them is with the lord now because he repented he repented and we see the lord they would never forgive you clearing over them so when they get to be there and they will go because i'm going to stand for them to go what's that going to be like they're going to be up there and there's this father that abused them how does that work they won't think that way anymore you are so filled with the love of God you hold nothing against anybody when you arrive there or those who let's say we're on the other side maybe they were the abused ones and they arrived and here comes those who they didn't think maybe would get saved but they're saved there is no hate there's no anger there's none of that there there's nothing but love and let me tell you the person up there will actually say to them i am so sorry i didn't treat you well you know i want you to know i love you i'm so glad that you're here that's probably not because of me but i'm grateful that you made it so let's just love one another and instantly that relationship is bonded right there wow yeah it's interesting i i love that you're saying that because this is probably a decade ago this sister said because i was trying to say you know dad's with the lord now and they probably didn't want to hear that no she said if he's there i don't want to go that was what i was going to say and and i understand that but i didn't know what to say what do you say you just say well i'll just keep praying for you and believing God for you that's what you say you can't really you can't really explain or even make them want to change that it's something that has to happen with them in God but because you're standing for her salvation she will get into heaven because you're not dropping next and your dad's up there saying the same thing by the way that you know my daughter will become a living testimony to the saving power of jesus christ i'm standing for her also well i was going to ask that do those that go before do they still proceed yes they do and their prayers are your prayers are actually mixing with your prayers they're they're getting it they're going to get caught between heaven and earth just like this is what happens so we're two or more agree on anything so my dad and i are praying for absolutely in agreement with your salvation that's like huge that's like huge it is huge um okay so husband and wife uh one goes to be with the lord years before which is my father and my mother and my mother gets there what's the relationship like do they live next door do they walk arm in arm are they friends what what what is it like in heaven for a minute they will totally remember they were married and they will be really good friends and because most families live real close to each other they'll probably live either next door or down the way you know maybe somebody wants to live by the crystal sea someone wants to live in the mountains but there'd probably be a place in between the areas somewhere everybody does things together as a family they remember they were family but of course it says in the bible that you won't be having a wife in heaven you'll be like best friends am i probably going to call my dad hey dad is he you can call him dad if you want to but probably most people will call everybody by the first name of heaven but you'll still know that you were his son yeah it's it's almost hard to think of and the things you remember are the great things if you remember the good things or you create new great things if you didn't have any of those so and and if someone and i remember asking this i can't remember quite how you answered it before but someone had always wanted to be married and it never happened they would and i um i've had multiple letters that they said ask Kat i've always wanted to be married what will happen when i get to heaven i don't know what kind of answer they're looking for but what do you say to someone like that when you get to heaven no matter who you let's say you had a friend a close friend maybe you were engaged you died and went to heaven you you would be good friends in heaven but there's only one bridegroom in heaven and when you go home to heaven you are going home as the father son or his daughter and there's going to be a wedding ceremony in heaven you know that everyone knows it as a believer jesus christ is the bridegroom and marriage on earth is only symbolic of christ and the bride it's just symbolic and because there isn't any of that fleshly thing going on it's a spiritual love which is much higher than the cersei love everyone in heaven is in love with jesus christ number one so they'll still have that feeling of having someone who loves them especially it doesn't matter how many people in heaven jesus loves everybody in heaven and can spend time just with them in heaven but there's going to be a wedding ceremony and it will be with the bride of christ in heaven christ is the only bridegroom and the father actually spent time explaining to me why you can't go home married if you went home married that would be big of me because you can't marry be married to jesus christ and already be married and everyone wants that everyone wants that relationship with jesus christ so it's all going to be good yeah and i had a woman that wrote and she she had always wanted to be married and another one wrote and said and she i i remember asking you about this and she was looking for something that i could didn't even not answer but she said i have been celibate on purpose my whole life and she wanted to know what the reward in heaven would would be for that i just think the relationship with jesus you've already got a super close relationship with jesus some people don't many people got born again probably within just a little time of going to heaven but you can build that relationship with him he wants to but those who already have the intimacy with him yes it's very special some people maybe feel like God they're so in awe of christ right but when you have that bond with him you just run up and grab him and hug him and so that is really the reward that you've already built that relationship it's not something you have to try to build on in heaven you already have that real intimacy it's not like yeah it's not like the lord is we've we've talked about the lord you know putting gifts in your mansions and building things in your mansions i've not heard you yet or anyone else say because you were celibate on earth and you did this on purpose there's going to be this special message for you there's a special place actually it's called passionate paradise i don't know if i've ever told you about it i don't know it's where those who really gave themselves to christ you know loved him on the earth and didn't well you of course everyone can go there but the greater relationship you've built with him you get to do more things there with him one of the things i know he does is he gives you his own song or he sings to you alone in this place and uh jesus is very romantic not the way we would look necessarily like it down here it's all about that closeness you have with him so she'll be greatly rewarded for that having given herself to him talk about i don't know if you called it a secret garden or your own garden you said everything else has a garden and what's that yes outside of everyone's mansion there's a walled garden a beautiful walled garden made only for you you as that's your mansion he gives you a key when you come to heaven jesus gives you a key anytime you want to be with him you go in that garden and he comes to be with you and the rose it's a rose the lock is a rose and you put the key in the middle of the rose there's a hole and you turn it yeah and many different flowers usually your favorite ones some of the flowers that christ loves and actually is something that's one of his favorite things are the flowers he loves flowers people leave him on the steps of the throne all the time along with sweets i think that's the second sweet so there's got to be i'm trying to picture a mansion i can i can picture a kitchen where you would make things and if you wanted to then why don't you say if you wanted to i am true i'll just speak into existence yes that's what i'm going to do my wife's not going to want to cook and she even when she's visiting you know but okay so i can picture a gathering room okay obviously there's no need for a bathroom so a bedroom there's you wouldn't think of a place to sleep so what's in this mansion you have well this is the thing God is so precious if you always said you wanted certain things a certain way like i want the biggest bedroom ever but it's not just a bedroom there'd be places to recline to meditate just to relax and everything there are rooms like that in your mansion and usually made lot of the times the way you would always want them made so there's places that you can go that's just beautiful your your favorite fragrances are like coming out of the wall flowers living flowers are growing out of the walls singing to you you have this place just to be because let me tell you sometimes you'll look a place to be alone because everybody wants to see you and know you you know and they all know where you live in heaven and so you have these beautiful places i call them like parlor rooms or something you know places you just enjoy yourself maybe your closest friends you'll invite into that place to spend some time just chatting and laughing talking about places you're going to go to in heaven your dining rooms could hold 100 people it depends on if you like to entertain if you want a lot of company i was shown this one person's mansion she could see a hundred people in her dining room and everybody said i mean it would look like king's tables the gemstones were actually some of the stuff that were in the center pieces and living flowers like growing and singing on these tables and everybody sat down and all the plates were just beautiful layered place with all kinds of you sit there and say i want roast beef and then it appeared instantly someone goes no i want gonna have fried chicken no i want seafood and what everybody wanted instantly you would actually say at the same time there's all the food everybody eats you taste the food you can feel the food going in it's made out of light though it's not really roast beef it looks like it looks and smells like it but no animals are killed no life is taken in heaven okay it's all made out of light but if you want to cook there's things that look like that stuff and you have a full lot kitchen with things you never saw before and the greatest thing is i was also shown that somebody was making this massive salad about the biggest this table and they were like peeling this cucumber and as they peeled it and it came off the end it disappeared there's no trash no garbage anywhere in heaven so they got to make food if they want to cook i won't i'll say chocolate cake and that's probably what i'll have i'm going to declare a decree okay let's talk for a minute about um you said you know have friends and you use the term if you have some special friends that you want to so what i'm getting by that is that you have friends maybe that you had here on earth that are still your friends and and you have then special friends and then do you make new friends that become your special friends you absolutely do and some of those are the disciples or the prophets everybody wants to know you so at one point when you come to heaven jesus is going to put on a big event for you in his own mansion i don't never touch this jesus has his own i said okay he had to live as a human he deserves one that's what i say that is a joke and all the tables are set in his mansion for two things dancing and eating sweets and he will actually send this beautiful carriage for you an angel will come within a personal invitation from christ that will read itself to you and he gives you the best things to waste itself to you yes the invitation will read itself to you everything is alive in heaven and then they wait you you get dressed i have all this beautiful and it takes you to this place and everyone is there to meet you there's apostles there's prophets probably adam and eve you know definitely probably elijah likes to meet a lot of people he didn't back in the day but he likes it now king david is always going to be there because king david is loves to be with people and meet people so this whole event is for you wow and he does that jesus does it just for you so you don't have to run around trying to find these people you get a chance to meet them and know them and later they'll come by and see you or invite you to their there's their mansions in places and i do remember you talking about people's closets and their choices oh yes talk about that you don't get a closet you get a wardrobe room that probably could be like maybe a thousand square feet that would be holding your wardrobe and that doesn't mean just like rope not just a gown and a robe you get those so you get your gown of righteousness your rover righteousness and your gown of salvation which are beyond amazingly beautiful but you get whole wardrobes because there's so many things to do in heaven we didn't talk about that yet and so everything you would need to go anywhere and do and enjoy things in heaven all those all those apparels are in there uh different things to go with all of them are in there your crown room is part of your mansion the crown room there's soul winners crowns it's the prophets all kinds of different crowns you earn on this earth really yes and so you can go in there and see all the crowns that you have gotten through your life and doing things for christ now as i'm looking i'm watching the clock we've got about five more minutes yeah what what about you said i don't remember was in the house or out in the yard there's like a doorway it's in the yard in the yard and you can go to different places to the store i love that that's very star wars star trek it is very star trek star wars star trek actually has some stuff that actually kind of exists in heaven i love how that creativity drops into the mind of man but one of the few times probably one of the first five times i was taking heaven and i was taken to see this man's mansion and uh it was amazing it was beautiful it was probably like gosh probably i'd say maybe a mile square and then on his mansion grounds i kept seeing these doors they were suspended in air there was there was a front of the door and you could go around and there's a back of the door but when you went through the door on the same space his mansion was on it was a whole different place that belonged to you so you could have your house built along the crystal sea but here's these different doors you walk through you have a place in the mountain of spices also and when you walk through she could look out the door and see that mansion the grounds but you go in here and go all through this other area that belongs to you see i can see i can picture saying okay i want i want to go to this door i want my cabin in the mountain yes and i want my thing on the on an ocean with waves yes and the crystal sea sounds pretty good too so you can have multiple places yes yes the place he said i go to prepare a place that place has so many things and properties that are all yours heaven is almost unlimited and as many times i've been there i haven't even seen just a little tiny bit of reality yeah but i've seen many mansions built in the sky on the ground under the ocean under the crystal sea on top of the crystal sea up in the mountain of spices and so uh people who love these things you're not going to be limited to one little spot well it's other thing and then then you talked about mobile your me about that what does that even mean that means you get an rv in heaven people always wanted one and never got to have one like my parents always wanted to have them on tour everywhere they have them but they fly and they're called mm's this is all the truth no way by the way i was psychoanalyzed by psychiatrists and said there's no way i could lie because i've said all these thousands of times mobile mansion and your family they go up into the sky they park in the sky and they're beautiful they're not like don't don't picture an airstream or something like this way beyond that it's very supernatural looking and you all get in there and you leave and go together all over places in heaven they have places to park i keep telling people my dad is helping you park that was something he loved to do and then you come down and enjoy like the uh you could go to the mountain of spices and see all that there's beautiful things to see there uh you could go to video land you could go to the artist gallery all these are places actually in heaven the rain forest where 12 massive trees support your whole mansion there's no roof on it things can fly in and out nothing's gonna make a mess so you can imagine how people get so undone there's adventure in heaven everywhere and your family go all over heaven like tour places do things taste all the food everywhere then they come back and they park and they come down then they all go back to their mansions i love this when we do the next show and watch for the one because we'll do two of these today they'll air a different apart probably a week weeks apart but um i'm going to talk about ask you about people looking down so don't tell us that now we'll make people but we're going to talk about people being able to look on us yes and see and pray for us and that sort of thing and uh i did want to ask you one last question when we're praying for our relatives and God gives them one chance is it like they die and they begin to come out like you described and at that point he says he get he says gives them a chance he talks with them then how does that work sometimes he does it especially if people are like in comas and stuff like that and you know you know they're they're sort of normally unconscious you have to understand your soul never sleeps your spirit man never sleeps sometimes he reaches them at that point and maybe they never come back you know to their senses or something like that where you could actually see and talk to them they would still go to heaven and it's normally it's right at that moment at that moment when he says because they are praying for you and they'll he'll actually show them who's praying they're a strong believer they've been with me a long time they've stood in faith for your salvation i can't let their words drop to the ground they've declared and they have decreed this continually you would know me and serve me so i have to ask you do you want me now and i tell you they get undone they weep and then you will cry and i can say almost everyone will say yes and they'll still repent i repent of all my sins all the times i reject you i am so sorry i i really want you so much so and he goes okay then then i will it made me think of that last night we were together and we were talking about then this just happened so like two nights ago there was a man who betrayed me in business years ago this is like in the mid-80s a long time ago now he's 90 something and he's been in a nursing home they finally got him and brought him back because of different things finances and now he's back to the house he's mostly gone yeah his mind is not there he doesn't remember anyone he didn't even remember he he looked at a picture of his son recently and he's he said who's that so it's not alzheimer's but it's one of those things that you go in and out yes so the other night he had one of those moments where he was lucid and he could think and his son told me just told me about it he showed him a picture of me and he and he looked at it and he concentrated for a minute he says oh i didn't treat him right and it's like oh man all that was all i ever ever needed he knew he was wrong right yeah that's all i ever do that's how the lord does that confession yeah if you confess your sins you know he's yeah and you had to forgive him anyway all these years but it felt so good how wonderful of God to do that yeah it's like a real gift from God and and at that moment when he gets to heaven he'll really realize man when he gets here so well interestingly enough this specific man if you took the whole train through what he had done he's responsible for what i'm doing now because i saw him at a trade show once he stuck his hand out and stopped me down the aisle and says hey have you thought about buying a house that's what it was in 1990 wow and one thing led to another and we started going to the bible study and we received the lord in a big way all through that particular matter wow so it goes it's quite a story so that's my story well anyway that's our that's our time we when we when we do our next show we're going to talk so much about what happens when your relatives can see us and different things really this believe me there's a lot more to cover so make sure you still celebrate celebrate celebration God's gonna do something possible celebrate i've learned that a lot from Kat you know

good morning happy wednesday february 17 or it's the 18th there if you're down under in australia our friends down there welcome to the elijah list right here i can't do it because everything's backwards uh we've got we're going to make a number of announcements just so you'll know kind of where what all is happening and then we're going to bring Kat in here shortly uh but be sure you sign up for the elijah list if you have not uh today we're we're um going live from facebook as always except it'll be a link that you click on it'll take you to the youtube section that way you'll see it in the youtube environment but you'll be watching it via facebook if it makes sense i may not even be saying that 100 right you'll you hear about us through facebook you'll click through from facebook but it'll bring you to youtube and watch it it's exactly the same thing um you can still comment on all those things i'm told um if i'm saying this wrong i'll correct it next time so hey i want to thank um jacqueline you know i used the middle initial m for my patriotic tie she sent this to me uh probably a few weeks back and came to our office and they mailed it to me and when it arrived the envelope was empty or if the envelope if you prefer anyways empty and they she had my accountant who had sent it had put an envelope inside the envelope and somehow it had gotten out of there and fell out so we informed uh jacqueline by mail we didn't have a phone number or email and in the meantime it showed up because that particular envelope that fell out was addressed or uh so it went back days later it showed up so here we are with the patriotic title so thank you to jacqueline and for your very nice card that you sent we're very grateful for that so here's a few announcements by the way tomorrow we have chris reed on the program prophet chris reed he's the last time he was on he had a word about the elections he may or may not have a word specifically but let me just address that if you will we were talking about this before the show we are not backing off in any way it is not over so you need to understand that we're not backing up some people if we don't cover quite enough or if we do one show that is more testimony and more stories than elections people start getting all antsy and saying i hope these guys aren't backing up to no we're not but just there are many other things God is doing as one of my engineers said that which is the best best way to say it there are many other things than than the election God's working on the elections simultaneously unlike us who cannot walk and shoot gum at the same time God can do millions and millions of things at the same time talk to millions of people at the same time and appear to them at the same time so guys working on the election and has done the in fact i believe it's a subtle thing and at the same time he's doing many he's bringing me to the lord yesterday a woman wrote after the show or during the show she might have written and said that my i i heard nathan french and when i turned to my son and said he was five years old would you like to get saved would you like to accept jesus and she he said yes he or she i don't remember and so she let her i think it was a son to the lord and so God is doing many things not only the election but he's never stopped working on this thing and as i've said i believe it's a done deal another couple of some of you may or may not have heard we lost two uh generals i would say in the body of christ but they're completely different carmen uh the singer carmen went home to be with the lord yesterday i believe it was yesterday unless it was earlier today i think it was yesterday and then rush limbaugh went home today and i say went home because he was very spiritually he was a strong believer in his later days i don't know for how many years but it's for a number of years and he's a general and as an analogy i want to say this God makes a statement very often by who he brings home at the same time so the statement he's making is that he sees rush and carmen in the same light the same kind of rewards for jobs well done and for serving him back when princess die um lost her life in that fateful accident the same day she went home to be with the lord mother teresa went home to be with the lord and a prophet at that time said she she was God showed her literally he could she could see through mother uh through princess dye's eyes as just before they lack the accident hit uh princess dye had uh turned around to see what was going in and on and she said she never saw it happen she didn't see it coming because she wasn't even looking forward she was looking back to see all these racing motorcycles and cars but God was making a statement that the same love he had for mother teresa who went home that day he had for princess die who had received christ and was a follower of christ you know mother teresa had taken the vow of poverty and here's another princess died living probably on the ragged edge of all kinds of wealth but uh as far as some of the work she did that we are rewarded for you're not safe for your works but you know uh princess die was one of her platforms that she stood up for years just to getting rid of the minds that have been buried beneath the earth all over the earth um that was killing were killing children that were playing in the dirt so uh i so that's at a point that God's making is that both rush and carmen would take taking home on the same day or receiving the same rewards or or rewards for a job well then maybe there's a better way to say it not the same rewards but um because they would be very individual rewards for the things that they did so a couple more things uh we do want to remind people about our new social media platform zap it and some of you have been once we announced that we've been getting a thousand new users a day many days not all days i guess it more accurate to say some days we get a thousand new users a day some more than that uh be sure you tell your friends about it we are very facebook friendly next time i come on we'll try to have we either have a commercial for you or we'll show you our logo which we're very proud of but zap it look if you once you get either zappa.com or go to the app store for your android or iphone smartphones and load load those apps up that way you won't have a really strong learning curve because it will feel similar it can't be the same but it will feel it looks similar as facebook so uh we are the the lord told us to start building that three years ago and so we went online about a year and but we haven't been making a splash about it because we've been fixing the little bugs along the way and getting ready for the big yet because one day someone like president donald trump is going to mention zapin and we have to be ready for that so right now we're making ourselves ready but there's many many thousands on now uh many of your friends i'm sure i'm sure already on zap and to be sure to tell them about that so last announcement is that Kat Kerr will be with us today but she's with us today this wednesday today and friday on friday we're having her again so we'll have her twice this week we have tried and we will continue to try to do her every wednesday but we're coming into the time when travel will kick back in and probably won't be able to be every single wednesday so because she'll be back on the road speaking at many places so probably will be having her speak from hotel rooms at times when she's on the road which is just fine um we'll all have to do a little bit more of that i've enjoyed this time on the not being on the road and being able to do it all from here i if there will be a few times i'll probably have to do the show on the road um but i love this setup right at my home there's my kids and my wife and all of that so let's see i think that's all i have for you today so all right without further ado let's bring kat in here and here she is hey you're all looks like you've got a new uh pink dude did you get a new did did you get your hair picked up again well actually you can tell when it gets closer to the time when it needs to be repinked i do some alternative styling so after today i actually go today to get more pink put in it oh i thought you must have just had it because it looks so pink but maybe that is that it's because we fixed the lights in the studio yeah and i can you know we see your face much better thank you for fixing that it was we just had a bit too much light on you so for that so well you know kat um we didn't get a chance to talk before the show but we usually start with things where all things related to trump and the election and i'm just going to turn that over to you and when you're all done with that we'll jump into the questions you got way more than enough questions so yes all right we actually sat together for several hours and i wanted to thank steve and doreen for having me at their home now that really happens rarely for me also to visit people who put me on the air but my hubby and i had a couple extra days we made it possible we wanted to visit with steve and doreen and thank them for all they've done for us and for one question for heaven and it was a delightful time but guess what we talked about uh heaven for hours going over all these questions that people have asked and we picked up so many it'd probably take quite a few shows but you know we love doing this don't we steve we really do we do it's really fun and we we sat in the living room for a couple hours i guess and then we went into our kitchen slash breakfast and we've got this neat little built into the wall and we all sat around there and made sandwiches and yeah yeah we were eating and snacking while we were going through our hours of we wanted to make it as exciting for everybody as possible because you know i love to see having to know but heaven but i think i love even more sharing it so we have some some new things coming up that we can talk about but first first of all i want to make it perfectly clear my choice about trump and all this stuff going on with the elections it's never changing okay i don't have just a little job where i decide to talk about trump i have a commission for my life okay here to share heaven's plans God has chosen him yes whether you believe it or not he is actually right now our president he is okay because he won and a lot of you may not like me saying that that's just too bad because guess what that's the truth and yes you're going to hear more about actually there's been a couple little clips he's been putting out there and i happen to know you are about to see a lot of action concerning all the stuff we've been talking about and we we try to hold back as much as we can until then you're all going to know anyway because we want to keep being able to talk to you you know on the on the format that we have right now we want to keep talking about things but trust me i will just say this i live in florida if you're making those to come and take me down you have to face these 154 angels who are with me i always have to give a warning you will not live in a decision like that uh the father is that when he told me they're not gonna let anybody take my life that's not a challenge to you that's a warning for your your safety so this is it i live in florida we are by four military bases never and all the years i've lived here over 50 years have i heard so much activity in the sky that one thing people what you've been hoping to see is going to be happening that means there's activity going on and i can say this again yay that trump was acquitted from the appearance yes lord once we were expecting that why because the whole thing was a fraud there was nothing they could even hold and do guess what there's nothing else they can do just so you understand once that part is over the action will begin and we we all knew that here other people i know knew that also so no he's not abandoning anybody and i want you to know he's a smart cookie God made him smart he made him bold he'd have to to put up all the mess he's had to i can just say you're about to see action the kind of action you want to see so hold on to your seat remember i said this would be a wild roller coaster ride and it has been you're also going to start hearing the actual truth about the virus so guess what this thing is happening people probably and i can't give dates on anything i just say the next few months couple months is going to have some of the greatest activity you've ever seen i'll leave it at that but i want you know i'm celebrating my family is celebrating remember there's 150 of us and everyone i talked to around this country while i have been doing some traveling by the way i'll give you a tip i am almost always home on wednesday steve i almost always make here on wednesday i try to travel through the week and the weekend but i'm always almost always here on wednesday so as long as i'm here on wednesday you'll keep seeing me i want to encourage you and all of you also in the snow thing uh i think that thing is going to be coming to an end fairly soon a lot of the weather workers have been on that crushing the ice and any destruction i do need to make a comment yay hank you nailed it there is snow and it's everywhere not in florida but it's everywhere up around the northeast across all of central america most of it i'm in contact with a lot of different people there a lot of them once the weather warriors that's the body of christ who have chosen to take authority over destructive weather we're not changing the weather patterns we're not allowing destructive weather and this is the what the the holy spirit taught me himself they did not create the weather to destroy they created to replenish and nourish the earth so there those four seasons will keep coming and uh and the bible says something about that but we're not going to allow destruction do you like destruction so stop bashing us about it start saying something with your mouth that matters and so i'm still celebrating here like i said there's a lot of activity going on in several different states on purpose wink wink uh i'll give you some time i promise you you will see in here activity even if they don't put it on the other news channels you're gonna hear it trust me it'll be all over the internet so stay excited and i do want to say one more little thing about the cake make sure you do that eat a piece about this big okay don't eat a whole cake and i want to thank God is this believe it or not this was made by a company called sweet savior s-a-v-e-u-r and they made a whole cake i got to show you this they made a whole little cake in this tin with the flag on it to celebrate this time while we're waiting for victory to come they have celebration cakes available i'm sure you can see them online and it can be refrigerated in that tin and let me tell you they're delicious red velvet don't send me a lot of cakes people okay i want to thank you for all the wonderful gifts you sent me but i'm going to have to get a warehouse pretty soon small gifts okay send something small but i want to know once you know i am praying all the time for everybody out there and i know i'm talking a lot about america but right now guess what the focus of the world and heaven is on this country God let it go into the darkness and throw it away to the devil he isn't angry at any of us those we the people we stood we prayed he loves your prayers they create an incense in the throne room so you haven't done any of that wrong just keep your faith high keep your trust and belief in God and all you bashers go get saved then you'll be happy that's [ __ ] right now yes things are going on behind the scenes and it is definitely not over it won't be soon for one side for one side who hasn't been good that side is going to see the end of what they've been getting away with so hello hello now um let me ask you one more quick question on that um i uh one gentleman wrote a few days ago and i think it was an older message because it's where hundreds behind and he said please ask Kat please ask Kat to just please tell us the date trump's coming back because we're just getting tired and weary we want to know the day tell people why you can't or won't it's usually kent in other words God's not revealing it but i'm gonna let you say it i have been given the commission okay that means jesus came in person and he gave me a commission to share what they share with me and to show and tell what they have literally shown and told me that means i've been taken to the past into the future i've seen over 100 years into the future about this country it was still here people and celebration maybe not eating cake but there was great days glory days and all this is going on i know this from the father he said for over a year great deep detailed exposure would take place guess what he knew it guess what he knows that has to happen you can't bring in a season that's so filled with with creativity brand new inventions that will make our lives better and happier and he can't bring in these moves of God like baptism and fire and carrying the glory around the world without interference he has to do something first guess what clean the platform off make sure the darkness is pushed back so we don't have to fight a lot of you are still fighting for things and i understand that but days are coming where you will walk into what God has shown you in order for that to happen all the southern mess is being dealt with if he doesn't give me a date i would be breaking my commission with him and i'm not doing that and i don't have a date i can't give you a date i'm just telling you there's a shift towards uh justice coming and you will know and see it and he promised that when all that stuff starts happening you will see and you will know it then you'll start getting really excited don't let any fear come into you that comes from the enemy the enemy can't do anything else he'll make you afraid guess what i'm not i'm not concerned about anything because i know what my God who he is i know how much he loves us he raising up america to be a light for generations why would he let the darkness take over so until he gives me a date i can't give you one that means you need to ask for greater faith trust in God find something to stay busy with and i was actually going to tell everybody out there get a blank piece of paper and on one side i want you to write down what you didn't get to do last year you had planned and over the next year i want you to write the things that you will do that you purpose to do make sure you put something in there for God and then a year from now you look back and see the things you wrote down that you desired to do or you knew you wanted to do and see how many of those things you get accomplished that is being productive okay but i'm not going to give you God has not given me because then who would be able to trust right yeah and to speak for God you say what he says that's right amen yeah amen there's yeah there has been or you know everyone everyone coming near into the prophetic i remember when paul cain walked by me the first time this is like 32 years ago he didn't know me and i didn't know him i became i got to know him years later and became my friend but i was i lived in dallas texas and i went to this big old convention he came walking by me down from the platform and because he's a prophet and a good one and he was coming my way i was confessing everything lord i have confessed to make sure because i had heard that a prophet can't see confess since and so i was sure that he would he would walk by me and know all of my sins even though i was just one in a crowd of thousands and so i was confessing forgiving the you know anyone so people everyone knew the prophetic thinks that if a prophet is in the room they know everything they only know what God has told them and so yeah go ahead go ahead once they have been with God and have been there for say 50 years and you have focused on everything he wants and you have walked in obedience you will one day begin to walk in the things remember what christ said the things i did you will do also christ himself walking is a man a righteous man knew the thoughts and intents of everybody's heart guess what when i'm in a room i know the thoughts and intents of everybody's heart even if i don't say it so i get happy when i see lots of God in there wow yeah so that's and you know that anointing is going up and that's interesting because the scripture does say the holy spirit i'll send you the comforter and he will lead you into all truth to this pastor that i had this is i wasn't my own pastor he was someone else's in san luis obispo in those years i don't know he i don't even know if he's alive anymore but it was 35 years ago and he said steve sometimes i just go to the mall not that many people go to the mall these days he said sometimes i just go to the mall to discern people and i said what he said the holy spirit came to lead us into all truth so i go and i discern people as they walk by he was just practicing his gift so that sounds legitimate right it does it does actually happen and some people sometimes want to shut it out but you know when it gives you an opportunity when you reach that stage make sure if he has said go say something if he ever says go tell this person that i said this make sure you say God just had me wants me to tell you this make sure that you don't take credit for that and make sure you know he wanted you them whoever they say if i'm in the mall every now and then it'll happen i'm going to go tell that woman that her grandson is going to be fine from the surgery something like that wow if i kept avoiding doing that when i knew he was saying and guess what my discernment would be squat that's what would happen so i have to step out and be bold enough to say so i'd go tell them that and they begin to weep and cry and laugh and shape because their grandson was actually in surgery and guess what i knew she knew because of the word God gave that he would be okay most i say 90 of prophetic is used for that very purpose and by the way in the past back in the ancient days there were no prophetic lines prophets spoke to the leaders of the nations the religious hierarchy of the day every now and then like the angel came and talked to mary and things like that every now and then that personal thing would happen because they were going to be called for something great in the earth so you're in a whole time we've been in this time for about maybe 40 years where God would let personal prophecy take place so you all are blessed because back in the day that's why the prophet stayed in the mountains okay i don't have a cave or a mountain i'm stuck right out here in the face of everybody and i can't i'm going to be there so i just want you to know it's not easy to live the life of a prophet uh they reach you or they're chasing after you because they love you or they want to know something from God and i've been able to understand and hear God from a very young age don't think four and five-year-olds can't get saved they can i did yeah i used to do these i used to do these i i used to do these uh prophetic conferences um and i you know i don't do as much we do one a year that when it's not the cover time but i prophesy i don't call myself a prophet but i prophesy at will when when i choose to i just prophesied because it works out that way um but oh what was i going to say let me lose my train of thought uh-oh uh-oh you'll get it back uh we'll go on if i think of it i'll bring it back up that's every once in a while i'm gonna i'm building it up to the point and then by the time i get there it's gone listen let's let's jump into some questions about it and i've got i think i have more than usual from kids today it's not all from kids but sometimes the kids sometimes they have to expect the adults are saying my daughter wants to know this so that they'll get asked but i don't really know because if we have childlike faith our questions should sound like children's questions frankly um so this is in this is from a little girl i don't know her age her name is danica and she's requesting that you address her by name when you answer her questions i thought that was pretty sweet all right the same name as a famous uh race car driver danica patrick was that this is a different danica but here i mean she has three questions about heaven and i'll just give them all to you if you forget i'll remind you of one is there candy in heaven that's one do they have an art room which i assume i don't know if she means in my house or an art room in heaven i'm not sure and then this does God really walk through the walls those are her three candy in heaven an art room or does God really walk through the balls yeah i will i will address the last one first he is God he can do anything he wants to when there was nothing out there he created it so if he is the creator that would be the father and the son working together they did that a lot about creating the earth and creating the the planets and all the stuff that's out there they are over time they're over physical walls spiritual walls yes he really walks through the wall just walks to the wall like he's just walking down the street or something it's not like there's some big drama thing then he appears he just comes in says what he wants to or writes something on my wall and then he goes out jesus is more the visitor kind of a person if jesus comes he'll usually sit down and talk to me about things i i i don't understand why one does one does the other uh because they like to do things together that's all i know but yes he does and i'm undone it isn't like a person coming through the wall this is the God of all creation he sent his son to die for us i am undone i feel the glory beginning to fill my room before he comes to the wall and then waves of love consuming me so it's not just like oh he walked through the wall no you know who it is and i get really uh hot from the from the love that he carries for all of us he loves you the same by the way so second question yes absolutely there are there is art all over heaven and guess what danica you can paint the sky of heaven because it's heaven and there are art places there's an art gallery there's a place called the galleria where they hold huge festivals in the streets of heaven everybody comes and sees everybody's art you get to take it back to your mansion nothing costs anything your supplies won't cost anything and all this is part of your gift if you're an artist you'll get to do this in heaven and like i say sometimes people come and paint in the throne room and the very air for our breathing is the canvas i i i can't explain any better than that except yes you're going to have art and of course there is candy chocolate is one of the best things they have in heaven gift is candy makers down here they use the same gift in heaven but it's just a whole lot better and no one's going to be hurt by sugar but it will be some of the sweetest things you ever have there you go that's really really good my wife bought me for valentine's day a box of c-scan i haven't had this in years she doesn't buy it because i she she said you got the dark chocolate with the nuts that you like i ate way too many i'm glad that she didn't and then she bought me maybe i mentioned this the other day i don't know she bought me a trump trump from the trump store it was like gold bouillon and silver bouillon maybe i mentioned it but it was chocolate inside it looked like actual gold bars it was good all right well listen okay so this one is she says the woman says um sally archelli or sally uh says my son asked me where did God come from where was he before creation and then she also said and i think he addressed this on another one not for this person my son wants to know if there are cars in heaven and technology so maybe just answer those at the same time where was God before creation and where he got what wings was and there would be something probably no one will ever do any answers in that he was the one who made everything life came from the father creation came he even time comes from him so he always was there was no one he made him he didn't disappear somewhere he has always existed and one day when you get to heaven why don't you ask him that question yourself you'll probably get the same answer and yes there are cars in heaven every kind of cars there most of them ride on air they don't need tires however there's places you can go they actually have antique car shows i actually saw elvis at one i was taken by to see sometimes i'm taking the places in heaven just so i can tell you what's there they have antique car shows none of them are rusty they're all pristine beautifully uh beautifully kept i don't think it's something from the earth i think that these are all all made in heaven just for your delight but yes they have them they have car racing nobody can get hurt racing the cars they have trails that you can ride on in the sky made out of fire and you can take motorcycles heaven has those two i call them that they're they're by hyper drive you can ride them on these fiery trails in heaven uh through the sky so there's a lot of places to take cars some go straight up the side of a mountain without a road so man i got to ask you when you say antique cars some guy goes oh man i collect 57 chevys are you saying they have 57 chevys whoa whoa that's you know they have them and um people who love to do that on the earth guess what they get to do in heaven they get to show their cars or they get to create these shows they have a lot of events all over heaven for us we have adventure excitement and fun in heaven so it's important that God provides all this and he's the one who gave that person that gift you're not going to have a job in heaven what your gift is the thing you're the most passionate about whether it's art or even styling hair yes they have those through building designing all florists i could just go on rodeos uh oh amusement parks that's all there but you have to understand there is no darkness nothing bad nothing evil nothing that represents hell they even have movies but nothing that represents hell is in any of that stuff but it's adventurous fun and exciting so that's why your family members they're not bored and sometimes jesus will go and enjoy those things with you and so that i mean i was asking the lord about his person um that personality but how person how personal he is with our life and i brought this up a couple times because it really made an impact on me that you said you saw in a mansion where somebody's favorite photo from from his camera from earth and i thought really in this perfect time which then brought me to this question that i wanted to ask if i just popped back into my head so i have a favorite photo of my wife and i were married 42 years ago if that if i want a photo of us in our wedding is that off limits because we're not married anymore so therefore i wouldn't have that photo no that doesn't count no he wouldn't look at it like that that was your life on earth okay he understands there's precious memories we make on the earth he doesn't just wipe all that away at the end of the bible i have to say this too because it takes me there when the word says at the end of revelation the former things will be remembered no more that doesn't mean that you'll forget you ever had a family that you won't know them anymore in heaven that means none of the wicked none of the evil none of the trauma the attacks the violence the hate will be remembered no more by anybody for all of eternity so it's like the devil would be wiped out of your mind all the wicked and evil stuff that went on through history for you for your family that will be remembered no more but your precious knowledge you made on the earth he does not mind these photographs or these things being on your wall and this is how they do it i laid down my gift as a photographer myself to do all of this for him the only thing i get photos of now are when the host appear and he says tells me take a picture uh so this is what he said to me if you see something you wish you could take a picture of us maybe i'm in the mountains maybe it's the fall leaves he said you just say take it and he said the angels will take that and it will be on your wall in heaven i would say i would sincerely say if you have a favorite beautiful photograph nothing bad nothing dark in it just say God i would love to have a a copy of that he will make a copy and put it in your mansion so he doesn't wipe that away that you were married that you had kids that's that part's not wiped away to me that to me kat that is a whole new revelation it's not and it wasn't that i thought God would refuse a memory but we've been we've spent so much time and and um time explaining that in heaven we're not neither married nor giving a marriage we will be friends with our former spouse but that we live in our own mansions but we've made such an important deal of that that for you to tell me and to clarify and other people are hearing that say you mean i can't have a picture of my husband and i on earth in my house to me that's going to come across as really good news to a lot of people well it's your if he has your family lying practically on that wall why would that matter if it was just you and somebody that you you know you all made those kids right uh evan they don't do that you are best friends as husband and wife you go home as the father's son and his daughter uh but he doesn't take away the memory now if it was a horrible situation that's different i'm not talking about that i'm not about happily married wonderful family that you loved uh those photos are on your wall i've already seen it in someone's mansion and they hadn't even had some of those children yet that i saw their photos on the wall wow God outside of time just blows my mind so okay um my daughter and son-in-law are having their first child in june how should i pray for this child before she is born so this is like uh the grandma of the child and how shall i pray for this child before she's born and i would like to pray a special blessing over her at her birth when i see her for the first time so she's asking about how she would do those do you do you know uh do they have a name yet maybe you don't want isn't it no the the the person asking the question is krista but no it doesn't say that okay we're just gonna say the baby it's gonna be a baby girl let's just say her name is sarah you would say sarah i declare you will not miss one moment of your destiny on this earth you would do great things for God you will have favor with God himself he purposed you he sent you we will pray over you and declare over you but we are thankful he sent you you're a blessing to this family that would be one of the most precious prayers you could say over any child being born even if maybe one was adopted you could even declare that that same prayer over them number one that they will be everything God intended them to be and they won't miss their destiny here on earth and that they will have love around them they will walk in favor and you might want to add one other thing you will be fierce against the enemy i said that over all of mine my daughters are so fierce against evil they don't tolerate anything in the enemy in their life uh not even one of my grandkids who was very young she is a force to be reckoned with against the enemy so make sure you declare that because the season we're coming into there's so many children uh being born now and have been being born for i don't know maybe a couple generations that will be very significant in these great moves of God so yes make sure you're covering them with your prayers they still have to grow up in a normal way but you can definitely just declare that supernatural part of their life and she and you would decree that thing both um before she is born and as after she's born it'd be kind of the same decree yeah some kind of things you just keep decreeing it yeah so and they they will be growing as they're growing God will open up new things to them that concern their destiny because you talked about their destiny which is what the enemy would like to steal away if you keep declaring you will not miss one day of your destiny you will fulfill everything God has given you to do on the earth that includes as they're growing that's good that's really good okay um this i like this question i didn't know what what i didn't know what the answer would be what is the difference between the way jesus looked before he came to the earth and after he went to heaven did he have flesh and blood before and does he now he does still have flesh and blood on him well he has flesh i don't know that he needs blood in his glorified bone his life was in the blood right he does look somewhat different he does look somewhat different than when he was all spirit okay and i will prove it satan didn't recognize him when he was in his flesh body on the earth he wasn't sure who he was but did he not live in heaven with him before he was cast out right so this is a clue right there that he had to change the very way his exact images look when they say he's the exact representation of the father that's talking about his power his glory his love for people um but he had to have flesh put on him that didn't just do like a little wink they actually had a big discussion in heaven before about a year before christ was born left to have to do a whole different thing on that but he knew what was going to be required of him as the word who was all God at that time and would work with the father would say i want this created and the word would step out because they can go in and out of each other and then the word would make it this is before he came to the earth he had to be willing to die for all of us to make a way back to the father and so he was a little bit different looking satan never knew who he was until he actually said that he suspected it remember on the mount of temptation when he was trying to get him to come to his side to the darkness and offer him all this junk and stuff which he's still doing satan still does that today to people but but christ resisted all of that but he did look different or he would have known immediately that's that's that's the son of God i better not mess with him had he known who he was actually he probably would have been too terrified to do anything to him but because it was in a very short amount of time from that time until he actually was crucified he didn't know who he was he didn't know that was the word who came to earth and became christ his flesh is still on him i can tell you he's a little over six foot tall in his natural body which of course that natural body is glorified he can be a hundred feet tall 2 000 feet tall it doesn't matter he can look like a lion a lamb an eagle right but he is himself when he was on the earth had mussels because he lifted big trees he was a carpenter he did a lot of physical labor uh even what happened to him on the cross he probably would have gone long before that had he not had strength in his body so he's strong looking you can see the scars when his hair kind of blows and you can see the stars where the crown of thorns was he'll show you the holes are here they're not right here this would have ripped right through the nail so this this is where the holes are on his wrist and also in the middle towards the top of his feet is where the the nail holes you can put your finger right through it in heaven so uh but he is very strong looking uh i would say uh like looks like a man's man to me real really but he's just so filled with love and he also is still fierce against remember he went into hell and whipped up the devil and all the rest him in there that was in his spiritual body but his physical body he still has the flesh he knew when he said yes father i'll do this he would forever in all time had that flesh as a testimony not for the terror or the bad things as a testimony of his willingness and his love for us that he was willing to give himself for us that's good good really really really good okay this woman um and people send me multiple questions i have to kind of pick the one that because we're a couple hundred behind pick the one that best seems the most important and it will help the most people but she's asking she said i was abused by a close relative as a child and starting then she began to on purpose or it just came over she started using profanity and she says i've tried for 30 years now to break that off and she says i try i prayed every prayer that i know how to pray and i can't stop when i get upset i start using profanity he says please would you help me know what to do to get rid of profanity that's what he doesn't want i'm sure i'm going to talk real quick first it's not really that hard it's something you have to purpose in your heart and i'm sure you have purpose that in your heart but it is in here it wouldn't be coming out of you if it wasn't in you and i'm not saying that was necessarily your fault from all the stuff that happened when those things happen to you especially young the enemy makes little deposits in you you need to lose it on purpose from your soul and i'm really serious so we're just gonna say this together with her right you have to choose with your will it's about your will you have to choose who you will to lose not just the profane words you've spoken but you have to lose the deposit of profanity that was put in you that causes that to happen if you will lose that in jesus name jesus will come down and take it out of you now if you have an urge to say that you after that after you've done that this is what you do i choose my will to bind the love and the life and the words of God to my soul guess what's deposited then he'll come up with deposits of his own words in you and then when you speak the other thing you need to take authority over is any anger since it seems anger causes that to happen and i also tell people don't watch movies that have a lot of profanity in them guess what's going to come out of you those are deposits so don't watch movies they have a lot of profanity okay because then you're putting new deposits of that in you and eventually when people get really angry sometimes it comes out so make sure you lose all the anger and lose the trauma please say i choose my will to lose all the trauma from the past all the abuse from the past i am not having it anymore i won't have that mess up my life i lose it in jesus name so it's not just one thing you have to lose all the stuff that happened to you and have no ownership to it anymore and then lose the profane words loose the deposits that were made by the happening you lose any anger you have from your soul and then you bind the love and the life the words of God his plans to you in your soul and then guess what what is in you will come out and you will notice a an amazing almost shocking change in the way you think and the way you speak wow that's good and i guess you would say that if you if you faltered and stumbled back into it or even accidentally got back in the habit you just rinse and repeat right you just keep doing i would say if it happens again say i repent for saying those words i'm not doing that anymore i lose them from my soul again in jesus name and because the enemy will try to drag you back into things like that and you say i'm not doing that and i'm not going there and you have the right to say i'm not tolerating being controlled by the enemy that's good i do need to say one more thing if it repeats several times you have to say this i serve the most high God of heaven and earth i will not serve you devil i'm done you're not controlling my life in jesus name and that one statement is one of the most powerful statements anyone on the planet can make if you can if you're continually tormented by things or stuff like that you need to say that because when you make a statement to him saying i'm not serving you i serve the most high God he will actually know that you're serious about that i know that sounds crazy but what you say matters i have just a few more minutes okay okay let me just get um let's see um this is i'm gonna ask two quick ones okay because you gotta i know you have to go did God create you know two-thirds of the angels didn't fall one-third fell does God create new angels or were they all created from the beginning and that's it i i can't say that he can't create new new ones he is God i do know that there were billions of angels everybody tries to figure out in their head how many they think that is but he did make billions of angels they're made in different angels are made in tribes and i know i have seen so many having been to heaven but not just having all the ones sent to the earth right now we probably have close to 200 billion angels on the earth right now because you'll tell me i'm sending this money for this right now with all the stuff going on around us now we have more warring angels than we ever have had before so i can't say he can't make more uh that would be entirely up to him i just know that when they're made they're going to be tested in some way we were tested in our own lives and those angels were tested at that time and then there were others tested another time when they were on the earth the watcher angels were sent down here on the earth to educate mankind some of those fell but some did not fall so i can say that's entirely up to him i i don't know the answer to that question if you make or not last one that i'll let you get going here Kat says Kat have you seen or visited your own family members and having to have passed away i don't get to visit any family members i've seen them but i'm not taken up there for me i'm not taking up to heaven i don't even ask i still don't ask to go to heaven i have a commission to be taken to heaven by father son of holy spirit showing specific places in heaven shown how heaven operates that means what life is like there um and then i'm brought back and then i'm told to share them so if he doesn't show me i don't i don't know i haven't seen everything

hi it's steve schultz here with another episode of elijah streams i'm here with Kat Kat we've done one part we did earlier today this one will air about a week later so those watching the first part will air uh well it's a friday this coming friday and the next one when you see this it'll be the next friday so watch for the friday episodes of this we've been talking about heaven you've been to heaven thousands of times and this subject i want to start with is one of our favorite epis our favorite questions issues whatever it has to do with do pets go to heaven now i just told you off the air and i wasn't planning on this but i'm just going to say because we did talk about it yeah my daughter my beautiful oldest daughter this day is having to put down wow her beautiful black lab which we love bella and the question is do pets go to heaven and the answer is absolutely yes and i need to explain that because God gave me revelation on that he said a lot of people will argue with you that why would i care why would animals go to heaven and he said they have a spirit in them and if it has a spirit if it's a if it's a creature or an animal they're going to go to heaven he said they're innocent they didn't sin against me in the garden of course the snake had to give permission we won't go into that part but God said they're innocent and he said if you go back to genesis he always takes me to the word go back to genesis where it talks about when i was telling a noah to put the animals on the ark and he said there's a scripture he's quoting scripture this scripture that says that God told noah to put every animal on the ark that had a spirit of life in them wow now then he said go back into genesis where i made adam and he said where he and the word made adam and he said adam was made his body was perfect and we all know the word made that body but the father carries the spirits of life in him we all lived inside him and he said that when adam's body was done he leaned over and breathed adam's spirit of life into the body and it said then adam became a living soul and so that was adam's spiritual little spiritual being breathed in there and he said that proves to anyone who asked that animals have a spirit in them so when your pet dies your personal guardian angel like my guardian angel took my own dog up to heaven that's how it happens and they'll be waiting on you they'll remember you and they'll be happy to see you and so that scripture God always uses scriptures when he talks to me so there's a scripture that proves that your pet has a spirit in it and so when it dies when it passes your angel is waiting to carry it on up to heaven they stay at your mansion if it's a dog they run around and greet people Kats probably never leave your mansion they're taking over it i can tell you so but yes your pets could have it regardless i saw a little boy's goldfish God had created a waterway through this whole boy's mansion of course the boy will live a full life but when he goes home to heaven he would always tell his mom i'll see my goldfish now i didn't know them and God showed me chester that was a gofish's name caught me up and i saw this waterway go through the whole mansion and end up in a big swimming pool and uh the day i ended up by meeting him and saying this he had just told his mom that day when his goldfish died his mom said no honey they just don't go anywhere and he kept saying i know God's taken my goldfish to heaven and when i get there i'll swim with him in a swimming pool now he said that to his mom we have all that recorded so don't bother telling me it's not true and so i i saw chester in a goldfish bowl and this waterway thing in this huge pool in the waterfall he'll be able to swim with the little boy when he gets to heaven so even a goldfish he cares about and so your pets will be waiting we had to put our own dog whose name was angel uh we named her that on purpose and she was there especially with my wife because i was dying for a few years yes and angel was there she was lit like an angel to dream she would begin to die of cancer after something like 11 and she's a little young to have cancer but when we finally took her in to to have her put to sleep put her down whatever term you use right after that someone wrote this and said i saw your dog in heaven running around with see if i can get this out running around playing with children yes who died of cancer absolutely they would do that you know well you had a word about the putting down of an animal yes you're actually doing them a favor i know it hurts you and i know you miss them and you know God knows that he gave his past i i believe adam had pets and uh and you may think this is crazy but angels have pets i don't know if i even told you that they do have pets and sometimes i see them in the sky with them well they were the first ones to have pets before we did so this is just a heaven thing but yes my mom was in the same situation that you were she had a little yorkie and it was just almost skin and bones but wouldn't give up it was hanging on and the holy spirit said tell your mother to let him be put to sleep he'll be in heaven well we all knew they went to heaven but it was hard for my mom it had him 14 years and she said i just can't do it i said okay jenna and i will take him so we took him to our vet and they gave him the little shot i prayed over him and everything and we stayed there until his spirit left his body and the holy spirit says run outside and take your phone and he said look over the top of the veterinarian's clinic and i looked up there and there was the spirit of this little dog because remember you look like you your spiritual body looks like you and here's this little dog he had real pointed ears and i still have the picture to this day and he was leaving going up to heaven and the holy spirit said he wants you to know he's grateful you put him to sleep so he'd stop suffering and he went to heaven where we saw him playing with other pets we had another time that i had to put my own dog down the same way and uh when when i was taken to heaven once i saw my dog playing with one of my other my brother's pat who died and they were chasing these squirrels and my dog's favorite thing to do was to chase squirrels but these squirrels were their friends in heaven oh wow and so they would take turns chasing each other up and down the stands and it made my heart so happy to know that my pet and my mom's pet was still having a good time in heaven waiting on us and do i understand that you can communicate with your pets in heaven absolutely well in the garden of eden adam actually talked to all of those animals when God said that he called them by name he didn't mean he said you're a horse you're a dog you know you're a you're a guy i always thought it was no he gave them a name and i can say this about the father the father loves to give nicknames and everyone knows when you go to heaven he has a little white stone which is a diamond and he writes a little nickname on it and gives it to you that only you and he will know he loves to give nicknames so adam gave all of these animals in the garden nicknames and it said he called them by name why would they say that he called them by name because they answered him and if they couldn't talk then eve would have been freaked out by the snake who could talk so in that day but when they were thrown out of the garden when they asked to leave the garden God took away the ability of all the animals to talk because he didn't want them cursing him like man did and later on kept doing it we also know the donkey talked and he didn't just put a voice in him he had the ability to talk God had just stopped that so in heaven all your pets will speak to you well you know and i asked you about this maybe it was yesterday when we were talking but we've had a lot of pets over the years and one time we had four dogs and four cats we had two two miniature donkeys and a horse and probably some things i'm forgetting when we first moved out in the place that you have a lot of pets waiting on you up there you know but most of them belong to my girls but uh and son but but my wife and i even we've had many many pets does that mean our mansion is like a little zoo yeah well it is so huge you have a lot of property with your mansion and if they also belong to your daughters they'll be visiting them at theirs too so if you all grow up together as a family and have a pet in common that pet will take turns visiting you in heaven and yes and they play and they actually have other ones that they meet and make friends with in heaven when i when i was very very sick so this had to be around 2007 or eight and i was i would lay on the couch day after day i was wasting weight under 100 pounds people they hadn't figured out what was wrong with me at that time it was a sinus thing but and many surgeries later here i am but yes my daughter had was had moved to california and and her cat was with us his name was ebony yes and he was dying and i was laying on the couch dying basically and he was laying there on the floor dying and i said a rug little thing there tell them and i would speak to him and i said to him and i said someday all right together in this heaven you're right sorry i had no idea i was going to go there but so you actually will be talking to them yeah i felt it was a true thing i felt like i would one day talk to this boy cat ebony and we were talking about what we went through together that's right and it was meaningful yes and i was you know when he finally passed the house i um drain had to take care of it i was too weak to do anything but i knew i had done my part you know because you know God loves you that probably also gave him comfort and you're absolutely right and i'll prove in the word if he knows when one sparrow falls to the ground and guess what he does care he does care he also now he doesn't love the creatures more than he loves us but they're also his creation and he does care he doesn't like it when animals are abused of course he doesn't like it when people or children are abused he despises evil however he cares about them why wouldn't he allow them to go to heaven if you love them especially and they're a part of your life you know and they have a spirit right and he told me a long time ago he said i had a decision to make when i created life meaning man and creatures i could even admit i could make them where they would disappear and never exist again ever or i could make a decision that they would remain eternally you know and he said and i made the decision they would remain eternally he said so if i did that and they would remain eternally and i didn't allow them to go to heaven where would they be he said yes they're going to be in heaven even ones that you knew not maybe your own pet but other people's perhaps you'll recognize them when you get to heaven i've been in my father's ranch and i've seen every pet we've had in your family yes i've seen my father's ranch no i don't go there and visit him but i saw his ranch and walking behind him was his 1100 pound this bothers some people he's a 1100 pound pig named sally that he had from a little pig when he retired from ministering and i saw writing on her two of the little mice we had in new york city as our past and there was charlie the alligator there was iggy iguana i recognized each one of these pets it wasn't like they were just someone similar they were the same ones we had and they went like forever oh my God because he had a hack he was up there they were all gathering on his ranch to be there together let's talk then while we're talking about the little ones let's talk about the children because i heard you more than once say every child who dies is with the lord is that right that's absolutely true every single one of them whether they were miscarried whether they were aborted all babies and children they all go to heaven and God has them all so if you miscarried a baby when you get to heaven one day it will be given right back to you the very same one that you lost and and couldn't raise on your own most of them stay very little and you actually get to finish raising that baby in heaven and and the same thing with children if they were really young here's a good example um i met someone whose son had died when he was seven and later on 20 years later his mother dies and goes to heaven and here's her little boy still seven playing in the streets of gold and his mom is so undone of course he recognizes her i mean she was probably the same age when he left hi mom what are you doing here and she goes i i'm i'm here but you were here and he goes of course i'm here and she goes what have you been doing he goes i've been playing with my friends all this time and he was actually playing with his friends and he goes but but you know what you can't stay mom you have to go back you're not done with your life and she said and so she grabbed him and hugged him before she left and he brought back down came out of the surgery perfectly fine she was healed and for years her and her husband would go around the world and that's what they talked about that your children are in God's hands they're having a good time in heaven and so there's many other people with that same kind of a testimony so your children will know you in heaven they're talking about you in heaven they can't wait to see you i will say this about the ones that were aborted every aborted baby goes to see jesus first he heals any hurts any memories of what exp they experienced in that situation they forgive the people who do it these little babies even though there's some are very small tiny different sizes their spiritual body is perfectly formed completely formed they laugh they play they have some understanding of who their parents are and they all the time pray that their parents will make it to heaven if you so if you had a woman let's say she had an abortion she thought it was okay to do that now she lives to be 70 80 years old and she receives the lord yes and she goes to be this is going to be one of those shows she goes to be with the father within him and she gets to now raise this child aborted absolutely yes that's incredible that that puts a new uh a new picture of grace the grace and love of God it is the grace of God and so many people are healed now when they find that out some have had multiple abortions they thought they weren't doing anything wrong because that's normally what they're told you know it's not really anything but that's not true at the at the time of a conception life begins when that happens God sends one of the little spirits from himself that would be that baby's little spirit and and knits it together in the mother's womb and there's that little dot of flesh that formed he knits that little baby's spiritual body to that and that's when life begins and from that time on they continue to grow inside the womb of the mother and by the way if you play beautiful christian music that baby hears it in the womb if you talk to the baby they hear also they'll recognize your voice already when it's born but for whatever reason some are forced to have abortions and i do know people that happen to them but this little baby when it gets up to heaven the aborted babies jesus greets them he loves on them they have a special they laugh and play they ride in the kangaroos pockets around go rides they ride on birds and they're all declaring all the time i can't wait to meet my parents you know they want them very much to come to heaven and i encourage people even if you had an abortion name your baby give it a name that could be a boy or a girl name and when you do that now the angels give them a nickname in these beautiful nurseries it doesn't look like a clinic it's very beautiful some outside some of the parts are in the inside building inside they will call the baby to the father and he'll say your parent just named you wow wow instead of the nickname they put in the nursery on the little wall uh God will say this is now your name your parent just named you and have a huge celebration for the babies we learned that from you before we knew you it was a year before we went on a cruise just my wife and myself yes so it had to be eight nine years ago something like that and the book and and and God said bring every book on heaven which i had never read the books on avenue one years and years ago so i had a stack like this but there were more from you but there's 90 minutes in heaven and heaven is for real and i brought them all but i came to that part and i brought tears i'm not going to do that again if i can help but i i said listen to this dream and i read her the part where you can name your baby and they would give it and that and the baby would be in heaven and so we we named it i can't remember if we named it at that moment but we both sat there and balder yes because we realized that was true and we understood so now we don't have three children yeah we have four children four children we just didn't know that's right and is this possibly true and i have not asked you this before but some women have you know inadvertent of miscarriages that they never even know about are those children of theirs in heaven as well if that conception took place and that baby began to grow and maybe they lasted a few weeks yeah they're still a baby yeah once that spiritual little body is knit together to that little dot of flesh then that is when life begins yes i know people had like five or six ones that didn't go all the way through they maybe lasted a few weeks or a few months every one of those was a baby yeah and okay and one last question about that so if you're a little baby whether you were whether you lost your life in india pakistan any muslim country the middle east china india you're still going to have you're still going to heaven absolutely he sent them from himself he actually timed your birth on the earth because he wanted you here at that time and no matter what your gift was whether it was singing or a florist or a designer a builder a baker that gift you keep when even the little babies when they go up to heaven they'll still have that desire to do those they'll grow very slowly once you get there and eventually they'll come to what he calls the timeless age it looks like 20 25 they will step into their own destiny in heaven and become that whatever that gift was he gave them so no real no baby ever really loses their true destiny which is what God sent they actually begin to operate in their destiny they begin to operate in the world and they pray for the parents they're always praying for the parents the whole time i wanted to talk about this is this gets asked a lot so let's talk about there's a lot of people who have had suicides of their family and they're convinced many are convinced that because of the suicide uh the person took their own life that they will not be in heaven or they're there and grieve talk about that issue the father was very adamant and so was christ that people know the truth about that and by the way they don't like it if somebody especially was a believer and people are telling them that their loved one is in hell when if they belong to God there's no way that's going to happen so the father on purpose told me about these three different people's lives and took me to heaven and showed me them each in heaven the first one was somebody who was known i won't say who that was but it was one of their children and they had been in an accident and they had taken medication that totally altered their mind their emotions they had no control over their mind or anything they finally ended their suffering and this is how the father said he said look in the dictionary and see what it says about suicide and i he actually had me look in a dictionary not in heaven when i was on the earth and this is what it says to commit suicide you are willingly knowingly intelligently ending your own life on purpose knowing that's what will happen he said like a suicide bomber like a terrorist who comes in to kill knowing they're going to die or you do it because you hate someone so much you want to cause them suffering you know what you're doing in other words most people who end their life that is not suicide not according to the dictionary what they're doing is they're having so much trauma suffering mental suffering emotional suffering or physical pain that they cannot stand it they want to end the suffering so when they do it for that purpose that's not suicide and God does not count it as suicide and this person who i saw in heaven was a young person and that has what had happened the medication altered their whole thinking they were in suffering and agony all the time they prayed for them all the time but he couldn't take it anymore so he ended his suffering and God said i will show you and he took me to heaven and showed me him in his father's mansion it was being built his father was still alive on the earth and he was living there in his father's mansion and i saw a trophy on the mantle that said the name of that person it said satan zero and the name of the parent of this child it said one in other words God had kept him and saved him because he belonged him number one but what the suffering he went through he couldn't handle and then he did that two other times with other people one was a young woman who had been so abused her whole life she couldn't handle or take it anymore and so she ended her suffering she wanted to be with jesus but she she couldn't handle it so that's not called suicide okay and uh so another time it happened so all three of these people who had ended their suffering one was a young boy who had also been so tortured and abused he had just been adopted by a christian family they prayed but he had these nightmares all the time of the suffering and so he ended his suffering that young boy is in heaven playing football right now i had no idea he liked football watched football always wanted to do it he actually is in heaven playing football and so these things that were their passion they still get to do that in heaven but i got to share it with each of the parents and it changed their whole life because people were saying it's too bad your child is in hell you know when you're a believer and it's wrong to do that okay God doesn't like that the world this is it the secular world said our heart is with you our compassion is with you but a lot of the christians had to prove their point because it says in the bible about suicide but suicide is when you know what you're doing and you don't care almost all suicide bombers we know where they went they did it on purpose to hurt knowing intelligently willingly taking their life for that purpose so most things are not suicide when i grew up 50 60s 70s i was taught i was trained in a fairly fundamental fundamentalist type of thing and the God that i was shown nobody meant harm by it they were trying to show me who they believed God to be was that God who had a set of rules and he was they would never reward it this way but the upshot of it was he was just waiting for them to mess up so that he didn't have to take him to heaven that was the way they would never say that they would just say you know if you let me keep my commandments but what they meant was even if you did one last thing and didn't repent and now i've come to the point where i'm the God that i'm seeing is still the God of the bible yes but he's if he's looking for loopholes he's looking for loopholes to save to save you not to not to cause you that's right but that does i do i've been asked this question several times i don't think i've ever asked it of you i keep being asked this by people that right they say ask Kat what does it mean as wide as the way that leads to destruction and narrows the way that leads to life and few there be that find it how do you how do you respond to that back in the days and you have to understand a lot of the scriptures that are in the word other than the salvation one and a couple others most of them are tied to the culture of that day okay like in leviticus leviticus a lot of the things that are in there were tied to the culture of the day when people were cutting parts of their body off and putting on altars to have been burned before demonic idols they actually did that they also marked themselves with the marks of the dead because they were so controlled by satan and in leviticus this is another thing but it's going to join together that scripture actually says do not mark yourselves with the marks of the dead it doesn't say don't mark yourself so don't say don't get a tattoo no it does not say although although the new translations say don't get a tattoo that is not what the original scripture said because that scripture was tied to the day in leviticus leviticus the culture of that day so many people were doing it that's why they put in there don't cut yourself don't let yourself be passed through the fire people think you can't be cremated either but yes you can God can put the ashes back together but in that day that's what they were doing and they were putting demonic marks on them and so they felt like they had to make that part of the law so you didn't do those things that were evil this is not that day i'm not giving everybody an excuse to get a tattoo but i happen to know people personally that God said you will put my mark on you and so you can't use that to beat people up okay you can't use that you can't use a thing like you're getting a lot of people won't get cremated they think that God can't put the ashes back together and i say what about if you were burned up in the fire does that mean you're not going to get your body back so again those scriptures will tie to that this about finding christ when there was not hardly anyone out there speaking on his behalf now we have the internet now we have churches everywhere so that scripture where it says the the white is the way to hell and narrow is the path to God and you know blessings there's a lot wider path now i see that it means you can be led to christ and this day especially with all the stuff that like i just explained is out there back in that day when that scripture was made there was almost nobody out there and so these are different days so sometimes you have to adapt what that says to now so in the scripture in right now in the scriptures it would say the path has gotten much wider to find christ which is a blessing for all those who live today compared to those who in the past did not so i would have to say i've seen hell i've seen who was in there and when i was in heaven there were more people in heaven than there were in hell really yes and that will actually increase because of the revivals the moves of God because of the great harvest coming uh because of the presence of God himself and also the people with all doing all the things stepping into what God has for them it will be really more clear now that there is a God and he loves him than there ever was in the past day in the past you told me a couple of names i think i remember them but i'm not going to say in case in case i have them remember but can you name a couple of people who would be considered almost celebrities who people would wonder if they went to heaven that you've seen in heaven i have seen so many people in heaven i've seen people from the past well i've seen the disciples and the prophets just so you know adam and eve made it i absolutely saw adam and eve i saw um uh enoch which is got like emerald eyes you hear him everybody has a frequency in heaven you hear him coming before he shows up so heaven is amazing but i can tell you that i've seen john wayne i saw john wayne in heaven and then later on i heard the testimony from his own daughter she was present when he got born again he was in a hospital bed dying really and i think it was the crystal cathedral which a lot of people even bash them they don't like the way they gave their services don't bash people who released jesus christ and lead you into sinner's prayer he came on and he watched him his daughter said regularly but in that day he said if you want to receive jesus christ as your savior get down on your knees and john wayne could hardly move at that time she said he dragged himself across the bed he lowered himself to his knees and he received jesus christ she was a witness and she gave that testimony later in her church and i didn't even see that testimony i just saw john wayne he was in heaven i've seen michael jackson and i'm probably going to get bash for that it doesn't hurt me or bother me because i saw him and he was worshiping jesus christ and whether you know it or not anyone out there i can tell you he was pursuing christ in those last days he was going to do his final tour now i didn't follow him or anything like that this is just things that jesus showed me he was he was following he was preparing for his final tour and he was his mind was always stressed he was always in fear about things and people will try to calm him down and at the end maybe a week or so before he passed he started telling people i heard jesus i heard the God of heaven and earth i heard him calling me wow and some of his friends thought he was nuts so they did an investigation after he died after he passed they did an investigation they called in eight different people or eight or nine people who were going to be on the tour separately and they asked him did michael say anything different than he had before was anything going on was he getting threats from anybody and every one of them without the others even knowing said the same thing he said he heard God speaking to him and he heard God calling him and he had to answer him and so they never told anyone else because they thought he was nuts and so it turns out all these witnesses who said they heard michael said that he heard God calling him and he heard christ calling him he answered him wow so whether anybody was present when he did that that doesn't matter he testified to all of them and he probably would have made some changes on the tour and i think probably i don't i can't say this uh um officially but i'm sure that his life was ended not by him because that would have drastically changed the whole thing about his tour and even his life michael would have told people had to remain don't listen to some of the stuff i produced before don't listen to that stuff when i wasn't living for christ because i know in heaven they all say that i would have changed stuff i would have not done certain things all i know is this the point is this he's in heaven he received jesus christ have you did you mention robin williams before yes robin williams i saw robin williams in heaven also and i know a lot of people think that he did certain things robin williams this is the thing about comedians if nobody knows this they get hit so hard by satan satan hates laughter he doesn't want anyone to laugh he doesn't like comedians at all because they let people laugh laughter is in medicine and so and i know several other comedians actually suffer from great oppression and he did he go into rehab all the time robin williams did to get help for this oppression the last place he went to was a christian retreat he gave his own testimony in an interview that's been recorded and he started telling people we all need God i got more help at this place than i ever have before you need to let jesus in your life he can change everything for you and and he didn't of course get rid of all the oppression but his testimony that is proof right there that he knew jesus christ and i did see him in heaven and i saw all kinds of people i've talked about whitney houston before i saw whitney houston in heaven and i was sitting on the front row of a church waiting to speak and i kind of wasn't even really aware she had died and so i was caught up to heaven sitting on the front row my body was there and i saw her standing before the throne of God and she was beautiful she was young she was so overwhelmed with the joy and the father was thinking here for guess what using her gift because your most important thing you can do is use the gift he put in you her gift was singing and i know she maybe didn't believe at that time in the religion that necessarily said all this about jesus christ but i do know this much about her this is what jesus said she's saying her own salvation he said on the last night of her life like i wasn't connected to her life on the last night of her life she was with friends out somewhere and they kept asking her sing a song sing a song and she was really greatly repo you know depressed she wasn't feeling well they kept asking so finally she said i will sing one song and she gets up there at the mic and she sings yes jesus loves me and jesus said in that song she gave herself and her heart's cry gave herself back to me so i took her to heaven and the father was giving her a reward for singing and he had this beautiful chest that he took from his throne and said whitney this is yours because you were willing to use your voice to sing i'm giving you one of my own songs that you can wear and when you opened this chest this beautiful garment like fabric came out and wound itself around her became this beautiful red dress it was so gorgeous and as she wore it and she moved you could sing the father singing off of her dress is that what you call a God of breath oh man he gave her a garment of praise and it was his own song that had never been sung and he saves them for rewards for people who use that voice she was so undone so filled with the life of God standing up there and then when i saw her every time she moved her hand or moved you'd hear him singing off of that gown and then after that i was caught back down and i was sitting on the front row so this happened just like that yeah and i got up and talked about it at the meeting i just i think there's your stories you're telling and you've said people have gotten saved hearing these stories i i just think one of the things the stories communicate you know it's in the word but until you hear it in modern speech sometimes you don't grasp the the level of the love of christ and the love of the father and the love of the spirit for his creation the love he has is so un he desires that none should perish and he desires even the vilest sinner be set free so i know people think it's not fair but that's the blood of christ and what he's showing in that is no matter what your life was like and let me tell you a lot of these people who are vile and hateful it doesn't give an excuse they are probably abused themselves and when you're abused usually as a child that shows up later because it goes in your soul and that's what we everybody knows what you put in there is what you will become and many people even though it's not an excuse that's probably why they were like that but if they receive christ they're going to sins forgiven like they never did it each one of us you know he doesn't have to do that but because of his love for us and his son sacrificed for us that is the way it works in heaven and there'll be people there you never expected to be there i've also been to hell i've seen people who went to hell someone who totally absolutely despised and hated God would never come back to him i did see hitler and i tell people all the time i saw hitler the first time i was taken there and he was hanging on a meat hook in hell and i want to say this you can be as wicked and evil as you want to thinking satan will reward you he rewards no one he hates everyone and those who serve satan the most will be the most tortured in hell when they get there there's no reward in hell it's so worth it to give yourself to jesus christ yeah i've heard you say before that some people that were led to the lord by someone else that in heaven from heaven or when that person who led them to the lord or influenced them to the lord goes to heaven that they're there they remember with gratitude yes how they got there is that yes they did people who were won by certain people on the earth whether it was at a crusade or just one on one on the street if they won if they're the ones who won your jesus you never forget that person and they will so grab you and hug you when you get to heaven thank you for believing in me thank you for taking the time to win me to jesus christ i wouldn't be here if you hadn't done that and they thank you adamantly also this the same thing goes like as we said before that maybe you had and maybe you were angry at somebody maybe you had a fight this is a good one happens a lot people ask me this if they had a really bad fight and they separated and were angry and these were friends and then the person died this person can spend 20 years suffering from guilt that person in heaven is not thinking about that happening they're up there wanting to bless you wanting to let you know they'll love their feeling they have forgiven everything even if you never get to hear them say that they're forgiving you don't live your life being messed up because you were angry with them i'm telling you the minute they stepped out of that body filled with the life and the love of God they forgave that so people always ask me will they know if i say i'm sorry if they fought i said you can say it to them and they'll hear it but the first thing they'll do when you get to heaven and say i didn't even think about it you know that's interesting that you say because you said you say it and they'll hear it because we're not taught that but to declare and decree a thing you know God can get the message to him or whatever um oh there was there are places in heaven though where people can go and watch your life and declare over your family members they're called portals i've been there several times it's just beautiful open big place inside of this building and there's stairways going up and a balcony around and your family member looks down if they're living in heaven they look down they see you as close as the ceiling and every year on your birthday they go there and sing happy birthday you're saying to them they're right there they're right here yeah looking at you because there's no time or space now heaven is way up away from here but when they look down and they want to declare over you sometimes they'll pray over you they'll declare if it's a family member who's not born again they will always declare i declare my family member will become born again they will not miss their destiny they'll become the living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ so if your grandmother's up there and you're not born again you might as well give it up if your mom's out there praying declaring with him you better really give it up because jesus is going to get you that is so good you know jesus there's i don't have this you know perfectly memorized but jesus was talking to the people and he said you've reaped where other people have sown that's right and he said what what you did not sow they sowed and he's talking about other people that shared the lord and he called that the heart he said they did the hard labor they did our perspective who don't consider themselves evangelists in any way may have had more to do with a person be receiving christ and the person that's waiting to thank them yes is in heaven they're not necessarily willing to thank the guy that got the notch in his belt maybe they will they will thank everybody but they remember the ones who planted the seas maybe every year for years you did you did acts of kindness you encouraged them that christ cares about them you know he wants you and maybe you never saw the fruit of that but the seeds are the most important thing the seeds that are planted and the other one who actually may be led in the prayer they were drawn by the holy spirit so holy spirit gets involved when you're willing to plant things into people holy spirit will begin to draw them and draw them and draw them till they get to that point where they're willing or want to receive christ and so this is the easy part you're right all this planting over these years sometimes it takes it is the hard work because you're seeing the opposite i don't want him don't tell me about that and they show no evidence but it goes in their soul and remains in that soul and the holy spirit can draw them from that until finally they receive christ though that thank you they give that person who did all of this will probably get more than the one who actually led them but they remember them and having so good well we only have a few minutes more and i wanted to give you a minute or two to talk about what were the environments yeah the current situation in the government and eating cake or whatever you want to see yes talk about that for a minute i will adamantly um the father is still saying the same thing to me that he said all along even back in 2015 when he said i have chosen trump and i've chosen him for two terms he will be president for two terms he didn't mean one term then four years go by then another term he meant two continual terms i will put him there he will make a great difference in america and everyone who knows him knows the four years and what a difference it made in our country to bring us back to God because he actually invited God and i will also add all this into that those who won one those who lost lost so those who were there now lost and stole it so our true president right now is still trump according to God he won 80 million people voted him in they voted for life for hope for justice for liberty and freedom and that's what we're going to get what is there now will not remain and the father on november the 4th remember on your show when God said we were going to do it through the third and God said i want the fourth he actually said that so i ask you and on the fourth the father said when the ground begins to shake the physical ground the spiritual ground the landslide of fraud will begin to be exposed it won't just happen it will begin to be exposed and he said the fall will be great from the smallest to the highest level will be great justice will be served and then i will put trump back in the white house because even that first thing in the morning when a lot of the stuff was going on he was already saying it God was saying it on the fourth after the third when they shut down everything he knew what they were doing everyone knows now what they were doing and so it's not been hidden God is adamant a lot of people began to say that because when it didn't happen on their dates God doesn't always choose man's dates but it didn't happen on the third when it didn't happen when the when the when the vote was taken later on you know when they voted in georgia and then when the whole thing where the electoral thing was done and it didn't happen then then here comes the knowledge it didn't happen they were like nope not going to happen not going to happen i have news for you God never changed what he said the fraud will be exposed justice will be served and i will put him right back where i want him for another four years and there's things going on behind the scenes you don't know uh both on earth and in heaven and we will end up with a great celebration God took me forward in time three times now i saw the same celebration people running out in the street grabbing everybody shouting with victory with joy we've been set free we have our country back so guess what's going to happen what God says is going to happen so stay encouraged make sure you keep declaring justice and victory cake and celebrate that's good well ken thanks so much uh people can go to revealingheaven.com to get your stuff yeah um if we we or may not be able to get it on youtube but we'll try but revealing him and there's a place they can give to you there yes there is yeah thank

well happy wednesday to everybody it's february 24 11 15 am sorry we're a little bit late that happens sometimes uh so i'll see it's a february 24 hours february february 25 if you're down under so good to see you all we have a great uh broadcast today and i've done some important announcements some of these are going to really like but i had promised you all i was going to introduce you to the engineering staff that does this program so without further ado let's bring you all on and the engineering staff is bringing on the engineering staff so i guess do we have everyone here it's good let me just uh introduce everyone to you at the top left is warren these warren schultz that's my older brother by two years he's got a little bit more hair than i do but other than i'm sure we would look exactly alike you know so warren's uh editor and engineer uh on this program in the middle top is michael wilhelm uh michael's kind of like everybody's boss except he doesn't boss me around except down below him dennis wilhelm is his boss so his dad is his body he goes he goes dennis michael steve then warren okay just giving you a hard time okay and uh so really michael is really in charge of a great all things technical and um that includes zapping and breaking christian news and elijah list all of that so we really need him top right is jeff tharp jeff good to see you jeff or uh see he can tell he's he's more on the microphone than other people but he will be we're setting up a new thing where in the mornings he will come on a few minutes before and give you guys an alert that the broadcast about starts some of you are missing the facebook alert so he's going to come on and say we've got a few minutes and we'll be live with and he'll name the guest so that'll help some of you who are not getting that like i said bottom middle is dennis dennis has been with me for what 17 years yes 17 years i actually remembered this time dennis and his dentist is what dennis's wife has always worked from home and actually everyone's working from home now and dennis has run the entire operation for all of these uh 17 years out of the i think we've been in town about 21 or something like that i don't know but dennis and his wife especially ran things i literally was dying in about 9 10 11 you know 29 209 2011 2012 right in there i just was literally dying wasting away they couldn't figure out what's wrong dennis and his wife rand and michael and julie ran ran the operation julie has um julie to your left bottom is both the the primary editor for the elijah list and she's the producer for this program so let me just tell you this warren is in bend oregon that's about three to four hours drive michael's in albany oregon uh jeff is in salem right yeah he's in salem and uh dennis is in albany and i'm someplace close to salem which i don't that's everybody uh that's everybody that's on the show as we're doing the show these are all on the show and then when when the show is going they're troubleshooting as you know youtube and facebook and people can be putting some pretty nasty remarks this is the team that's that's monitoring it and cutting people off as fast as they can if they say something that's that's mean-spirited not if they disagree but if they're mean-spirited they'll cut them off and ban them so that keeps the list clean keeps the youtubes and facebook clean for us so that's that's why so when you're donating this is just a small part of the group i think there's probably almost 20 of us all together um but it goes to these are all full-time positions so it's a little more complex than it looks like when i'm sitting here at home doing my things all right everybody thank you everybody everybody very much thanks for your hard work and here they go one at a time okay that's a team uh that's on on the show as we do it um i just want a couple there's a couple announcements first of all there's a rumor going around we just heard about it there's apparently either a guy named steve schultz has the same name as i as me who they say is claiming that kim is a false prophet kim is not a false prophet kim was my good close friend a very dear friend back in the day we even helped promote him one time his assistant when he lived out in texas for a while said you i went out there to shoot a program and she said you'll have you have no idea what you've done for kim and i said i guess i don't what have i done for kim and basically she was saying that the elijah list at that time we didn't have the we were doing some video but it was just kind of like extra we didn't have a show yet and she kind of credited us with um kind of launching his ministry in public forum so he's he was a dear friend of mine i love him very much i cried crocodile tears when he went home with lord not i'm sure he's happy but i feel the loss it i really felt it strongly for a lot of years so there was another steve schultz who was in the prophetic years ago i've lost track of him i don't know if he said anything about kim or if this is somebody just claiming that i said something about kim with kim's kim's a person of great to be hiding esteem so i wanted to tell you all that um yesterday i got word through a third party and they they acknowledge this party who's in dc who are they saying there's a sudden shift in dc they could feel an open heaven and open heaven is good because that's when God can begin to really move and do his stuff and then this morning a good friend a prophetic intercessor friend out of um either the windy city i always forget which one she's in uh or or st louis she said wow open heaven open heaven open heaven so it's not just in dc prophets are beginning to feel the open heaven so this is a really good thing we're putting on uh it's either there right now or will it be there shortly on facebook robin bullock had a word about nine he said the lord said if i only could get nine prophets to take their staff and bang the ground hit the ground and call trump back into office and when he did that as soon as he did that i paused it because it was on the replay i ran and got my staff went out in the uh room where i was watching and i banged the ground with him and later of course he had already done it because it was a recording and i texted robin and uh because he said there need to be nine prophets that would do that and and i said i just did it with you on on the replay he said we only need seven more well i guarantee you there's gonna be a whole lot more than nine because any most intercessors are really prophets who pray that was a phrase i got by jennifer evans a few years ago and i thought you know that makes sense because most intercessors are seeing prophetically or they wouldn't even want to pray they see what they're praying so if you get watch that tape watch that's not tape watch that video and get your stat of a broomstick if you have to uh bang the table with the spoon if that's all you got and and prophesy that the return of trump and uh that may well be one of the reasons there's a sudden open heaven in dc and and over the nation so uh let's see what else do i want to tell you robin when we got to talking we agreed yesterday to start a new weekly program uh it's on in this hour but starting march 8th robin will be doing a regular program every monday it's i won't tell you the name of it that'll be a surprise you'll like it it's something that no one else is doing or has ever done that we know and you're going to like it a lot it will of course be doing some of the same stuff on those programs but then there's a twist to it that i think you're going to really like so that and then last but not least timothy dixon or tim dixon the truck driver is going to be on with a special program this afternoon so two o'clock pacific time which is five eastern many of you have written to us saying can you get timothy dixon on the truck driver and uh he's quite the prophet he's God just breathed on it said in favor on the lord most of his prophecies come from his truck and you can hear the engine running because the truckers tend to leave their engines on um that's the way that that's the way truckers do it so you'll hear the the the oh i can't think of the name the diesel engine's running so hey steve that show is actually tomorrow at two it's tomorrow oh okay are we taping it or is it tomorrow it's gonna be live tomorrow at two o'clock oh my apologies everybody i my information was wrong thank you see that's why we need the team behind us think how much better it is when somebody's auditing this and can pop on and tell us when we blew it so apologies everybody well i have this afternoon off after all um okay i think that's about it so without further ado let's bring our friend kat kuran here there she is hey Kat how are you i'm doing fine you just did you said nine nine lumping fine how many so how many services did you do i've done uh nine meetings and probably the last like week and a half wow you i would i would be tired wow well are you holding up okay i'm doing great i actually was one of those prophets out in the middle of the road just the other night doing the very thing that robin said okay wow that's three we only need six more and i guarantee it's already been more than that it probably has even in the little bit of time you've spoken i'm sure they've all done you know someone gave me that staff and when he had his staff on it was the one i think somebody gave him and i looked at it i thought that looks identical to mine it had the leather strap it had a leather tag on it my someone gave it to me is called the ezekiel stick or something like that yeah whoever gave it to me if you're watching this thank you because i used it yeah probably for the first time doing that so any right way to get it so well Kat before we get into questions of heaven why don't let me just throw the floor open to you and tell us anything you want to say about current events i do know there's a lot of activity that's going to be starting like in the natural i'm talking about in the natural and one thing we're going to do before we're all done we are going to declare over our military very specific reasons they're going to need it okay so we have to declare over the military that God will sharpen their skills give them supernatural discernment and of course the hosts are already with them and i've been declaring probably over the last month uh commanding the heavens to open over dc and the host to pour in and i do know that a lot of the demonic has actually run out of dc left and i knew that would cause something to begin to happen number one the ones hiding behind the barbed wire are getting very terrified they've tried everything they can you know to get rid of trump has not worked and i think they've been successful in making him mad i will smile about that me too i'm smiling too and there are plans if we've been saying his plan set in place they have their own time to happen but i do know that those things are about to happen and i think probably uh let's see close to a month from now things are going to be different i can't say what those things are but they will be different but the heavens have definitely opened over dc and over areas of texas and over areas of florida all offer the same purpose and like i said i do know that the demons have been running from dc as fast as they can because they know that their mission there has already failed their mission has actually failed in america because they have not gotten what they wanted i'm talking about the physical and these in the spiritual have not gotten what they wanted out of americans because americans are not a third world country i pray for third world countries all the time i'm not speaking against them i'm just saying third world countries are controlled usually by satan and by the leaders there but that's not who we are we are americans this is the land of the free the brave and justice and that's not going to change because you know what they didn't count on they couldn't get out of the heart of the people they figured if they could move their hand and control everything from there it would happen but it didn't happen okay it did not happen uh the heart of the people hasn't changed freedom is still in our hearts they can't take that out it's like you can't take something out the heart of a person or out of their soul uh even though you think you can you can't do it and the normal way of satan doing all this is if he can get the mind of the people and get the mind of the majority of the people controlled and defeated and crushed down that's when satan will usually move in and be successful but he hasn't been able to do that he's actually afraid hell is trembling demons are leaving dc like crazy like in waves and the hosts are are are flying in there so they're surrounded already they can't see that they're surrounded but they're totally surrounded by the host of heaven who would be there to do what they need to do when that special event happens and this is probably one of the most powerful things he's had me say so far i do know what's going on on the other side of righteousness and freedom i can't talk about those things but i can let you know what's going on in the spirit realm and what happens in the spirit realm impacts this natural world so yes i am very excited i expect i expect that celebration uh to not drag out and people will already begin to know when things are happening that that part can't be hidden so don't worry everybody you'll know when those things actually start to happen don't let any fear come into you because this is not the day of wrath against us is a day of wrath against the devil and against those who serve him so the only ones that should be afraid the ones behind the barbed wire and anyone connect to them worldwide is about to be shaken yeah for those that don't know behind them but when you say behind the barbed wire a lot of people do not show this on the media but the but the military that surrounded uh the reflecting pool and the capital and the white house the military is still there is that not right it is and people may not may not know this and this is probably is known in many places but the president well of course he is our president still but even at the time of uh an inauguration you know even at the time of an inauguration there's months after that that the president that was standing has absolute total control of the military maybe people didn't know that but they do so although the real president who won still is actually literally in that seat and those who stole it aren't going to be able to keep it they meant not doing a very good job at all because they're not number one organized they have no foundation usually the people who are over this country have a foundation of hope and greatness for the land that they are guess what serving not controlling and so that foundation of hope for everybody is there but when the devil comes in there is no foundation that's why so many of his attempts fail or they last for a period of time than the end but i can tell you right now that our president donald still has absolute control of the military so you need to know that everybody and i think that that's why they keep trying to take him down hoping they can end that but they can't have no authority not even in the natural not even officially not even legally can they do anything about the fact that he still has control of the military wow that's amazing that's amazing now you you said we were going to uh command uh what did you want to do did you want to do that right now regarding praying for the military i didn't do it now everybody can just repeat this and i don't want people to say i'm in agreement i actually want them to say the words it's nice to say an agreement for something for somebody but when you yourself are making a ruling over what's going on because we rule right with jesus christ you say those words so we're going to say this together father father we declare we declare in jesus name in jesus name that our military our military will be covered completely covered completely during this operation during this operation they will have physical help they will have physical help they will have words from holy spirit they will have words from the holy spirit they will have discernment they will have they will have discernment and be able to move quickly they'll be able to move quickly with no harm done to them with no harm done to them every operation every operation on behalf of america on behalf of america will be successful will be successful it will be a suddenly it will be a suddenly that God is behind that God that God is behind in jesus name in jesus name anything they need to use anything anything we need to use in the way of tanks or jets in the way of tanks or jets or weapons or weapons can operate correctly correctly we thank you father we thank you we thank you father that america that america in america belongs to you belongs belongs to you and we need the people we we the people we the people we are all in agreement we're all in agreement that america that america it is free it is free in jesus name amen amen amen oh that's so good well we're going to things of heaven but that's amazing is there anything else you want to add before we go on and make sure i don't cut anything off i i think that's pretty much it that's probably all that can be said that i can just tell everybody this is such a an amazing year that you're living we can't say a lot of us cannot say we've ever lived through or experienced anything like this but the thing that is so powerful is that we can all declare an agreement with God's plans that we don't have to step back because we don't know what time he's going to do something we do know he is going to do something and the most important thing you can do is don't step back keep that stand on behalf of our God and our country and the president that God has chosen we're not stepping back in jesus name i expect celebration in a great way that never seen before not just in america but around this world and he has never stopped saying that to me so good so good Kat uh Kat thank you so much for that that's really good well for those of you that may know uh be maybe new Kat has been to heaven over the last 20 some years thousands of times she stopped counting at a thousand but she's really with the lord all day every day he sometimes walks through the wall literally and sits down and writes things on her wall it's amazing so we ask her every time she comes on every wednesday when it's mostly every wednesday she can't necessarily make it every single wednesday but most wednesdays and we ask her questions from you the viewer i'm hearing some feedback in my ear is that me or is that something else interesting well if let me know if i need to do anything different michael jeff so just a little bit of feedback there that's better it went away so Kat you said you uh like to ask um answer questions from kids too by the way i'm still getting some feedback in my ear if it makes any difference guys um so i'm gonna give you three kids questions i can't tell if these are from the same mommy because there's three different ones but she only refers to one so here's the here's an eight-year-old question from taylor do you have your own house or can you share your house with your parents in heaven i wonder if they mean as a child i think if they probably i think she's seeing it from or she i assume yeah i assume she's seeing it as if she's there with her parents right now at this age like if the lord returned or something i guess uh absolutely the children would be with their parents um and i will say this if a child leaves here early they're never alone they're with the closest family members who are already there in heaven usually it's with grandparents or even great-grandparents who will keep them until the parents arrive no matter how long that is earth time they're never alone um of course families do things together all over heaven uh together as a family because that's just the way God designed it he doesn't split up families when you go home to heaven we've already said before you don't go like you're married on the earth but you'll be like best friends everybody can visit and stay at each other's mansions that happens a lot sometimes they go off somewhere and stay somewhere in heaven i mean i don't mention that but they have beautiful fun places to go and even stay at in different places in heaven maybe you want to be there even though there's no time you might want to be enjoying all the activities festivities uh or fun that's going on there then there's actually places for you to stay at there awesome okay wow okay so liam seven years old liam wants to know if there are mermaids in heaven well i've never seen a mermaid liam i'm not saying they aren't there um just about everything else is there i've seen unicorns i've seen dinosaurs i've seen creatures there that aren't even on the earth so but that's one thing i haven't seen i haven't been under the crystal z very much i've been maybe once actually under the crystal sea swimming and the creatures talk to you while you're there the whales the sharks yes there's sharks there every kind of thing octopuses everything's there so i haven't really been under there a whole lot uh mainly i've seen it from the land or been on ships going across it so i can't say there aren't uh because i haven't i don't know the answer to that question but that was a good question that's good and then last one jonas five years old wants to know does God take off his slippers or change his clothes i can't say he has slippers um i would say he absolutely has a wardrobe he made everything i'm i'm certain because he's such a person of um you know God can be in the shape of almost anything actually we know christ appears as a lion as a lamb as an eagle i'm sure the father can do the same thing i mean they made everything i can imagine if God did have slippers i wouldn't be surprised if he did probably the one who would get a chance to see that is a child if a child ever went up there to visit and they were in their bedroom slippers God would put bedroom slippers on too just to make them feel at home i can just i will say that much but i've seen the father wearing different robes different kind of gowns um absolutely he has different kind of crowns the rainbow never stops moving in and out of him you know that's where life comes from so that was a great question i don't think anyone's ever asked me that i do know this that when this little child was caught up to heaven to visit God sent them back they had passed from something i remember what it was but he was taken up just for a visit and um God sits on his throne when this little child came God sent for a little throne lightly and put it right next to his on the left side and that little child got to sit in that throne and just like the father did so that's why i said if a little child was caught up and they were in their pajamas in their bedroom slippers God would probably wear bedroom slippers just for them he's so personal huh that's so good okay well i know each person in heaven like when they walk up will i instantly know who they are do they have to introduce themselves or does everybody know everything about everybody kind of like at least as far as names or do you introduce yourself i'm just looking at this um yeah i guess that's it it's like when you're walking up you see a person you automatically know that your father your grandfather do you see another person because we're all young then and suddenly you know that is your friend from your little friend from high school or from grade school do you know that stuff automatically or do they introduce themselves to well first of all let's talk about the ones that they know personally the bible says that in heaven you will be known as you were known that means that your friends and your family will automatically recognize you and you will recognize them no one is old but people still know the other thing i do know also is everyone in heaven automatically knows your name and i've heard that over and over and over again from other people who've been to heaven or had visits there they recognized people they knew that that was their grandfather the great grandfather even people they hadn't met they were part of the family they knew who that was but every heaven knows your name when you get there and they call you by your by your first name yeah i can imagine that just strikes a new question to me it's like if everybody knows everybody and i i never met my great-grandfather i didn't met my great-grandmother but his father and his father and his father and his wife we could have we could literally have a schultz reunion of that whole line right and there'd be hundreds and hundreds of people oh yeah they do that all the time they have like huge like reunions massive reunions from people who are you know in your family line people say i don't know anybody trust me they're up there and they will know you and yes you will everybody's gonna hug no masks in heaven people no social justice there's no social different thing in heaven and everybody will know you and greet you and usually what happens is after your throne room party with the father son and holy spirit your family will eventually come to get you because you so want to be in the throne room they'll talk you into going with them because they want you to see your mansion and usually that's how it happens they come get you they take you to the man your mansion because they've been putting gifts in that mansion for you since they've been there and then you have another whole party with all your family your relatives even from way back and that's usually when you actually meet uh most of them that's amazing now you said i was dared to ask you this question so you're gonna giggle but um first of all there's all kinds of hairdos there's pink hair purple hair and different hairdos and people change their hair to up right okay so i just dared to ask you this question have you ever seen anyone any guy with a man bun in heaven well i will say this that some people from their culture if that was their culture actually there is there are and you know people can wear their hair any way they want to like you said it can be long it can be short most of the guys will wear the hair similar to like jesus it'll be kind of loose most of the time it's about down to their shoulders almost nobody in heaven almost nobody's balls at all because i guess unless they wanted to be i've never seen people in heaven without hair but almost every other kind of hairstyle that you know that they would like to have you can change it uh they have salons especially the women like to go there but they have like diamond dust emerald dust put in their hair people dress sometimes God will have a huge event and everybody dresses like royalty it's the most magnificent place and people wear all kinds of things up there everything's decent i have to always say that nothing revealing or indecent in heaven but beautiful amazing some of it's kind of edgy you know i've never heard anyone complain that they were given a nightgown or a bathrobe up there although most people draw that most people draw that because they don't know they know you get a gown of salvation a robe of righteousness but those things are the most spectacular things you actually own in heaven so but there's all kinds of clothing to wear because there's so many things to do you don't want to wear a gown on a roller coaster there's a clue right there i was thinking about that yeah this i'm gonna blend a couple of questions and you might have touched on this a little bit before but um so there's there will probably be he's and she's in heaven and i'm guessing and this is a as much a question as a statement i'm guessing the women have the form of women and the men have a form of men but the quest two questions are if we don't go to the bathroom and of course we're not having children what what happens to the end they're asking what happens to the inward parts do they are they just not there because you don't need what you just don't need those parts that's what the question is you have to remember everybody you're in your spiritual body of course except elijah and enoch during their physical bodies they've been there a very very long time in the physical bodies but they don't look old either they're amazing but everyone else when this physical body dies your spiritual body steps out it doesn't have all the inward physical parts that you need to live on this earth you don't need that in heaven okay when we get our glorified body i don't think that uh i think when our body at the very end when everything's over all the wars the millennial reign when all that's over and then we all go we will be together at that time you know it says in the day the dead and christ shall rise that's this body you left behind that was buried or whatever happened to it even if it was a burn up in a fire or you were cremated God will put every ash every piece of you particle view back together and if you've been living in heaven your spirit man at that point will come down be glorified in that physical body they'll be put together as one and after that your physical body and spiritual body will never be separated you'd be like one and so i don't know that you will have to have all those parts that worked for certain reasons i don't believe anybody will ever ever have to go to the bathroom again because everything you eat is made out of light it's absorbed into your spiritual body which is made out of light it tastes like all the food you eat here no weight gain nothing's bad or not good for you but it's dissolved into your entire being so i don't think that will ever change even when you get your physical body back so you don't need those certain parts in heaven you still feel uh you can breathe in heaven and your spiritual body so it's like you have spiritual lungs you couldn't sing right you have to suck an air to sing and to speak so you actually feel like you're breathing the air of heaven and you also can smell things in heaven which you need those kind of things and you eat okay you don't look at a piece of food and it just dissolves in you you actually eat it so those sensations and things you still have those but as far as the other ones like waste and stuff like that there isn't any anywhere in heaven none of that it just gets better people yeah awesome okay now this one has been asked me many times i finally decided to jump in and ask it our guardian angels are with us from the important of conception i think you said they're with us all the time this question keeps coming to me so when i'm i'm going to use the word indisposed i'm going to say when i'm doing intimate things married couples there there seems to be a concern what hap what is the angel what is it my guardian angel see you guardian angels are outside the room but they're very well aware that there's nothing there that could hurt you because that's their number one job is to keep you and to help to guard over you especially if you you go in places they're always right there next to you but things like the bathroom and the shower and stuff like that they don't they don't have to be there they're they would be aware of something happen like if you started to fall or something in the shower they of course could rescue you from there but their heads you have to understand they're from heaven they don't think like in your natural mind they don't think oh man they can't see me like that because they've rescued people and save people on the operating table from death and i don't think you wear clothes on the operating table so that that intimacy that privacy you get to keep that to some extent but if harm was ever going to come to you they certainly would intervene so that's the way that they do things they're not like glued to you every second every second uh those times when you go but i will tell you this the holy spirit speaks to you more when you're in the bathroom than any other time and you know your mind is quiet your mind kind of shuts down it's focused on what it's doing and so i will know holy spirit is everywhere also and uh but he doesn't think that way that oh my gosh i'll see them not dressed right or not this they don't think that way in their head they're here to protect us and i can tell you the conception they are sent waiting outside your mother for you to be born and they will be with you when you go back to heaven one day okay and then on the guarded angels they're there to protect you does God bestow on them also um for lack of a better terminology powers to heal so at the right time when God said now can your guardian angel touch you and create healing or are they really only there to protect you and something else has to happen for the healing to happen oh i've seen angels many times when actually you know it says that they actually go back and forth to heaven you know it says that that it they go before the face of God and stuff like that and you actually have more than one because one's always with you if one has to go back to heaven to receive stuff to give to you to bring to you to shower over you there's so many things that they do like that and yes sometimes they go back up and he speaks to them and sometimes they can bring healing they can bring body parts for sure i know they deliver body parts to people like they'll walk through them with the body part and it's in them i've seen that happen many times so yeah they can get special assignments to special times i've actually seen in and like an er somebody was like dying they were actually dying and i saw all of a sudden the people that were praying and then God said it's not their time and these angels flew in and they leaned over this person beginning to blow the breath of God on them wow okay literally i've seen that happen several times and all of a sudden instant healing for that person like they were on death door and instantly healed still in the er um waiting to do something with them so they actually flew in i've seen it blew on the people and they were restored because God said it wasn't their time to go yet so angels can actually do that and maybe a special group he sends to do that but i do know that the breath of God is so powerful i felt it blown on me not to make me not to make me still live and not die but for for different reasons and i've seen people especially prophets if you see them sometimes when they're speaking over people sometimes they'll blow like that when they do that that's the breath of God that they're blowing out whatever God had them saying to somebody that kind that sometimes can seal something that God has said this and then he seals it and they they'll blow the breath of God on himself there's so many things we don't talk about the operations of everything we're that side we talk about the operations in heaven there's so many things the angelic do the army does army of heaven does on this earth it's like would be countless probably impossible to actually talk about all of it but as far as healing i have seen those things happen really good now i asked you a form of this question before and this woman wanted to know and i'm going to add mine back into it she wanted to know if if there are certain activities that she always wanted to do but never did but i'm not just talking about activities she wanted to be able to do something that she couldn't do they'll become a painter a dancer an ice skater mountain climber and i had said boy i want to be an athlete but i'm not an athlete really could i be something i never was i've always wanted to play the piano i'm a little bit musical and play different instruments but i always want to sit down and play whatever came to my mind you know i couldn't do that like something could i have a skill that i was never given on the earth just because i wanted it i'm certain that you could most people actually do get to enjoy that and there's places you go in heaven for instance i've seen people that that's what they did their gift was to teach piano and that's what they did and in heaven they have a studio with like i don't know 50 other pianos and people go there to learn piano in heaven but it only takes a couple lessons it's not like it takes six months and that's true with anything i've also seen people who always want to play football they get to join a team that they all were experts that was their gift they get to be a part of that team and at that time they get to play really good so all those things you talk to are absolutely possible in heaven that's amazing that's amazing all right this one i'm going to just read it it's a little bit longer she says i have a question for Kat i'm somewhat of a strategist and this question is about something that stops me praying when we pray and utter the words that express our deepest feelings does the enemy hear these prayers meaning when she's saying out loud and do they give him greater insight as to how to overthrow us i pray almost always internally it seems foolish to let the enemy know my heart and deepest needs this is only for God to know please help me understand this more fully from a strategist's point of view there is something you can do about that every time you say it when i when i'm when i'm declaring declaring a high level of prayer so you know that God says what you declare and decree i will establish unto you that's still prayer you're saying something believing jesus for declaring this is what you're desiring from God and you can pray this prayer i right now take authority over all the power of the enemy who would seek to hear me uh get involved in what i'm saying and i put a block on them that no demon can hear me they can't hear me they can't respond to anything that i'm saying and i post the angels of God around me to prevent them from hearing me i will sometimes say that before i speak in a meeting so they can't come in no demons if people bring them in they can't interfere you should do that every time you pray you should say you know i choose with my will and i make a declaration no demon will hear what i'm saying the devil will not hear what i'm saying and then they can't hear it but most people don't think to do that well yeah let me just push you in there a little bit go ahead go ahead it's important to pray out loud okay because when your words are released in the atmosphere the frequency of God is in them if christ is in you he's released into that situation immediately he doesn't ever say to pray internally he always says to speak out to declare to pray with your voice that would be like you singing internally it might sound good to you in your head but it's important to say it out loud now if you're ever in a place let's say you know whatever you're going to sell somewhere and there's other things in there then in that point i would pray in tongues if i were you or i would just pray quietly but enough for you to hear it and you know also what you say about let's say you are in a cell what are you going to say you're going to sit there and just put up with it how are you gonna command the host to come to begin to form things around you to give you favor with judges with the cell master i mean you know the disciples were praising God when the locks fell off when the angels came to let them out we should always remember to worship God no matter what place we're in in our lives but yes you can say something to stop the enemy from hearing your words it's all in us when we receive christ so don't be concerned make that statement they won't be able to hear what you said and you actually will put fear in the enemy because he will be shocked that you know that you can do that wow okay that's really good um okay i gotta read this one because it's it's specific uh patricia says i've never had a child never had a miscarriage or abortion i ended up having a full hysterectomy at 46 yet to this day i feel so strongly that i have children meeting in heaven and although they were not able to be born to me on the earth i have children in heaven is that possible that i have children in heaven waiting for me even though i had none born to me on the earth there's many times the women felt like they were pregnant i actually know some people that they really felt like that they were pregnant but nothing came out of it in other words there was no physical evidence that if there was a conception once that conception happens that little spirit is sent into that dot at the time of conception you create like that little dot of flesh and that little baby spirit is in there if that never comes to fruition i don't care if it's two weeks three weeks along that baby's angel will take it to heaven and that baby will be waiting on you when you get to heaven so as the father said many women would be surprised how many times they felt strongly that they were but nothing actually came out of it there was no evidence that the pregnancy actually happened most women are right when they feel things inside like that the other thing is this even if you didn't create one yourself there are places in heaven that God has kept a reserve of babies for people just like that and you can go pick one out they will call you mommy it'll be just like that they were they were yours they'll always think that way so no one has to go without children if you didn't have them on the earth you never have to be without them when you get to heaven it's absolutely possible to have uh go pick them out and have them for yourself wow that's really good okay uh okay this is a good one and people need this when i ask you this once this is one of the questions i asked you when i first got to know you because i wanted to drill down on this because see people have read your book and it says i've heard many people say they were taken to hell and christians were there because of unforgiveness in their heart when they died from your experience is this true my husband will not talk to her oldest son because he refuses to let go of things that were said i don't yeah so i guess it's her husband that won't let it go and i want to add to that so if this is i guess this question is about one father who refuses to forgive one son and then i asked you back then well what if i just there's a person i just didn't forgive and i kind of forgot about it and i moved on that's still unforgiveness so i want to it's a matter of degrees how much how much unforgiveness can i put it that way is going to put you in hell there is a difference in harboring uh there's like a spirit of unforgiveness a lot of people get upset in their lives and things were done wrong to them that doesn't mean this is what unreal true unforgiveness is uh you know if you say to yourself i'd rather just go to hell than forgive you that's unforgiveness to be angry to be upset about an issue that you can't bring up because it's so painful that's not real true unforgiveness that means you were angry you went through a trauma or something because of something but i always tell people if you want to make sure you can just say no matter what your feelings are about the situation if you say these words as a child of God i choose with my will to forgive and you say that person's name even though my heart doesn't feel like it or my mind i'm making a declaration that i choose to forgive them even though there's no emotions there because you made the declaration that will be white that will be wiped off of your list that you were angry that you couldn't forgive them and your own flesh would begin to line up with that till you get to a point where it doesn't hurt to hear their name you know hide for them so i know what people go through when that happens to them but there's a big difference in living an absolute life of unforgiveness and hate usually hate despite or some kind of this agony and torture that kind of thing God has more grace on that but someone who in the right mind just decides that they hate them they'll never forgive them they'd rather go to hell and forgive them that's more of unforgiveness than for saying i was angry at one time i didn't want to say anything to them so i was just going to let it go uh usually the holy spirit will work on people that are in that situation but just because people say you know i went through too much i don't think i can forgive that's really not the spirit of unforgiveness and i'm not trying to give people leeway to get away with it you know in your soul how much you despise that person and just hate that person don't even care if they die and they die and go to hell that's more of unforgiveness than just saying i don't think i can forgive them i'm just not going to think about it no more i think that the holy spirit would work on them or at the time at some time in your life it will be brought up probably by the holy spirit peter just say i forgive anyone i have not forgiven God forgive me for all that even if you're not emotionally involved it's really important to at least say those words and if you can't remember who it was you'll still be covered because you said that that's good now i a cousin sort of a thing to this unforgiveness is i've told i think i even said it on the air here and i told you recently when you're here visiting that i have a sister who who said to me on the phone a few years ago because i said dad had got his heart right and he went to be with the lord and she said if he's in heaven i don't want to be there if she met her with all the depths of her soul let's say that she just has every intent never never never to forgive him i can still stand in for my sister and say i declare and decree that she will know the lord and that kind of thing right so that God still i would give her more but we both know that all that was tied to the torment that she went through that was just because i got offended somebody said something to me somebody took something to mind where that's coming for from and her was a continual torment and agony that she faced even thinking she didn't want to be around him to begin with so that was our inner heart that she couldn't stand the agony and torment that would cause her to be even near him and when people that's what i was saying that God gives grace in some areas that would be one of the areas that they were under great torment and trauma by an individual that that was just it was dug so deep in their soul it's almost like a terror to be near them they couldn't picture being near them of course that doesn't he doesn't want to separate her from jesus christ he understands that pain that she understands christ understands the pain she went through he understands why she said that words he would take that with a grain of salt because he knows what she went through because of them i believe because of you're staying for her and christ not willing to lose her to satan who caused all that to happen from that side that God purposed her to be here for a reason and he loves her even though she went through that trauma he didn't cause that to happen that was all satan but satan's ultimate goal is not just to torment people on the earth but to drag them into hell with him and God's not willing it was enough for them to be tormented and live in agony and have nightmares and then let them end up in hell with them God will pursue everything he can to her his self he will pursue his herself uh to make sure she gets into heaven and she comes to that place of at least repentance with christ and you know when you repent your sins to christ there's no sin that he won't include in that whole thing so let's say she gives a full of herself fully to christ and repents of every sin committed no matter what it was that that she said about him will be wiped away like it was never said very cool very cool all right a couple more and then we're running on time here um i'm going to kind of this is a longer thing so i'm going to kind of encapsulate the question when people get to heaven will they ever be realize what rewards they missed out by what they didn't do that could have done well somehow that became known to them that they missed out of this reward even though they're happy to be there and then the second question is is it okay to be on this earth motivated by the promise of rewards so God said he's going to reward me if i help the poor so i purposely help the poor because i want the reward i think that um you know what the bible says if you think for something for yourself to heap it upon yourself which is why sometimes God won't give great wealth to certain people it would ruin them not everybody but there's some people that would do that and and people would uh want to be in the ministry so they'd be on a big podium and people would uh you know love them and sort of go after them you know because they want to be with them some people by the way people need to know the difference of worship and honoring and love because someone has helped you which is what most people are doing for people who are on a platform somewhere but there are some that do it just to be seen and if they did it for that reason they get no reward in the bible it says that will be your reward your pride of what you wanted to do for the purpose of yourself you don't get reward for those things so you would have wasted your time if you do with the right heart to help people no matter how small you get great rewards God has purpose already to reward people who do certain things for people and i think some even start up with that i'll look good and look good on my resume it'll look good if people see me doing this normally in the course of doing that the holy spirit will get your heart and milk on behalf of the people and you change completely that you're not even thinking about what you've earned you think about the difference you're making in lives for christ uh so what i can tell you there are some people who will lose rewards they'll make it into heaven because of selfishness um because of selfishness maybe you know that was one of the reasons why satan fell it was pride he was very selfish he still is selfish selfish is not a good thing okay you're not walking in the spirit you're not caring about other people you care about only about yourself which i could take that everybody back to dc right now everybody up there right now only cares about themselves individually they don't even care about each other they don't care about anyone here and that's why one of the reasons why they are going to miserably fail so don't ever start out thinking i'll do this for myself it'll look good for me if you're working on stuff like you're highly skilled you're working towards a job or something that's okay to be be happy about how good you're doing but when it comes to people's souls make sure you're doing things for the right reason the rewards you can never out give God not in your life service not in helping people not even giving financially to God when you give it should be like even though you're giving an offerings or to help others you give it like you're giving it to the lord that's what the bible says so i can just say this the rewards will be shocking amazing beautiful exciting that he gives in heaven there are so many different ones i've seen people get even things you never even dreamed could be a reward because it's in God's heart to bless and he wants a blessing to others amen and when let's say a person makes it uh just barely makes it to heaven and they're just happy to be there when they're there and they're proud to be the will they will they realize they missed out on rewards when they're there will they go will they realize but there's no regret it's hard to explain they know they missed it they know they missed it and uh and you can't escape that you missed it but you know what you don't get it and people go man you missed it didn't you they won't say that you yourself will realize i should have done more for christ i should have thought more of others but this is the overwhelming thing above all that even if you you won't get a cabin because it's not even a little cabin and having those beautiful places it may not be some extensive massive mansion but you are so happy that you're there and not there and one more thing i don't talk very much about people don't bring it up there's the judgment seat uh the judgment uh white great white zone judgment but there's another one called the judgment seat of christ and most people don't know those are two different things the father is on the throne and all the wicked will be taken out of hell at one point you know when time is no more and we're going on to the rest of our lives the wicked will be taken out bought before the throne of God himself and he will show them when their name was taken out of the lamb's book of life or what they did to cause them to not they didn't accept christ at all rejected him they will no no no they were guilty so that's for the wicked dead that's not believers who made it into heaven there's a time in heaven it's called the judgment seat of christ it's at the end of our time before probably before the new earth and everything you'll go before the judgment seat of christ it says to judge you for deeds done in the flesh that's not judging you for sins that's judging you for things he asked you to do you knew he asked you to do and you said no and at that time you cried and it says all the tears it says right here about the judgment of your christ your tears will be wiped away and those former things that you should have done and did not i mean major things i'm not saying little things major things maybe you were called to be in the ministry you said no i want to be a plumber i'll make more money or this maybe you decided to put yourself without God involved in the ministry like we talked earlier so you could get attention and he called you to be the best plumber on the earth you you need to do what God has asked you to do what he called you to be because the judgment seat of christ is about the gift he put in you and you and you don't want to do that gift you have no intention of doing that gift you will be judged for not doing that and any rewards you would have made had you done it will be wiped away you still get rewards from loving people and helping them but many people don't consider the judgment seat of christ that's actually in heaven it's not about judging your sins i'm not talking about sins and so maybe you should go look that up everybody and read about that but the but the great white throne judgment is not for the body of christ it's for all those who went into hell and the sentence is passed and then they're put in the lake of fire that's why we should all be praying for souls we should be praying especially for our family members all the time declare that it's going to make it into heaven that they'll be repent of their sins they'll come to know jesus christ as their savior and be a testimony to what he gave himself for it's the most important thing you can do for any family member that's on the earth with you right now wow kat that's amazing well listen that's our time and i know you've got an appointment to get to uh but thank you again tell people that your website you got two of them again tell them those websites yeah i have revealingheaven.com which is our that's what we have all our events that's where our store is we create things that represent heaven on earth like this cup that says i don't do demons now this cup doesn't judge anybody except hell probably that means you're not a part of hell you're not into sin you're not participating with the enemy's plans and the holy spirit came up with that that slogan right there as he does many other things he wants things to represent heaven on this earth so we do that that's revealingheaven.com if you need more spiritual revelation and uh all kinds of videos to watch that will train you and teach you like how to pray for your family members how to ask for grace for abundant life every day all different things how to lose things out of your soul that you don't want in there so it'll be taken out bad memories all kinds of things how to bind the things of God like his life his love his presence to your soul it'll change you that's katker.com and i always say this to people there's only one way online if you want to give to what we're doing that would be on KatKerr.com i have no other place out there to do that if you find a facebook page that's asking you to give money to me that's not me if i'm saying uh people say you need to give money to this certain group or or come and win this prize i'm offering you that's not me those are fake pages they do it on both youtube and facebook and they do it to a lot of people so i have theKatKerr facebook page and theKatKerr public youtube channel those are my own and so if you want to know what i've actually said you can go there and we're going to start dating our broadcast our own facebook things we're going to give a date when we say it because people are taking them and saying this is new but it was from two years ago there's over 400 hours out there people and and so uh and it's that is all free from me i don't charge people charge for commercials that isn't me so i always want to let people know there's so much of that going on like you just talked about the steve schultz thing and i will say this kim clement was one of the best prophets that ever lived on the face of the earth i will agree with you i got to hear him several times he was so right on uh with the words he gave and some of them are still coming to pass when a prophet speaks it could be for that day the next day five years 50 years 100 years down the road so when a prophet says God has said this is going to happen and they don't give you a date don't stick a date on there don't give God a time when you think he needs to do it like what we're about to experience because he didn't do things on certain dates you thought man was going to do something that doesn't mean God's not going to do it in his own time that's so good and that's a good instruction that is really really good all right well Kat thanks again God bless you and tomorrow see i may not have my seat anymore because i i lost it uh but anyway was uh tomorrow is the cc texas sometimes she texts it to me nope she did oh yeah well timmy at the addiction is tomorrow uh in the afternoon oh yeah yeah johnny johnny endless tomorrow morning and timothy dixon's tomorrow afternoon so all right everybody thank you again Kat and we'll see you all tomorrow

well welcome to elijah's streams this is steve schultz with the elijah list right there be sure you subscribe to that so if we ever get kicked off you'll know where to go or we'll know where to send the notice um let's see it's march it's actually march 2 we're recording this on tuesday march 2 for wednesday's broadcast so just so you know the date we're recording it it's march 2 it's 2 26 2 27 pm pacific standard time out of the state of oregon so because we're recording this we're going to go right into this with Kat Kerr so let's bring on kat here she is hey kat how are you i'm doing just great just got back from where was i gent virginia the people are at a peak of excitement there i'm telling you they are so excited about things that are going on right now uh concerning the election so we can start with that if you want to we'll start there in just a second and cancel her focus is a little suck but that's because of the connections a little bit uh the connection's a little bit soft right now but you feel bear with us we're i think we're just fine to go ahead so Kat you do have some things to say about the election and i just we didn't we didn't debrief i don't know you did say you had some interesting things to say i don't know which things you're allowed to say so without further ado before we get into the the heaven questions tell us what you'd like to tell us about the elections okay let me find one of the things i know that i have to say i did make some notes so that's going to help everybody there's quite a few things going on and i first of all want to talk about the speech i hope you got to see president trump's speech at the cpac and it was so powerful and i know hey he was an hour late i understand that no one cared everyone was say celebrated from the time they got in that place i wasn't there i was up in virginia i actually didn't get to watch it till like 10 something at night because i was speaking myself but i can tell you what the the energy level and the excitement and the love level for our president was out of this was out of the building and they had people outside the building wish they could get in but they had you know they had to meet their quota and not go beyond that but the people who were there were so excited it had been about a month since uh they had heard anything from president trump and i'm just going to keep calling him that because you know he is still and anyway the words he spoke were so powerful people were hoping he'd say a little bit more and he kind of left everybody hanging but there's a reason for that i know we always say he's got his trump cards which are hilarious to even say that but he does and so things are going on um i can just i can say this arrests are being made around the world not just here i mean you'll be so shocked too surprised i can't give names but i can say literally they have been certain to be made concerning with people you know that they they conspire to interfere with the elections and these are people overseas leaders overseas knew what they were doing didn't care some were paid some were not paid but they have been see that's i think i i can kind of say i haven't hear trump say this but i know part of the plan is to get as many arrested overseas before he starts here and so i think that's going to bring some as it leaks out people are going to get more and more excited that hey evil is evil no matter where it is and then even spider to overthrow our country these are the terms they're using i know in indictments that have already been typed the terms are this treason insurrection conspiracy to overthrow the country of america conspiracy to overthrow the presidency conspiracy to con collude and lie with the elections so those are the indictments they're very severe some are federal offenses and the treason actually is a very very serious that anybody could would conspire to and i think the arrest that was just made in italy i will tell you it was in italy where it was made because it's already leaking out places uh i think that was for conspiracy to overthrow the results of the election so it is very serious and i will say this that land side that God promised on november the 4th he didn't give any dates he just said it would happen and uh there are people out there saying boy the cascading of the landslide is is actually beginning to start so i can say that the other thing i can say is that the father has never changed what he said to me about what would happen what he said to me on november the 4th he is still saying those things so what God wants God gets in this time and so many people have prayed and i want to thank you for your prayers because while other people are saying nothing's happening because we prayed wrong and say that very boldly you prayed powerfully the body is going to come together to pray on behalf of our country the freedom of our country our president who we actually know actually did win the election and those results have already been collected they have so much evidence i don't know how they'd ever present it won't be presented in the civil courts probably at least not that part i will say this what will be presented in the civil courts and actually already has the the first lawsuit has been launched uh from a county that um that they are not withholding the oath of the office whether it was governor mayor i'm not sure who that was for they've already launched our lawsuit against the things being said by the person behind the barbed wire who's making their own laws without going through the legal course there's actually a legal proceeding that must take place even trump had to do that when trump made laws to present they had to go through councils it had to be approved by different places and different people well the person behind the barbed wire the b person uh never did that so what do you mean you can't make laws like a dictator and that's exactly what's been going on okay let me just interject sorry to interrupt for people that don't know cannot see me i can see her but she cannot see me so uh our apologies when i sometimes interrupt but uh when you're talking in code so when you say the person behind the barbed wire this is someone within the beltway or in washington dc who is in that inside part behind the barbed wire is that what you mean i'm talking about those who are in the capitol building who have have put themselves there uh actually illegally no one is allowed to withhold our public buildings like the capitol building like uh the supreme court all those places that are for us we the people who you know those who are in office even in the fake office right now they're supposed to serve the people they're serving themselves and they're doing it any way they feel like it and some of these laws that are being made like all the terrorists can come in for free we're going to start to tear down the wall that was built for our safety and all kinds of illegal things that are against our constitution against the wish of the people they're causing harm to our actual country their cell those are real legal reasons to put forth lawsuits and that is one of the lawsuits it's already been put forth i'm trying to remember which state that was or which county that was but it's already that's already been made public that they're suing the top people that have put themselves in an office that they didn't earn because they lost the election those people are being sued because they're making illegal laws that they think that they can force us to have to operate by but we don't have to because they're against their their what they're doing is they're conspiring to cause harm to our country by letting in terrorists with no checks on them uh by doing away with our law enforcement which causes harm could cause harm to us anything that anyone does that is is reason number one to kick them out of the office and to cause them that they're going to be sued right now they're actually being sued uh the ones behind the barbed wire the one who calls them our top people that are not uh they're being sued because they're making ill legal laws without going through the process of having them approved you can't do that they're acting like they're dictators and that isn't gonna work in america and so successfully in a county court they have allowed this one organization saying that we don't have to abide by the laws being made they're illegal according to the constitution they're supposed to uphold our rights and to protect our country and they are not doing that so they are now therefore being sued for those those laws that they think they can make without proper procedures that i can say that's already been made public like i said i think in front of me i tell you where that was but there's also been a lawsuit made against the illegal laws with no one checking no one having a proper say about that they cannot do that in america we're not a third world country they can't just make any law they want to and make it happen if it's illegal comes against our own rights as citizens according to the constitution if it actually causes harm or detriment to our country that they could face because of them being made those are illegal and they cannot even enforce them so that is good news that that is actually happening right now and the other one of course is it's already leaked out the indictments i just told you that there the things that they will be uh these people who have been making illegal things who helped overthrow the elections it's all the evidence is all there and it's being done i might as well just say this not through the civil civil courts they rejected it which that also was illegal and i think whoever did that is probably also being sued also at this moment you cannot reject something that you have the evidence for when it concerns a federal crime messing with the elections that is a federal offense and uh so those who were involved in that they're they're they're having their indictments made out right now and i already told you what they were treason insurrection they are conspiring to overthrow the country of america conspiring to overthrow the presidency conspiring to steal an election and like i said there's some people in italy you've already been arrested for that that's already been leaked out there so it's already out there you may or may not have heard about that but you will and then the other indictments that were actually made signed and sealed and when they're signed and sealed they cannot be changed the evidence has been presented for these indictments to be made those people are about to be arrested and i will not give names i will tell you that some of them has to do with the courts and there's already been one person's name i'm sure if you search online somewhere you're gonna find that person's name uh their indictment was already sealed and ready to be presented that's already linked up but that won't stop it from happening so that that thing that you've been waiting on the action to start it has actually started yeah so everybody should be in a place so we should be celebrating okay this is not free uh we want a country free liberty justice and freedom in our country and you cannot force a free people to be dragged into socialism or communism we didn't vote for that that's not in any of our constitutional papers they don't have the right so don't let fear uh don't let fear be in your life you should all be very excited right now these things are literally happening and i'm sure as soon as those last indictments are sealed signed and sealed you'll hear a different message coming from trump and uh he's about to play his trump card that's what everybody who is on the inside calls that so yes our lives are about to begin to change for the good and the better and i also wanted to thank this is a little bit still a little bit about the elections that people are sending me all kinds of notes and things with stuff on it concerning america and concerning things that are being said so i would like to thank our friend who made these cookies you can see it right there it is a flashpoint cookie and yeah they made this and sent to me so we want to thank all those at flashpoint who allowed well especially myself to speak about the truth about the elections but the others who spoke about that this is their way of thinking it and they also made one that's at home of the brave right here and uh these people themselves this family that makes these cookies uh they're already got their celebration hats and their little blowers all ready for the day when they have to make that announcement that we have been set free and so i just want to encourage everybody keep your hopes high and stay excited and what did you want to show me john oh this is a little note to everybody save room for dessert oh that's good that's very good any room for dessert because let me tell you the things that have been talked about by steve and i especially continually we've never changed what we said God said and i know like people like jeff johnson hank kuhneman uh uh liz bliss and uh johnny enlo amanda uh amanda grace amanda grace these people and i know there's others there's more that have stayed strong then more that have stepped back no this is right that's right and so i just want to let you know i i do want to read a message i got from an unknown prophet how about this this is from an unknown prophet and uh he was in the middle of america God said go to the middle of america and he told him to stay there from the evening the sun down to sun up representing something and this is what he was told to do i was to be here the center of america at the close of one day and to the start of another and was given the to blow the rams horn seven times that walls would fall and high towers and platforms would be destroyed and then the word of the God the word of the lord came to him the holy spirit said to him the sunlight had set for them the wicked attempting to overthrow our country and those in agreement with them uh the sun has set on their time and then he the holy spirit stated it's not by chance that saturday night was a full moon for what's left is a lesser light that's decreasing night by night until the new beginnings so they have a very short decreasing time to come forward and either repent or confess that is from a prophet not known by people very accurate prophet and that is the word he got standing in the middle of making decorations uh for God himself and some people are saying or have said and they write in and they say um okay God's telling you just ask Kat they'll say this is not one person but many okay so when is it they'll say when is it and and the reality is God doesn't do that God doesn't get us gather his prophets and say on this day at this time i'm coming he tells the prophets what he's going to do he almost ne and he may say it's getting close and then he'll show signs he'll say you'll see this as a sign but he just doesn't do dates does he no God is not man and i think the thing that has probably uh affected people the most was they all thought in their head on these dates set by man the election you know the electoral vote the recounting of votes uh even the inauguration they had never had that even some profits if it didn't happen by these dates it wasn't going to happen at all but i won't remind you two things the father just spoke to me number one noah okay he didn't give noah a date when the ark would be finished he said you will finish the ark the reigns will come and i will save you and your family because there's none others on the earth that are righteous how about that people let me tell you it's not as bad as it was about a noah's day because God's going to rescue a lot more than eight eight of us okay so days aren't that bad but i won't say this some of the same evil demonic beings and those wicked places spirits and wicked places were involved in the days of noah uh and they can't destroy our country this is God's time he has other events planned but what he did and he did say what would happen he clearly talked about what would happen he clearly talked about his own plans that he would not change his plans and God was right trump won the election there's no way anyone can get around saying that pretty soon everyone out there will see the hard very visible evidence that he did win God's going to make sure everybody knows trump won and they will have to announce that he won so you wait and see that'll happen the landslide of fraud will be so deep and so vile people will be shocked to see who was involved in all of that stuff and let me tell you justice will be given because he also said that would happen and so he didn't give me a day i'm standing on what God has said and when God is ready and whenever needs to be done so trump can be ready you will hear and see all of the evidence but this country is free will remain free it has a powerful destiny as does other countries because you have to understand not only is God setting people free here he's literally going around the world and removing wicked girls who've been wicked for probably probably generations of time abusing their people taking advantage of them and God is done with that right now he's not going to wipe all evil off the earth because we still have things that are that haven't happened yet but these are greater days than ever before for us and for many other countries in the world who also run into the streets and celebrate so you need to understand God is not just winding it up he's going to shoot and show off exactly what he said and make sure you understand clearly what he said will happen and God does plan things by events on his own timeline and you're right steve he doesn't have to live or operate by man's time or their dates they have set but when he made a promise he's keeping that promise that's good and you know one last thing and we'll get into the heaven things but um people have said and i've seen other it on youtube and saying okay um God can use anything he can use a rock okay God can use anything he wants but the argument continues since since biden got in by hooker crook mainly crook all only crook therefore God we must pray for him and bless him so that God can use him talk about it i will go back to the scriptures as God always takes me the scriptures and he actually showed me this himself no he said pray this is what the bible says pray for those in authority well they have no authority when you cheat you don't have authority trust me in the olympics if they cheat they have no authority they don't get medals they don't get rewarded they don't get honored they get kicked out when you cheat that puts that whole thing in a different category we pray for those in authority the ones in authority would be trump okay would be those of his administration who are still there with him and the governors right the governors who are ruling when righteousness and not part of the cheating and stealing uh but those in the in the in the capitol building who are calling themselves they're giving themselves titles they have no right and this is what the father says they have no power in america they are not in authority in america right now so no the only thing you can pray is they might get mercy and not the death penalty wow yeah that's big and one last thing on you know people the media the mainstream media does not show this uh now but on on inauguration day when they went through that foe that fake inauguration the city washington dc was surrounded by barbed wire those big old circular things i don't know where the limits were but you couldn't get into that place unless you had special permission that razor wire and folks it's still there ask yourself the question if he's the duly elected president with all the power invested in him why is the razor wire still up what is he hiding from i will tell you what he's hiding from we the people because he's so afraid they're all going to come and overthrow him in their cells i think only because of the grace of God they aren't because there are groups that could do that right here in our own country and they've all had it with the lying with the defilement all the things that that whole group is involved in you're going to know not just about the elections people you know the other things the wicked things they've been involved in in our country and around the world which will probably leave you speechless because it's so evil and God's not letting evil take over this country but you're right what are they hiding and why can't we the people have access to the public buildings that we all everybody in the past paid for those to be built that's public property we actually have the right to go and tour and look at them they're not letting anybody in okay they don't want anyone in they don't want to know what they're doing they don't no one who actually is trying to give orders some of them are coming from overseas you're going to find out all of this but let me tell you if that's true then why is he riding in a used suv as supposed president why does he have an old plane that they have spray painted baby blue why isn't he in you know air force one why is he not in the in the vehicle that is uh set aside for the president to protect him he has access to none of that he still didn't have access to the military why you need to ask yourself why is that that's because these other people including the military who are uh when the military uh trials start they know and have seen all the all of the evidence they know who's guilty they know who doesn't really have power at all they're going to go with where the power has been given legally and that's not going to change okay they're probably hoping they can make it last as long as they can but there's some of their group already realizing it's going to fail like was said in the past also i'm sure some people will be trying to get out of the country when they realize this whole thing is falling apart this is the reason why when you do something on a foundation of evil and wickedness you have no foundation no one in that group cares about one another no one is sticking up for one another they all want something for themself they're in it for their self everyone they've colluded with paid off or in it for their self and that's what happens when it's evil there is no foundation to hold you up to surround you there's no groups of people there doing marches because they're so happy about what's going on and that's because nobody wants what is there we the people didn't vote for it we're not taking it and yes God is going to intervene along with the true president of the united states and you're going to see all this come out so that even the fake news which by the way i can add this this is truth some of their licenses are in jeopardy right now because they also colluded with those and conspired with those to overthrow our country by never showing the truth and they may not like that sleek doubt that sleeps out everywhere not just here but i can tell you what they'll be lucky if they get to keep anything and so i can just tell you look forward to new networks look forward to new social media that won't ban you block you uh crush your dreams take things away from you some contracts that people had for the businesses that was they just dumped them without any warning so that is wrong you can't have a viable business or business contract or agreement when you do whatever you feel like and don't care about what happens to others going on and these democratic governors and the ones who don't want real life there they're also controlling their people i've already met with people who are in those states right now they've had it with the with the lockdowns and the continual uh fake stuff about the viruses being worse they're not worse people a virus comes and goes that's what it does and i can tell you things are getting better in that but they're not letting you know the truth about anything so legally we the people have a right to come forth and say this is going to stop you don't have the right to do this but when it gets to the higher levels and those indictments are made against the social media and other people like that not just social media but the actual news media have not been showing you the truth and when they lie it helps to promote and continue on what's going on that's illegal justice is coming to this country and is coming in in mega waves so that's about all i have to say today that's good that's good that's really good very good well okay so now any for those of you who may be new we get tens of thousands of new ones every month kat has been to heaven as many of our speakers and guests have been many times God is doing this all over the earth i don't know how many get to go some people like to know that but a number of people including about at least four of our people i haven't taken a head count but trust me there's a lot more but kat has been somebody thousands of times he said she stopped counting at a thousand so she comes on wednesdays and after we do this part then she's here to answer questions and you guys have been bringing the questions in they come through about five different ways people hit reply people do it under youtube people do it on facebook and so we've been every time we get as many questions as we can fit in so if you're ready i'm going to give you the next questions and uh except for one or two rare exceptions we do not be brief before the show she doesn't know which questions are coming some of them are light some of them are almost funny others are extremely serious so without further delay i'll get into the next one this is coming from someone who i think she may be a minor still close to 18 and she says if someone if you're passionate about dog training or animal training will you be able to train animals in heaven that's i'm gonna give you two she had two and then she's question number two is she says do sea animals s-e-a to see animals who live in the ocean in heaven have the ability to go up on land in heaven for instance could a whale or dolphin go up on land so those are your two questions those are great questions and you know what those are new questions i love getting new questions and usually young people come up with the best because their imagination is still going strong in them uh yes if you're an animal trainer you will get to train probably people's pets are all going to be there in heaven with them and they may still need some training maybe to learn different things you didn't expect to train them in but of course that's not going to be taken away from you God has um many different creatures and haven't even some you haven't seen before and so i'm sure but the one thing you will have to face in training them is they will have the ability to speak so i hope you're ready to handle that that the pets themselves that you'd be training may have questions for you which will make it a little bit humorous and yes sea animals do not need to be in the crystal sea to live they can go on land they actually have fun places for kids to play and they actually have carousels where the living animals on the carousel go through it they're on platforms and some of them are sharks hey they're not going to bite you some would be like little baby dinosaurs or something and then other things it may be lying stuff but they're all alive they're not they're not harmful in any way but but you in heaven when you go there you can breathe the crystal sea you won't drown just like the animals don't have to be in the water to breathe and to live in heaven so those are great questions very good okay so this must be a parent he's asking uh ask Kat if kids you know i'm sure she's this is like are they always or could some of them be because some of my kids imaginary friends could they actually be angels that they're talking to or their guardian angel i think if they're probably young enough that could possibly be true uh my angel talked to me when i was younger of course i was as a seer but as a senior i could see them so to me that was normal to see angels even as a little child my angel would have short conversations with me what would they talk with you about what would they talk with you about what did your guardian angel talk with you about my guardian angel would encourage me to to continue to know jesus christ to pursue to know him that he loved me that the father loved me the holy spirit was real they would say when i was like four they would say things like that to me and then they would come they would wrap their wings around me sometimes if i wasn't having maybe a good day maybe i got upset you know kids get upset sometimes they get over it quick but they would just sit there and put their wings around me like and uh if i wasn't feeling good maybe or something you know and then the presence of God would go into me so that is possible for any little children i know babies see angels all the time because if i hope when they look behind me and stare at my angel my own grandkids did that so to other children your pets also know the presence of angels too so i think it's because their mind hasn't gotten to the place where they have to have proof or they're not going to be judgmental they're not going to go by head knowledge they know what they're seeing so they will respond to that and so yes i do know that little children uh even my own greens but i've had other children come up and say i saw my angel today you know they had orange and blue wings and they made me laugh that's something they do a lot they would make me laugh they would say funny things angels also sometimes tickle you when you're young really all right i i've been knocked on the shoulder by my angel this is like a year ago or so oh and i've seen i don't know if it's my one guardian age or one of my guardian angels if i have more than one you know but i i think i told you when you were at our house that i a guardian angel kind of or an angel i don't know he's my God corrected me on something he was a bit stern and so i complied and i never saw him again and then i took a trip a few months later into france and i shouldn't have traveled alone and i wasn't and i didn't know what to do i stuck in the paris airport i didn't have a cell phone i think how am i going to get my friends to know where i am and over there was a man with a newspaper he dropped the newspaper and looked at me and it was him it was the angel that had given me a third warning it was like he was watching a couple of minutes later my friends showed up is that my guardian angel or is that that is probably one of your guardian angels we actually have more than one um sometimes they need a break so we actually do have more than one and i can tell you when you get a little bit older sometimes you do get corruption that thing on the shoulder i have felt that many times sometimes i've even seen my angel walk by and just touch my shoulder and i would just say well what is it and even either he would say something or holy spirit would say something to me even the father has come to the room and he actually just brushed my shoulder and said don't tolerate or participate anymore with things in your life uh what he meant was don't think this is before all this stuff started i still would see them i mean i saw them most of my life i don't participate with what the enemy is saying make sure you cast it down uh don't be a part and whatever you do don't help him advertise he said that to me directly don't help hell advertise by talking about things that are not right or things like that all the time so i think that's the thing they do i think messenger angels you could have seen had you not seen the same one twice the fact that you saw him twice in different places that tells me he probably is one of your guardian angels but there are messengers sometimes just sent to give us a message or a word from God and they'll do it once and then leave and then you won't see them again but you're seeing your guardian ninja yeah that's fascinating you know it scared me the first time because he was stern he said i wasn't doing something right and so i started doing it right so actually when i saw him the second time it was good to have a stern angel there because i knew he's going to take care of business which means there's another view there's a i don't know there's a follow-up from the same person or not is it okay to talk to our guardian angels now you said as a kid but i'm let's say i'm walking around and i know my guardian angels around can i say you know i i it's not a joke i've named my angel stan since he's not telling me what his name is is it okay if i say hey stan i'm glad you're here hey can i ask you a question blah blah blah or are all those supposed to be directed only to the lord okay that you can ask a question if they have permission they'll answer if they don't have permission they won't answer it but i i know actually other people that don't know their angel's name and they give them nicknames it's always okay to say because i do it on a continual basis i do know my angel's name and i'll say hey and i'll say i'll say his name i say thanks for being there for me thanks for saving my life which she's done several times uh thank you for putting up with me if i don't know what that was right uh maybe i say things not exactly i'm not talking about words from God i'm talking about just in my normal life maybe i'm not happy with somebody i say something not mean to them just say something maybe not the best thing and then i'll actually realize my angels hearing everything i'm saying and watching me and i'll say i'm sorry i said that and then sometimes i'll hear like a short laugh if i see them that they'll roll their eyes at me no i don't mean not in a good way they're kind of like you know hey so i would tell people there's coming days on the earth where because the the veil from the spirit around the physical realm is actually getting thinner and the enemy will get away with less things because people actually be seeing operations the enemy this may be several generations down the road but i do know it's going to happen but will begin to happen in that time people will see their angels and i'm sure it'll be up to God how much conversation we can have the bible says do not worship an angel right and i think people from the past because that was always passed on down don't talk to one you can't talk someone they have nothing to do with them but i happen to know in the bible in the old testament in new testament uh people in the bible had conversations with them and abraham even ate with them and i think other ones isaiah and ezekiel knows they had conversations with angels if they were sent from God and they were a scribe or a career or a messenger then you know you will know that usually if that happens but we're entering into new times of greater glory in the power of God being seen angels working alongside us is actually going to be happening and so you may end up by knowing your angel's name and i always say i say it's up to the father he made them right he made them sent us from himself so it's kind of up to him and i think that his choices are always better than ours just look forward to new things happening that haven't happened before that's really good now that that's this reminds me of a question that i once in a while have asked no i actually i've never i remember the question i remember you saying something so don't let me just jump in here years ago i heard you say that when we get to heaven our angels have some questions for us do you remember saying that and what kind of person what kind of questions do they want to ask us you got me really curious about it i never asked you one of the questions they will ask you is what were you thinking when you did that that's what i figured they'd probably have women have such amazing senses of humor and remember now they were with you if it was your garden they've been with you since uh actually since the time of conception they're there they're sent then they wait outside the mother so the minute you're born that's it their assignment starts they will be with you your whole life they are probably some of the first ones you'll see when this body dies and your spirit man steps out the probably the first one you'll see will be your guardian angel and they'll be going like this come on we gotta go i've been there when people were leaving come on no it's okay it's okay we gotta go and you're undone that you're seeing and i never forget the time that somebody was a comedian this guy was a comedian and everybody loved him but he always got kind of picked on he was a young budding comedian actually in our church and he would always wear this clown nose just to make people smile you know some of the other people didn't like it i thought it was not in the right place to do it his job was to make people smile laugh and i have to tell you this that i was not in the room when he passed he became ill people loved this person in our church and that he was still young not real young maybe in his teens by this time and uh i wasn't there but God allowed me to go into his room in the spirit and see him when he was passing and he started to pass and his little clown nose was next to him because he loved he kept it with him all the time even i think it was in icu or something and when he began to come out of his body he wasn't sure so he kind of hesitated and his angel was there he couldn't see he didn't look up to look at his angels he was tall and he could see his anger going no come on it's time to go it's going to be okay come on you got to come and find me he kind of sat up in his body which you know it died and he looks up and there is his own guardian angel wearing our clown nose this is truth this really happened the biggest grin came over this young man and although his physical remember now this angel's a spiritual being his his clown knows it's the spiritual clown noise and he opens his hand to the young man the other hand and in it was a clown nose for him to wear and he grabbed it and put it on his nose and they left in a chariot to go up to heaven and there they were together in the chair there was this guardian angel wearing the clown nose and there was he that totally threw any apprehensions out that's amazing there's his angel and i was able to tell his parents that they were so undone that God allowed me to see that but that's the relationship they really become attached to you and so they're they're grateful to God when they actually can take you home to heaven and so here's this young man not knowing what to think that he knew that he was dying he knew it but when he decided to finally sit up he looks up and there's his angel wearing that clown so i mean if he goes to heaven he shows up wearing the clown nose might he have greeted the lord with that clown nose on oh yes i wouldn't be surprised if jesus had one on himself either because jesus i will tell you what he's doing in heaven because God did let me see more about that he also was one of the camera people in our church he did mostly all the taping of people and he always made them feel at ease he'd wear his clown nose and so he was always on this the other side of the camera you know operating it in heaven he has a comedy show and he does his comedy jokes he was so funny so now he's not operating the camera he's the person doing the show and that was lord to God that even in all his life even when he went feeling well he still tried his best to make people laugh and smile so he didn't miss his destiny so he's doing a funny show in heaven right now uh wearing his clown knows that his angel gave him so and one more because this is just generating more questions for me so there's clown shows he's not the only one there must be all these places that do funny shows so are you saying that a person who's gifting an anointing on earth was a comedian and comedy are they going to come up with with humor that's going to make the lord bust a gut if i can put it that way that's going to make the lord bust up laughing absolutely because i tell you what jesus laughed a whole lot more than he ever cried on the earth he laughed he made people laugh he was captivating i mean if the sinners want to be around you you got to be pretty good right so he would captivate them with i'm sure with um revelation they never heard it before but he also made them laugh jesus loves to laugh and i'm sure that he visits these places that people have as part of his mansion this young man is part of his mansion has his whole place where he does his show everyone comes to see and they laugh and laugh and laugh and yeah you're gonna laugh in heaven but there's many places like that that's a gift now you have to understand some people well their natural mind will go to the other side there's nothing indecent there's no profanity there's nothing disgusting ever said anywhere in heaven not in the comedy shows not in any of the songs or the concerts you go to uh not and anywhere in the amusement park or anything like that that part of the devil is not there there's no darkness there so everything you have and enjoy the movies they create will never have profanity or sexual content or graphic violence in them but exciting intense funny amazing that's what's in heaven so all those comedy shows would be on that line not what most people do so good well we've got a few more minutes here um what role do the people in the bible have in heaven like moses paul peter these guys are like serious characters so maybe we're going to the other side of the serious sober profound what do they they do what do they do in heaven well i can let you know they've been there for quite a while [Laughter] the heaven culture which is joy celebration uh profound and laughter half of all of heaven is fun i have learned that the father told me that i've been to so many places profound beautiful just so undone with the beauty and splendor that like in the throne room or other places in heaven the all that is there you get that too but there's other places to go where you just laughed you just want to fall over things are so funny or fun either way they're there and so i i can promise you that everyone's going to enjoy even paul now i've seen paul many times he's always in the same garden i'm sure that garden is outside his mansion and he's sitting in different places and people are all around asking him they're always asking him questions about what it was like to be on the earth what happened in these certain situations like when he was cast into the sea you know all these things that happened to him they asked him those things but you have to understand since they got to heaven and that would include anybody abraham moses noah paul the disciples they have understood and been shown what was going on in the spirit realm all around them in their life so they have more to add than just what they saw with their eyes or experience their stories they share that's what they talk about a lot powerful things that God did for them what was going on like you know when they were ready to cross the red sea what was happening in the heavenlies what was happening in the spirit realm you see a whole new picture of that whole red sea experience the same thing with with abraham the same thing with moses they got to see all these activities that are now part of them sharing their testimonies so a lot of them that's what they do and paul actually still makes beautiful things with fabrics because that was a natural gift he was given he makes banners he makes beautiful things to hang in your mansion uh that was what did you say he made he makes what he makes what paul was a tent maker yeah what did he make you said he makes something else yeah people like in the church right now they have flags and they'll wave them to the glory of God well in heaven whatever you create on that banner comes to life let's say paul who's such an artisan with fabrics and and and colors he was on the earth and he was part of a group that did that so in heaven you can go visit this mansion and order certain things to be made that you've always wanted even like robes to wear and stuff like that and he is such an amazing artisan with fabric he'll make some things on purpose that people come and say i want a new flag we're going to all worship in the throne room together me and my friends so we would like to have beautiful flags like with lions on them roaring or eagles and when they start to run in the throne the lion's head comes off the flag and begins to roar wow flying off the flag fly around the fly back under the flag it's heaven it's heaven and so everyone even they were on the earth if they had a natural thing they did as a living besides being a disciple or a prophet or something that is a natural gift and God doesn't take that that gift from yourself amazing that's right now i uh a question popped into my head i'm gonna ask this one and one more my my questions go forever so i assume in my head so um someone goes to a comedy show let's say they go see robin williams because you've seen robin williams in heaven yeah and let's look at his mention and let's say three or four friends said let's go see robin at his place and watch one of the shows okay so they go to see it it's hilarious they split the gut they're laughing and laughing okay now afterwards do those fork would those four maybe say that was a great show let's us four go out to eat absolutely yes the biggest thing they do in heaven of course is worship even greater than what we thought on the earth i don't we don't have time for it to be going to all the forms of worship people do in heaven the second most thing done the most is fellowshipping and you absolutely would be welcome to go out either robin williams would make stuff in his own place for you to just stay there and fellowship or there's favorite places because people guess what have gifts there's people who are chefs who are bakers they have amazing bakeries and stuff all over heaven none of it costs anything and yes a lot of them have their favorite place and robin would say to these people especially if they just got there i got a favorite place they go come on they'll make room for us really really yes and then you would get to go and talk with him and get to know more of him uh where he will have no more fear he robin williams and most comedians need to be aware of this the enemy will hit you with depression don't keep that depression you lose that depression or oppression lose it from your soul because he actually would go to retreats and stuff like that to get help with that with that in his life but he's free now and he doesn't have any now but the enemy hates laughter and anyone who helps to produce that he's going to try to to get them pulled off the track or keep them oppressed and i know several other comedians that face they've even said they did so they need to know they can be free of any of that but he didn't have any up there so he absolutely would invite them to go to his own favorite restaurant and say yeah let's go here you know they got the best barbecue they got the best pizza there's an italian restaurant i love we need to go there and because people go home to heaven every day and they get to use that gift and sometimes it's a baker sometimes it's all kinds of different things they invite you to go and see things be a part of things but especially eating when there's no weight gain no food allergies and if you listen to people's and these people have amazing gifts to make this delicious food they'll serve you with a smile they'll have entertainment while they're there and i like to add this just because it's funny people get taken out all the time they celebrate not just your birthday on theirs they celebrate the day you or time that you came home to heaven really like a birthday even though they don't keep dates they kind of know when to happen they celebrate i say come on we're all going to go out and celebrate uh you know it's been a while since you came and wanted to celebrate your homecoming here and they have these funny and i had to say this in a straight church it was the craziest thing ever this is what God does to me you have to tell them about the greeter squirrels the greed greeter squirrels and then i was caught up standing at the platform and shown these people celebrating somebody's uh homecoming and these squirrels came running in on their table and they had top hats and canes they began to sing and dance to this person you know who was celebrating them it was absolutely the most hilarious thing i've ever seen and so it's different than having a birthday card there trust me and so they do that and i've seen them several times in heaven so you get to laugh and have enjoyment even if you're eating somebody it's not going to be normal no matter how not at all okay so last question i i've never heard anyone ask this because we're not married we don't date in heaven but you said we're best friends with our uh why of course that's easier in a picture if there's only one wife if someone's been married multiple times that's i can't i can't figure that one out but uh but the question is that someone asked me is are couples now i don't think there are couples per se they said are couples able to dance so that's the question well i will that'll be two different answers this is why this is alone because i have so much detail but it helps to understand God wants him to understand with detail uh there aren't couples like you're dating like they do down here you will have best friends always whether whether you were best friends on the earth or became best friends in heaven you you like to spend time with other people certain people sometimes sometimes you were married if you were married three times guess what you got three best friends that's the way it happens there's no jealousy no coveting like you don't have the right blah blah blah blah they don't happen up there people so happy to be there but the thing about the dancing jesus holds these huge celebrations in his own mansion and people go why would jesus have one because he had to live as a human people he deserves it he has his own mansion and he's got this massive ballroom people dress up in these amazing outfits that he provides and yes they dance all over in in in his ballroom and sometimes this couples together sometimes it's it's sort of like the greek kind of dances you know they do in greece all the men gonna lock arms and they do the little greek thing like they sweep one they do that right there is dancing in heaven and you will so enjoy it's exciting it's fun it's beautiful so there's nothing on this earth although you think you will miss it you probably won't give it a second thought when you get up there and and if you have family members and friends make sure you pray for their salvation that they will make it to heaven and you will do the most important thing you can on the earth pray and declare that your family member will come to know jesus christ they'll become a they won't listen to destiny they'll become a living testimony of the saving power of jesus christ whether you are aware of that now or you see them when you get to heaven but there's such greater more beautiful fun things there than you could ever imagine and that same God who provides all that for you right now has his eyes on this world he's about to change many things for him and for other countries in this world that people can laugh and dance in the streets again because God is about to crush a lot of the plans of the enemy that's so good that's so good kat that's always amazing it's amazing amazing well let me let me just drill that let me give you give me another minute so this person is saying uh my husband my ex my former husband and i are best friends in heaven we go to the ball that the lord has thrown i can dance with him at the ball is that what you're saying yes good wow that's going to make a lot of people excited i think for heaven but it's no jealousy no impurity no desire in the flesh i have to add all that because people thinking wow i'll have all these different emotions and stuff going on you'll have joy and excitement and probably not much beyond that about that is so much fun it's about joining excitement is not being physically attached you don't have physical desires okay you have friendship desires fun you want to have fun together yes and if you go in a group everybody can dance with each other at these big events but there's none of this like wow we need to get engaged you know we need to get married that thought doesn't even come to your head because everyone there is in love with jesus christ but you can have friendships you can have special friendships people you like their company you laugh you know friends can all go do things together and i know i have a huge family like 150 family members stop counting at that like we just stopped counting after a while about something and so my dad worked there probably getting his big ranch ready for everyone as they come up there to be welcomed once you leave the throne room you go to your own mansion and all of your family and friends will be there to celebrate with you there also so they celebrate all over heaven heaven is probably the chief celebrating place there is in existence and that's what God keeps saying not that we're not you're not ignorant of what's going on but you're innocent of any of that stuff so guess what God's got things and the people he needs to handle these things that are going to happen probably aren't things you can physically be involved with that just stay in prayer and keep thinking God you have a plan we're here for your plan and we're going to stand with you we know that your promises are true and that's why he keeps saying celebrate like it's already happening that's so so good tell people how they can get your tell people how they can get your book or books and you've got at least two websites tell them that okay yeah i have revealingheaven.com which is uh that's what the father called my book he said to call your books revealing heaven and i have i have two i've gotten out there number three still in the process it might be a while for that's done uh revealing heaven is a really good title for the books that's what happens you get heaven revealed to you places i've been to what happened when i was there what happened with people when i came back and shared about their family members i saw there are in those books and uh so revealinghaven.com is a website where you can buy products things like this i don't do demons cup right here so yeah that tells the devil putting up with him and so we we create things that represent heaven or statements are saying in heaven and that's revealing heaven.com you also find out about the events there and then Kerr.com that's k-a-t-k-e-r-r dot com is a spiritual platform where you can be trained in many things how to pray for your family how to lose stuff from your soul to be free from that stuff i think it talks about heaven's army we're going to be updating that there's probably like 30 some interviews that are on there from people who interview me and then a lot of content there's images on there and other things that God has to say about stuff it is the only place now and i keep telling people this i don't have other places that you can give it to me online it's online KatKerr.com you click on the treasury and then it shows you how you can do that if you desire to do that i don't ask for money in any other form so these fake facebooks or fake youtubes out there they tell you i'm asking you for money oh this missionary needs money send it on to me and i'll give it to him i don't do that those are fake places trying to get your money theKatker.com is where you would go to find out about those things so good thank you Kat thank you thank you thank you again and a reminder for those of you who can donate there's a slide at the end of our uh presentation it shows you a link that you can do that helps us a lot uh timothy dixon is thursday and thursday that's thursday the normal time and then manuel johnson is thursday afternoon lots and

show or during the show on a different tab you just there's a clickable link under there to the right summit and you can go on that it's going to be really epic so i'm pretty pretty excited about that so one we want to remind you quickly that three years ago we began developing a purposeful competitor to facebook where believers can say what they want it's called zap but there are tens of thousands already on there you should join it so without further ado i'm going to play this a 60-second commercial for you so you can see how it goes so go ahead and play [Music] [Music] i love that commercial chapter that jeff is our uh jeff and warren do the online engineering jeff put that together uh he's got some real clever ideas we're gonna do some more clever stuff coming up that will you'll enjoy the different kinds of commercials we'll run for that but you can say what you want you can talk about plan against planned parenthood we're not going to um block you you can talk about pro-life we're not going to block you uh so this is christian owned my wife and i own it it's will allow anyone on it as long as they're respectful but uh it's christian owned and christian friendly so that's what we want to emphasize there one quick word of knowledge or actually two the lord is giving two of you an opportunity to ask a question to kat live she doesn't even know that i'm doing this but this morning in prayer this picture came up before me so i'm just going to tell you if this if this uh applies to you if you're this person then you need to go on the eve of the chat um on um youtube off to the right i think it's up to the right or on facebook we'll be watching for you if you say i'm that person and this is my question for Kat then they'll let me know by my screen so i saw a young woman in their 20s or 30s and you had a light blue jacket it looked like what you'd wear on the ski slopes a nice light or baby blue kind of a jacket there was a beanie cap on i think it was a little darker color i i saw what i felt like was a blonde or blondish hair um and i also saw if that applies to you you're either wearing that now or you just had that on or you're getting ready to go somewhere like that this person also i saw sometimes does a youtube like this i don't know if it's your family and friends or if it's a larger show but if that applies to you pop in there and say i'm that person here's my question for Kat and we'll ask Kat today live if you're on during the live show if you get this in a recording we won't be able to do that the other one i assume is a different person it might be the same person is a person whose first name is lisa spelled l-e-e-s-a and the specific thing i heard about you was you didn't want your location or your last name uh ever mentioned and that's one of the reasons why you haven't asked a question before the lord knows that so say i'm that lisa don't say my name or location here's my question for Kat and if one of you answers that or a couple of you feel like that's you they'll type it in and i'll be able to ask Kat all right without further ado let's bring in kat Kerr here here she hey kat how are you doing today oh i'm doing great how are you feeling so good we got a little bit late start but that's okay it doesn't matter if we're late it only matters if we're on time and right on time so that's right Kat um i guess we'll start we'll start like we always do the lord gives you some stuff to say about the climate the government the elections trump whatever so share your heart as long as you want and then when you're all done with that we'll go into questions about heaven so the pleasure i want to go back just a little bit when the weather warriors were speaking against the three earthquakes i think they happened somewhere off the coast of new zealand and it was going to affect the hawaiian islands and i think the samoan islands i think this was not too long ago and one of those earthquakes within i think six hours three major earthquakes happened off the coast of new zealand one was at 8.1 and they began they began to speak about the tsunami that was soon to follow they said that it would hit any or all these islands really hard and so we went on and did a weather warriors um broadcast and we have maybe 4 000 people now that are a part of that from all over the world we all speak against destructive weather and we did it we were on for about 20 minutes explaining about i think we also talked about something that was in the indian ocean like a cyclone or something but the major thing was the earthquakes because earthquakes if they're severe under the ocean a wave begins to form as a result of the earth being unsettled and the plates moving the place of the earth it causes major tsunamis that can be several hundred feet high and they travel under the water and then they'll hit that first land mass they come to and sometimes can wipe out like whole islands and we begin to speak against it because you know christ stopped the storm um and let me tell you what it worked when we spoke in jesus name we took authority over the destructive results of the earthquake we said we would not tolerate the tsunami it would do no damage there wouldn't even be one there and let me tell you people were of course saying not nice things to us as we were broadcasting within two hours they had already put warnings out to those three major places to new zealand to the hawaiian islands and i think the other one was the samoan islands but um they had already put warnings that this was going to happen within two hours of the broadcast they canceled the warning to the hawaiian islands within two hours we were getting results back from people in hawaii and they said they've already canceled the tsunami warning they can't find any evidence of even forming and guess what eventually the new zealand uh came in and said no they have minimized what they're saying it will affect although they were still looking for the wave it never came and i know the next day we had a report that said there was a meteorologist in that whole area that said they they're trying to figure it out in their head never in the history of american meteorology since they've been tracking um earthquakes and tsunamis never has that happened that that an earthquake that major never caused a tsunami the tsunami so there's absolutely power in agreement when you believe in God that is so incredible i've i've heard people speak against that and part of some we our apologies to the people can't see me and we also have a delay so every once in a while i accidentally interrupt her and i don't mean to do that but she doesn't see me and we have this delay so we try not to i try not to interrupt her but i did want to say that um some people have spoken against doing that kind of thing and kev is exactly right jesus calmed the storm and he was our our example he said greater works will you do than i've done so these are the greater works so yeah we got we got some great evidence from the they saved the broadcast of the meteorologist and we'll just keep them uh stored but we've really been kind of keeping track of the different things whether it's hurricanes tsunamis cyclones we've spoken against fires at different times even the arctic thing that i know we know that hank had said that the snow would come and it would mean purification all that that did happen and it was fine for the snow to come but you know what we don't have to be putting up with the devil who gets in these weather systems and he can do it he's the prince and power of the ear and bring destruction and so we did and even some of the prayers against destruction through that arctic wave made a difference some people's electricity was on right away some areas didn't have it as bad because those people had really great faith uh in those areas people need to start standing up and doing what christ did so anyway that was one that was awesome how uh that what came out about that there was no destruction from a tsunami so oh so so good well what is it we're showing you about our government these days you mean the insanity of the fake government because i'm still the insanity of the fake government is what everybody would be living by if God wasn't going to do something and God's still telling me the same thing you did on november the 4th when you were a witness of those words God said the father said that when the ground begins to shake and shake watch for the landslide of fraud to begin and he said the fraud would be detailed it would be horrific the things that we'd find out what the left was doing and all those were involved not just here in america but around the world to take over our country to interfere with the elections to conspire to come against america and our president donald trump and i can tell you what all the stuff that he said they would be found doing we're finding out they're doing that and if you can't tell by his uh fake regulations which he has no power to make because let me tell you our military know about the election fraud they know everything that went on they already know that they're guilty the military is still in the hands of our president donald trump right now i know that there are plans going on behind the scenes but i do want to say this here in america where we are a free country we're a democracy and even though somebody cheated and stole and they're sitting illegally in that spot as the highest person in the land they're pretty lousy at it because they're supposed to already have given a state of the union address they're not doing it i think they're afraid they don't even know what to say never in the history of our country from a presidential election has it taken it's i think they said over 48 days not one word from them about what our what the condition of the country is is because they're afraid they're afraid i can tell you a radical probably redneck radical group not a leftist one the ones in the right who are sick and tired of all the stuff going on up there and they're not putting up with it have already started to come against the ones behind the barbed wire in the capitol building and they were going to try to do a takeover in a good way okay they were going to take our country back and they were talked to i'm not sure who talked to this head of this group to please not do that don't try to bring their own group against them uh they didn't want anybody to be harmed so they decided to step back for a while but they left their vehicles i don't know what kind of vehicles vans what it was filled with dynamite and stuff right there i mean the evidence was left for them behind the barbed wire that they're fed up with that with a defilement and with the illegal regulations and laws they're trying to make as dictators this really did happen and so they found they they left the evidence like we're tired of this we're real serious about this so the first real attempt about taking it back on their own uh this group who's who got themselves together uh they're tired of it and i'm telling you i don't think it'd be much longer when that begins to happen more and more uh people on their own saying we're not taking this we're not living by these laws and i can tell you over 20 some states i don't know which ones they are i saw the report over 20 some states have sent information to those behind the barbed wire they're not living by a single regulation illegal regulation most of those laws they're trying to make without due process you know when um whenever a president makes a a recommendation for a new law to put forth there is a process that goes through there are councils that have to look at some of it has to be voted on they're ignoring every bit of it and acting like they're they're they're you know they're ruling as a tyrant and they expect everyone to bow down and just roll over they're not doing it so we've got 20 some states saying we're not taking it we're not living by it oh i may as well add this there's mask mask you know the mask right winning parties everywhere because people in different states are saying not just a few people a lot of them this has been a year we've had it with a mask we've had it with the social distance they're having mass burning parties wow you can see them online different places so i've talked to a lot of people right here in my own city and they've had it with the mass stuff they're gone i've noticed some of the buildings and the businesses taking the sign off the door and i do know this also um i'll pause for a minute in case you have a comment to make before i continue do you have anything did you say i was i was going to say that you know we just went to ohio to see my mom because she's getting quite up there in age 87 and so it was kind of a traumatic trip because she's not doing that well but i had to wear i've never flown anywhere during this pandemic or supposed pandemic whatever because i just don't want to wear a mask the whole time but we did and one time i kind of fell asleep and i left my mask on the airline dropped down and said my nose the tip of my nose was sticking out out of the mask and i got tapped on the shoulder and woken up put your mask up here and i'm thinking really because when we breathe out that air is not going nowhere it's going out of the mask into the air where do they think the air is going if you have your mask on it's going out of the mask into the cabin so how is this going to stop that it's not if people have lost their minds that make up these rules yeah they have and i think because no one is quite sure what it's going to do because we do know a lot of it has been made up uh it's still a part of the left trying to control everybody if you don't know that by now i think most people have figured that out they want us to social distance it isn't about the the virus which is not a disease by the way it's not a disease it's not a plague it's a virus it doesn't affect mostly 90 of the population is not in any way affected by it but the left is using it because they want to keep us away from each other seriously and we're better together we're not better apart there's still ways you can make sure you know that if you don't have symptoms or what all that people are mostly careful anyway but some states like texas finally made the statement we're not doing it anymore we're over with the masquerade is what they call that they're not wearing masks there they're not requiring people to wear a mask they're not requiring social distancing and guess what they're doing just fine with that i agree that if people want to protect yourself yes let them wear a mask but i also agree with if there's nothing wrong with you and you don't want that you shouldn't have to do it and i think that whole thing is coming to a spiraling end because guess what the americans are doing it their self like i said we're a free country you can't take this is the craziest thing i'll say the most unintelligent thing since i'll try to be kinder um the most intelligent thing they've ever tried to do was you can't go in as communist agenda and take over a free country not with millions of people loving their freedom uh wanting their freedom you're the ones who will be hurt you're the ones who will lose those who's trying to do that they're finding out more and more every day and i will say this one more thing the new york times himself have blasted the b person the fake president they blasted him for all the illegal things they were doing with the laws which shocked and irritated him i think they said angered was the word they use because the new york times was saying there's no there's ways you're supposed to do this and where you can't do this and you cannot just make a law yourself it has to go through due process we don't like it that you're doing this so you need to check yourself out and see what you're doing these people not just voted for him they supported him through the whole um campaign and so they're not the only ones doing it fox news is starting to step up fox news actually hired somebody who is part of trump's campaign one of the speakers for trump's campaign and she is blasting that whole fake agenda that defiling agenda they're trying to come up with uh behind the behind the barbed wire in the capitol building uh yeah they don't like it either this is what they're realizing what we have said all along if you don't stop them if you're for them you'll lose everything your networks your businesses your newspapers you're going to lose your property they have no plan to prosper america that's not their plan okay that's not their agenda and more and more we will find out really how wicked and evil they are with the agendas and the laws that they've been trying to make but these people we the people aren't taking it there's also suing their state suing them they're suing mr b up there behind the capitol in the capitol building suing him for making illegal stuff so america's starting to wake up and say we're not taking this you know and when people we weren't alive when this all went down when the british were tax taxing us and it was taxation without representation in other words you will pay the money we tell you to pay but you don't get represented your voice is not heard you will do what we tell you to do and get started the revolutionary war from which came the united states of america so there's nothing ill-religious or sacrilegious or unchrist-like when we say enough is enough you know with christ we stand against here it's tyranny it's one nation under God not one nation under satan okay and i don't mind saying that at all but i do know and i'm connected with groups that do know things are going to be happening and again i don't have a date i just can tell you this God has never changed what he said the fraud will be exposed they will all be brought to justice not their justice but real justice and things will be removed people lose their seats their properties their homes or go to prison it's all going to happen people uh you can't be ignorant of things you can be innocent we're innocent not ignorant but i can tell you God who this country belongs to is not tolerating the stuff that they're planning to do especially since a lot of it comes against children i'm just saying in the in the weeks ahead you better keep your eyes and ears open because you know what that celebration is going to be happening and it's going to be powerful that's so good it's such good news and you know we hang around with the prophets we hang around with each other mostly online of course that we're all hearing the same thing we're all feeling and sensing the same thing we get it in our own ways in our own verbage because God speaks to everybody differently but we're all hearing the same thing this is about over you know or it's not over is another way to say it this is not over at all so well um anything else you want to add before we go into questions about heaven i want to make sure i don't cut anything off one one more thing and that is as far as i can understand and the information i have received georgia has finally got i don't know if they got who they got permission from or how that happened but they're actually supposed to be recounting single ballot in the state of georgia and we all know that was one of the swing states so let's see what happens with that that's good yeah all those things is a lot of people thought this was dead and i thought all of those battles were probably dead weeks and weeks ago and yet they keep reviving because there's a trump is a fighter his people are fighters and uh probably the single most common question and this is this is going to bridge because people keep asking me a Kat question but it's about this word about pence what do you say now or what is God showing you about pence is he the good guy or the bad guy he's not saying anything to me about pets i think that's probably going to have to come from trump himself or pass himself and i think it will i think we will know and i i do want to say this from the beginning of time before the earth was made actually before the earth was made our God he had a plan for all of us all those who he would send from himself to live on this earth he had a plan for all of us and some people actually have a commission some have a calling some even have an anointing to do something but they still have to say yes because they're humans sometimes people change their mind either they're in either their uh you know they're being um controlled by people which we do know and have found out that some of the people who stepped back were threatened by death and i don't mind saying that either uh some people some are political figures some are business figures figure somewhere all kinds of people if they were a threat against the left and they had a voice to speak many even some of the prophets were threatened with death and we do know that for a fact so sometimes we may not know to this whole thing comes out and all that justice stuff happens i think those people will come forth and actually give a testimony about that happening but some were um and so that probably maybe encouraged them or maybe force them to say something against somebody that maybe against the president or somebody that they were standing for i do know something did i don't know what pence's case was i know people who know them and know that they're very close pence and trump are very close they have been very close and uh pence was being groomed also to be president um after trump i do know that is a fact and that's even from God himself but like i said God calls people sometimes they say yes sometimes they change their mind we cannot control human nature i just know what God's plans are i will say this trump is our president right now because he won the election all of our military know that and uh so i know that one is for sure that will have to be something figured out even even because if we find out it's a covert thing which that could be a possibility or for whatever reason but i think that will probably come we won't know until trump or pence say something and neither one of them are saying anything right now because of things still going on behind the scenes that we don't know about wow well good uh um if you're ready for some questions there on heaven i'm ready to ask um this is really interesting to see if i can pull up this other one um i had a question i'm just gonna blend it together because i woke up this morning and i thought i'm going to ask i have hundreds of questions don't get me wrong but i thought there's some questions that are not being asked that i want to have asked for myself and so i i wrote down i got my laptop i'm still sitting in bed and i wrote this down and no sooner did i come up with this question thinking no one had ever asked this question then a man wrote and asked this question this morning or it gave me this morning so the question is if we like to read and i'm not as a voracious reader like some people my wife loves to read read read if a person likes to read will will they be reading in heaven and if they'll be reading in heaven what will they be reading and that then begs the question will other people be there and write books that other people will read in heaven um i think both of those are yes absolutely i've i've been to well they have the hall of knowledge they have the library of the scrolls i mean there's all kinds of ways people could write in heaven if that's their gift it's not going to stop when they get there i'ma for instance i'm a photographer that's my passion that's what he made me when he sent me here i'm a photographer i already know i'll have studios in heaven i'll do photography in heaven and i know if someone's an author they'll write books in heaven now let's say they wrote books that weren't so nice they got born again they've got to have them they'll write books but they won't have any some of the maybe the colorful language won't be in there or just say profanity nothing in heaven not the movies not the cartoons not the videos kids play not any books not anything they have no profanity no sexuality they have no graphic violence in them because that's part of the darkness and there's no darkness in heaven but the intensity the excitement the amazing things the the wonder that are in some books people will read books but they have two ways they can do that you can either just go get one off of a shelf or if you meet an author they'll have them available for everybody for free because nothing costs anything in heaven some books you will take that book and open it and when you do you'll see a hologram and you watch you will watch what's in the book you don't have to read it if you don't want to and so that's another way that you can still see an author's work in heaven that's really really good now awesome that's really that answers that question um so i haven't you had said that heaven was like 50 fun which means doing whatever playing sports uh good uh going to the amusement park the anointed christ-oriented amusement park and and then the other 50 was worship so my other question related to that is what percentage of time would you guess people are in their own mansions versus out and about for lack of a better word because and that might that the follow-up question is i'm not so much a loner but i know people who love alone time they like to be with the group and then they love to be alone for a season of time and will that person still love to be with people and then feel that need to be alone because that's the way they were on earth i think that it says you'll be known as you are known in the bible i think your personality gets enhanced in heaven i do know that your gifts are enhanced they they're greater even than they were on the earth i think people who like to still have some alone time absolutely can have alone time if you want a long time with God though you can just go be with him it's not like you have to sit alone somewhere hoping you'll hear him i know people go somewhere they want to meditate on God or meditate on the word you live it you live that kind of life in heaven and the thing about worship is it's 50 fun 50 percent um splendor and wonder and part of the splendor is the worship the worship is called living worship in heaven everywhere you go when you see what he has made for those in heaven when you see what he has blessed those or rewarded those in heaven you will always worship him the worship in the throne is a whole separate event in the throne room like there's no time and let me tell you that is wonder and splendor you begin to worship you're caught up off the floor in the throne room you can worship in the sky of heaven no matter where you are and you're worshiping in heaven with everything the trees the flowers the ground the pebbles of the creatures it's like waves of worship everywhere i think that's probably a better way to say it but the splendor and the wonder could be just standing before his throne seeing life coming in and out of him uh seeing uh the glory coming from him the seraphim who dipped down out of the glory cloud over the throne in in heaven and their hair is on fire with their passion for him it's something like you'll never forget people love to be there especially when they first come sometimes their family members will finally come and say can we all go see your mansion you haven't you don't see your mansion first you go to the throne room first where you're welcomed by the father christ walks you back up the steps there's quite a few steps going up to the throne and he gives you back says father i have brought back your son or your daughter whichever one it is and then the father greets you he'll hold you he gives you rewards right there that time for what you've done in your life on the earth and then he has more in your mansion or around your mansion it's like it's this unending love and uh it's something it's really almost hard to explain but the wonder some place there's places you've made just for wonder the amazement that rolls over you and waves when you go into certain areas and see what God has designed just to enjoy the beauty of his creativity it's it doesn't end so it's wonder splendor and 50 fun that's really the way it is so no one living in heaven is sad no one has any regrets there's no jealousy no coveting no anger uh there's no um um you know nobody feels small or little or forgotten no one's rejected in heaven it's the place everybody should want to go when you leave this earth you move okay you don't stop existing your body is here sleeping but you the real you that steps out of this body looks like you but better it's you but you look younger you look better that lives forever and you live a real life in heaven it's a literal life you walk the ground you smell the flowers you taste the food you live in your mansion and the other part of that question i was asked was if you want to be alone time do you want to still be alone well part of that yes because that's you but let me tell you most people are not in their mansions most people are out going all over heaven going on tours of heaven with family with friends sometimes the prophets invite you to come to their places i mean there's shows being put on everywhere and having extravagant beautiful shows some are worshipped some are for fun so people are always going places in heaven wow so well you know that that another woman wrote this question i had the same one written down it's hard for me to visualize a mansion without a what we call a bedroom and then a bedroom has a bed is there no sleep nobody says i'm just going to go and lay down and have some r and r with the lord or do beds not exist in heaven at all i know this for fat because he's your father he loves what you love he will create bedrooms for some people just because in their mind and in their heart they always pictured having some glorious kind of a bedroom with some special kind of a bed you'll sit on that you'll recline maybe maybe you'll be reading or watching things on in these video books or whatever mostly people have things to recline on i wouldn't say it's like a bed bed it's probably more something you would recline against you've seen some of those beautiful i don't even know what they call them like they have a back and they come down like that mostly people would have a room to meditate in to if they want quiet time it'd be hard to have quiet time your angels there talking to you all the time really i don't want to take you places but there's beautiful places like butterfly meadow uh the friendly forest the valley of the falls where people love to go and just enjoy the beauty that's there uh i think people who even didn't want to be around people will fall in love with people in heaven everybody likes to be together and do things together now you just said your angels would visit i don't think i've ever heard you talk about that are you saying our angel stays with us forever is your angel always with you i don't know that they stay with you forever they spend time with you they'll come in and out just to say hi and uh because they're you know they have a special connection with you they've been with you since well since the time you actually were conceived they were sent to wait outside the mother to watch over you from that moment they're with you except the times they get a break to go to heaven and you most people have at least two because they do get a break to go back to heaven not from you but you know what they're connected and they're with you they're the ones who the first ones you'll probably see when you when you pass when your heart stops when your brain stops and you step out of this body usually the first one you see is your actual guardian angels and they will escort you to heaven in many different ways and then they'll take you into the throne room and then you will from that moment jesus will take you and be with you for quite a while and then you'll be with the father then you'll be with everyone in the throne room then you go back to your own mansion and see it for the first time your angel will come for that because your angel will want to see the expression on your face and see what you have yeah so it's not like they live with you forever but they'll definitely be coming to spend some different time with you so good now um i've heard a lot of people say they've read books on heaven this person went and then they went on a visit they wrote a book about it but when they came back they they went through a period of almost depression because it was so dark on this earth compared to heaven and so i keep being asked this question this ask Kat how come she does she feel that way does she feel at first depressed or if not why don't you when others do i was given a commission i don't just take myself up there i'm taken all the time and so um the father and jesus put something in me they actually put their hand in me and they said we're putting something in you so you won't want to have a desire to stay now and you won't be effective when you go back because you have to share that's what my commission is to see heaven and share heaven to see the trinity to share the trinity to if they take me forward in time i have to share that back in time i have whatever i see i have to share i share what they show me or i say what they told me that is my commission and so i wouldn't be a very good ambassador for heaven if i was always dreaming to be there so i literally have something in here i love seeing it i can't wait to come back and share it so i don't experience that i do know some people that actually are i've seen him at the throne saying i don't want to go back please don't make me go back and the father would say you're here for a glimpse i'm not done with you i need you to go back and i understand about the light it's not just like the physical light like the shining on my face right now it's the light that comes from him the glorious light radiates all over it's the life of God it's the love of God and you go from that back to this earth it would seem dark the atmosphere would even the light itself is on the earth would seem much dimmer than it is in heaven and the joy also you know but you know what i live i i have as much of God every day that i want i bind every day the love and the life of God to my soul it will help to change you if you do that number one make sure you don't have any darkness lose all the darkness from your soul any fear any grief loose it off from your soul it's the keys to the kingdom and then you bind and you say i choose my will divine the life of God the love of God the presence of God his plans his will his celebration i bind it to my soul ye will not be the same person if you if you do that on a continual basis because as your soul prospers and that's what it was your soul prospered by what you put in there what you get out what you put in there your soul will begin to prosper and then you will live in hell so make sure that's what you're taking care of guard it keep the junk out make sure you let God in uh i do it all the time but i do have a commission so it makes it a little bit different for me yeah oh that's a good answer thank you for that that was very detailed and sure helped me too um so i asked this question another way but this lady's asking in a different way she said i really i understand there's no need for the sun because the God is there in heaven and i understand there's no night but she says but i love the night sky i love the moon i love the stars she says is there not anywhere in heaven we could go to see something like that absolutely yes because he made them now it is if you ever travel through the spirit realm up to heaven you would see light everywhere out there in the spirit realm physical realm is wrapped around the spiritual realm it doesn't take it away it's there okay the spirit realm is all around us that's how the angels are here that's how the other ones are here uh but i can tell you that um yes there's a place in heaven he made there's always going to be a place you go to this place called the observatory now you don't get a ticket or a pass and a picture of picturing an observatory with a big telescope that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about there's a place you entered these ancient doors i mean ancient there's no door it's just an archway you go into this beautiful place you step out and you're in the middle of the galaxies and the stars and you like it and you'll probably visit there and when you're done you just step back in it's not like i'm not saying you're stepping inside like you open the door and step right up there that's not that you're out in it and you see the beauty and the splendor of all that he made every star has light every nebula has light some you'll recognize or recognize some you will not recognize but from heaven itself the light is so great coming from the glory but in the sky of heaven in the sky there's beautiful things you see even as much light there is here he made things you can see like things that look like stars groups of stars will come and sing in the sky and they'll have faces on them there's waves of beautiful light that that come from him that he has there's times when certain parts of the sky are dimmer than normal because these waves of color that come in well they'll consume whole groups or whole mansions or whole parts of heaven and it's like a light show so you're not going to miss it i have never i've never heard anybody describe that so you're saying you you will be able to look out and see some stars that will have faces they're like we think of the man and the moon you can always see a man and then this is like stars that have faces that will sing to you is that what you just said yes yes yeah that's pretty good okay here's my question i have a bunch of prophetic friends who have already gone home to me at the lord and i have family does anything like this ever happened where some family members get together and some prophets get together and they say you know what steve's having a rough time now let's have let's have a prayer meeting and let's intercede for him does anything like that go on in heaven i'm talking of course this is i'm not just talking about myself talking about anybody does anybody have groups of people in heaven that decide to stop and intercede for them i think the intercession is totally different than it would be on this earth i think more like declarations they will make declarations over you and also uh they probably go to the places that he calls the portal it's a building it's his beautiful facilities he's made if people go to KatKerr.com i think they can see see some of those pictures or maybe even to heaven.com i think in our photo gallery we may have some there's a place called the portal that God created where people in heaven can go to they walk upstairs they look down they can see their family members on the earth they declare things over them one thing they do is every day on your birthday they'll go sing they literally will sing next to where they stay in are these beautiful vases and urns they may be like three foot four foot high some are shorter and there's petals like flower petals some are saturated with peace some are saturated with joy some are saturated with his presence some are saturated with wisdom and whatever it is that you're needing at that time they'll make declarations like let's just say i declare father that steve will have peace in his life right now i declare that you'll give him the wisdom to know what to say i declare that he will be successful in what his desire is concerning his mother i declare that he will have the very presence of God on him then they lean over and pick up beautiful these petals with wisdom or with peace and they'll throw them over this balcony and if you're if you're real sensitive i feel like every time one of my family members usually my dad i'll feel the peace of God come over me in ways that really the peace that surpasses all understanding are real these petals of peace and they will throw them over you and you begin to be consumed with peace even in the midst of situations yes they don't forget you they know what you're kind of going through but it doesn't pierce them like great sadness or grief does not come over them they can see the activities of the holy spirit they can see the angels already around you and beginning to be involved in the situation like they could they could take and go to your mother and release the life of God on her if you've got people praying for you sometimes he'll send angels will be sent on assignment to impart peace or even joy when there wasn't any they'll bring that to that situation so that's what i mean when it's a different life to be up there but certainly people are going to say things for you over you wow wow now i have a question from christy she may be one that i gave a word of knowledge to she has two quick questions one is she says i'm a violinist so i was wondering about a heavenly orchestra are there heavenly orchestras where she might play the violin absolutely yes i actually within my second or third encounter i had in heaven i was actually taken to see their or their orchestra their symphonic orchestra they had people playing the instruments they had people singing it was the most glorious glorious thing the one thing that was different that really surprised me and i actually got to share this at some of the intercessors at bethel very soon after that i got to visit bethel i wasn't invited by them to come and speak some of the intercessors brought me there just to share heaven with them and something i actually gave is a tip to somebody there um the ones who you know they have a maestro right who's usually there like this and what they're encouraging the people to play at different tones or different times i i'm not really musical at all but i understand that's how that happens you know who the ones are they're actually directing this orchestra it's the artist this is really going to get you really all of the orchestra was standing like the orchestra if i was an artist and i was leading this symphonic or this uh whatever it was that they were doing singing concert or whatever i would be here with my easel in front of me and what i painted as the artist would be what they played on their instrument that's incredible but the thing is this we do it backwards down here we'll have beautiful uh worship and we'll invite artists to come and paint you know down here everyone's up here and they're all singing down here the artist painting what they're hearing it's the opposite in heaven what you paint as an artist that orchestra will sing and play wow so yeah in order to do to be doing it like heaven the the worship people would stop stop and wait to see what the artist was going to paint and then they would go interesting okay here's our next second question since my mom has symptoms that move around her body and just plague her we do all the declaring and all of that what else she's asking what else can she do she doesn't say which symptoms they are she just says he has symptoms it would depend on what that was if it's activity the enemy that would be one thing you would do if it's actual like medical things affecting her body physically it i would have to know if it was a spiritual thing or a physical thing and maybe they don't know the first thing i would do is i would actually come together and ask God show me what it is make sure you're asking that and sometimes you'll just hear him say it this is just an attack of the enemy this is something that's not actually physically wrong with her take authority over that in jesus name and cast the enemy out of the situation i would totally do that first if if i know any number of calls i'll say well i'm taking authority i'm laying the phone on their body literally i haven't put the phone out really yeah you can send things in the spirit realm you can send it you can send the lightning power of God that destroys any operations of the enemy in somebody's life that's what john g lake did he operate in the lightning power of God but see most of the body don't know this you can also release the anointing you carry that breaks every yoke of darkness so if they're there with her you release the anointing you carry first john 2 27 when you receive jesus christ as your savior you get a deposit of the anointing the anointing breaks every yoke every yoke of what whether it's sickness whether it's grief whether it's laugh whether it's poverty where it's fear it breaks the yolk of the enemy that's trying to bring that on you there's so many different things that that could mean but for sure make sure you take spiritual authority a spiritual authority over anything that might be doing that to convince them there's something wrong with them and then after that lay hands on their body or teach them if they're a believer they carry the anointing they carry it their self i would say lay your hand on on the person if the christians say uh have them say i choose to have the anointing stirred up in me they can every time it happens they can say let's say a pain hits here i release the anointing to break the yoke of darkness trying to attack my arm it moves over here i release the anointing the anointing breaks the yolk now this might sound extreme but this is the way we actually should be living i'm not saying don't go to your doctor that's what you have peace to do do it but make sure you're taking authority over it yourself so good so so so good yeah and i remember hearing uh even years ago in my prophetic training they would say and this was this wasn't even just discerning it was saying with knowledge if something is always moving around it's probably a demonic thing as opposed to medical condition so that you would go there first if something's moving around but discerning is even better so some people walk in the room and know exactly what it is yeah so if you if you don't hear anything i would totally dislike like what steve said a lot of times if something is literally moving around especially if you feel it moving around make sure you cast out every evil spirit attacking you trying to affect you in jesus name commanded to go we have been given power over the enemy to cast out devils if the person who's sick is too weak get people in there who know how to take authority they don't have to be in our deliverance team or something they know their authority in christ they know that we've been given that and have them go with them lay hands on her and cast out every evil spirit that's trying to attack her in any way and make sure this is the last thing make sure there's no doors being open in that place to let something in if someone in that home is watching extreme violence that gives a right for the enemy to bring violence in there i'm serious about that if you want to inspect yourself that's extreme i i tell people a television a computer your screen on your phone those are portals for things to come in and if you watch the wrong thing you yourself are allowing things to enter into the place where you live to affect you so make sure you cast all that junk out and like steve said take authority over the enemy first and that might eliminate it all together yeah that reminds me of uh in jennifer eva's book which um i endorsed that book she's become a good friend she's a seer as you are um and so she and she can feel things so there was this guy that couldn't get set free from whatever it was i don't remember what the condition is she walks in his house and immediately feels something dark back there he goes back in the back with his permission goes into his closet pulls out a stack of heavy metal records that are filled with violence and sex and she says here's your problem right here he disposed of those and the condition went away so that's what Kat means is get rid of stuff that's that's welcoming in your home yeah whenever you don't ever ever have any palm reading stuff don't have crystal balls do not have a ouija boards don't have anything that has witchcraft in it even um pokemon is a spirit of violence and i will give this as our own true testimony we when we move if we move we we cleanse the entire place we're moving into if we didn't have that built we have it cleansed we look around for anything left behind and when we moved in and we we love each other but we started this was maybe 10 years ago we started fighting with each other maybe 15 years ago we were bickering and finding continuing said okay stop we're stopping we're going to go and look everywhere we can to see what's there and so everybody want everyone they were empty and somebody went in this child's closet and in the in the um what do you call the footboard that goes around i don't know what you call it yeah the wall board or something that put yeah molding was stuck one pokemon card one one that was the one thing that was causing us all to war because in that cartoon thing they wore that's what pokemon does it wars against other ones to see who has greater power and so that's not a good thing to have we burned that card outside we took communion and we poured on the ground outside to cleanse the whole place it never happened again isn't that amazing and sometimes i'll tell you this story real quick a 30-second version of it i had a dream with there was a demon around the back side of my walk-through closet he was hiding in behind the clothes and so rather than doing anything about it i called my friend paul who is a seer and he can feel he helps me over the phone so i said i'm going to walk through some place and i'm going to see what you feel and and so i walked through and i put my hand right close to the clothes he goes there's nothing there steve and without telling him i went like this i put my hand about 12 inches with this further right into where i've seen the demon in my dream he goes ooh what's that i said well that's what i just saw in my dream he said well tell him to leave every time i've ever used him and you need to identify something that i knew was there he says tell it to leave which is kind of like crazy just tell it to get out of there i'm thinking i'm waiting for some sort of magic formula no he said tell it to get out it says we have the ability to cast out demons that doesn't just mean any person that means in places too and i'll come back sometimes and there's been visitors here other stuff going on and i'll feed them feel the presence of something that i knew didn't belong there if i don't see it i feel i'll open my front door and say i evict you in jesus name get out and it leans just like that yeah you should do that every night before you go to bed let me ask one more question and we're about at the time here um people have been saying i've been hearing this reported i don't know how carmen this is Kat but people have been commenting on booms and explosion sounds around the world and wondering if you knew anything about the booms that you talked about military being but have you heard anything about people hearing mysterious booms yes i have i've have not just heard them hearing about the booms i've heard them hearing like um rumbling sounds like something was rumbling and rumbling and rumbling that's usually the activity of the army of God come in if there's a lot of them coming into an area to deal with stuff sometimes you you you will just pick that up that happened in florida that happened from mid florida lower florida and that happened to be the day that that was when i was releasing billions of the host to head out to dc on the very day people heard it they didn't know what it was they could hear all over in this whole area and down south floor they could hear it they were looking for things in the sky they couldn't find it there they were hearing the spirit around the army of heaven's activity wow wow i had no idea i did not know that well let's do this we're at the time would you pray can we do something where you pray where people are right now in their houses and where you where you command things to leave yeah i'll do that also i'll i'll do yeah i'll do an eviction and i'll do the implementation at the same time when you command stuff to leave you need to fill it with God right so father i think authority over anyone's home that they're living in right now or the place they're living in it may not be their home father if there's any darkness there and they don't want it and they haven't caused it to happen right now are you evicted in jesus name you will go from those places you will no longer plague people attack people your presence will not be known i command the host of heaven to go in there right now and crush and push back and kick into a dry place every evil spirit shred the platforms over those people's places right now in jesus name will no longer have the presence of the enemy no fear no grief no laugh no sickness get out in jesus name now i impart the life of God into the same place as God the love of God the presence of God his joy his celebration his expectation of greatness in their lives i thank you God that you love your people you want to be free in jesus name be filled with God and go live your life for him amen that was powerful i felt that thing wow that was anointed thank you again we put your uh what you can't see it probably but we put revealingheaven.com on the bottom of the screen and then tell people how to get to your other website as well yeah my my one website revealingheaven.com is about my corporation one quest international we create and release we release heaven on earth and create things and put on the earth that represent heaven and then i have KatKerr.com and that's where you go it costs nothing to go there there's so many hours of videos that were made from interviews like with patricia king and other people there's a lot of help to teach you how to declare over your family members who were not born again i think how to lose stuff from your soul which we kind of did a little bit earlier it teaches you to be great in christ you were never meant or put in this earth to be crushed down and pushed back to be controlled to be beaten up you were meant to rule and reign with jesus christ KatKerr.com is a spiritual platform where the father son or holy spirit are allowed to say whatever they want sad that's what's on there it's also the only place in existence that you can actually go and give to me online if you find any other facebook any other youtube there's a lot of fakes if they're out there saying send me money i need if they're saying it's me it's not me they're saying give to this person for this cause over here that's not me either i do that personally myself i give to places like that so katper.com and revealingheaven.com my public facebook page which i think they took the word public alpha is the caccur and then i have a public youtube channel and i can tell you God has greatness for every believer on this earth it's up to you to choose it you have to choose it and say i'm willing to do what you need me to do i'm willing to go where you want me to go and it says those who are willing and obedient shall eat the fat of the land well instead of the crumbs that we're getting right now from the fake people in the fake administration we're about to get so blessed royally blessed uh and our years ahead are going to be great so be blessed thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you i i just really want to honor you publicly

well happy wednesday march 17th st patrick's day i don't know if this if st patrick's is celebrated outside the u.s i'm guessing it is i just don't don't know if i've ever asked that question but st patrick's day i got my green on had to get something with green and blue in it because i i don't i have one green shirt but it wasn't ready by the time i remembered this but anyway welcome to another episode of elijah streams this is brought to you by elijahlist.com both of these are our organizations i started the alliances 24 years ago um this month 24 years ago well in april will be 24 years and then a few years ago we started elijah's streams which you're about to watch with with the next prophetic guest which is kat Kerr so uh hey let me ask you a quick question jeff if it's not too late if you are ready to run that zapa commercial can we run that for people to see if not we can go on past but you need to let me know one way or another he may have stepped away we have to say you cannot step [Music] [Music] very good thank you jeff i appreciate that that was very good yeah we i don't want to run that every single time but that is our organization zap it is very facebook like friendly and you can say what you want to say we're not going to censor you you can talk about you can speak against planned parenthood you can talk about vaccinations you can do whatever you want to do on that channel and we won't take you down and i don't see ourselves um becoming like some of the others where we're gonna edit all the news and say this is fake we're gonna i see ourselves uh trusting the viewers to determine whether something is fake or not i don't know what maybe maybe time will tell something else but uh let's see i think that other than that make sure you subscribe to elijahs.com and when you go to the youtube channel to subscribe what you do do these there's a thumbs up a subscribe and a bell so you go to youtube.com put in the largest streams as one word and then when it comes up you do the thumbs up the subscribe and the bell and you will be notified on your devices when we're coming on or when a new episode is either doing live or is about to come on and that will keep you in the know all right so without further delay let's bring on kat Kerr she comes in there you go hi kat hi happy st patrick's day thank you say to you what does your shirt say read it read it to us it says you have me at uh shenanigans i'm gonna stand up for just a minute there you go you have me at shenanigans all right and then of course it's a cat that's a picture of a cat so that's where there's a double double wordplay you had me a cat yes yes that's really funny it was a funny shirt i think jen probably found it she finds all the fun stuff but just a minute before i start on um america and i'd like to do a little focus on st patrick and before people get in their mindset it's so weird isn't it how people get something stuck in their head and think this is wrong or bad or maybe they were told that or show that i think it's important to share truth whenever i can if i have truth on it and number one the word say i'm going to talk about that first for a minute st patrick saint thomas you know saint paul all these words about calling people saints i do know in the catholic church they saint people but they weren't the first ones guess who calls us saints God in the bible it's called the saints of God that's all of us who belong to jesus christ so you just can kind of let that thing go it's something that kind of stuck in different wet places but um st patrick actually was a great man of God who had received jesus christ as a savior now as a youth st patrick and i'll just give you the dates somewhere between 320 and 420 something that's when he lived now that was still pretty close to when christ was on the earth we're talking about 300 some years after christ had died or had been gone to heaven moved to heaven let's say that so he was still around pretty close to when jesus had been here and that was very uh stuck in his heart so he was raised in a great family but as a youth he was kidnapped taken to ireland he was a laborer for several years there i think he worked the land or something but he was a laborer he wasn't a minister he wasn't a priest or anything at that time and so he fell in love with ireland he fell in love with the people of ireland so when he was finally uh set free he went back to uh where he was from i i'm not quite sure where that was i think it was maybe britain or something like that he was from another country when he went back found his parents let them know you know he was okay he decided to go back and preach the kingdom gospel to the people in ireland now at that time ireland had a lot of druids and wizards and all that kind of stuff was going on as it was in many places during that time and so you can see even now darkness raises up its ugly head wherever the light of God is to try to take over it didn't work back then either so patrick started going around just preaching the gospel he was not at the beginning in any part of life the catholic church whatsoever he went around preaching the gospel and sometimes he would actually use the um what is the three gen the three leaf clover he would use that to represent the trinity yeah yellow oh the three leaf he would pick a three leaf clover huh okay clover he would use that to teach people about the trinity awesome jen's giving me pointers over there so we would use that to represent the trinity and that's one of the reasons why it really does represent a lot about st patrick it was something he used in his ministry so don't go saying it represents some evil wicked thing people you need to focus on what is the light of God and so he won many kings and then eventually became a part this is a funny part he became a part of the catholic or catholicism but he didn't teach catholicism i mean he actually got into trouble at one point he would go win these kings these druid kings to christ and every time he won another one they would light a fire on the hill uh where that king ruled where the druid king ruled because that whole group would come to christ and he lit up a lot of ireland by winning these kings to christ and so finally some of the a normal priest and then the parishes got upset because he wasn't collecting money to send back to rome you know what you normally would do he wasn't establishing parishes so he actually was called back to rome to see the pope how about that and these priests were hoping that pope would say you can't do that anymore you have to line up with what we're teaching that's not what the pope said to him the pope told patrick you go back and keep doing what you're doing because you're making a difference for jesus christ and that knocked a lot of them so he continued ministering and preaching and winning these kings to christ and he was at one time in bangor uh there was like a whole area called bangor um that's not like bangor maine bangor island and so much did he win the the loss there that they had luminous angels this is all true luminous angels began to show up with patrick when he was going easter or after he administered even to this day in ireland in bangor people still see those angels those luminous angels which i can understand because like when i was in israel i saw the same two angels who were in the tomb of christ when when mary questioned them and another saw them uh something remains where something was done for jesus christ so patrick was a great winner of souls and he is uh i can tell you he's in heaven i've seen his mansion and because jesus also has a sense of humor he built patrick's mansion in a field of five foot tall shamrocks wow really yeah you see what in heaven he did i did i saw him in heaven and uh somebody's got all these shamrocks that sing to him and jesus christ because God has a sense of humor so there's your little tip on saint patrick it's okay you know to recognize who he was and uh a lot of people are so lo love patrick in heaven a lot of people want to talk to him and share about when the luminous angels would come and we ran we i did the story but i don't know if it ran today or yesterday but look on the elijah list elijah.com or facebook we ran a story in saint patrick that kathy walters wrote and it talks about patrick raising the dead druid king and then the druid king came to the lord but because he raised his two children that had just died apparently they died at the same time in two different greek accidents so and you know um i want to add that she actually wrote a book i've never seen anywhere else called the celtic flames that talks about these uh celtic uh men women of God that did great things way back in that day and we actually found out that my husband has a in his family line connects with one of those i think was manuscr which we didn't know about what a powerful heritage so celtic flames by kathy walters is powerful you need to get that if you want to know more about these celtic uh saints and great men of God that's good thank you awesome well we got to we're going to do at the end at the last part uh last half whatever all questions about heaven we got a special treat for you in that vein but before that what do you have anything you want to add or or tell us if anything new from the lord regarding the whole trump yeah i'm still hearing celebrate but until i'm hearing this that it is so much closer of course obviously if it's been this long with all the stuff going on um of course any reports you get on the fake news that is still fake most of it's um still made to support the left and their wicked agenda maybe you didn't even know that but there is a battle in the spirit right now not just for our country but for the world and it's not going to work this is what the father says it won't work these are not the perilous times it's not the tribulation evil will not take over at this time and i can tell you what God is doing is exposing what he must remove because what we're going to step into is so powerful the greater days of glory the manifested sons and daughters of God us moving so freely not just in america but around this world to take the gospel to demonstrate manifest signs and wonders never seen before God has to deal with the evil in the darkness to give us the freedom to do that so if you want to know what's going on that's exactly what's going on and God is still telling me the same thing he has not changed since november the 4th that he is going to deal with it their justice will be brought i do know that they're still working on some of the um indictments i can't talk a lot about that but this definitely working on indictments uh so there's things going on you don't know about that nobody can talk about but yeah this is definitely it's not over this is the beginning of something powerful and it is powerful for God God is over everyone he holds the air all of us breathe and in these days of his time on the earth guess what he's going to have his way so keep thanking him keep speaking against any darkness every time i will say this every time you hear another illegal unconstitutional wicked uh regulation or law being made from up there behind the barbar you yourself say i nullify those bills i will not live according to that way i believe God is bringing freedom and liberty but i will not participate with darkness please say those words that will make a big difference in the atmosphere of your home and even releasing things out into the atmosphere of our country so good so good well okay well we have some questions for you we're going to do something a little different with these questions last week at this time in fact they they tell me it's on episode 15 at the 6 minute and 25 mark i began to have a word of knowledge about a young woman i said you're in your 20s and 30s i said i see a ski cap on i see at the end and the word the specific word that i had you had a light blue ski jacket on as if you were on the slopes and i said God wants you to be able to ask your question or questions of Kat i said i also see that you have your own channel and you're going to you're doing your own videos now and so what happened is she didn't get to us during the show but after the show either on the replay or we missed it by a few hours she said i think i met one and jeff go ahead threw up a photo of her now and that's a photo that's the exact face i saw the ski cap was like that now this is one that she was in the books because she said her name is ellen and she said ellen said that i just came off from the slopes of norway she lives in norway and she says i was wearing something like that yesterday before i came off the slope so so i don't know if it's an exact match because i don't have a photo of that but this is ellen and that's the exact face that i saw so what i did is i've gotten to know her a little bit and she actually tells her testimony in one of her videos it's the only one she's done in english everything else is in norwegian so we're going to play two minutes of her testimony she really loves Kat by the way she's been teaching all of Kat stuff so play her testimony there jeff it's about two minutes hi my name is norway and i just want to share my testimony with you i love jesus with all of my heart do you know he loves you so much more than you can ever know and he exists he is there i had the privilege of actually seeing him so i had this great hunger for jesus since i was a young kid really i just longed for him i wanted to see him i want to be with him i just longed to live the way i saw people live for him in the bible and but i was not there and i didn't know how to do that i didn't find him as i just i just did what he said in the word it says that you can seek me and you will find me if you seek me with all of your heart so i decided to do that and and i found him so but a lot of stuff happened before that so i got really sick and i had over 37 symptoms in my body and the doctors couldn't do anything to help me and they just said call if you're about to die you know so i i was bedridden and i couldn't i couldn't do anything i had no strength i have seizures i had constant pain in my body i you know i was dizzy nauseous i couldn't eat properly i couldn't sleep probably and i i just had a lot of things going on in my body and nobody could help me so but i knew that God could help me i knew that he's real and that he sees me and i started to experience so much with jesus when i was like i started to see dreams and visions he started to give me a revelation he came with his presence into my living room and one day i was just seeking him and crying out for him God i want more of you i want to see you i want to be with you and one day he just showed up in my living room and i saw him and he he did like this on my face and and he smiled at me and the whole room just was filled with his glory and his love it was just like liquid love just going through my whole body and i was completely changed from that day on he was not speaking to me with words but he was speaking a whole book to me just with his mind with his presence so he could actually just say something in his mind and i could hear it and he just said like and i love you so much nobody can love you like i am loving you you know you came for me i created you i have a great plan for your life he just started to just say all these things that i actually knew but when he said it it was like then it really hit me you know and it became my words it just came became so real you know that wow he loves me he sees me i am created by him everything that is in the bible is true and i was so amazed by his love so good i'm sitting here smiling from ear to ear she's just got such a sweet presence and all that so you said you've been in norway uh Kat is that right yes i did i get to speak there i went on um a scandinavian cruise where we went to all the different countries i got to speak in a dif a couple of the different countries but norway was my favorite because the hunger that was there was amazing and there's probably well over a hundred young people that were going to start a brand new network this was probably maybe what maybe three years ago and they found out i was on the ship so they sent a message saying could she please come off the ship we'll pick her up and bring her here this is the beginning of our studio we'd love for her to pray over or prophesy over the studio and of course i said yes it was just amazing the beauty of the presence of God that was in that place and i loved it that their building was a major building in the business district which has beautiful artistic it's so artistic the whole area was but it was a round building i love round the throne room is round i think probably people's homes maybe end up by reflecting that i used to say that but the people in norway were not like what people had told me they're cold they don't care that was not true wherever God is working there's going to be people who love him and love people so it was a great time i really did enjoy that very much wow well you know and then i offered uh ellen a chance to ask her a question or two and i got about seven of them so i decided okay that's our show today we're going to do her questions if we run out which i doubt we will run out but i've got other questions beside if we finish up so with your permission i'm just going to go for it i'm going to i'm going to give you the questions ellen gave me in the order she gave him to me okay okay that's great question one does God the father and the holy spirit have their own house like jesus does you know what she's the first person who ever asked that of me i can tell that she's really had uh time with him because the more time you spend with him the more possibilities open in your own soul about these things and absolutely i know the father does the father has a place called his chambers and i've seen that place it's just for him it's just his spot and people think he's super glued to the throne he's not jesus has his own mansion a father has his chambers which would be his face holy spirit usually is all over heaven uh seeing people and i know you say how you can you see the outline of the image of him you know it's him he usually is normally right to the left side of the throne we know jesus sits next to the father on the right side about holy spirit i've never seen an actual place it's his i think he takes all of it i think he just claims all of it and he's everywhere all over the place so yeah he's not usually like necessary i would have said holy spirit's not a loner he's a very much engaging he wants to be with you hello he has to live in us he better like being with people and he does he really does so but i have seen the father's amazing place where i was invited to go there and this this whirlwind of glorious blue like with eyes all in it this whirlwind came to me when i was taken here and it totally engulfed me and when it stopped he was standing beside me which i just got so undone again at that time i looked like i was eight he always takes me i look like a little girl it was the most beautiful time in the most beautiful times i ever remember so i do know the father has his own space i'm sure he needs it like all of us do sometimes and i'm sure he takes others there but so that that's the answer to that question that's very very interesting well i'm gonna get cover every one of our questions we're gonna skip ahead to a couple because you see this one's about the holy spirit she says what will our relationship with holy spirit be like in heaven will he still live in us will we have one-to-one fellowship with him too i don't think i don't i don't think that relationship will ever ever stop i don't think it's ever going to stop it just gets greater he has such a personal one-on-one with us because he lives in us and we know christ in us i know christ steps in and out a lot of us and christ will step out sometimes for me when i was a little girl and i got born again at four i literally saw him step into me the holy spirit is different he has a commission from jesus himself and he was sent to this earth to help guide us to come alongside us but when we invite holy spirit to indwell us holy spirit does send a layer of himself that's elohim he moves right in and he will speak to you 24 7 if you encourage that and he's like i call him my best friend and i know that's not going to stop when you get to heaven he may continue to step in and out of you but i think when you're there you can see him whenever you want to he may be outside of you more than inside uh that was necessary for us on the earth and heaven we don't need so much guidance and making sure that we stay on the path but i know that relationship that friendship with him is going to grow when we get to heaven really really good good question okay and she's got several that i've never heard um anyone asked so people say might be saying well i hope they don't get repetitive just so you can cover her no these aren't repetitive so okay do angels feel cold and hot weather when they're with us and do they get wet from rain or snow or feel the wind it's a lot of storms where i live so she wants to know if the angels feel that i don't think it affects him whatsoever i have never seen my own angel get wet even when it's raining they're spiritual beings now i will say this there's a whole tribe of angels that have flesh on their body before we were even made God made them for specific purposes if they're here they do feel the wet it doesn't bottom they do feel the wet they will feel the wind because they have flesh on them it's not quite like our flesh but he did put flesh on them so they would be seen on the earth they used to help guide people and teach people at a time in the earth when knowledge was going to increase and they're called watcher angels now i do know this a couple of them were some of the ones uh i've heard different messages from different people or prophets i know that there are a tribe of them some people have seen maybe 200 some have seen maybe 30 40. i do know that some of them did decide to fall back in the day when it says God set boundaries for them when he sent them that they would not mix with humans they would only help to inform them and give them information so they could learn and grow on the earth and then we all know that some of them did mix with the women they created the nephilim and then they became wicked now those are bound in chains the ones you create in their form are bound in chains they're not even here on the earth right now there's still some a lot of the good ones a lot of them um their their leader is melchizedek who also has flesh on him and i know this is a little bit long description but she asked so if they're here in the flesh you would see them you may not know that's who they are but they will experience the wind and the rain it doesn't affect them like they wouldn't get roasted they wouldn't get sunburned or something but normally a spiritual angel made spiritually they're in the spirit realm and they allow themselves to be seen sometimes and in the spirit realm you wouldn't be touched or affected which is the spirit realms all around this earth if you step in there it'd be like a whole different place they are living there they're sending an assignment from there so it's a different kind of life but the flesh would definitely feel it you mean let me uh let me parlay off of that you may remember i told the story about seeing an angel for the second time i'd seen him over here in the states and he corrected me firmly i don't know if he's a guardian age or one of these watchers when i got lost in paris and at the airport i had no phone no ability anything i was saying lord how are you going to help me and this person put the newspaper down and it was that person that i now recognize as an angel so could that have been any angel taking the form of a human and looking at or if i could see him does that mean he was a watcher angel i'm pretty certain well see even the ones in the spirit spiritual ones God can allow them to be seen they can appear a God can let them appear they can even look like they are human i will say this most guardian angels look like us uh they don't look like the army of the army in heaven has a lot of creatures and strange-looking things they fight in war our guardian angels don't usually fight in war usually there's some of the hosts with them when they go places that was probably one of your guardian angels and most of them would not kind of corrupt you unless it was probably your guardian angel so you probably saw one of your guardian angels oh interesting fascinating all right this one um this was really good i'm again i never heard this question she says ellen can we create stuff with our own words in heaven like God if i said i want a necklace like this and this would it be created right in front of me because i said it now is she talking about when she goes when she's talking about in in heaven once she goes to heaven will she will she speak things into existence to create them basically what she uses the word create or is that or does only God create and you express the need no we are his sons and daughters we're supposed to be just like him if you will remember he said you're talking about mankind at that point let us make man in our image and let them operate like us now it says let us create men in our image and after our likeness that word likeness means crea it means operate so God made us to actually look or simulate him and to act or operate like him that kicks in so strongly even now as believers this sounds wild to y'all even as believers when we call things that mean as though they were you're actually that's called a form of creativity you create things in the atmosphere in your home places that you go all the time uh by you speaking that's what the manifested son and daughter is that's why the earth is crying out for us to stand up and say no this is not going to happen no i need that earthquake to go back the way it was before it came uh no i need to create and call forth rain and crops out of the land immediately those are some of the greater works that we'll be doing on the earth so absolutely yes i was shown that we will actually get to create like God the one thing we will never create is people we will never create another tribe of people or groups of people God wouldn't do that to us okay that will never happen but he actually showed me like worlds that were blank canvases and he said i'll send you there you can create the you can create the type of uh like earth like is it mountainous is it lakes are there trees even some of the little creatures we will so yes she's absolutely right we will get to create things in heaven there's no wickedness in this no evil no coveting no greed because people in their natural mind think well somebody could become like a lucifer again that won't happen but his ultimate goal is really for us to be like him we're not him we'll never replace him we won't ever be God but i'm telling you we'll have great authority in heaven that's why you need to be accountable for your life right now the more accountable you are now the more he can give you and as God told me the way you live your life right now in the earth determines your position not that you won't go to heaven but we will have levels of rulership and creativity according to how we were accountable for our life here that's good now ellen asked about creating necklaces and at the same time another question came to me that was a similar thing online asked about animals it says might we be able to create a life form like an ant like animals in heaven so that i'm just gonna throw that i came to me the same day but not from airline or different i think i mentioned that uh when he showed me these blank worlds that he called a canvas this is after everything's over we're in the new heaven right we're on the new earth i mean the new earth that we won't just do normal things we won't be bound just to the new earth we'll have all of creativity that'll be out there that he can go and take us and say okay see what you can create here what kind of buildings what kind of creatures now he's not talking about creatures that will look like humans and act like humans he's talking about little type of creatures that might be kind of fun to do things with or stuff like that we can't the reason for that is this we cannot create a soul we never will create a soul a soul is what makes you operate in here uh but just to bring a life to a little thing like something i've already told people that when you go to a christmas town in heaven you build a snowman that snowman comes alive for a certain time because the snow itself has life in it so wherever he takes his life will already be put there by him and we won't be left there alone because i know someone's going to think that no no angels will go with us the father will be visiting holy spirit we'll be going back and forth from the new earth to whatever we're working on it'll be like a project but absolutely God says this day i offer you life and death and it says life does not say that power is in the tongue life is in the power of the tongue you need to be speaking life now and bringing hope and joy if you expect to do something later on even in into the new earth but we will absolutely have creative ability but not for humans not for things that have a soul in them so but the but the possibilities are almost endless of what we can create because our father is a creator he's a commander a creator um and those things that he does and he said we operate similar to him that's why in the scripture God says know ye not that ye are Gods but it's a little g most pastors won't even touch that scripture they don't know what that means but we're made in their image the father son and holy spirit and after the likeness we will operate similar to them more in heaven more on the new earth than right here because it'll be much freer there there's no evil that's been done away with forever but even in this time we're stepping into such a powerful time which is why all the stuff's going to be white a lot of it will be wiped away right now we will begin to call those things as though they're not and then they will be do you by the way do you know where that i've heard that scripture and pastors won't touch it because they don't want to sound mormon doctrine or something like that so they'll say but it says don't know you not that you are God's it's a little g where do you know remember where that passage is by chance no i usually don't once holy spirit tells me they they'll quote me i know it's there but it's not only that the other scripture they don't understand is when God himself says command ye me and they don't want to touch that when they want we can't tell God what to do you have to turn some scriptures this is what the holy spirit tell me sometimes you have to flip that scripture he said that scripture revelation on commanding me is showing me you can command like we command the weather we're over the weather not under the weather we have been given power over all the power of the enemy when we speak words forcibly and we have pure hearts something happens and so when God said commanding me he wasn't saying tell me what to do he's saying you say what should happen okay that's declaring the decree so i'll find out where it is again can look it up right now maybe she can tell us before this yeah if they tell it and and if my team finds it they can type it on my screen and then i can share it that way too yeah um okay here's what she said i've heard kat saying that jesus dances a lot with people in heaven does the father does God the father and the holy spirit dance with people in heaven like jesus does you know you're probably gonna have to look up look up another scripture it says in the bible i do know this absolutely he does because this is God this is the father of jesus christ we lived in him that's where everyone came from we lived in him we played in the river of life we jumped down the stones of fire it says very clearly in the bible he's saying over us and he danced it says he danced and what that means is he can make himself while he's sitting on the throne people this is the one who's over everything that's why i'm not concerned about anything the one who's over everything can make himself while he's sitting on the throne make himself small enough to step inside himself and play with all those who are still in him and that's what he would dance with us he would sing sing over us so absolutely he does do those things that's really really good all right now this one uh this one now she ellen heard us talk about i had asked the question and several people asked the question i asked it for them if if husbands and wives are having marital relationships or people are undressed or exposed you know as far as you do they want to know and you said well at that case the angel waits outside the door but could come in to rescue you if there was an issue right remember that yes okay so she's following up on that and she's talking about abuse and she was very clear to me she said this is not my situation i didn't have this happen to me but i'm going to read it she says i heard Kat say a few weeks ago on your show the angels will not stay in the room when people make love but would rescue them if need be so my question is what do the angels do when people get abused why do they not do anything i met i once met a girl that said she prayed every night for God to help her but she was still abused a lot why do angels not help them which is a i mean that's got to be one of the hardest questions you ever get asked i would think probably that's one of the ones i don't have an answer to i do know God cares i know this is a thing this is what he actually did say this to me there's evil on this earth okay God does not ever promote evil he never intended us to be abused it's when people it's when the people see we can't necessarily control the soul of a person when God sends you here he sends you here to grow to be nurtured to know him that was the purpose of why he made the earth and by the way for whatever reason he has rescued different ones at different times i don't understand why that happens but i can tell you this he can heal you from all of it he can make it like it never happened to you uh you can lose all that abuse from your soul and he jesus will come take it out so he made a way to not have to hold it in your soul but his answer was similar to that was when he made this earth it was made for us to come to earth and we have a body so that we could have a body not just remain a spirit so we could be with him through all eternity even christ came to the earth out of body and then return to heaven that's his purpose his purpose is not evil but we know how much wickedness is out there right now well God didn't intend that God didn't create it people have a will and there's a certain place that he that he will not go past her will and i don't know why sometimes he does unless there's more people praying for them that may have made a difference about that if that people outside strongly praying for her lots of times or they could send about ask the angels to go and intervene i do know sometimes that makes a difference so it's important for you to raise your child up to know how to declare over those things and understand things don't always happen right that they themselves can tell their angel i'll give you permission to rescue me to intervene at any time it makes a difference how much you're operating in it's not because God doesn't care it's how we establish the earth to operate and if he he's coming in to change and stop everything things some things just won't ever happen and i don't know how to explain that i can just say this God loves you he despises evil and i will let you know this those people will not escape punishment if they don't get born again and repent for that they will be punished more in hell than others will so they won't escape their punishment ken i was trying to remember if you had asked answered a question similar to this um someone said this and i don't remember it was you as it talked about God can uh is patient wherever that sin sometimes allows these things to happen where he doesn't intervene knowing full well that that that is a tiny tiny tiny blip on eternity where we will spend eternity with him is there anything to that did you ever say that or where am i thinking of that kind of a no i don't think i'd said that but um i got i can say this so whatever you allow God to use for glory even the hard things that you went through uh he didn't send you hear from him himself saying well i'm gonna send them and all these bad things will happen when you know what it says in heaven he wrote every day of your life in a book that didn't mean he wrote every evil book of thing that would happen he wrote everything he purposed for you in your life to become and to get to experience those were good things those weren't horrible things but because we have a devil who's on this earth and we ourselves and this is a real serious we have been tolerating it our job here is to have power over all the part of the enemy we start declaring and taking authority it says if you submit yourself under the hand of God is this right if you submit yourself under the hand of God and resist him that would resist him means you take authority over him saying you're not tolerating it i'm not putting up with it you know i evict you right now when you do that he runs from you so this is the whole purpose for that scripture we've just been kind of sitting around letting it happen we're clueless to our authority and dominion he gave us on the earth christ died for us he fought in hell so that we could have all this given back to us that's what we're supposed to be living like and i can tell you what starting now two or three generations from now will look so different because we'll be walking in this great power and authority crushing darkness pushing it back those attacks are going to be minimized because we are finally stepping in to what christ gave to us okay good that's good you know and i have to just you know you just see hear the breaking of glass like is these old thought patterns that people like us have were raised that things are going to get worse and worse and worse and finding the lord comes only in the last number of years has the seven mountain teaching come out that we're now supposed to invade society and bring it back to God's yes his kingdom in earth in heaven as on earth as in heaven that just goes against everything i was i was ever taught by the way they gave me a couple scriptures psalms 82 6 i have said ye are Gods and all of you you are children of the most high that's psalms 82 6 and john 10 34 jesus answered them it is not written is it not written in your law i said ye are Gods so it's in the law itself and psalms is part of the torah it's like the the first five books in psalms and proverbs is probably considered the law um and jesus said is it not written in your law i said your God and i'm thinking boy wasn't that a little bit risky think of all the other false theologies that are going to come from that but God can protect his own reputation yes i guess so he can say what he wants to say okay jen did give me the john 10 34 also um no you're not the er Gods but it's a little g it's not like you're him okay yeah and can i i want to ask you one more clarification on that um because we talked about creating so you could do the necklace you said in heaven and he said he's not going to have you do something that has a soul but if if someone said well i want to do this i've always wanted to have a kitten that this characteristic could they speak that in existence or as a cat something that has a soul so that's not going to be something they can do i think in the city you talk about in heaven right yes all in heaven in heaven that depends on if you are creating with the father i think i do know that there's creation lab that's a learning place in heaven i was taken to you and also that's where you when you go to heaven you get to see him actually making him in the word making the heavens and the earth seeing how they did that there's another thing that goes on there which i haven't spoken about where you actually learn how to do those things if the father is with you or if the lord is with you and you're doing those things they then can help create those other things you said you always wanted so i left that out so it's going to share that another time but since you brought that up and if they're involved in it then yes they actually and yes cats have souls dogs have souls your soul is what you vote think with what you choose with uh if if they're if they didn't have a soul they couldn't decide what they were going to eat who they were going to trust where they were going to go see if they didn't have those and i'll take you back even further to genesis where God told noah put every animal on the ark that has a spirit of life in it that spirit of life is their soul so therefore that when they all came off the yard these all these ones that were on there they they have a soul they can think they can make decisions um that's why animals can be different personalities they would not be they'd be like robots if they didn't have one so i think yes i do know that when the father and or the lord is with you in this place called creation lab you won't create people i want to make that clear but there are things you'll be able to create and if anybody can actually give them that life in there it would be the father or the son so that little spirit of life comes from him yeah good okay here's the next one from ellen she says how many times should i send the host out because you teach people how to send the host the warrior the armies of God how many times should i send the host out in a day is there a question you can do it 20 hours a day if you can stay up that long okay because and one of her things was she said uh and there might be another part here she said i'm not a seer i don't see things happen although she has had senior experiences because she saw the lord walk into the room and touch her face that testimony but she says i'm not i don't see things normally so she's saying you know after a while it's taxing because i can't see i don't see them go so it's kind of exhausting because you don't see it the results or you don't see them go whereas you can't get to see them take off right it's called faith but there's actually hundreds of thousands of people right now doing it and they don't see them they know they go this is something God gave us to do it says right in the bible that our weapons of warfare are not natural they're not physical they're spiritual and they clearly says they they are mighty to the pulling down the strongholds that's the army of heaven they were designed to war for us they're they're a weapon and if you invite them like the father taught me i invite heaven's army to be my weapon just like the father said you get 100 right then will come to you you need to start sending them out and your army increases and i think um there should be no frustration in here lose all the frustration or aggravation you begin to feel that because that's the enemy trying to steal that from you saying nothing's happening it's called faith you step out in faith and do that with joy and celebration because let me tell you things are happening in the spirit realm when they go that's why they're designed it's called faith i also even though i see them i still believe i know that God sent them for that purpose and i have millions now that are part of my army because i don't stop sending them usually i make a list because if i hear stuff or i don't usually watch the news if someone tells me these things are going on i make a note and i will literally strategically send them i don't randomly send them they're strategically set like i have started sending them right now i say i'm sending a hundred of 100 million to go back into dc to to go to begin to pull down every stronghold of satan ruling over the capitol building and all the fake administration i command the host of evan to go and shred platforms that demons are sitting on also i have an authority over that to go and pull them down right now and when i say go go go what happens just as you can have an image shafts of light will shoot past you this is what they look like when they're leaving shafts of light it's them going trust me they're going and they will go there and i can i'll even say for the next 10 days 24 hours a day you will release the terror of God and anyone in anyone leading promoting or using human trafficking against us on the earth i want the terror of God to begin to consume them 24 hours a day for 10 days they'll be crawling around at the end of that time so horrified and convicted that what they're doing is evil and God will bring judgment to them so you have to understand what we allow we're allowing this because we have authority to do it God's going to make sure that happens those angels are waiting to go do it but they don't have authority they don't have power over all the part of the enemy they've already gone and wiped everyone out they have to have orders we are commanders because christ is the lord of hosts he gave this this for us to do you have to step out in faith and joy should be coming up in you joy that's what should be there that you're making a difference for people in this world you're using your authority christ gave and so as you do it your faith should be building i know your army's building they'll stand there and stare at you waiting for you to send them well you know it's just like i wish i'd had this teaching much when i was much younger but i mean most of my life it's been what can little old me do uh what you know i don't that's not my gift i'm not a warrior and and i'm hearing you say God it doesn't matter if you're a warrior he assigned warrior angels to you but you have the authority they don't have you can send them they can't send themselves is what you say if i've never been a warrior i'm just not good at spiritual warfare i'm not good at fighting i can turn to my host with all the faith and say you go now to be seen this is where i want you to go and and even though you consider yourself kind of uh introvert i was an introvert almost all my life that was who i was it's not about in the physical who you are you're looking at the spirit you're looking the physical who you are i'm in the spirit you're a king and priest unto God you have been given by jesus christ he looked at us and said i give you power over all all the power of the enemy and nothing biting me shall harm me that was for us he had turned to the angels those angels have been waiting all these eons to finally have orders to be sent you can't send someone else's army nobody can send your army and that's not like me i don't like violence i despise violence i don't want to go in the physical and hurt people but i have no problem being fierce in the spirit realm against the evil that's making all this stuff happen and let me tell you it will rise up in you and you will begin to understand when he said we rule and reign with christ we have that authority we have to receive that authority even if you even though you don't feel it yourself and in the emotions you step out and declare what God has said about you and that's going to eventually come into you wow wow well there's one last question regarding the host and i think i've heard uh variances on how this can be answered she says can everyone because she means believers have a host in other words their own army no matter their age or maturity in christ let's say they're very i guess you're saying what if they're really young and very immature or very immature in christ do they still have hosts to send we have eight-year-olds at command armies we have eight-year-olds we have 10 year olds that do it all the time uh they'll make little notes in a journal something angels oh absolutely they're the ones who have no problem believing it our natural mind or our physical mind will fight against it i'm nobody i'm not worthy even though the word clearly says what jesus said clearly if you are a believer born again believer and you're not actively you have to add this if you're not actively sinning if you're not actively partnering with darkness because they won't listen to you if you're out there using profanity all the time guess what you attract hell's army to you hell's language is profanity you can't be swearing up a storm and then tell the angels to go somewhere they won't go anywhere so you have to be accountable for your life for your words in order for this to operate you can't think you're sending an army if you're shredding your wife if you're sweating your husband they hearken under the word of the lord that means when you speak you sound like him okay you're taking authority over darkness not letting it in your house what are you watching are you watching r-rated movies all the time they're not going to listen to you because those things have a right to invade your life this is the way the holy spirit says what you enter into will enter into you so there are guidelines and there's places you can go and listen to me say that um i've already i've made a cd called invite heaven's army uh it's in our store if you want to see that but all the videos i put out there i actually teach whole congregations how to invite heaven's army what that means what the protocol is what your uh what your accountability is with them so there's guidelines you can't sound and look like the world and think the army's gonna listen to you but if you're living your life for christ they were so happy to go and pull down the strongholds of darkness and begin to shift things and this is what the father said one of the number one ways you will keep your life in these days is to have an army to come in because their number one job if you're operating correctly is to protect you good good you know i have one other question that occurs to me donald trump you could say he's a newbo he's like a baby christian he's been at it probably for four years when he's really dedicated his life to the lord so you would say well maybe he's an immature christian or a baby would he have either the same authority if not more authority to command host of heaven to go fight on behalf of the u.s and different countries um because he's a literal king on the earth um would he have the same authority if he knew what authority could he get even more done with less armies on the earth could he do that i think he has the same authority that i do or you do as a believer um he is the president and i still call him that because he actually did win the election that's one of the plans i have when i finally get to meet him is i'm going to teach him how to invite heaven's army and send them because i think he'll be one of the most fierce people on the earth i know that when he finds true believers who operate the way God gives us to he gets excited he wants to know he wants to learn and i can tell you right now if anybody right now is disgusted it's him because he came under the commission of God to make america great which he did do and even though someone stole this last election it won't interfere with him completing the call God gave him to be president here he does not know about that he knows angels intervene he asks the christians or the people he knows to pray all the time please pray he's even said that publicly he understands that prayer does do things but when he ever gets this thing about the army trust me he's going to invite heaven's army to be with his weapons and he will use that weapon yeah and you know i couldn't even imagine him in the natural he would have to send armies for this and that that he could never talk about but in this private time he just goes now lord i just sent the troops i'm sending the host to go along with them right yes oh absolutely we i actually all the time my husband especially has a call by God to speak on behalf of the first uh responders whether it's firemen or policemen or the military he was in the marines that's still in him he declares over them he sends the host with them all the time um to to be with them so absolutely that could be somebody's assignment man i'm going to watch what they're doing and i'll always send the host where i hear things going on uh you know to go in there and help them they absolutely will go and do that and and to finish this point what you're saying is God could send uh the host of heaven and probably does but primarily he's made the host of heaven to respond to to us to our orders right is that what you're saying so it's so you say well nothing's happening well maybe not enough people are sending their armies i would say this it will accelerate things if they were doing that instead of like complaining or just dropping on you know i just think nothing's happened you know enough time has gone by that's what a lot of the christians are doing not all of them well God had enough time to do something so he's mad at us or is too evil it's not to evil people this is the thing you need to focus on what God wants and what God says and what his word says but God does send in the past and i will say in the past he would send the army when israel even says so in isaiah it might be isaiah 13. when israel cries out for God to come and defend them at that time he would literally send the army of heaven to fight on behalf of israel and there's stories in there one angel killing so many of the wicked evil people won okay and God sent them at the request of this group who were in agreement who represented him on the earth he absolutely will do that and he still does in some groups who pray and cry out to God to do things for him he does answer that but that army was made for one reason they don't defend heaven they don't defend the trinity they're here to war with us and that scripture clearly says that so yes we have a great authority christ himself was the lord of hosts he said walking as a man if i wanted to i could call the army of heaven to come and fight on my behalf but i'm not going to do that and he said that to the sanhedrin when he was standing before them you know they were spotting off we'll just do what we want to to you he actually made those words so that was a that was a clue if he walked as the son of man and the son of God he could have called the army himself said get down here right now fight these individuals i'm not going to be killed i'm not going to be crucified they would have come and wiped them all out but he couldn't do that because he had to die for our sins so there's there are scriptures that talk about this and most people don't understand but i promise you right now since 2014 a scroll was opened in heaven and i saw it and the scroll read itself it is time for the host of heaven to complete their destiny being commanded by the believers on planet earth and when that happened that we entered it in a whole new time in the spirit realm for us to be commanders like christ wow wow wow wow that's so good that's our time um tell people how they can get ahold of you i see we have revealingheaven.com up on the screen and then you have another you have another site too yes i have a revealinghaven.com is about my corporation i'm a ceo of a corporation one quest international and God commissioned us to reveal and create heaven on earth with products that represent heaven instead of the darkness and then i have Katker.com which is uh my spiritual platform for God to save whatever he wants there's a lot of revelation on KatKerr.com and if you want to give to me online that is the only way you can do it online there's no other if there's other things out there there's fake uh there's a lot of face fake Kat facebooks and there's a lot of fake youtubes but but my actual websites are the only place where number one you can get products on revealingheaven.com or sign up to become a part of our guardian zone on KatKerr.com and you know people are always going to fake things to try to use them i know some of the fake facebooks will say give money to these missionaries i'm collecting it and it looks like me saying that there's my face on and everything but that's not me i don't i don't do that i will always come separately to do that uh maybe at an in-person meeting i may take up stuff for other people or other groups but i'm not going to do that online because then everybody else would be would be getting away with it so i think we even have a brand new fake facebook page and this is the way you can tell if it's mine if it has a proper date when i open my facebook they the only facebook puts the date you started on there so anything that's got a new date saying that's me it isn't me i think you can go in somewhere how do you find that jen you have to go in to where it says about and there's a place on the facebook page it says about me and if it when is the date it says it um your facebook page was created in april of 2016. april 2016 that facebook page better say and about me it better say that's when my facebook page was created that proves that that's my personal one people are creating them right now and it's saying this year you know this year this page was created this year that's not me and that's probably a tip for you also steve that if people go in and they want to try to pretend they're fake that they're you so they can get money they're getting money for their self and i will not tolerate that i don't charge for people to watch my videos i don't put commercials on those that's youtube or facebook so i can't control when they do that it's not on my own it's on the other on these other ones and people get paid for that so you know what we have to continue our life and our race to do what God wants us to do but there are things that you can do to uh to stop those people from doing that okay well kat thanks again and very very much let's see tomorrow folks uh timothy dixon i've been calling him truck driver and prophet timothy dixon he's about to now be a truck driver the lord's pulling him off the road it sounds like which is good because he's just he's devoting himself to the lord and then on friday is yvonne yvonne atiyah she's had many trips to heaven and she's going to be sharing more about that each each time we have her on as well so she's going to be a regular along with our others we just have a real spiritual uh bond i guess you could put so thanks again kat thank you to all your team thank you to my team and we'll see you all again tomorrow bye

well good morning everybody happy wednesday march 24th it's 11 12 a.m for the state of oregon here i've got one of my gifts my patriotic tie i've got two or three versions that look similar to this so the swirls are different and the flags are different places but there's another one that arrived the other day a different kind of a patriotic pattern that someone sent me and it got separated from the envelope so next time when i wear it the first time i'll point that out but i'm not sure if i know who to thank for it because it got separated by accident uh anyway welcome to uh wednesdays with kat and steve uh be sure we're gonna bring her on in just a moment be sure to subscribe to elijah list.com so we can give you an update on anything and everything that's happening uh on the youtube channel we want you all to subscribe if you possibly can go to youtube.com and when you're there type in the search box elijah streams one or two words of work once you're on a larger streams then do this let's see if jeff is ready for that he may he he's forgotten he can't find it there it is thumbs up subscribe and click the bell so do that one more time when you get when you get us up hit the thumbs up hit the subscribe and click on the bell and that way your devices will be notified whenever there's anything new i use it exclusively because i can go right to any of the programs i want in the order on the video tab it shows it in the order they were taped and are there it tells me which of the most popular shows who are the most popular speakers tells me how long it is and so it's a lot more intuitive and easy to grasp and if you're trying to find one show at a time from days and days ago on facebook that's so that's a hard task um jeff i forgot to prepare you for this but do you want to run the zafa commercial this is our uh social media if you if you're prepared for that we'll run [Music] [Music] all right i love that commercial we'll do some more clever ones along the way we're just having fun growing it be sure to try and uh i should say try i would get sign up and register for zap but we're very facebook like it's very intuitive we're fixing bugs as we go we hired a new coder yesterday to help us with our app the app you can find zap it in the app store for um either android or iphone technology and you can say what you want of a conservative nature you will not be cut off or censored if you say i don't like planned parenthood they're killing babies we're not going to cut you off for saying that so uh i want to say one thing real quick about the facts is we get hundreds of requests demanding that we tell you whether God says you can or cannot shoot or should not take the vaccination i have to tell you that there are fine christians on both sides of this issue people that love the lord with all their heart there are people who totally believe this is science is good the science of the facts is good they say they're not worried about the mark of the bees and they're going to take them back so we don't cut there are people on this list who are that way there's other people on this list who who will never take it i'm the one i'm among those i'm not going to take the vaccination i don't trust it i don't think it's the mark of the beast but i don't trust it i'm trusted for health wise and i don't know if they put things in it that they shouldn't put in it so we don't ask Kat every other way people are writing and they're kind of twitter painted to use a word and they'll say please don't ask Kat if if it's a sin to take the vaccination she answered that a long time ago said no it's not they've asked if if it's the mark of the beast he said no it's not they've asked her if she's going to take the vaccination and she said no i'm not i'm not Kat's not my wife's not probably most of you are not but we don't we're we're not medical doctors we don't have the right to tell you that it doesn't work or that will harm you we are um ministers of the gospel and prophetic people so uh what's your way to get a shutdown is if we took one hard stance on it and said you must do this and we must not do that we could be shut down and then then people say well you should be brave enough to say this or that well we could be brave enough and then be shut down what but what good did that do us so let your conscience be your guide it's not taking the mark of the beast if you try and stay healthy i don't intend to take the vaccination others of you watching are perfectly happy to take it um you know we just have to do what we what we feel to do the bible talks about don't don't i'm going to paraphrase it but to stay out of disputable matters don't don't get into each other's face about disputable matters of the law or anything else so that's a disputable matter because fine christians are on both sides of that issue so we don't tell you what to do on that okay i think oh one one last thing today we're pushing out in fact it may be in your um inbox right now here on elijah list we're sending out the last notice for the rice conference which starts in friday it's a friday saturday there's about 20 speakers i don't have the list in front of me but uh four of them are with us here nathan Kat Kerr steve schultz johnny elizabeth enlo uh benny and bill johnson and the list goes on and on great main people and each of the presentations of these 20 people like 20 minutes long so you won't have these long drawn out things but everyone's going to give you their best best best revelation for this hour so it's going to be really good at 69 and that helps pay for the people to and we spent weeks and weeks and weeks weeks getting ready for this so that helps us pay the bills and all of that all right so without further ado let's bring in kat Kerr the pink revelator hey how are you kat i'm great thanks good to see you so i don't know if you wanted to add anything else that i said about did you hear what i said about the vaccinations yeah i will add a little bit if that's okay sure go ahead i also know people just like you said on the list some are adamant we need to take it it's going to help everybody be safer uh then we have them to say i'll never take it they can't force me to take it well i will confirm what you said i'm not taking it why would i okay my first question is why i have nothing wrong with me i'm not in any kind of a place that i might be compromised my own life right now i'm extremely healthy happy and i'm listening to what God says and so well i'm not taking it my family my immediate family is not taking the vaccine and again i know people on both sides friends good friends who know somebody they know a family they had a lot of people in it one died and it didn't even necessarily was from the vaccine everyone else who took it was fine on the other side i know somebody who had a husband and wife both took it and one died and one did not now the thing is this i know that there's many different types and forms of that vaccine which is true there's about four or five different versions of it this is the thing i may have trusted it when trump was sitting where the villain fraudulent person is sitting but because they're not i won't trust it i'm like steve i don't trust it i don't know what's in it i don't know the makeup of it i know there's sources that have so many conspiracy theories almost about anything you can think of today there's a theory for it i'm not taking it that's my answer and i will not take it and i would suggest if you are not in any way prone to thinking you have symptoms why would you all right i don't think putting anything extra in your body is necessary if you're already healthy so that's my answer on that i've had things from both sides say both things you have to do it gives you peace seriously if you're very concerned about it then don't do it if you think maybe this might help me pray again before you go make sure you still have that peace but my recommendation for myself and my family is we are not even considering it and if they demand i take it before i travel then i won't be traveling and for an example the royal caribbean cruise lines which i always speak on i will not be speaking on them until it's changed because right now they're saying that you must have the vaccine and proof of the vaccine to come on board that means even the speakers or you have to have a an exam that says you're perfectly clear from any symptoms whatsoever but i think right now they're changing that more and more as we go along for the protection they say of everyone on the ship so i will not be speaking on royal caribbean not this year anyway so here's my my say in all of that do it gives you peace but i say if there's nothing wrong you're healthy why bother that's good now some of you may remember manuel johnson came on and said God transported him into 2022 he was in california he said in california in 2022 there were no masks anymore it was gone so if that's if that was accurate and we have no reason to believe it's not uh things are going to look good and to that end let me just add more one more quick thing we are so confident that that's about to go away that we have been arranging an israel trip uh for those of you watching kat Kerr is going to be our featured speaker on that trip uh we did this about two years ago well it'll be three years ago by the time it's a year from now it's april april of 2022 i think is the day i think it bridges april may we're going to do a Kat Kerr's steve schultz elijah's dreams tour of israel uh it'll be a big one because we have a real loyal following here through a live stream so get ready we'll announce it officially in the next couple weeks to give you a link to sign up with so that'll be fun i want it oh yes it was really a life-changing experience in every way and uh the other thing i probably should add also is that God did tell me himself that he would take the virus off the earth so that would not and not exist anymore i also do know like manuel the mask will be a thing of the past and i in the in the near future i saw no mass no i don't know if that was a year two years three years but i know there were no masks at the time that i was taken there the virus was not even mentioned and just so you know this the numbers are literally going down and continue to go down on that i think the other side the left would like for us to stay masked and so distant so that we can't communicate with each other we all know that well most of you should know that by now but even that's ending i think people americans will wait just so long for something they'll start doing what they know is their freedom right many of them are going back to work full time many of them are stepping out and just doing what in their normal life they would do so that's all a great sign even if the left doesn't like it you just can't trust any of those in leadership right now not not the ones in the in dc right now because their whole agenda is against us against america and if this is the first time you've heard it you've probably been hiding yourself in a hole uh all the things that they want to happen are all very negative act some of them actually break and misuse our constitutional rights so i don't trust them at all in any way i do know they will be replaced again i might as well start right now trump is actually at this moment our actual president he won the election many things are still going on behind the scenes and you may hear about some of them coming up really soon especially about communications yay but then they're definitely starting to happen in the country in the people and and the plans to uh take back our country that's good now one lady wrote and she said could you ask Kat uh next several have written but maybe two or three and one of them said can you be sharing house Kat to tell us which things she's getting from the lord and which things she has natural knowledge of so i don't know if there's a way you can address that because as prophets the bible says we know in part we can't not know what we know and then we are we're prophesy apart so God's told you so God took you into the future and showed you being president that's not natural knowledge that's supernatural knowledge right that's called revelation and almost everything i say is revelation i'm here to share revelation that comes from the mind of the father it's what he says over what man says a very few things number one i never will research anything he doesn't let me research i don't listen to other people's things sorry out there i don't listen to their blogs i don't watch their other stuff that's going on i don't read other people's books he won't let me do that he wants my soul to be free of any kind of clutter other than what he says so i'm not online looking to see what everybody else is saying doesn't happen i don't do that it's really good there's a lot of directly from him and when he said he'd take the virus off the earth that was him when he said the mask would be a thing of the past that was him when he said trump would be put right back as as sitting as their president that was him that income from anybody else's mind that came from him that's good and i think one more thing today is march 24th i'm going to start saying that because so many people are taking videos and saying they're from two years ago or some from two years ago they're saying they're for now and that happens a lot to me so i've had probably so many requests please give the date so today is march 24th 2021 that's good that's good yeah that there's an unethical behavior out there it's basically against the law but people are getting away with it they download this video they did it to me they've been doing it almost every day we have a new report and it's illegal it's illegal to do that but they download it they cut it down to some of the parts they cut off the beginning they cut off the end and they make it look like it's their own production that they did this video and they're making money by putting advertising on is extremely unethical we record it every time we can because uh it's not that we don't want it out there but it's the ministry that's putting it out we want the ministry to be responsible for it and we want people to know the date that's why i said the date at the beginning of every show as well yes the same thing i mean i think we make it to the point where we put it on a subscript where it's always on the screen where they can't take it off that way that would be a good idea i actually was thinking about that myself to have a way to do that and then there's no way they they just wouldn't have the video right they wouldn't be able to say that but it's happened almost from the beginning of me speaking there's like four or 500 hours of me on youtube talking about heaven and that's because a lot of people of course have have shared in senate places but i think i've probably talked that many times and there's so many different dates people don't know if it's for now if it's four years ago and so i'm going to start doing something i will come up with something also so that people know the actual date that we're doing which i think is important if you're making prophetic statements it's very important to know what day you've said that yeah it is i mean there's people i've stumbled on this three or four times someone did it and i didn't know at the first that they were copying i thought this must be their channel because you have to look closely sometimes to find out and then they'll begin to prophesy and this has happened the other day and some one of the prophets said i'm telling you this is what's going to happen um next year in 2021 i thought wait a minute this says was this was put online five hours ago it was from last year so be very careful about when you're watching our stuff it should say either from character or theKatKerr i think it's facebook yeah the same thing also people do it to make money they put it on their own youtube channel or create a new youtube channel and youtube pays you for putting commercials on there if you watch a video of me and it's got like eight commercials that is not for me i don't do that i don't allow commercials on my own and people are making a lot of money doing that so either report it as a fake or just don't watch theirs okay because the Kat Kerr uh that's what it's called but we found someone who put the hyphen Kat Kerr and almost nobody notices it and that's a fake one so it says the Kat Kerr no other punctuation marks no other words in there and so you're right steve you have to be careful about what you're watching but like i don't um i myself don't like commercials but i know people are making i mean i wouldn't want to watch somebody for two hours and have 16 commercials definitely not my site okay that's you yeah and we are we are one of those that do allow the commercials because it brings some good income to the to the ministry but it's i don't i hope it's not 16 in in two hours i think it's probably like five or six but i don't know for sure i watch other people's and the commercials pop up and i think oh a commercial and then seven seconds later i'm back on i don't even miss a syllable so i i've allowed it to go because the income and by the way i'll just say this to those that are watching and even to you i understand that they're not watching the commercials but we've theorized that the reason we're still on of course you have your channel too so this that would not we've theorized that one of the reasons they haven't just shut us down because we've been pretty well and they're faced with what we say is because youtube is making money off of our channel so then we thought well this may be why everyone else is getting booted off and we're not you're right because we talk so much about heaven i think it kind of i don't know i think it kind of maybe softens it but you're right about the views i mean it's going to a million views a week and they're totally making money on other people even if not me they're doing it with other people because of the content and they do know that it draws people why would they cut off their own sub their own substance if they're able to have commercials and i'm not against all commercials i know some were so ridiculously disgusting not on yours but i don't know if you get to pick or choose which type there's some choice i think there's some choice but i don't know when they started all this it was anything and everything and i don't see them doing that now but in the beginning when they had the commercials it was like they were you know showing them from hell no that's not good at all so far i think we're okay but we'll find out yeah listen we're where uh we let a lot of time go by well let's ju did you say anything else you want to say about sharper did you get that in no i just know new things are going on and i might as well say this because it's being passed all over right now he is considering trump literally is considering this is true came from his administration he's considering having his own a network or someplace or create something where it can't be booted off where instantly you know instagram cuts them off facebook youtube they all cut them off they're so afraid why do they do that they're afraid of his words they're afraid of getting all of us inspired and empowered and excited about our lives so he's going to do something about it and i will tell you that is truth that is true that that is from here from earth it is from his own administration that he is going to come up with some type of network or way that he can uh send things to anybody everybody the millions of people who used to follow him uh i miss him myself because number one he was quite entertaining and i think that was the only one but they came to me on they came to me automatically it doesn't not i i don't go and look for other people's stuff so i don't want what God gave me i'm talking about the prophet prophets now or anybody any five of anybody i don't want what they're saying if it doesn't line up with God i don't want it in my soul and therefore what you hear from me is 99 is what God has said that's good good very good well let's jump into questions about heaven if you if you all or anyone on is brand new and there are always brand new people every show uh Kat's been to heaven thousands of times God sometimes walks to the wall and on the earth and so she has a lot of revelation she calls herself a revelator as much as a prophet right yes actually that's the title that God gave me when he told me to write the book he said you'll call yourself a revelator he said the those who don't like you won't know what to say about you because i'm not calling you a prophet they can't say you're a false revelator because they don't know what it is and that was his purpose for doing it a revelator is someone who's like a high level prophet who receives directly from God detail like john did in the book of revelations himself he was called a revelator and that was someone who gives direct revelation from God to the earth and that was the title he gave me that's good that's good well let's jump in these questions and i'm going to the first one's going to be something we might little take a little chuckle with but i'm going to go ahead and hear this lady she's been asking me for a few weeks now he says please ask my niece and nephew my niece and nephew this is not really a question about heaven but it may be something that you know or don't know because my niece and nephew love bigfoot and she wants to know is there really a bigfoot and i'm going to add to that question this is my part i'm going to say whether or not there is is there any creature in heaven that looks like standing up on two feet with long hair like someone would see a big thing have you ever seen anything like that in heaven so i'm going to ask those two questions together i've never heard of one being on the earth i think and i do know for sure this is head knowledge everybody the people do that for a living that live up in the mountains in the area where there's been sightings and people have photographs or they have an encounter some say they can talk some say they can't talk it always changes around but they're trying to lead to one thing that they're really here and they're actually people who dress up and that's what they do for a living they go up in the hills and the mountains and and um do these kind of crazy things just like people try to pretend like there's real aliens and uh that goes in that whole thing okay i know there's unicorns in heaven we know there aren't any on the earth right now God had them all in heaven but i have never seen bigfoot down here i can't confirm well i can confirm to you is what i have been shown and most of what have been shown is in heaven and yes yes absolutely yes there are creatures that you would call bigfoot or sasquatch or whatever they want to call them i absolutely have seen intelligent creatures why because there's creatures there we don't have here why because God created them for up there and so like i've said i've seen unicorns in heaven they're really there i've seen little tiny beings that you would call a fairy but they're small angels and all those things up there haven't seen a leprechaun yet or a mermaid because we'll always get those questions after i talk there are creatures huge creatures i would say probably close to 20 foot tall that looks like that and most of them are part of the army of heaven the army of heaven is mostly made up of super intelligent creatures designed by God to fight against the army of darkness and that's where i saw them i saw them in the in the area where michael's headquarters are in heaven and i saw some that were like not that that being but i've seen some beings that would be like 200 feet high and the barracks they stay in or the areas they stay in the doorways are that high for them to go through so yes there are creatures like that in heaven you'll be delighted when you get there to find out exactly what's there that's good good good good okay now this is a follow-up and we talked last night last time last weekend ellen out of norway had a series of questions here's a follow-up you had said on the show that someone could create like if they're in heaven they said i want to have a necklace they could kind of speak that into existence or it would appear and then that became a question about can can they create anything can we once we're in heaven create anything and you said you can't create anything with a soul but there are things like you said everything is alive pictures are like grass is alive snow's alive so this person's saying well what's the difference if it's alive they understand the soul part but how what is life if it doesn't have a soul i mean she didn't even know how to ask this question you'll probably find that out when you get to heaven what the under there's things i talk about that there's no way in the human mind you cannot grasp or understand it if you aren't in heaven when i said let's use the snow for an example the snow is everything in heaven is alive there's life in it why because God is there his life flows through everything and into everything and so everything creates a frequency it has an existence that's probably the best i can do for you so if you take snow that is alive and you create something from it like you're going to play with it or something then for that short amount of however that time as you're playing that snow if you made a snowman would be alive it would play with you throw snowballs at you laugh and play but when your playtime was over it would just go right back down into the snow because it is the snow and it has life so that's probably the best way i can explain to you about that experience that you can't have on the earth and uh i would encourage everybody to make sure you receive jesus christ so you go there there's a plug for jesus well i got to see that stuff and i know so much more about having these things okay um this question is can you tell anything about what you've seen someone said you said you'd been back in time when jesus was younger i hadn't heard that but if you have what what can you tell us about jesus as a kid or as a youth what was he like did he have lots of friends did he have no friends did he work miracles for other kids what can you tell us about jesus he didn't really work miracles except at home and they weren't called a miracle and i was explained it great um extensively by jesus himself about that he said once he realized or God gave him the father gave me an understanding of who he was so he knew clearly remember in the caravan when jesus wasn't with them after a couple days they couldn't find him he was back where they had been visiting in the temple talking to the priest now probably possibly around that time he could have gone like eight or nine something like that uh he had freedom to run through the caravan to play i'm sure that he jesus was always a very responsible child and uh but he remember what he gave the answer when his parents said where were you when he said i had to be about my father's business he was talking about the father of God so at that point he knew who he was and i do know that he worked things in what you call a miracle at home it was normal for him to turn the water into wine that was normal mary would not have known to tell those people at the wedding you know that jesus knew what he was doing when he said do whatever he says you know she knew he was going to make wine out of water how did she know that he did it at home how did they know he could multiply food he did it at home okay i'm sure that none of them were ever sick because of his very presence in the home and you also realize in the scriptures when he came when they came looking for him if you remember that he was ministering somewhere and then his mother and his siblings came and started calling him to come outside and i'll tell you why they were doing they were ready for him to come home and that's the honest truth is what jesus said they were ready for me to come home they wanted back there where they had the food made and they had the wonderful wine from heaven and he looked to all of them and said now you are my mother you are my brother you almost says in other words his time was now to give to them to give to all of us and so he did know how to do those things and as God revealed those things to him he began at one time to meet him at the mountains it said he went away to be with the father that i mean back to heaven but he did it one time start going to meet him to be have time with him but as a child he grew up in egypt and that's actually scriptural when this when the um when the wise men came to bring the treasures jesus was not a little tiny baby at that time i know in every every sunday school christmas program you've ever been a part of i don't know if they still do that but back in the day every year we knew it was going to happen they would know a manger scene they would have baby jesus someone playing mother mary mary and his mother mary and joseph and they'd have the sheep maybe sometimes that was crazy the shepherds were there but then they would show the wise men come to the manger that's not what happened jesus was about two years old it took him two years to cross the deserts these three different kings or magi which are wise men bringing treasures treasures plural gold frankincense and myrrh fabrics all these beautiful things why so he would have his life pretty much already paid for and they needed it because soon after that happened was when word came the angel came and said leave here and flee into egypt because you know the wicked king was looking for them to take them down he was educated in egypt by the best scholars why they had the money they had supply jesus was popular even then because he had the ability to influence he had that as a gift in him to to share things beyond their own wisdom or understanding he captivated them and so they did like they liked him very much jesus even growing up i do know this also in his schooling like any other child you had to learn to read and write i'm sure he went to torah school that's where they taught you the torah i'm sure they were earmarking him to probably do that for his life although God had the plans so he knew the torah better than anyone else because he had these great educators but i can say this for sure the holy spirit told me one time as to be funny but was truth that jesus's favorite subject in schooling in his schooling was reading he loved to read he loved to see and understand things he loved stories you know even the father loves stories and that's why jesus told so many parables because that was in him what he didn't care too much for was writing and i do know that for a fact he would prefer reading over writing and he said that's why there were 10 commandments and not 20. that's good hey count what uh you know nowadays with people like yourself there's a and i know probably a handful now people who have got caught up to him many times you're the one that as far as i know has gone the most from my knowledge so jesus had the ultimate anointing on his life do you think throughout his young boyhood and even during his three-year ministry he was caught up to heaven to to to have meetings with the father during that time or even as a child i don't know that he was caught up to heaven i do know that he went to the mountains to be with him that's where he went to be with him uh just like you remember moses right i mean moses went there and um that's where he got the ten commandments remember that okay it was a place it was in a high place and so i'm sure that's where jesus went to meet with him the father did share things with him things that were going to be happening in his life and i do also know this when his name was the word the word was with God and was God and there wasn't anything that was made except that he made it that was the word that was the father the word and holy spirit in the beginning the word was willing to come to earth and die for us and that's when he began to be called jesus christ yahshua messiah all those other things began to be attached to who he was but when he was the word and they created everything God would speak something and the word would step out and make it that's how they did it i know that before the word ever came and died on the cross before God made him into a seed that's what he did made him a new seed and then the holy spirit brought him down planted him in the womb of mary that's how that happened that he knew all the things that would happen he knew before he came he was told everything that would happen before he ever came but being born as a baby in the earth is called the son of man there were times growing up this little tiny thing he had to begin to learn himself to hear God so crawling around on his hands and knees and being a little baby i think that's mainly what he did and he began to speak but there was a point in his life where he had great understanding he knew he was the son of God he knew the father in heaven was his father his life began to drastically change then and so at an early age which is why i tell people and go to people talk to your children when they're three when the four when they're five about the things of God where they came from who he is who jesus is uh i myself got born again at age four i knew exactly what i was doing as a seer literally jesus stepped into me as a foolier i did and so i know christ had many encounters with the father and once he had the understanding why would he say it must be about my father's business he told him he had an encounter with him where he told him that things are going to be different now so there's things we will find out when we get to heaven but there are many things he did show me and tell me about himself growing up he had a wonderful life in egypt i will say that living in a hovel with nothing uh they had plenty to take care of themselves amazing i have a question about you said he made him a seed and i don't know if this is specific what you meant but i've always wondered many times the angel comes and visits mary and and says you're going to be with child and he's going to be from the holy spirit though the holy spirit overshadows her and the assumption is at that moment that's the assumption jesus mary was pregnant uh not conceived by man and that and you can correct me if that's not the case but it seems like at that moment my question is is the lord ever shown you in the past history jesus saying goodbye to his father and the father waving his hand and suddenly jesus is now a baby without uh knowledge of heaven for a season what would what i would say a very short season i know the angels were always around him i mean when he left they came with him and i i was shown quite a bit actually we'll probably be in one of the movies we produce one day where people see all this revelation i'm talking about but i can share it i can share this part i did see the part where they were saying uh they were they were embracing each other and the lord uh the word knew his life would be never the same because he only had a spiritual body a powerful spiritual body filled with creative he was God willing to have flesh put on him he'll always have the flesh forever now he can still be as big a tall or small jesus can but he knew it would never be the same and he knew there'd be a season as he was growing he would come to the understanding the father shared every bit of this he shared the cross with him all of it he had to say yes before he came so it was like anything else when he asked us to do something he said yes he said yes before he came he said yes again in the garden to the father that he would go that he would drink that cup with all the evil in it that he would go to the cross he was even told by the father on the third day in hell i will raise you up and they will know they can never touch or use or harm a righteous person hell would have no right to hold a righteous person in hell and he knew that all everything would happen but at that three days in hell which we're approaching what we represent that time when when he came off the cross he descended himself into abraham's bosom then he crossed over to hell and they took him they were afraid the father would come and get him so they didn't do anything to him for a couple days and then satan was going to do a big show about torturing the son of God and on the morning of the third day when christ stands up in the midst of all this evil and fire starts shooting out of his hands and he melts the faces of the principalities and powers strips satan of all his royal garb takes every gemstone out of his wings and then takes the keys of hell death in the grave why that was taking back our authority it was on the cross it was done when he said it is finished christ meant for our for our salvation for our salvation he would have never gone into hell to take back our authority that adam gave away and that's what he was doing on the third day and then he left satan in a heap of dust and just beat the pieces and then he ascended back up and that at that point that's when miriam saw him at the tomb and then after that he said i have to go to my father that was the first time he was with the father literally with the father since the time that he probably was um became from the word into a seed and you're right when the holy spirit hovered over mary the holy spirit planted that seed which was christ in her womb that's how it happened it wasn't done by man and then of course jesus grew just like any other little baby and then so it's this is powerful revelation to understand when you see this whole thing especially on the movie screen one day you'll be so moved you won't ever be the same again but there were things he did know a point of three days he had to wait not not having any contact with the father he knows what that feels like when you're waiting to hear from him and you don't hear he had to trust like every one of us and of course we know in the third day in colossians it said he spoiled and wasted and ruined principalities and powers in hell he stripped satan one of the gemstones that he had when he kicked him out and then it says he took the keys of hell death in the grave and then eventually went back before the throne of his father to present the keys to him that's actually what happened in these days approaching that we're going to be celebrating celebrate it like you never have before because he didn't just die for your salvation he went into hell and wiped up hell to take back our authority as believers and that's why we have the right to come against all darkness it's really really good awesome okay i apologize i stepped away that i had to sign for a package and no one's here that i have no idea how to do this so i just got up and did it okay so um here's one and it's a little bit lengthy i'm going to read it fast i might skim it just because of its importance i'll i don't normally read one that's this long my son tyler it's with my tanya my son tyler passed away suddenly at the age of 30 two years ago he was raised in the church we had times in his life that he lost his way i prayed so hard for salvation his whole life i don't think you've ever been asked this question before i'm not sure i'm struggling to praise God after my son's passing because i'm afraid if he didn't make it to heaven that every time i worship God the devil will punish my son for this my question is what should i do is it okay to ask God for a sign about where my son is and if i do and don't receive an answer is God trying to spare me more heartache God i am i'm assuring you even as i'm sitting here i'm really very much assured that his son is in heaven why because he stood for his salvation and he said he did jesus won't let your words drop to the ground we have a promise that you and your household shall be saved and the very fact that he took the keys what those keys represent so terrified satan that christ took those keys away from him why did satan have him why was he terrified he took him away it gave christ the right and the authority even at the moment of death if you have made a stand for your family member to know jesus christ he has the right to appear to them and say do you want me now and i've been i've been shown several times that actually happening with people i've been taken into a time where i saw people and was actually there watching when christ presented himself i've heard other people's stories especially a story about a jew whose parents were very devout jews loved God with all their heart and they had great friends these great friends would pray for their salvation all the time to know jesus christ as their messiah and this young man who did not want christ didn't want to receive him was suffering because his parents had died and he started having nightmares and by the way the devil can give you nightmares tell them you're not receiving them show them burning in hell because they didn't know jesus now this is the devil if he's trying to convince you of that then what he's probably telling you is just the opposite of what happened and so this young man cried out to christ himself find me i need to know i want to know this says this is a real story christ appeared to him and said because of your parents believing in God himself they were counted righteous and because they were kind of righteous with their stand that i had the right to appear to them they are both they both received me they're both in heaven i'm here to let you know yourself you have the right to receive me also but your parents are not burning in hell that is a lie from the devil and so there's so much other evidence that this happened so i would say to that father you need to go before God and said thank you for rescuing my son i give you praise and glory and i promise you waves of the peace of God will begin to consume you and if you have those thoughts anymore you're trying to tell the devil i'm not taking your lies anymore i know that God because of because of the stand that was made that my my son is in heaven that's so good now that woman's life is going to be changed forever with that that he just made her day and he made my day too okay this is the we get these unpardonable sin questions from time to time i have been worried for many years that i've committed the unpardonable sin this is from ann it worries me so much that i feel like i won't make it to heaven i'm a believer in christ and born again i'm afraid i have done something that has been tied to an unpardonable sin or as i have been blaspheming the holy spirit what exactly is the end part of a sin is you know it's like she's telling you i don't want to be lost and she doesn't understand right why i know you have not committed the impartable sin you are worried about it exactly when someone has committed the impartial sin that would be what satan did almost no one almost no human on the earth has committed the unpardonable sin satan committed satan will never be pardoned for what he did lucifer knew what he was doing he knew the living God he lived with him he knew that it was wrong what he was doing there is no pardon for him he will never be pardoned for that sin that is the unpardonable sin when you turn your back on God and you hate and despise him well you're saying you're a believer if you're a believer you don't hate and despise God okay you wouldn't care if you had if you committed the impoverished sin you wouldn't care you would never care you would actually put in people's faces so you have not committed the unpardonable sin because you have grief in you that was not true what people were saying to you they probably heard the enemy say that if you've heard it more than once the enemy's beating you up with it turn to the enemy and say you're lying i'm not receiving the words you said i believe in jesus christ i'm my i am righteous and according to that my life will be in heaven amen you receive christ by his blood that gives you entrance to heaven the devil will beat you up with whatever you let him so you're headed for heaven let me ask a cousin question if if somebody is uh tortured that's not me but if someone says back when i was young in a young marriage before i got married whatever they could they point to something that they did that was bad uh really bad or maybe they had an affair with somebody or something that they have never gotten over guilt bothers them to this day and they they pray for God to both forgive them and to remove the guilt and they can't get rid of the guilt what would you say to them they can't get right i wish you when you lose that you lose whatever that was from your soul you lose that uh what you could call a trauma for him if it's a trauma for them now if they're still thinking about it that is the devil trying to beat you up if you have repented for that it says that if we repent of our sins jesus is he's just and righteous he will cleanse us from all unrighteousness that means that's not held against you the devil's trying to hold it against you because you know what the devil knows what goes on but you've been forgiven for that you loose what that is that you keep seeing and thinking about you have to lose the words you have to lose that lose the actions from your soul you've been forgiven don't keep it loosen in jesus name and then you say a bind the love and the life of God to my soul and you will not ever have that happen you again you'll never think about it again when sins are forgiven God remembers them no more so the one bringing them to remembrance that would be the devil that's good very very very good um okay this one i'm going to just paraphrase because it's a little bit long but she's saying i know Kat says this christmas town and i know she's saying christmas is not bad but how do i recline the ugly truth of our early christmas decorations and origins of the christmas holiday with what Kat seen in heaven because there's another place she says but they christmas has these pagan roots how do you tell release someone like that to enjoy christmas without all that worry about pagan this or that i would say to do the same thing loose all that loose all those lies because they are lies people can say all you want to this was created on the earth this was a an occult this was a pagan thing guess what the things they're lying about are normally things that are good that are in heaven satan will twist what is in heaven to make it something evil on the earth like the symbol of the eye saying that's the illuminati not no sorry that is the eye of God that is the ever seeing eye of God and satan knows it so he'll twist it make it into some weird secret society that doesn't make it bad that God made it so guess what christmas town has been in heaven before these secret societies and these wicked pagan rituals because they make a pagan ritual they're going to use some form of truth in it doesn't make that bad so God according to God christmas is a good time of the year it's called it's actually called christ's mass is the time to celebrate christ literally and i know there's going to be always secret societies and wicked groups they're still out there they're still growing they're still being made by satan that that that does not take away the joy and celebration of what God has made available to us so whether satan likes it or not so whether satan likes it or not christmas time is in heaven it's a place to go celebrate the birth of christ only he gives the gifts out it's there and you'll have that understanding when you get there but if you keep getting beat up or people keep pointing this is man man's pointing but this is evil no if it's human sacrifice that's evil okay i get that that's evil the misuse and abuse of drugs and stuff human trafficking those are evil practices by something as beautiful as the glory and splendor of the birth of christ that's still celebrated in heaven today that one thing that there that time that christmas time of the year when people love when they forgive when they help others that in itself is not an evil thing it's so good good good now karen we've talked about uh many times now about pets going to heaven so that's a subtle thing our pets do go to heaven but this person's saying glenda wants to know what happens to our pets um her question is when our pets leave the earth after they die who meets them to take them home to heaven have you ever seen anybody meet a pet or how does that go your own guardian angel takes your pet i've always known that my guardian angel took my own pet when she of course i've known this for years and years um a few years ago when my own yorkie passed away and she waited till i came back off the road i was traveling and speaking the holy spirit said she'll still wait to say goodbye she had her own way of greeting me and um i did pray and i told God i said okay i've said goodbye i've loved honor and spent time with her and i said so come and take her my own angel which i knew would take her so my own guardian angel took her her spiritual body my dog's spiritual body took her up to heaven i've seen my own dog appear a couple times in the clouds her spiritual body appear so your own guardian angel will take your pet to heaven by the way you've talked about humans looking down through the portals and God creates this portal in heaven you can go look at your family of a special are you saying that your pet can look down and see you they make special places i don't know if we've ever talked about that they make pet portals they're in the ground itself like they don't go in a building and walk up steps there's places i've seen them a couple times i've seen pets around them looking down over the ones that were their masters that took care of them and of course they love them they can't wait to see them again too but yeah pets can look down and see you on the earth and i would say to everyone whether you have a pet in heaven a family member in heaven or a friend in heaven stop grieving over them i understand it hurts when they're not there but when you think about this beautiful place filled with the love and the life of God they celebrate life all the time it isn't just when they come home to heaven and they do still love you they do still think about you so i just want people to know you need to lose grief at one point if you're still grieving a year later you say i choose to lose grief from my soul uh you don't want that to tear your life apart they don't want to look down from heaven and see you in such a turmoil and agony that you can function as a normal person especially if you're like a parent and a child dies this is a the hard part you can't make the other children feel like they have no value because all you talk about is the one who's not there if they could come back they would say hey mom hey dad make sure you take care of my brothers and sisters too because they need you you know they're living in heaven it's not that they don't want you or don't care but i do know they would say things i hear them saying things like that over the portal you know please make sure you hug and you love my my brothers and sisters saying this to their parents if they they died young so i would say that's a given for anyone from the time and step out of this body they're engulfed in the love and the life of God their whole appearance even changes their young life comes from them and they're filled with excitement and expectancy they want you to feel the same way it's hard we need to have a celebration depot when people go home to heaven that's true it makes me think of you know about three or four years ago we had to put down our dog angel was her name see that's a horrible cancer we tried everything to get her healed and pray but but it was time and then doreen it was really drean's dog you know doreen and she this is when i think it was a two or three day process where she began to see sink in such grief she was feeling herself going a dark deep hole and she realized this was not great from the lord especially we had been told the same day that she passed someone saw it they wrote to her and they said i saw your dog up in heaven playing with other children who also died of and so with that word and she had to literally choose to stop this sinking that was happening what would you tell us how would you tell someone that's starting to be pulled down and un you know that's why it talks about this you know the sting it talks about this thing uh when there's death or it talks about the grave and and all that there is a sting in your soul because you've been separated this is what happens you make a soul tie with those you love whether it's your pet sometimes people don't even have family members they only have a pet there's nothing wrong with loving your pet there's nothing wrong with the hopefully you're loving your family members when that song tie is cut because they're not there and they're part of your life which you know we should love our family members not that they they matter to us there is like a there's a vacancy there where they were you need to say jesus fill that with you the other thing you need to say sincerely anytime i find anyone who's about to go to a funeral or they've lost someone a hat i say please say these words about your family remember i choose to loose you to release you to release you into the the destiny that jesus has for you in heaven i release you into his arms for destiny and your life in heaven and something will happen on the inside almost joy will start to spring in and that will happen even with your pet uh whatever it is because grief can really harm and hurt people and it's like you get to the p of despair is where she was going despair is not a good thing because there's this oppression depression and then despair and after despair it's um that's where the thoughts of suicide start to come in and you don't want that to happen so anyone out there no matter what's going on in your life if you're always oppressed you need to say i choose to lose all oppression and and all fear all agony all suffering any grief in these spirits of grief i lose them from my soul and i bind to my soul the joy of celebration in life in heaven it will help tremendously but you can't keep dwelling because this is what the devil does he'll replay and replay and replay and he'll beat you up and beat you up till he pulls you further down when you get to where you can't even hear what God is trying to say to you you're rejecting love from other people or even people trying to console you you don't want it maybe in the beginning that would be normal but let me tell you days later months later you should at least begin to feel a little bit of a freedom knowing that your family member and your pets are always going to go to heaven um so i just know that the devil if he couldn't get you if you can't get you into hell or get your family members he'll try to ruin your life and that's what he does and fear is still fear fear anguish agony suffering oppression depression despair all of those come from hell so don't let it ruin your life don't let it ruin your mind say father it was an act of my will to lose from my soul all fear all agony all suffering all grief all despair i loose it from my soul in jesus name and i bind to myself the life of God the love of God the celebration of life in jesus name and then that stuff won't be in here it'll be taken out because if it remains in your soul the devil will play that little thing movie over and over again to you no matter what the tragedy or trauma was he'll try to use it against you you can be free from that in jesus name really good really good okay now we've touched on something like this this is asking a different angle um so i don't have a name but it says if you are abused by your parents well you have to be friends with them in heaven i forgive them but do i have to be around them in heaven um again we're going to have to go to the pa the fact that there's a difference between heaven and earth on earth you're still thinking with your normal human mind you're remembering about all the sufferings and the agonies which by the way you need to lose all that trauma you need to lose if you were abused whether by a family member by other people if you were abused especially sexually lose that trauma from your soul because again the devil will beat you up and you will begin to think differently i'm not saying what they did was right it was wrong and God doesn't ever approve of that happening but in heaven from the moment you step out of this physical body and you're engulfed in the life and the love of God you will feel differently at that second when you see your parents in heaven one day they will embrace you and yes they will say it was wrong the way that we treated you we should have never done that we were we were listening or we belong to the devil when that happened we want you know that we love you and that life and that love will just consume you and you won't ever think of those things again it'll be gone from you because there's nothing but the life and love of God in heaven no one has trauma no one has horrible memories nobody is rejected nobody hates nobody avoids people in heaven so that's the difference between heaven and earth you're there with the maker you're there with the one who made you who loves everybody when forgiveness comes if they repented this is how God looks at it like it never happened just like when you got born again if you had sinned it's like it never happened to God so he would be unrighteous and unjust to throw people out because before they got born again they had done something bad that's the beauty of salvation so i would just say don't keep the trauma don't keep the memory in your soul if you want to have a good life yourself i think that's why God said one day there will be soul doctors on the earth i actually saw these little signs outside of doors and businesses and churches even in government offices one day there'll be a full doctor where people come in there to lose stuff out of their soul this is how important it is to God it's the keys to the kingdom he freely gives them to us but it's up to you to use them whether it was a trauma whether it was a tragedy and that invades your life and 20 years later you're still having nightmares or dreams stop letting it happen you choose to lose it out of yourself and some people because it was so severe might have to do it more than once but i'm telling you it will get better and better your mind will begin to be free your emotions will line up with what you just declared i it's i've seen the evidence i've seen evidence of it happening it will happen and so it's still done by faith but you have to take the step to do that don't let something that happened to you well even if it was five days ago but it was 10 20 years ago people will let it ruin their whole life because all that they can do is the devil replaced the trauma or the tragedy over and over especially if people are already in heaven they're up there saying please get rid of that please be free they want you to be free their self and so we have to think of things from God's perspective he made these things available for us to use that we might be free and guess what the truth which i'm speaking the truth will make you free not maybe it will make you free so this is truth he gives us to get rid of it while you're on the earth so you can live on earth like they do in heaven uh really good i guess we have time for one more question let's get this one in um this person asks why do we need guardian angels when we possess the holy spirit in us and we have God's presence and of course then there's the lord jesus christ um i mean you can take that to an extreme why do we need holy spirit within us if there's God so i mean what why do we need so the question is why do we need guardian angels when we already have all of God well let's let's go ahead and say i like the olive God thing first uh the fullness of the Godhead that would be the father the son and holy spirit you need all three i agree with that but God who is the father designed this plan that he would assign angels to you at your time of conception actually you'd always have somebody there watching over you and let me tell you when you get to heaven you go into these theaters that's about you minus no no there'll be no sin you will literally see how many times that angel those guardian angels saved your life you will know really in reality how many times did they save my life did they prevent me from doing not the good thing or the right thing what would my life have been like without them if you think about that he assigned them on purpose so you'd always have them with you to watch over you by the way they probably say things to you uh to try to get you to maybe do some the thing that is right they may even you may even hear don't turn left here right now don't go through that light right now that's probably them saying that to you because they're there and i've i've heard that and it stopped and the car would like run the light and so they're here it's God's plan he didn't want live in this life alone that's his presence with you all the time and i do know that with you from the time you're conceived they are the ones who will take you home to heaven sometimes jesus comes and takes you too but they're with you your whole entire life and they love you they care about you to me that is the thing of beauty that God did it's not like why do we need them of course them because he knows the beginning to the end he knows when you will need them so i would just say thank God for them being there when you and one question related to that related guardian angels you said before and i've heard this by other people they say your angel your angels or your guardian angel one or both can look like you when you say like you do you mean exactly like you does Kat Kerr's angel look like Kat if you can see it mine doesn't normally look like me but i know that there are probably times when they would have to represent you for whatever so it could be something to do with maybe even saving your life or preventing something happening in your life like of course as much as i know i don't know everything and i don't mind saying that i do know the purpose of him making things and i know how that operates but there would probably be times when i could see them looking like me like if maybe harm was coming or something they would appear as me and walk in a different direction or go a different way and maybe people would follow them thinking it was me to do harm then they would just disappear my own angels i know exactly what they look like they don't look like me but i can tell you why in a case like that yes absolutely yes they could look exactly like you if that was necessary wow okay good that's awesome well Kat that's our time you know below we have revealingheaven.com it's on the screen uh tell people that you have two sites tell them about both sides i think healingnevin.com is about my corporation that God said he wanted me to be a business person i am ceo of one quest international which creates and reveals heaven on earth and so that would be when you would buy products with all kinds of revelation in it uh like the cup i like to show the cup because i love this i don't do demons um there's all kinds of other stuff we have on there with all of them have revelation in them uh there's image of places like in heaven and stuff that you can see or get um and then my other also it's where you go to find out about our events mostly they've been online but i will be traveling again actually i also will be at the arise summit um this coming weekend with stephen and my hubby will be going with me um he's used to the cold and the mountains and i guess he'll probably be dragging me at mountains again like he did in israel anyway so um it tells you about events and products and KatKerr.com it's another whole website God calls it his spiritual

well good morning everybody it's wednesday march 31 11 00 we're a little late today 1108 a.m from the state of oregon on the pacific northwest region of the united states here we're in oregon washington state is above us and california is below us and they're all liberal at least in the big cities but guns people are everywhere and there's going to be a break out of we're hearing good things out of california modesto's having to break out there and so good news and bad news and all mixed in but God is in charge this is the day that the lord has made so we want to be rejoicing and be glad in it be sure that you subscribe to elijah.com it's always free comes your inbox 365 days a year including christmas we said prophetic words out and those are becoming more potent as well and we're putting each of the uh alive each of the well some of the best of the best of these recordings that you're watching here we then send out on by email as well once a week or sometimes twice a week so uh let's see i want to answer one question uh let's talk about youtube personal answer this other question be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel that's where all of our programs are listed you can see them at a glance listen to the one you want so you go to youtube.com and then you pull up in the search box elijah streams and when the elijah streams comes up then there's three things that you click on the bottom the thumbs up right there you click on subscribe and you click on the bell and that way you'll be your devices will be notified uh whenever we're coming on live so that's the best way to get on there let's talk about uh the chat let's see one of the biggest questions people are asking us is where do i submit my questions we get your questions about almost everywhere we get them from underneath youtube we get them on the comments and facebook and some people have an email uh that's the live just that's not necessarily the way to do it but we do see those there too the one place we do not get your questions is the chat off to the right side of youtube it goes by too fast we can't capture it um that fast so what you do if you want to leave your questions for youtube write it down at the end of the youtube program once it's over or if you're seeing it on a replay you just put a comment underneath the youtube screen and we do look at all of those so we're all at any one time or a couple hundred questions behind so 99.9 percent of you will never get your question answered live uh because we're so far behind every once in a while something is so potent we grab it and ask it live but normally that is not how it's density kind of gonna get in line with that so what else do i want to ask uh answer that i think that's it so today's Kat Kerr let's bring ken on in here hey Kat hi how are you doing good it was good seeing you sunday or this weekend out in bend oregon it was uh Kat and myself nathan french and johnny ello as far as our speakers here it was actually a johnny inland conference called the rice summit some of you uh were there you can get the replay if you were if you paid for it you can watch the replays so yeah it was really powerful yeah so how you then spoke on sunday i heard that was pretty good did you guys do something different on sunday i mainly prophesied corporately about the time that we're in and how that's going to change everybody and um it kind of lined up with the rise summit but you know the father just spoke it was really powerful uh to encourage people and show them some of the future like beyond even this time that we're in uh what things would be like in their lives so they can't look at what's going on around them right now and think that's going to be their normal it's not going to be their normal and i would also say this that um we had so many more people watching online than they ever thought they could have i think they ended up with around six thousand 45 minutes i believe is what they said was represented it was just wild but people know the truth right they want to know what's going on right now yeah it could actually i i could actually it may not may or may not be true for you but that was just by the numbers the single largest conference i've ever spoken at was 6 000 at least in the us there was one i did in africa that was like 15 000 but i was just uh i was the only white boy in town and they called me man of God in africa you know they're very very respectful uh to to those people who are they're they're very hierarchy oriented they there's a stepping it's just kind of the way it works in africa yeah the top dog in there and so we were a man of God and because there was a couple of us white speakers that were brought on over so you'd go to these conferences and outside they were selling all these pictures here's this whole row of pictures of of this white guy steve shelf speaking and people would buy photos on it's a really different kind of a culture and uh yeah they have these things for sales have you been over there yet to africa i have 25 invitations to go to almost every any of the major cities or places there but God said that he would have it for another time now i've spoken at some of those who came over here and had meetings and i was i spoke in america uh you know being a part of their conference here in america which was insane i think it went to like 100 000 people online everybody was watching everywhere in africa because of the speaker who was there that was bringing the meeting it was in atlanta and uh it was wild i think it was something from nigeria where they told town they literally pulled down the satanic altars uh the mountain opens and swallows them up um it was really quite something they talked about witch doctors and all this other stuff that we don't see a lot of that level of the darkness showing up but the glory was just as powerful so uh my husband's waiting for me to go i'll go then nigeria i remember again this is about 20 years ago and the worship was so profound and again there's like 15 000 people at any one time up front there's someone having a deliverance very often so throughout the service especially during worship someone would go there and they begin to manifest and then i remember i'll never forget he's beaten himself up you could tell he's beating himself up and it wasn't voluntary it was involuntary so he knew what kind of demon it was and it got more and more intense and finally he just collapsed and and was delivered and after a while was able to get up and and have his right mind but that's how we don't no we don't have that in our services no uh the enemy's been uh controlling so much of that country for so for probably centuries actually and now they got such powerful men and women and i from the speaker that brought me he said if you don't live that way you die if you try to come against those principalities not the principalities and powers but any principalities that are ruling me in the darkness they have real witch doctors who really fly and they do all kinds of sacrifices and stuff so you better be strong if you are just going to make a trip if you go there make sure it's God sending you there make sure you connect with somebody powerful over there because they're not it's not like a game not that it's a game here but it's so much deeper and farther there than here i will go and the people there know it because what they would take is from our hotel which is about a couple miles drive yes and and when they when we get in the car from the hotel they they'd stop and they would pray for for protection from the hotel to the church and when we left the church to go back to home they would pray for protection from the church to the hotel they prayed every time there was movement and it was a real life lesson for me it is it is a totally different lifestyle and culture over there like you said but the thing that happens is there's such damage done to the enemy's plans and even the hierarchy of hell that's there is shredded and pulled down when when we're when God sends us there the unperfect sentence there is for a powerful purpose to come into agreement with another leader of other countries who are wanting to rescue their people's lives from that darkness and i think probably more now than ever before i must we'll jump into that we're seeing some of that show up here in the in the laws and the regulations trying to be made by those who have fake authority here almost every regulation or thing that they're making is something that's wicked or evil and you see that all the time over in those other countries so whenever God can get somebody in africa in a high position as a man of God things swiftly change right there in that city or in that country so we're gonna see a lot of shifting and i can believe this for sure some of the greatest victories will ever have in our lives will happen to us probably over the next few months at least i have to say that things will begin to be seen so openly and while i'm at it let me just give you a tip trump has actually come up and finally opened his entire own new website that you can actually contact him freely or freely get information from him is 45 office.com and he launched it yesterday i can imagine how many people already signed up for but he'll be able to say what he wants to to all of us and i think that the left is very much concerned about that they they work so hard to keep us separated from someone who is our true leader and now he's back really he's back in that position and he'll probably be letting us know a lot of stuff that will be going on so people are very excited and happy about that but i will say this these days coming up depending on which side you're on the light or the darkness it'll be the greatest days of your life or the worst days of your life because when evil is disposed and pulled down it's going to totally affect those who thought they had gotten the right thing running after the right thing but when they find out the wickedness and evil that's behind all that it'll shock them but we'll need to pray for those people i've already had a couple prayer times for those people when the reality of the what they thought they were getting was just the opposite but on the right the side of the right and life there'll be massive celebrations in the streets like i've been talking about i know hank's been talking about it that literally they are going to happen and people will respond when God begins to shift it back in the way he is designed to operate in this time that's that's amazing well um how if i can ask the question this way how eminent is it are we like days away from seeing dramatic things what what is what is what are you saying no God won't give me a date he absolutely refuses to give me a date i don't ever ask him for a date i just keep on going with what he's given me and this is what he literally has said to me audibly you will say these words as long and as loud as you can that victory is coming justice will be served and all of the evil will be exposed and dealt with completely and those are exactly his words until he changes those words with me i can't say it's going to be this next week or next month i do know it's a lot closer than it was because number one at least we can see and hear the one who is a legitimate leader here in the country and now he's got a way we actually can receive from him if you go sign up and you get on his list you'll get every notice he has about what he's saying and doing that should empower people right there that we're no longer being canceled because he is overwhelmingly overcome he's got some of the greatest people in technology working for him and they won't be able to block a word he says they can't stop that and i know fear will begin to fall on those people when they realize this is what's going to happen first they themselves begin to realize their plan is crumbling when that happens hell will be able to begin to desert certain people in areas because even they realize it's not working and they're going to just withdraw because if they don't they will be in serious trouble with God himself because God's going to get really involved literally involved in all of this and because this is God's plan maybe not man's way i just know what's going to happen and all those who are backing or supporting uh this whole plan on the left they're all going to either run and hide or they may abandon it completely but one thing that will happen and you may even see it possibly in the news them bashing each other i'm talking about the highest leaders who are in illegitimate positions may start bashing each other or just crumbling even behind the scenes if you can't see it they're not going to show that they won't even show the truth about what they're doing in the news there's things they're hiding about the southern border and don't want you to know there's things that are hiding in other stuff they don't want you to know it because they still want to fake as much as they can by using the news but i will say this there are some people in the news media that are leaving because they know if their soul didn't get corrupted by listening to fake news their self then they already realized this whole thing is just falling apart i know people the new york times already know that the washington post they know that also even fox news some of the people in fox news i can't say all of them realize this is a horrible thing that they're trying to do and there will be no life for anyone if they succeeded so now even they are speaking against them which wasn't happening before so this should show you right there that things are beginning to happen even if they won't put it in their own in the fake news they won't say it okay but i know they themselves are concerned this thing wasn't wasn't planned well they just did whatever they could to get in that place uh that we all know is not true everyone in this country knows the election was stolen you know i think 90 of the note was stolen so the whole thing is crumbling now because people are starting to speak out and let me tell you that's how it starts their foundation is very weak and it's already falling apart there's no way they're going to be able to hold it together and the more they try is the worse it looks to people even people overseas are saying what's wrong with their minds can't they think right can't they speak right so even people in in the world are realizing this whole thing isn't going to last so that should make people very happy just from those words yeah someone had written to me and asked the question um i wasn't going to ask you but maybe i'll try it you don't watch the news uh really but someone will bring it to your attention did you see the clip where biden had fallen three times going up the steps did you see that i did see that somebody sent it to me i figured they would do when you see something like that does God speak to you through that did do you get a word of the lord when that happened yeah that that whole thing was really this no matter what they said they said it was the wind that's what they said they said it was the wind then they said his shoes were slippery they tried to make up everything this is the fake people that's what they were saying was happening but it was God really saying you're not climbing to that level you have no right to that seat that's actually what he said to me well yeah the higher end it was good the higher he went the more he fell and he got to the highest point then he fell well okay so let's jump into that anyone that's new may or may not know Kat's been having many many times so we do uh wednesdays with kat steve we hit the political scene for a while then we go into more questions about heaven we have hundreds of and then people get into other areas that God would have shown you so it's mostly about heaven but some are slightly different but this was kind of in the middle this is a teenage girl who's asking this question she said are the jewish leaders and high priests who falsely accused jesus and the people who actually crucified jesus are they in heaven or hell or some of each i think that would have to depend on what the decision they made themselves before they actually died i do know that some of those especially of some of those who were like guards and those who were around the cross really did realize he was the son of God when the earthquake began to happen it really freaked them out they didn't expect that to happen um and so that really stunned them and many people actually at that time began to realize he probably is the son of God why would the earth respond uh there were other things that happened also in that very time that probably shifted their mind like what have we done you know what have we done and we all know there's always movies made from way back when that they made similar to those things happen like um my my husband if he was here could tell me what some of the names of those for because he loves those movies where even some gladiators realize that jesus christ was the son of God and in that time frame of them were battling in the arenas did realize that they weren't going to do what they were doing anymore and so many people did and we all know what um that you know i think it was was a pilot who didn't want anything to do with what was going on uh one of them i know washed their hands and said this sin will not be upon me let it be upon the jews and actually that's what did happen but i do know that some of those who were present at the cross and saw the things that happened i think in that moment they had decided he was the son of God so i would have to say there's probably some in both places i'm sure some were went to abraham's bosom if they made that decide the decision in their heart and i'm sure after that time when they were hunting the jews you know to take them the um apostles that many of their lives probably were saved by those who had decided jesus christ was the son of God and i know that there was some protection given to some of them so those surely had received christ and i know that they're probably they're most likely in heaven so only God knows who and where but i do know when the earthquake began to shake the ground like right now that's happening hello people judgment was coming and you better be ready for that happening because the ground sure is shaking right now uh here not just in america but around the world so that's a great question no one's ever asked that so kudos really yeah interesting um this says does ken hardly suggestions how to bring a stubborn friend or family member to jesus i've tried witnessing to them but it breaks my heart to think that they may never accept jesus or go to heaven so i you know of course we've talked about decreeing and standing for your family yes but i mean but and maybe that is the one and only answer but this they're saying is there anything that we're missing about how to bring someone to the lord i think the worst thing to do is to continually bring it before them it's almost it's so hard for a family member unless you're so close together and you've been close your whole life that might help you show them kindness and that sounds wild to do that but if you make them move further away from you if you even though you're doing it in a wonderful way if they're rejecting rejecting i would not keep bringing it up to them because most people who are that hard-hearted they get born again by someone else God sends them on their path this happens more often than not that it's someone else who wins them to the lord it's okay just to say you know don't forget jesus loves you he's got a plan for your life so don't give up on jesus say it that way and then drop it don't keep pushing them because you'll just push them further away and you may shut the only door you have opened them as a family member because i'll tell you this if they themselves get into a place where they're desperate for prayer uh maybe they've had a bad diagnosis maybe some horrific thing has happened to them if you leave the door open for communication by just reminding them that jesus loves them as a plan for their life don't give up on jesus uh i'm sure the devil is beating the person up number one to stay away from jesus they don't want him there so you have to realize you have to see what the enemy is saying to that person behind the scene you don't understand but if you continue to love them that's what my mom did with all of my siblings she always left the door open if you need me call me i'll always be able to pray for you pray for you so why don't you leave it there because then if something happens you'll be the first person they call but if you continually try on them you need to do this so you don't go to hell you're just pushing them further away and that's from my own life experience uh that what you need to do trust holy spirit to bring someone along their path certainly pray that but most of all you say not to that person you say this to jesus christ i'm standing in the gap for my family member who does not want you and i declare they will become a living testimony of the saving power that you carry and that they'll be with me in eternity and i'm standing in the gap i'm not letting that go that is the greatest number one thing you can say on their behalf other than that unless they already know where you stand if you you keep talking about them or pressing them with us they already know what you are and what you believe just leave the door enough that if they have a serious issue they i promise you you'll be the first person they call that's interesting you know there i i would i would almost give the name of this person because it's it was a written in the newspaper just a short time ago but because um i don't know how wide it is now there's a major leader people on this list would know about it that name and and he had five children and they all left the lord it sounds like one especially then moved to new zealand she became a buddhist and agnostic and all that and she wanted nothing to do with this prophetic person's leadership and she almost got a boat accident almost died he was the first person she called yeah yeah she she moved back because she's still the same buddhist person now she moved back and she got caught in the hurricane and had to be on the phone all night to try and have someone talk her through this hurricane who was that person her father again yes so she's still this buddhist person but she keeps calling her father when the chips are down that's really what you're saying he left the door open yes but let me tell you what's really happening and she doesn't realize it if he's praying for over the phone and she asks for this those words he's speaking are going into her soul number one she gave permission uh just to talk her through it the presence of God that's in that person calling her speaking to her that frequency of God will go in her soul and begin to break up the darkness it may not be something that shows up but every time she goes to him she's getting more layers of that life of God put in her eventually it's going to get her to christ that's good that's good you know and then that other thing jesus said you know the fields are white for harvest they said pray that the lord will said laborers for the harvest of he's talking about people or angels or both probably all of the above all right well here's one people this question says people say God bless you all the time does something happen in heaven once when people say God bless you or is it just kind of a saying it's not just a saying if you're a believer and you say those words God will search out one of the best ways he can bless that person because when you say that to them you're opening a window for God to come in and do something to show them he cares i would say it's the number one thing i say to most people no matter who they are where they are sometimes they'll just look at me when i say that like they didn't know it was a christian number one but they at least know you believe in God if you say that so anything you can say on behalf of jesus christ or the father or holy spirit you could say if people say well i'm really struggling i'm going through a hard time in my life you may add may the spirit of God guide you see that that would they would want to hear even though they didn't understand that there's always ways and i even encourage people write down some of these one-line things that you may offer to a person maybe just like three different ones and if they make a conversation like i'm having a hard day then you can say like i pray the spirit of God will lead you and give you wisdom that that they kind of made a point to say something you gave an answer to them like i said we don't know enough of how much our words impact the soul of that person but what you say to somebody goes in their soul and then they're totally unaware that that puts something in there that God can use so i would totally say i always say something especially from the hard day say well or just say i'll pray for you but then when they walk away they may not want you to touch them when they walk away pray for the person God i i ask in the name of jesus christ you you help that person they may know him they may serve him in jesus name you're standing in the gap and God will never ignore those words good good okay here's one i don't know why they're in this if they're thinking of sin in your life or whatever it says do your angels ever leave you permanently and they didn't say why they're asking that question gifts they said if so for what reason would it would your angel leave you permanently i don't know of any time they left anyone permanently they're with them until the day they die that's their assignment and uh they need to be there for purposes got that God has for their life and so they may not watch everything that they do and they close their eyes and i've had people say you know they they noticed these other angels with their eyes shadow said well then maybe you need to think about saying something to God because you know they have never left anybody when the time comes for them to pass their assignment is to take them to heaven they the they're the ones who escort you to heaven so they're not going to leave leave somebody just because they turn to bad in their life it may be the only way their life gets saved it may be the only way that they still have the influence of of God on their life so you know they're with you they're going to be with you until the day that you pass and there's hope and their belief is they will be able to take you to heaven i did there was a question i don't think i've asked this uh but i've been asked it a number of times also about your angels when you die and your angels done with you for now now maybe they'll have some r and r in heaven do they get reassigned to another person and or do they get assigned to someone else in the family line do they stick with the family line anything like that from all that i've heard or known so far in heaven i don't know that they get reassigned he has billions of them there's more angels than there are people on the earth and i think that he probably takes them back because it because they do know this people have gone home to heaven have later got to meet their angels if they were reassigned they wouldn't be there so i think for a period of if there was time in heaven that they would remain there and i know that people have encountered their angel several times and once they have gone back have gone and moved to heaven they've had opportunities to see them have discussions with them and uh so i don't know personally at the time when they were reassigned to someone else on the earth i think think they finished their course there's so many things that they could be doing in heaven or sent out on other assignments not necessarily as a guardian angel interesting okay good now this one ephesians 2 6 they're asking about that they say can you elaborate where it says and he raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places in christ jesus does that actually situate us someplace in heaven with jesus in others do we literally go are we seated with him or is it just that we are always in christ relational and it's just kind of a neat way of saying we're in christ are they talking about why you're on the earth i think that's the question you don't have any i know exactly what that means that means when you receive jesus christ you give him permission he takes a layer of your soul i've talked so much about the soul before because i have a lot of understanding and revelation on that in your soul are layers of you that's what all your emotions are and so uh you actually what you give yourself to whether it's an addiction or it's a good thing God gave you to be a part of you actually give a layer of your soul to that and what happens is you you have a great tie that's made with that i also know this that when you receive jesus christ as your savior he has the right he takes a layer of your soul which just looks just like you it's you and he takes it and he literally seats it in heaven in a heavenly place and many times the father sends for that layer of you to come before his commissioning throne room if he's going to give you a commission on the earth you're still down here alive but that layer of your soul that represents you in heaven he sends for that layer of view they walk in the throne room they'll kneel down he'll put a mantle on that image of you that's you that whatever you at the same time angels are right there putting one on you on the earth so there are reasons why he takes a part of you out and that layer is seated in heavy places if you went up there you'd see you sitting on the throne well you know i had a guy that was into quantum a strong believer i met him in australia and we were talking about that kind i don't remember was that scripture but he said people don't understand the boundaries of the human spirit and that was the way he was trying to define it we think of the soul is here it stops here and the spirit stops here but using the whole quantum thing and light and all of that it may not be quite as defined by the out outside edges of our skin i suppose what do you what can you say about that my father came the father came and spent four hours earth time i literally saw how he made a human soul i know what it looks like and if you can see inside of yourself he takes those layers of you when you're a believer and he'll send them places to another country to preach the gospel that's why people see you there they met you there and then he sent that letter back inside of you so he has the ability to use you in those ways it's not so much that he's projecting your spirit man everywhere it's those layers of you it's still you it's still a part of you it's really you it looks like you it came from you and uh and then he will put that back in so that's literally how it actually happens and i do know that's how people can be in two places at the same time it's a layer of your soul that looks like you that he takes the spirit of God will take it and send it to preach the gospel around the world and that will happen more and more and there'll be a time when we have the understanding that that's how we're made and it says we're made in their image holy spirit is made that way it was not made holy spirit is that way holy spirit has unlimited layers of himself now you don't look at him and see a million layers they're in him and when you invite the holy spirit to indwell you he literally reaches and takes a layer of him that's him it's a whole of him and he puts that in you and you become the temple the holy spirit you don't have a little piece of holy spirit he's literally living in there but he never finishes that's how he can be everywhere all at the same time he has all these layers sent out of himself that knows everything going on and so even though people understand quantum physics it's not like he's taking you just as you singly as you and putting you all these places in in a blink of an eye i understand a little bit about quantum physics but as far as you being in different places it's that layer of your soul that looks exactly like you when he takes it out and sends it somewhere it looks just as full and operational as you personally be it's the way God that's why he says we're wonderfully made that's one of the ways he made us i there's a prophetic guy we've we i won't go into who he is and all that but he had he's been transported to many cities and countries but he tells him an experience where this first began to happen but he would go to bed the family would go to bed the kids would be in bed the wife would enter he's sitting in the chair and he decides to walk throughout the house and decides to pray over the bedrooms and the doorposts for his kids and he goes around the outside of the house and prays around the outside and he comes back to his chair and he sees himself sitting there asleep in the chair and he realizes that God has raised has caused him to well how are you describing leave his body and do this or what what does that sound like to you is that it's the layer of his soul that i do that all the time that's exactly literally what is happening he's seeing his own body sitting there but the layer of his soul is outside doing those things he feels himself he understands that but it's not it's not that God's taking him he's not separating his body body it's becoming the layers you have that he will take and send and that's how people who still don't know people who even walk travel in the spirit that's a little bit different if you travel in the spirit and God has allowed that you leave here you're gone you travel the spirit to another country that's a different thing that you're sleeping and you see your own body still there that is the layer of your soul that is you you're a many layered being holy spirit is an unlimited layered being and we're made in their image and all these things are just beginning to be known because God's giving revelation there'll be a point where people know and the holy spirit may say okay we're sending a layer we're sending a layer of view to this country and you'll know it's happening but to even have that head knowledge of your mind your natural mind can't conceive of that maybe if you're brilliant you can so that is literally what he experienced that was a layer of him you could feel yourself walking on the ground touching things and then eventually he put you back in there put you back inside your spirit man why he did this test Kat and i can't remember it's the same experience once he realized what was happening or if it was a different night but he said he tested it he wrote this up in a book i think and he was outside praying around the house he thought i'm gonna test this he took a handful of dirt up on the air conditioning unit just so it was laying there dirt he picked up and then he goes back and realizes he sees his body he's with his body again the next morning he goes out and that handful of dirt is there so he realizes in a material way he was there he put the dirt on there that's exactly what happens that's why people if you send the lay of your soul to these countries they hugged you you prayed for them literally laid hands on them that was a physical thing because it's a part of you it's the way God made you when he takes a layer out it becomes solid as if it was you yourself there so that was wise you didn't do that but of course if he was whole outside of himself he could pick up the dirt he could have picked a flower he could have left half a cup of water sitting on the sink and it would have been there you they have to understand how he made our soul that's why he told adam you are a living soul uh it's one of the most important parts of your being and all those layers of view like i tell people all the time this would be your will inside of you it's a spiritual thing but it's you here's your will it's the column coming off of that will are all these layers of view like if i had taken a book and opened it up it's the same way all these layers are attached like this can you see the cup and what God does he reaches out and takes one out and then that you hold right there but your body and your spirit is sitting right there and here you are here and you'll send you to countries uh now people most people don't remember that but that's exactly what he's experiencing so that was a great test he did that was awesome yeah i had one experience like that i told the story but basically i was in my bed i saw my headstand i saw my clock i knew i was there at the same time i was down the road in a bus accident uh and praying for an interceding for it and it was both real and i knew i was in both places that's the closest i've ever come i as far as i am concerned i never left my bed but that was so real that's exactly what happened yeah so it's freaky but it was real i mean it was good i'll never forget it it was freaky good i guess okay here's a funny question um actually it didn't used to be funny because when i was really sick and i was dying this back in the early 2000s 2005 70 i was really sick i got so empathetic towards anyone that was in pain that i didn't even want to squish a bug i didn't want to touch that thing and yeah after i got well i stomped that thing flat when it was so this is the question is is it wrong to kill bugs that come into the house i say no [Laughter] there are some things God made just to exist for his purpose here and uh i've never seen a roach in heaven okay i'll tell you that there's no roaches no mosquitoes i don't believe those things have any kind of a soul whatsoever now that would be different if it was a different kind of creature God doesn't like us to hurt the creatures either he really doesn't those who have um i think called the spirit of life which is they have a spiritual body and that makes them have a soul and he made them that way and that's why he told noah but every animal in the ark that has a spirit of life in it well they were all alive so what did that mean i mean they had a spirit a spirit body too and they had a soul because God had to make those animals agree because in the normal you're not going to have wild animals running to get on a boat i don't care if a storm is coming because God impressed them all to go with noah to get on that ark and they could not have done it had they not been able to choose with their soul and their will to go with him and so there are most creatures like our cats dogs anything that would be in the zoo though all of those animals they have a soul they have a spirit man a spirit body and they have a soul and that's why when your own pet dies your guardian angel takes that spiritual body of your pet up to heaven okay good um which one of these do i ask um this has been asked before i can't remember if i've asked this to you but that people keep asking okay we've got our mansion in heaven and then one day there's gonna be a new heaven and a new earth does them does your mansion in heaven come down to the earth what what what's the difference between those two mansions if there are if they're different because i think because he makes the statement i will make all things new i think you'll have a new one and i think you'll love it just as much as you did the other one if you compare that place when you pass from this earth and your guardian angels take you sometimes you just go on up to the cosmos and you arrive there sometimes you're taking many different ways i've seen people step in these things that look like elevators and zip you up some go in chariots some going by planes some going um like missiles or all kinds of things to delight you that's why he does that but i can tell you that he made that mansion for you and the reason he gave you a mansion and property was so you could use the gift he made you whether it's a baker an artist someone who's saying someone who holds rodeos all kinds of things there's so much adventure in heaven that is your absolute destiny and heaven is to use what he made you to be in the natural that that gift and i think if he made all that for you it says he's going to roll it all away that's what the bible says and he'll make all things new a new heavens and a new earth and even he himself this is what he tells me the father i will pack my bags at symbolic and i will get on the new jerusalem and i will come down to the new earth that will be our home not just my house but it'll be our home together and we'll be there forever that's his exact word so i have to say he's going to make everything brand new and that means you'll have another beautiful place that is yours to all to do all kinds of wonderful things and but we'll also get to travel through the new heavens he makes and you'll have planets for us to visit just for fun you won't just stay there you get to go to many places that have been created to have fun awesome awesome okay that i didn't have a chance to look this scripture up but he's referring to revelation 21 and states the c is no more but then she quotes according to revelation as different fruit for every month and she says are there months in heaven i'm not that familiar with that specific scripture do you know which one she's talking about talk about everyone scripture well unfortunately i didn't look it up she says you know we can save it for next week and i can look it up but you're you're saying you said before there are not time in heaven right no he he he does things by events and every major thing that happens is an event and it depends on the translation let me just push that a lot of the new translations have changed words to make more sense to us now than it would but but then but they don't have a they don't have excuse me they don't have a son in the moon that show one day then another day another day they don't do that God's light lights heaven it's lit by the glory of God that never goes out and so it's a whole total experience it's still a world which people even argue about that it's too bad too late i've been there many times it is a world bigger than our own galaxy and that's the father's house that's what he calls it and so he has a timeline and i've seen a good part of his timeline and it will have a dot and it says what event that is the event when this event happens a fullness of time has come from that one to this one that means new things will happen new ways will happen uh you never stop belonging to him that part never changes but as time we know on the earth as time goes by even in the natural things change and happen because that just goes that's just the way it is and so i can tell you no calendar there won't be a calendar per se like we have hanging on our wall and i don't know why that bothers people how can you keep track of time there is no time it says in the bible time will be no more doesn't mean we won't exist that means it's in a whole new thing God's created for us to enjoy and a lot of the stuff in the past you know not i mean hard times and stuff like that really hard times we won't remember those things but you'll still remember you you still remember your family and the beautiful things you experienced in heaven he's literally going to make a new earth and i also get asked about that all the time i said he says he will roll it away like a garment because when there was only the spiritual realm and the father went out and did nothing the word was in him and when father said physical realm the word which was jesus christ stepped out he took a scroll and he actually stretched it around they could be bigger than the whole everything stretched it around good part of the spirit realm that was a physical realm so they could put physical planets and stars the sun the moon this earth and us we could have a body that's what he made there so we could come here and have a body so that's just part of the big picture and he said he will roll it away and i can tell you why he'll run away he said roll away hook the garment he knows where the ends are of the physical realm physical realm holds time so in in the in way into the future when we're there there won't be calendars or clocks you won't need it you'll know every time an event is going to happen when you create an event everybody knows about it so it's a whole new life that your your your human mind sometimes can't grasp that i i and this one has to do with time as on heaven versus earth i don't know if his men will or someone like man was on the program and they said or i read it and someone had gone to begin to take classes in heaven for for whatever they missed on earth i don't know and by the time they got to heaven and were in the middle of their first class 30 years had taken place on the earth does that kind of time warp is that kind of like it is and is it can be the opposite to where you're where you feel like you've been eons in heaven and two days have gone by in the earth how does how do you make sense of the earth because you've been there and back many times well when he takes me and brings me back it's the same time that i left now i know about earth earth-wise time um the only thing i notice is sometimes he takes me to one place in heaven sometimes i go he takes me to five places in town in heaven but that doesn't really necessarily relate to earth at all he just brings me back i'm in the same place that was when he took me whether it was in the grocery store in my driveway sitting at my desk here in our offices i'm right back exactly in that time that he took me so because there is no time in heaven i can take people been caught up and shown many things participated in things and then you can bring them back but normally it's to the exact same time it was when you left interesting interesting all right here's a question about the host of heaven he said the host of heaven are the armies of the lord and God didn't create them to protect heaven heaven needs no protection he created them to protect us so what happens the question is what happens when death and hell are thrown into the lake of fire and there's no more need to defend uh have either heaven or earth what what happens to the host what do they do i think they'll probably be the ones who escort us to these other planets to visit to enjoy ourselves and they'll probably escort us back and that might be more just to participate and not to protect because there will be no evil anywhere all evil and wickedness will be thrown in the lake of fire which will not be on the new earth not anywhere near the new earth and there's so there's no evil aliens out there waiting to take us down even when God ends time and he ends the way this physical realm operates we won't have to be concerned and i have i have jokingly said to the host i guess we'll have a lot of tour guides in eternity yeah i hope it's not boring they gotta fight feels like they want to find something you know why they won't be bored steve they won't have to fight yeah that's good okay out of all the terms and i've had three quick i'm going to blend a couple of these together they're wanting to know if you've seen adam and eve and or talked with them have you seen solomon and have you seen princess die those are the three that are big that i'm putting them together from different people i have totally seen adam and eve several times absolutely seen adam and eve some of them i don't always have conversation with they may take me by to let me see them and they're having conversation with people who have arrived in heaven because everybody wants to meet adam and eve of course they made it to heaven they were the first ones he made and even though they fell in you know in sin in the garden they did get restored to God eventually they had to teach their own children about God himself which they did well because if they hadn't you know then you know even then they had to make a choice right their sons had to make a choice one serve God and love God the other let pride get in his life so but still how do you think he learned who he was because they didn't have any children when they left the garden that means adam and eve had to share with them about him so yes their adam and eve is in heaven and i'm trying to remember i know you said princess dye was one who was the other one uh um adam a princess diane solomon solomon is absolutely in heaven he is in heaven um he obeyed God he did what he asked him to do he established the temple which was the greatest thing God asked and the only thing he asked him to do was establish the temple and some willingly willingly did so many sacrifices and gave to God more than what God had asked at that time in his life when he got older i'm sure when anybody gets older they don't think quite as well and i think he probably lived quite a long time but i can tell you that as far as i know he is solomon is in heaven i've seen him i've seen king david i did not see saul which kind of surprised me i didn't see saul i saw king david i saw solomon now you have to imagine you're talking about a world bigger than our whole cosmos and i've seen even though it's been over 20 years i've seen bits of it i have seen quite a few people humans who are in heaven like from the even from the past i've seen quite a few of the apostles i've seen what they're doing people just love to find them and talk to them so that kind of thing goes on a lot i've seen john wayne and then later found out that his daughter was with him when he received jesus christ as a savior i tell people i've seen elvis several times he's usually with jesus when they see him and i've seen some athletes that are that are up there um i know meadowlark lemon i've seen him in heaven he went to heaven still playing basketball by the way he's playing basketball he's still playing basketball yes he is so i've seen some of the people we would say were great people people wanted to know them i've seen quite a few of them in in heaven the one person i have seen in hell i've been to hell like three or four times now i saw hitler in hell and i know this sounds terrible but satan makes an example of him all the time that he was so evil he he talked about the the great deceit he put upon him and used him he'll even blatantly say to him his face i used you you thought you were wicked and evil but it was me and i used you to kill millions and he's tortured almost more than anyone else in hell on purpose because he gave so much of himself it's totally different if you give yourself to God you get great you're rewarded if you give yourself to satan you're going to be you're gonna be uh crushed and a torture more than anyone else so don't do that people you're never gonna win nobody wins in this whole group even now that's up there uh being uh wicked and evil who are sitting in a place that they don't deserve and they didn't earn i'm talking about in our government if they if they do go to hell they'll be tortured more than the rest because they gave themselves totally to the enemy that's why it's important for you to reconsider your ways God says that he desires that the violence sinner be free that doesn't mean they're going to be free they have to choose and repent of that things okay that doesn't mean they're going to automatically make it nobody automatically makes it i have to say that they will receive uh they will repent we see the blood of jesus and sometimes it's as they're dying and maybe you just say this is for your family members if you stood for them i can almost assure you to say that if you made that stain for their salvation 90 of the time they're going to end up by making it into heaven because they're not going to say no if they're dying and they know they're dying and christ appears to them which that does happen that's what those keys are he took from satan the keys of hell deaf and the grave were were realms realms of authority that he took away from him and christ has access to them but he needs our words now he can't go rescue somebody out of hell that died three months ago or three years ago or 30. it's that's just not going to happen but i can tell you it's important for you as a believer to make a stand for their salvation like we said earlier but the more you give yourself to satan the worse your torture will be in hell on back in the days when people preachers would preach fire and brimstone and people would come running to the altar is here's what i want to ask you salvation salvation so so say thousands and millions came to God because they were scared to death of hell and that's how they got in they said i want nothing to do with that sure i'll accept the lord that they and and so they walk that out versus seminars who just love God it is salvation salvation no matter how they get in is there a preferable way is it better not to be scared i would just say this it depends on the sincerity of their heart and the only one who knows that is God God will make a judgment if they really sincerely received his son this is the father the father sits as judge okay that's who makes that decision did they sincerely make a commitment to receive my son and maybe they had a really rough life maybe they would go up and down up and down but they never turned from that salvation they would be in heaven their reward may not be great but but i know people or i know people like even somebody close on my staff that their their husband was just a horrible person but they went and prayed with him with one of my other family members and her her ex-husband totally absolutely received christ was not a good person his whole life and they sincerely made that and i actually saw that person in heaven and where they were living they didn't have a big mansion but they had the most beautiful place like this huge massive maybe three thousand four thousand foot uh cabin on part of the sea and i didn't know anything about them i saw their dog their dog was named pepper i didn't know that dog i never met this person and i knew that they were fishing they loved to fish so i came back and confirmed hey he made it to heaven they were really happy so people who make it to heaven are overjoyed that they're there especially it was at the last moment maybe they made a commitment very early in their life but they never turned from that commitment to christ no matter how it was done then they will most likely be in heaven if they were wicked and evil and sin horribly and were wicked to people that's they that's going to cancel that out they need to make a recommitment to christ but don't stop believing for their salvation you know when you you ended up with this thing about some people may not have great rewards i think of my father that way because he lived a great wicked life but then he got to be went to be with the lord at the last minute just got very safe so we talked about people didn't have much reward but they wouldn't care if they had a little cabin but then the question was someone asked me what if someone goes to heaven like that and do they um what if they like my father like to build things when he gets to heaven has a little tiny cabinet he says he's going on a building i want to make a great big cabin do will people can people do that do they do that do they add i don't i don't think they do that i think they may i think he will be welcome to be part of other projects that God is doing if that was actually a gift he had if that was something that he loved to do uh even though he made it in by the skin of his teeth that's what i tell people he's so happy because that thing he's living in was made by God himself wow what have mercy and love for him he wouldn't want to change it see people don't think like we do on the earth maybe i'll make it better or great that won't even enter his mind he is grateful and overjoyed that he didn't go to hell and he's so thankful for the thing God made him he loves it he'll love it God gave him he'll love the mercy of christ and all they are all they are grateful they're happy for people who have places that are bigger no one's jealous no coveting no pride joy everlasting is what they have and but if somebody else if jesus has got a project going on and he does this quite often jesus will build new places for people to enjoy people who have gifts like designers or like like wood work people who work with wood and stuff like that he will actually go invite them to be a part of what he's doing interesting okay hey someone uh they sent me i don't know if this is my producer but she said because you've seen hitler in hell now judas said i betrayed innocent blood and then he killed himself is judas in hell judas is in hell in the story you need to go back to the scripture God always takes me back to scripture and jesus was talking to the father and he was thanking him you know he loved the fact that he could be in and out of each other he said father i have all that you gave me except for the son of perdition that tells you right then you can go to heaven that was judas because he gave him the 12 disciples he said i have all that you gave me talking about the disciples except for the son of perdition that was judas so he did not go to heaven and christ was making that plane he i didn't get him in other words he didn't he didn't repent of his sins even sorry he was caught yeah and he knew that it was such a horrible thing that he felt he which was the worst thing he could have done because that just set him to hell quicker so no he judas is not in heaven in christ actually himself and then you may i don't have this absolutely but i think when when jesus prayed and said i've lost none except the son of perdition that was like john 14 or 17 was it judas had not yet betrayed him yeah but he knew what was in his heart okay i mean he knew he knew he was lost his disappointment he was totally the son of God at that appointment he knew that but he knew he had turned against him no he knew it was already in his heart from the time he added judas he could see everything that was in his soul that was something christ could do he knew the thoughts and intents of judas's heart and his heart was deception he stole some of the money from the offering that's why he wanted to make sure he carried the money back so he was dishonest from the beginning he was disgruntled he actually talked amongst the others about how unhappy he was about stuff that christ was doing and he wanted him to be the son of God for all of them to make them all look great christ knew every bit of this he knew and at the last supper when he said go do what you must do he knew what he was going to do yeah decision judas had already made that decision this is what i'm going to do yeah wow on the opposite end people have asked me over and over and i keep forgetting to ask answer this soon or ask this mary of course the catholics venerated to maybe almost put or too high but mary said and prophesied all nations will call me blessed so it seems like mary the mother of jesus would have a super special place in in the lord's heart is she considered the mother of jesus in heaven does she have an amazing mansion what have you seen about mary in heaven i see that mary is really humble even in heaven that God would entrust her with birthing the son of God which she kind of always was like that really she doesn't have some massive huge big mansion i don't know that she would necessarily want that i've seen her with jesus off and on myself and when i was in heaven i would see her with him and she has still got the love of a mother because you don't stop loving your children even though you're known as like you're known as the son or daughter of God whom you have near his son and his daughter although you have great relationships with those who were with your family hers is the same way she helped to raise him and she knew him she refuses to allow anyone in heaven to worship her and nobody what's in you when you get there the second is that to worship and love jesus christ the son of God and the father and holy spirit even holy spirit and father in ways you didn't before because they are the Godhead but mary certainly loves the memories she have of raising christ and the things that he did on the earth people honor her highly honor is different than worship but she certainly is honored because of what she went through knowing she was carrying the son of God having to watch him die on the cross although great joy came upon her when she knew that he had been raised from the dead so she doesn't carry any sorrow or even a sorrowful memory she just remembers that God trusted her to carry him uh the son of God in her and she still does even though he said on the cross to john john behold your mother and he said to mary behold your son and at that very moment he had to die on that cross as her savior he couldn't dying as your son he was dying as the son of God and even though he said that there on the earth in front of all those who were at the cross he was actually saying to john here you will care for she will not be your mother to care for that doesn't mean he wiped away the memory that she she raised him so that's where he is he honors she's highly honored in heaven and i have to say this to catholics all the time there's only one that's worshipped it's not mary well and speaking of memories uh let's we'll probably end on this question because that's our time but you know in my generation we had pictures and we started taking pictures here a photographer and we said we could have pictures the lord will put some of our favorite pictures in heaven mary had no photographer in heaven she has no photographs might the lord preserve some images and put it in her house could she have a promise she's got photographs of her with him when he was a baby the angels were there i think they have photographer angels because there are some that do nothing but take the pictures and i promise when she got to her mansion she saw a gallery of all the pictures when she was telling that that's that uh truth to elizabeth and he and and you know john left in the womb of elizabeth i i know that encounter i'm sure that was photographed i'm sure them going to bethlehem the brotherhood she's probably got pictures all over in her own mansion she probably got a gallery of all that well i want to see those i want to go visit people that's good you you have not seen you have not been in her in her mansion though i have i've seen glimpses of inside her mansion parts of it no not all of it of course i've seen parts of it because of christ himself the father taped the father his videographers i know what they call them the father tapes everything because when you get to heaven now when you get born again he goes back and edits all the sin out and they they tape everything they tape our lives and then they will take all those parts out that were sin he takes them out you yourself can go back when you get to heaven and go to these uh video uh places like theaters and you want your whole life flipped over from the from the time that you're born you watch your whole life lived over all the crazy silly fun things you did um the things you did yourself as you got older especially all the times you help somebody you love somebody all it's all there so you can see your own life left over but this is what's included in that video will be the holy spirit your guardian angels you see everything you're guarding that at that moment you'll know all the things they did to preserve your life or to whisper things in your ear that maybe you needed to know if you're trying to make a decision you see every bit of it when you get to heaven wow that's amazing that's amazing you know that's the first time it ever occurred to me that mary would have pictures of of jesus but why wouldn't she you're right yeah why wouldn't you if some of mine are up there and i and i actually was told that when i had to lay down he said you lay down your photography gift i put in you you use it in heaven but now the thing i want you to to photograph the most will be the host so i'm a photographer of the host of heaven right now that's what i do he said every time you want a picture all you have to say is i want a photograph of that and they take it and then it's put in my mansion crazy well kat that's our time uh tell people about how to get ahold of we have revealingheaven.com on the screen tell people which places to go for what yeah if you want to know more about events or any of the products we have our store is at revealingheaven.com if you want more revelation on the spirit realm on heaven on how to pray for your family members and that's on katker.com um it doesn't cost you anything to go to either place i will i do want to make mention of something i had a call from johnny anderle this morning and somebody contacted him and said somebody ordered my book off of amazon.com revealing heaven book and when they got it it wasn't my book the cover was right but inside the printers had made a mistake and they put some story in there it was about a baker's daughter or something so if you get that that's not something that we did you contact amazon.com and tell them that they printed the wrong story in the book and they should either replace that for you or give you back your money and that just happened so we haven't heard that before but our own zoolon press um they have their own printers that they print and send stuff out and we did call them to let them know about it but they said that must have been on the side of amazon's printers who have admission for all they get so many orders they have permission to print that so that probably been on their side so that's normal story i'm not a baker's daughter wow i didn't even know amazon did that well awesome um one last question people say what is the movie you said you're working on a movie do you have any idea how many years or how out that is well you all know this okay literally i am rewriting a script for one of the resurrection movies that were being made but all of that we know stopped hollywood has come to a halt uh any projects have come to a halt so anything that's been anything you see now in the movies were things that were made probably in um 2020 you know what i mean probably made some 90 20 or almost none but there's nothing that's been made new that i know of unless it's only stuff made online and presented online uh so the whole project they had to stop that producer contacted me and said we got to stop everything but inform me that if i want to keep working on the art with my artists we're right now still finishing the images they will use to um advertise the movie which are real from heaven real scenes from hell i destructive and my artist is working on them now so that's all we can do i'm still working on the script too but my own movies i have two trilogies that i'll write and we've got i've got the titles and this is what the father does he shows me the movies this is what we're going to do it's going to be i'll just give you a tip it will be about the spirit realm and the natural realm together in all of these movies and you'll know the characters you see the real operations of the army of heaven of gabriel's group uh but it's actually going to be a story with a theme and a plot it's going to be powerful perfect oh i look

i'm doing great how are you doing good so you had your uh your home going party with your brother regarding your brother not yet we're still planning um you know i was kind of put in charge of that by my family and by my brother's wife people who don't know for years i was head of hospitality at new life christian fellowship that had 4 000 members so i know how to do an event and my family know that and they know i'm i'm a detailed person everybody loves the detail and prophecy but let them tell you living with with me as a detail person so what what someone would do two hours it takes me 10 because every single every single design every item nothing's going to be left out so we're still planning it it's actually this saturday and i'm going to really relax and enjoy myself like my brother is in heaven okay so nobody is going to be great when we do have it and for those that didn't hear this your brother went home because it was time for him to go he felt released to go you all blessed him to to go and you are not looking this as a time degree at all is that right there is no grief whatsoever because if you've if you ever even had a peek or a glimpse of what heaven is you would actually celebrate i encourage people to celebrate number one when you have a service if a loved one by the way i gotta add this it's not rj okay God's not done with him yet everybody's going to say is that rj oh no he's not ready to go at all he's not ready my other brother was ready to go and his mansion was done it was completely done God had told me the beginning of the week and to let my brother know the one who passed your mansion's not quite done yet but it could be done at any time and we did get to go visit him we were with him literally hours a couple hours after we visited him and he went to heaven i knew he was going to go because his angels were pacing in the room he wasn't in the hospital everything they were pacing back and forth and watching him and so uh but you know what i'll say goodbye i put an anointed i tell you what don't ask me to pray for your love and if they're terminal or if they're really ill because they're either going to be whole or they're going home to heaven and most of them go home to heaven so anyway he's out there enjoying his welcome home party in heaven and we're going to have a really great celebration here i do want to encourage you you exist to live in heaven down here we exist to make a living but in heaven you actually exist to live so there's quite a difference that's awesome well you know i've never looked at having the same since i first met you about well it's probably about seven years ago now i remember talking to and there were two people i asked julia our producer was one of them she had gone to see you Kat seven to ten years ago went down to canada beach or something and she had talked about how good it was but then you know i i've seen this pink haired lady i didn't know anything about her but then i did another call with theresa phillips i think and on that call i said does anybody here know about Kat Kerr you the real deal and it was victoria boyson who spoke up absolutely the real deal right after that we signed up for the cruise that you were on and God said get every book on heaven well we went on our own cruise first and we got every book on heaven and i forget exactly chronological then we did one on the next cruise with you either the year later or something and and uh your your staff lost you on the boat because you were in our room for about four hours talking about it a long time but you know what you you were both very hungry to hear about heaven and i can't resist sharing those were great those are great a great time when we got to get together and you know if you remember even though in the captain's table where we sat and had dinner on the ship it was we were talking across the table almost like standing up talking to each other we were so passionate excited about having what God had prepared for us everybody just kind of left us alone they kept just talking the whole time so yeah i was we were definitely hungry and i think i still am but i i mean i've got to probably if i have 100 questions to be answered i'm probably at 60 i have a lot more and when i see these questions for you then i think well i should have asked that one that's a good one right here and then there's questions that i don't feel like i need the answer to but somebody does so i'll let some of those in well before we do that let's get into questions of having two things let's first talk about we've got to warn people again that you are not writing to them and inviting them to be friends and you are not writing to them asking for money talk about that because we're getting requests from both of us saying why are you asking for money and you know i think people now have adapted that as their job i mean i think they do it as a business on purpose those people are out to scalp you for your money i don't have time number one jen knows this i don't understand the technical inner workings of the internet or even how to barely operate my cell phone let alone go online and design things and ask people things i don't have time i love people but some people take advantage of that and when the more well you're known and i heard this from almost every known person in the ministry it all happened to all of them the better you're known the more they want to use that and work it they design a fake uh facebook page like there's like i don't know how many did a lot of them out there some of them do it just to let people know about the revelation i have some of them do it to make money and what they'll do is a facebook allows you to take pictures as you know off of your facebook page and show them on theirs just to show them but some people take mine even exactly what i have on the on the very front of my facebook page they'll take the same picture the background they'll put enough information in there that sounds like it's me except for a couple things number one they're not going to be able to answer any questions themselves they're not going to be any of the events that we're showing so they don't really can't talk too much about the events because they don't really know what's going on with it the one thing that they will do if they're a scalper is that they will ask for money either directly like you know i need money for this project i need money for this whatever that would be like me saying that or uh would you mind giving to this orphanage would you mind giving to these people who have had these horrible things happen to them you can either send it to us and we'll give it to them or they actually create a site where when you give it goes directly to those people and what they'll do too is they'll message people i don't even know how to do that i think messaging they don't mean like send you a letter maybe they do anyway they'll contact other people and say would you join my whatever see i don't even know how to say it to you i don't invite people to be uh join my facebook page i never have done that if you get a request from somebody inviting you to join my page that is a clear sign it is not me you have to just watch and then you can follow that's it and i'm not ask you to give money to other people i'm certainly not asking it for myself all the messages that i give are free you see over 500 hours of me on youtube talking about heaven and i don't charge if these people are charging for that that is not me so there's a cool there's different clues you can follow but the Kat Kerr that's what it is might be the Katker not patrick Katker not the hyphen Kat Kerr a people will make these fake pages somehow to get my name in and there's actually one right now patrick Katker is a fake one and he's saying he himself is saying i'm part of her media staff sorry sitting over there in the chair doing my media that patrick person is not on my staff that is a fake page that's a good example of what goes on and we gotta i got an email this morning or at least i saw it this morning it was sent to me the lady said she was upset because like a week ago that sheets had written to her she said i found gob smacked or something like that she said how would he why would he say if you wanted your healing to manifest you should donate to my ministry or donate to uh this orphanage in nigeria he said so she said i felt God smacked i don't know if she sent money or not and then about a week later she gets an identical email from kat Kerr saying if you want your healing please donate or donate to this orphanage in nigeria using the same words exactly the same words but but this time it was Kat curve advice so you guys ought to watch for that most most um well-known speakers if we're out and about we will not initiate contact with you ever and asking you for money we just won't do that not i don't know any of us that do that yeah so that's just a uh it's it's not just Kat Kerr it's happening all over the place we've shut down a number of fake steve schultz accounts you know yes we're losing us you know but anyway be patient with the system i don't have to figure out something one day to minimize that but when when you have a free social media platform world which we do yeah we want it to be free for people then you have to allow people to get on and start typing things and they have to commit something wrong before you know they're doing something wrong so yeah i haven't figured out a way to cut them off at the past we're finding out more ways to to smell a rat you know but uh we actually have a couple friends who on purpose check um the internet especially facebook they'll check it all the time to look for the fake ones we have some people we know who actually helped to like i said in the beginning there are some that are really great friends and they'll post everything i say but they're not asking people and they'll say like friends of Kat Kerr or whatever they'll mention my name but they're not asking for anything so there's probably about 15 different groups out there Kat Kerr celebration something like that but they're only to let people their friends know about it so there's a difference but scammers if they ask for money or asking you for your personal private information don't ever give it online don't ever get us online so those are red flags for you and uh but you know what God designed the internet this is what the father said i designed it i'm using it and there'll be a day when such that the power of God will come to that that screen when you're watching and there will be automatic healings with nobody asking you for money and i'm telling you the power of God's about to be released through the internet and every time i see like a computer screen or even my phone screen those are portals i've said this before they're portals to the spirit realm and things can pass through there that's why you be sure you're watching the right thing at home on your own not television or your computer don't watch darkness because there's portals there too but the power of God is about to hit this world through people's computers and through that media form and he's going to send the anointing the presence of God the miraculous even the angelic may show up and you might actually see them this is wild stuff i like to talk about the wild stuff you'll see them such angelic displays from heaven are coming because this is what God wants for this time and i was in the grocery store the other day i always have an opportunity my hair actually is like a beacon i'm minding my own business trying to shop and this worker in the store comes up and goes you're a christian aren't you and i said well yes i am he said so what do you think about this whole thing about the world coming to an end it's going to get darker and worse and went i don't agree with that he said what do you mean i said well i know from God it's going to get greater and better and he's only exposing the darkness so it can be pushed back he himself is going to do something to change the platform so we as believers can carry the glory around the world do the miraculous signs and wonders that will be on display everywhere and people will know there's a God and he's standing there with his mouth open like expecting that answer but i'm going to take that answer so people everywhere need hope don't they steve they do they do well man we can talk about any of these things for a long time let's jump to the next thing where let's talk about what the lord's showing you about current events and all things we've been talking about i do want to say something and it's really important number one it's about trusting God you're not going to escape that no one's going to escape in a time where God is doing things not expected and you may not even understand what they are why they're happening you have to keep trusting God he gave promises to us he said promises in the word of God he says certain things would happen he's not wrapping it up he's going to crush the darkness and push it back however he chooses to do that you can listen to man all day long and their theories their assumptions or even their head knowledge you need to trust the word of the prophet that's hearing God and has not changed what God is saying no matter how God does it he's going to put things the way he needs them to be that we can prosper not just america but over this world things are shifting right now even in the spirit you cannot see God is setting up behind the darkness who is totally unaware they think they've won they're going to get so smacked by God himself and suddenly it won't take months and years and suddenly when God does something everyone's going to know what's happening you trust what God is saying and don't look at your circumstances you keep saying i'm trusting God i believe what he is saying and guess what you'll be so happy you stood and weren't moved it's about time we moved things and stopped being moved by the enemy so so so good yeah you know i've been last couple days i've been going over it's been going over and over my mind that scripture i think it's psalms i should i don't have it memorized but it says because he trusts me i will protect him and there's one in uh psalms 91. uh there's one similar to that the one says because he loves me i will protect him and another one says because he trusts me i'll do that God's into and knows intimately who trusts him and who loves him and he acts on that he says it over and over when you because you love me my my spiritual father said would always wade taylor would always quote proverbs uh eight something he says uh i love those who love me and i and and and those that seek me early will find me and then he skips a couple of verses uh three or four verses or whatever and it says and i will cause them to inherit substance and depending on the version that says the treasury's the wealth of the in the world and he would quote that over and over and over and i think wait okay i've heard it but you know what i was looking it up again he's been with the lord about 10 11 years something give or take maybe 10 years and uh and i'm still pondering that scripture that that he was 85 86 when he went home and his his words are still speaking to me because he loves me you know so anyway well anything else i'll go share one more thing real quick i can tell you these things that guys have been saying are going to happen number one when the prophet themself begins to experience some of the things God is saying is coming for the body you know it's really close and i personally am experiencing some of the very things God said would begin to happen in these days of greater glory it's not the end it's not the tribulation of the paris time paris times if people say what time is it you say these are the days of the greater remember the word greater greater glory so they're not going to go back to the way they are they'll be greater than they ever were before i myself in the way God is talking to me and the things he is showing me that are just right on the edge right now are going to be so fantastic these days you're going through will become like dust your future is not this time this is not the new norm i don't like it when they say that your normal will be super natural that's what God is saying so good and you know i can confirm that what you're saying my dream came home the other day she was babysits on tuesday our granddaughter um and our our third and probably last grandchild depending on how it looked but she came home and i said man it's like during this everything that i'm turning to it's like the lord's adding grace or a little just a little bit more prosperity when an issue comes up and the pharmacy called and there was a question on that they ended up giving a whole bunch more and for ridiculous price and ridiculous grace you know so there was a need and it's too long a story to go in but i said it's like everything i'm turning to is all of a sudden grace added to it are you experiencing that too the grace and definitely the prosperity um from unexpected sources and that was God said i'm going to start sending wealth from unexpected sources and it will be it will be like an overnight thing like one day you're waiting to be able to do this the next day triple more than what you needed comes in that you can do even more than you had desired to do those kind of things literally are happening right now and the doors that are opening from unexpected sources like people you would never even think care about God or care about heaven those things are beginning to happen they will begin to go begin to go out and waves in the body of christ you should be all saying i'm taking that i'm receiving that right now when you hear a prophet say something like that if you want it you should actually say i receive that for myself that's good that's really really good and this is like i said a little bit earlier God responds to what what's in your heart he will reward you without you necessarily doing anything because he sees what's in your heart if trust is in your heart if you believe what Kat's saying you just earned a reward right there without even doing one thing you're just going in your heart you're like i believe that i really boom reward yes you know so watch out well listen okay anything else before we go into questions about him have we covered everything he wanted to i think that's probably all i'm going to say today except this and i still can't tell all of this this is something literally i am personally going to be a part of and involved in and i've been talking about mentoring for some time people keep asking me they'll actually send me letters can you mentor me i can't individually mentor people all over the world not one-on-one that can't happen but online and there's new ways being devised to do that and not only that in the in the coming future there will be tours i actually will be doing tours training people in the spirit realm uh in such a powerful way you will never be the same person again and if you won't be able to come in person like i said it'll be a tour like a whole area i might do uh five meetings in two weeks or something in in a greater places greater arenas so that you will be prepared to rule it's about ruling and reigning with christ it's not about being beat up by the devil anymore it's about jerking the doormat from underneath his feet okay and like christ said pretty soon i'm going to bruise the enemy you know those things are about to happen but you will have things to use you never thought you could have before or do before that is right on the edge of happening and i am involved in that okay announce it we want to be completely ready and done and have places already set up that we will come in great arenas to train people i'll just tell you what it is about it's revelation on the army of God you don't know who you are because let me tell you once you learn and you have the right weapons to use your life will be dangerous against hell so yes that is really close coming you're not going to be the same person you'll help you step in to this new time that God is bringing he's not waiting for that new time to shift you would begin to shift things yourself so cool and and uh before this first question you use the word tour we are about to announce the kat kur elijah streams elijah list tour we mentioned it before we were very close i gave final approval yesterday but we still have to get airline prices and a link set up before we can say but it basically starts about a year from to now a year from this week or year from next week uh so it's 2022 i think it bridges april and may it's a really good time before it's too cold or too hot it's a really good time and kat Kerr will be speaking on important places including the the garden tomb and masada and some of those other and you know mount carmel where we've done those things before we had a good time last time we went was that your first time i can't remember if that was your first time to israel when we did that it was the first time i'd been there for quite a while when the alec brought me over at one point maybe i don't know eight years ago teaching people how to lose things from their soul because of all the stuff she was going through it was her way to i guess you could say get back at the enemy to train millions of people how not to live in grief or or doubt or hurt or suffering and those were very powerful meanings but it was only there for a couple days and came back so what elijah was did wow opened up almost every major place something significant and when i was there i saw everything that was left as a mark by God like i saw stairways i saw angels posted places i saw the glory of God on places in the ground i heard what actually happened on mount carmel what God had to say about it i gave it to the people it's going to be that type of a tour in israel so you'll hear all the revelation that happened in all these significant places that if i touch it if i walk there i will see it and then i share it that is so cool yeah you would point out indeed sir where the angels were hanging out over there there's you know and i didn't see it because i you know i don't want to decree that i'm not a seer but i've seen a few things but you know you weekend on the garden tomb and you said something about you'd never felt this kind of anointing so that's how you knew it was the right place and we i walked out and julie they were our producer was there with us last time she didn't know what you had said because she didn't go in at the same time she said i've never felt this anointing anywhere at any time she said it about 60 seconds after you said it not knowing you had said it so you know you take that kind of thing to the bank and so well the garden team was a very special place especially when you realize this was really it this is really the location it's not yeah that i saw posted there were the same two angels literally that rolled the stone away that were there when mary talked to them at the tomb and the disciples the same two angels they're actually still posted there God does that a lot around the world like when i was in rome before i asked the person who robbed me what are those lights shooting up from the ground like several miles from there what is that place and they said it was where the prison was that paul was held really whoa well it's nice to have a seer or see yours along you know every time we get together there are there are more seers on every trip i you know each time it gets more supernatural because God's releasing them so i'm looking at the clock i guess we better jump here let me just start with some questions now we're going to do a back and forth well people are wanting some clarification on cleaning their house and their property because we talked about that we won't do that every single week because it'll become too much that but we'll get a couple clarifications but there's a couple kids that wanted some questions answered and the first one's kind of hilarious but i think i know where it's coming from this is a son isaiah age nine and daughter rachel age 10 one of them is asking they must be thinking of father son and holy spirit because they're saying how many heads does God have i have three questions from them how many heads does God have as your first one yeah because some people in foreign countries especially they think our God has three heads because the bible talks about the three in one and people can't decide well does he only have one head does he have three the trinity are three individual beings who are God father God he's a spiritual God he's powerful that is his name he is the father it talks about him all through the word of God uh that is the father of jesus christ you know who jesus came jesus is the second member of the trinity he is the son of the living God the one who died for our sins on the cross and then there's holy spirit the spirit of the living God is an actual being he's not just a facet of God's personality the father yeah she is a real being he is God also and that he appears as like whirlwinds uh ribbons of color the fire he carries the fire where he goes uh i was like here i'll just tell you in the upper room in in israel i saw the portal holy spirit came to when he put the tongues of fire on those waiting and they were asking for you know to be consumed by the spirit of God so holy spirit is the third member of the trinity and he stands to the left side of the throne there's even like a well of oil called the oil of the holy spirit that he takes and pours on people sometimes it comes out of bibles those things really do happen right so there's three individual Gods they're all God but the reason is the three in one is because they have the ability to step inside of each other and the way the father explained to me was he caught me up to heaven i saw the father sitting on his throne there's christ sitting at his right side there's holy spirit on the left and he said now we will be the three in one jesus stands up and steps totally inside of his father you can't see him anymore he's in the father holy spirit comes and steps inside the father and the father goes now we're the three in one it is that simple that's a literal thing that's not a symbolic picture that literally happens and even in the bible when jesus would say to the father me in you and you and me i desire that they that talks about the body of christ be one as we are one because when you go to heaven you can step inside the father jesus steps inside the father and holy spirit steps inside the father and then you're all there together it's an amazing thing and you have more understanding of the spirit realm you have a spiritual body and so they as God they are the God head they each have a head they're three individual Gods and they step inside become the three and one the trinity the holy trinity and so that's the best explanation that's exactly the one the father gave me i understood clearly and then and then of course then the holy spirit steps out christ stepped out when i'm standing before the throne of God he said now we are father son and holy spirit it is so simple a five-year-old can understand that that's really good very very good okay now this might come from this is there's three questions here this might come from someone wrestling around with a parent maybe because he's saying is God ticklish uh i i hear God laugh a lot and i think it's the things we say uh even when we lived in him i remember hearing him laugh a lot and uh when i'm with him in heaven sometimes he laughs i say things i say silly things that make him laugh when i'm on the earth and i have to say he has a funny bone somewhere that he had to carry all of us like children he better have a sense of humor and i would have to say yeah he'll probably tickle you when you get to heaven especially children i know jesus does that also jesus really wow okay and then the last of the three is what language does God speak and of course neither if you're from india if you're from pakistan if you're from america so what language does God speak i i when you're in heaven you understand every language that's spoken it says in the bible that in heaven every tongue that's their dialect every tongue every tribe that means all the different ethnic groups and every nation will be represented in heaven that some from everywhere from all those places will be in heaven so God made it wonderful that no matter what language anyone is speaking you know what they're saying and you could say something to them in english and they would understand it completely that barrier is removed that no matter what you say when i hear the father speak i've heard him speak in hebrew sometimes but understood in heaven on the earth i wouldn't understand it but most of the time i hear him speak to me in english since that's the language i use but in saying all of that there is a language the language of angels which the father gave them and they communicate with each other i don't know what they're saying and yet they do that in heaven also they have their own language they can understand the language as we speak but it even talks about the tongues of angels in the bible and you remember the bible said every tribe tongue and nation would be represented so even the angels are going to be present at this huge event in heaven and even their own language when they use it at one point we will understand that right right now when i'm in heaven if the angels speak in their own language i don't unless the holy spirit tells me what they said wow now you said to me or to the to people many times i don't know if this is every time but you said you're you are when you're caught up with a father you're kind of as a as a little girl is that what you're saying and if so is it always that way and how old are you and do you have pink hair i am eight years old wow i met years old and i have these little blonde pig tails there's one little piece of pink in my hair really i think like a child that's why i come back and give a good report you know there's nothing bad to say about having but i noticed the fun things the glorious things the wonder and the splendor you know when you're little it's easy to get people to experience wonder you take them someplace they've always dreamed of going they're undone they're in awe of being there well that's what it's like to be in the throne room or to be with the father to be with his son to be the holy spirit i am in all of them but with the heart of a child i can embrace him openly with no fear of rejection with no fear of being misunderstood i'm always welcomed with that heart of a child you know the bible says you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom of heaven and i don't care if your grandma was 100 when she went there she'll feel like she's a little kid when she gets there normally people who are let's say over 20 in their 30s 40s 50s up to 100 your spiritual body looks like it's in its 20s so you already feel you're full of life and energy and excitement but when he takes me most of the time i'm like that eight-year-old child and i'm looking up at my father i can't wait to see what he's going to say i'm almost like vibrating with excitement and then he'll just whisk me and take me somewhere in heaven and show me uh places in heaven i never i even never dreamed he's still showing me places many times i think a couple times when i was caught by jesus i looked like i was in my 20s and even in the 80s i was in the mountains i think of north carolina and the lord called me aside we pulled over to rest i guess or stop for a break the lord said come outside i want to show you something all my life i have pursued christ i wasn't perfect but literally began to passionately pursue to know him for him as my savior as my king as my beloved and so i always had this intimate relationship and christ was waiting for me on this path and he said because you're willing to sacrifice yourself and give your life away to help the world know me i'm going to show you your your glorified body and he actually moved his hand and i saw myself but i will look like an eternity it's amazing oh i don't think i've ever shared this much with anybody i saw myself i remember the clothing i had on it was like the silver with lights moving in like it was alive and my hair was really long it had shades of pink and white and it was beautiful really long right wow yeah and this was in the 80s before i started doing the heaven thing i always had encounters with christ and he said because you're willing to give your life away i'm going to let you see what you'll look like in your glorified body for eternity so i can tell everybody you always win when you choose christ your eternity is set in the most magnificent um amazing places he's got planned for us okay on the earth you have to live with all everything going on and there's society and there's bad people and not nice people and people who are unkind or harsh your life that ends when you leave this planet you step into a whole new life of joy and celebration that you can imagine but the thing about being alive today i'm gonna step back for just a minute uh the thing about being alive today is this is starting a whole new time not the darkness i can't say that enough i mean people think it's all bad and wicked and evil because you're actually seeing it in action but it is not staying that way we have several hundred years left you know i'll just say it okay in the end it's not going to get the band-aid off let's just say powerful powerful things that the bible talked about the greater works people stopping earthquakes and making them put it back the way it was wow and you take the lid off the jar and raise the dead that was cremated these are coming you should be excited that you're part of christ we're supposed to be christ-like he has no fear no regrets no anger there's no hate no rejection you know what i'm wearing the scarf because he said i am love it's not about himself christ he is love he loves us enough to share what is coming he loves you enough to keep you in his own hands through this is what what happening it will not remain and he says it to me it will not remain this way it will not be the new normal what will be the new normal is is satan getting bashed continually by the body of christ wow wow wow well let me uh let me blend three uh for time and efficiency uh let me just before i ask you these three questions about who's in heaven is it true or not true that if you don't see a particular person in heaven that doesn't mean that they're not there would that be true that is true that does not mean they're not there they could be anywhere in heaven and when people go to heaven there's favorite places they begin to go to and visit a lot uh they're not always in their mansion as magnificent or amazing or fun as that mansion mentions are fun too they're not just you know glorious and beautiful there's some of them are just all about fun because that person has that heart for that but if they're out doing things with the prophets or with king david or something else so they're invited you're invited invited let me tell you you're invited invited invited things going on in heaven then that doesn't mean you're going to necessarily see somebody that doesn't mean they're not there right yeah and that's good to get that out because people will will word their questions they'll say is so-and-so in heaven and that just because you haven't seen them doesn't mean they're not there unless you know differently so these are the three that i've got they're different questions ones and i had asked you this about princess die and someone else before and i forgot to remind you that you had not answered if you had seen so princess die joan of arc and billy graham have you seen any of those in heaven um i i i have totally seen billy graham one of the biggest welcome home parties ever um i got to see oral robbers i got to see quite a few people who did significant things with the life of course people hear me talk uh all the time about some i can't even remember the name right now but i've seen great men and women of God there uh yes princess die and people can argue all you want to about this she knew who christ was she had reached out to him in desperation and her life didn't turn out the way she thought she was so innocent when she stepped into the royalty thing and was not treated fairly you know by her husband and other people i just put it out there's truth this has been in the papers for years when she wanted this stuff and she was brokenhearted and i tell you you can see uh when her sons were being raised even after she had passed and gone to heaven her sons were being raised what she had put in them about being kind and doing things right and respecting people i'm not talking about stuff they might or may not be doing now but as they were raised up they had something special in them that was deposits from christ from their mother and so i can say she did right by God by training them up in the way they should be preparing to be someone who loved christ not necessarily even for the royalty and so yes God does honor her and yes i've seen her in heaven joan of arc is absolutely in heaven she literally gave her life for the gospel for the kingdom she also is honored in heaven and loved by people and people want to hear their story now when i say that they want to hear the story they experience with christ in their life beyond growing up even things that they went through they want to know what really happened in those days in your life and those are those are major people that they would want to see and of course billy graham was loved by so everybody in heaven i think loved him yeah as oral roberts did so and now of course i've also seen uh john wayne i've seen some of the different stars that gave himself to christ i've seen renowned people i've seen people nobody knew i mean seen mother teresa in heaven who's still trying to uh be a part of helping people if she can she just likes to love people and give hugs so there are many people in heaven you would think they're never going to work out there yeah you said he had said you'd seen michael jackson whitney houston whitney houston and then yeah receiving her rewards at the throne yes she gave herself that to God i'm sorry oh and then the comic uh i can't think of his name hilarious robin williams you've seen him in heaven i have okay and that was a tough one because because he was so dark and depressed toward the end that he took his life but you'll clarify especially if people are on here new you haven't heard it the bottom line is you said that the lord has said there's a difference between committing suicide which is an act of almost terror against other people and someone who was so dark and down that they couldn't bear another day and they that's not suicide in the lord's eyes is that right you're not able to bear the suffering you're under and i also will just say this about robin williams and any comedian guard your heart if you're oppressed a lot that's the enemy goes after people who bring laughter to our lives and there's several comedians right now who still experience oppression and depression the enemy doesn't want the men to be funny he just can't stand that he wants everyone to be suffering and agony and doom and gloom robin williams and his friends knew this his family knew this he would reach out and go to these um restoration centers for help and he'd go he'd be okay for a while but because that that was continually brought against him by the enemy he still was suffering and so the last place he went to and i saw this one interviewing don't remember who was interviewing him he kept mentioning God this was just maybe a few weeks before he actually ended his suffering but he kept talking about we all need to know God we need to understand who he is and receive that he has something for us he said words like that and then i found out the last place he went to for help was a christian uh center it was a christian center and he came to know christ there you trust christ and he was a different person he did very few interviews after that last time when he went there but he did one and they they brought up they tried to bring other things up to him he wouldn't talk about him he only talked about letting God reach out to you so yes he is in heaven oh that's awesome i'm looking at both the time in my set here um uh uh people wanted to know what and there's there's three or four versions of the same question okay so i'm gonna try and lump them together what do i do when people in my house are coming to my house guests chill adult children and i know they bring stuff whether it's harry potter whether it's other unclean stuff and they leave it even laying around what do i do how do i keep my spiritual atmosphere clean uh and then someone else said what if i live with the person so i assume that means like a spouse or and they're trying to figure out how do they stay clean when it's not in their power to keep every object out of the house so i've had like four or five questions that boil down to that and there's all very good solid answers to those questions because you as a believer have the right to not put up with activities of hell where you live you may not own the place you may not be the person over the place but you as a believer in christ don't have to tolerate the presence of the enemy you can evict that out of the place all the time if you do it every night before you go to bed or something nobody's watching you don't have to make a show in front of people to make them angry the first thing you do and i'll just use something for example let's say this is a magazine left somebody left laying around or let's say it's a video or something they left it laying on a table or something but it's not yours to throw away or burn which i did all the time by the way it was gone i shredded it i would bash it to pieces you know i want tolerate because i see the demons attached to it so let's say somebody leaves this it's either either a really bad magazine it could be a dvd even music satanic music music talks about drugs and death and dying and don't you don't want that in your atmosphere this is what you do number one don't play it don't listen to it if they want to play it go somewhere else take authority over the atmosphere and say you evict the presence of the enemy and then you tell the host of heaven attack the demonic that's attached to that please make sure you say that they'll go after anything that's attached they'll bash them to pieces they'll bash the demons so here's this lane here right and you walk up and you see it sitting there you take your hand which is filled with the anointing you say i cleanse this for the kingdom and evict any darkness after that even if that person who it belongs he plays it that darkness won't affect you don't willingly sit there and watch it but it will have no power to affect you because you dealt with that darkness i would take the television i can't remember what you call it the thing you changed channels with let's say that's this right it's laying there and you're so tired of somebody whether it's a spouse or somebody else who who thinks they have rights watching things you don't approve of and you don't want that stuff do the same thing i release the anointing that breaks the yoke of darkness and i declare they'll get tired of watching that stuff they won't want it anymore i notified the right of the enemy to operate through it wow and this thing that controls that the television or whatever you will notice a drastic change of them not watching it as often or they'll go man i'm tired of that and they'll try to find something else but when people say nothing the enemy comes in and takes over wherever he can take over make sure at night when everybody's men you open the front door and say add every part of the enemy out of this house in jesus name and whatever's left behind will run out that door so yes you can do things about it you have a right as a believer to be free from any effects of the enemy and if things show up because someone who owns a place let him in you say i serve the most high God i will not serve you get out and as a believer you have every authority to not tolerate any of that stuff in your life no matter where you're living right now if you have a choice to live of course you're always going to try to find a place that's free from it but if you say you're under your parents maybe you're 14 maybe you're 10 maybe 11 or 12 you can do the same thing when they're not looking because when you make people angry you're going to give the enemy an ability to then try to attack you in other ways so be covert right now in your life if you're young don't put up with anything coming in or music coming in that you don't want and make sure that you're kicking it out and especially in your own room you can put your hand around the door frame and say i apply the blood of christ you don't have to actually do it i apply the anointing to keep anything in enemy out of my room and your angels will literally stand in front of your door and will not allow anything to come into your room or mess up the atmosphere of where you're sleeping at night that's good now that's really really good Kat now there was a second set of questions by multiple people they're asking a similar question but they're saying outside of my home maybe in another city are either my adult children or maybe it's the parents do i have authority to do anything about them of course everybody believes in praying for and praying against evil so i don't think that's the question they're asking what do i have authority to cast out if any from let's say my child down the road or another city you're related to these people you have a great authority over all the power the enemy trying to control them whether they're involved in witchcraft if it's drugs if it's pornography if it's just hating people maybe they they have uh involved in all kinds of things you don't like that their mom then you could take power over all the part of the enemy and come in the host of having to go pull down every stronghold of satan controlling them and it doesn't matter if their son daughter husband cousin uncle it doesn't matter who that is you have authority jesus said i give you power over all the power of the enemy he didn't say but not in this place or not in this situation if it's taking authority over darkness you have to say something okay don't go to their face and say i'm kicking the demons out away from you okay don't say that unless God tells you to say it and he normally wouldn't the activities you take in your own life and i can tell you declaring and decreeing it says when you dare to declare a decree it shall be established unto you right there your words have power in them and it doesn't matter if they're on the other side of the world if that's your son your daughter you have authority to speak about their life over the darkness controlling them they still have to make a choice but when the enemy when the demonic is removed that is influencing them or and empowering them to do things that are wrong that leaves an opening for the holy spirit to go in there and operate in the fullness of the power of christ because you took authority that's good that's really good well let's see i've got a couple more this one could be big one a long winter could be short um this lady said i've been wondering what the crucifixion was like for God the father what's the father there watching when jesus breathed his last why did jesus cry out that God had forsaken why did God leave him i feel like jesus likely knew that was coming but but in that comment he seemed surprised that his father had forsaken him what can you tell us about what that looked like or actually what uh first thing i'll try to make it as brief as i can but you know i'm a detail yeah yeah go for it just go for it i'm a detailed person people so God shows me in detail he absolutely knew every single thing this is the father knew everything that would happen to christ when he sent him he knew it before he sent him he's been from the beginning to the end which means every part of time that will exist the father has been to that he's already seen it he knows what's going to happen he makes choices but he knows that certain things have to happen to make our life possible so he actually before the word that was christ's name that's what they the angels and army they called christ the word even the father called him the word before he came to die he wasn't called christ jesus christ he was called the word the father he would go somewhere where there was nothing the father would speak what he wanted and and the word who became christ would step out and make it and so that's the relationship they had he would step in and out of him all the time when they created they did it together and he knew within this time the father knew time is coming when something different will happen so he called the word to himself shared all that would happen in order to make a way for humanity to come back to God because adam gave it away but he knows that he fell he sinned he changed it for all of us so christ he had to have someone come to pay a price that made it possible to come back he explained to the word all these things i got to see part of that he actually had to tell him you have to be willing to have flesh put on your body you won't just be all spirit and for all the time you'll have that flesh you'll have to experience living with humanity you're God you know the father was God he was God you have to understand you be there you have to live and experience every single feeling emotion and temptation that you are not even involved or know or feel you'll have to go through all of it so you know what they go through to live on that earth you have to understand that satan will be there he'll want to wipe you out he won't know who you are in the beginning and he'll he won't understand because the word looked certain way he was all spirit christ who was born to the womb of a woman who took on some of the attributes of the jewish race didn't look like the word so satan didn't even know who he was for a while when he figured out who he was he thought he would do him in not knowing this was all part of the plan christ knew he would have to die on the cross he even shared it with his disciples he knew that was going to happen and so he knew that there'd be suffering he felt every bit of the pain that he went through he carried uh he was bruised with the stripes meant for our healing he was bruised for uh and you know he took those stripes he took the crown of thorns on him he gave himself he drank the cup in the garden of every evil wicked deed that could ever happen because it wasn't just his body being crucified it was the evil he drank in an innocent pure and innocent body that stuff had to be nailed to the cross which is why christ is the only one who can forgive sins because he died carrying the sins that doesn't give you the right to sin all the time you want to that's unrighteous to be righteous you repent of your sins and he will cleanse you from all unrighteousness so you have to understand that christ knew before he left heaven he would go through all that but he had to be willing to be planted as a seed in the womb of mary being birthed like every other person on the earth he would then have flesh on him now now in his glorified body that flesh can be as big as it wants as small as it wants so he still has that glorified uh part of him that's on him but walking on the earth he had experienced everything the the ridicule the unjust criticism the harshness of people's words and that's why he says that you know he he is the one who set your soul free he's the one who says cast all your cares on me because why he cares for you when you see the big picture you understand he went through all that just for you uh what was the question you know well on this one why did why did he what did he actually feel that his father had forsaken him during those moments did he literally feel like why have you forsaken me he had already told christ not christ never was away from the presence of his father even when he was talking to the disciples and training him the presence of God the father was with him he'd even go to the mountains it says to to speak with him and be with him but there was that point in his life when the father told him for three days you will not feel my presence but you yourself will have to trust me that i will raise you from the dead that you will walk in great authority he had already explained it but when it happens it's different when it happens yes the father did not look upon him at one point on the cross he turned his head away i don't think that he could bear it but he knew his son knew he wasn't watching he had to trust the father like we have to trust he had to trust him from that point on and he knew even though he'd been told he could feel the the presence leave him and the whole time that christ when he took his released his spirit out of his body on the cross he still didn't have the presence of the father yet people make up all these things he had to go to abraham's bosom or paradise where the thief was going to be he had to preach the gospel to those that God put there because they they believed in God himself then he left there went into hell he still didn't feel the presence of the father these three days he didn't feel him and he had to trust his father in the midst of hell where he was taken and kept and uh of course everybody knows that satan planned a big show himself and that didn't turn out right on the third day when the father he could hear the father's voice speak and thunder ripped through hell and christ stood up and melted the faces of these high-level demonic who sits on thrones around the world he melted their features like wax and colossians and said the principalities and powers that means they couldn't ever put back their features the way they were he demonstrated the power of the living God from himself in hell stripped satan of everything he had on took the keys of helgeth and the grave i'm telling you that was the biggest show ever except for when the father kicked all the of satan you know lucifer and all the one through the angels this was a show christ put on a show and it said in the bible he made a show of it openly in the midst of hell hell thinking they had him they couldn't wait for him to get out of there and then of course he raised from the dead took his body back his body was instantly glorified at that moment and he he he then he knew because he trusted his father his father did everything he promised and everybody should be doing that right now in the darkest times of christ's life when he could hear nothing he had to believe and trust what God had said to him so his father did not look upon him knowing not because he couldn't because he couldn't stand it necessarily as much as he knew his son had to trust him just like we have to trust the father ourselves yeah so so so good well we could go on for a long time but i think this is a good holy moment to stop on this point so people will ponder that man what is what uh what a sacrifice you know and and yet we are told to be joyful for what he did for the joy set before him he endured the cross amazing scripture amazing scripture so yeah well tell people remind people there's got a couple sites we have revealing heaven.com along the bottom there that's one of your sites tell people about both of those sites yeah revealingheaven.com is my corporation that God had me create a corporation uh because we would create so many things that would represent heaven and put him in the marketplace he himself was tired of the evil in the darkness i mean demons are put on everything everybody knows that why not put images of heaven why not put par army of heaven on there why not but places are in heaven on your t-shirts on your bags on your carpets on your walls and so God created one quest international which i am ceo of that revealingheaven.com is where you find the products that's where you find about the events but then God had me create Katker.com that's a literal website uh where you get so much revelation for free you can go and see and learn all kinds of there's training videos there's videos with revelation so many it took us forever to create that place uh there's interviews i've done with people that are on there that are powerful God calls it his spiritual platform well he is where he is allowed to say whatever he wants to say and at one point we probably will be doing webinars from there and other stuff from there but it's Kat Kerr.com it is also the only place on planet earth you can go to Kat Kerr.com and give to me online not through any facebook nobody's facebook nobody's youtube that is the only place we created for that and so you can go there and click on the treasury and do that or you can be become a guardian regards the treasure God put in me i'm very grateful for all the guardians out there who helped to support me but let me tell you planet earth is about to be touched by the power of the living God in what is never expected the darkness will shrink and scream and run into hide but let me tell you you yourself will stand up and take authority christ said you will rule with me now in this lifetime and in the life to come and he intends to keep that promise we are very very very good ken we're so grateful to you on behalf of all the viewers i just thank you again it's been a real neat partnership that i hope will continue for years to come so yes well thank you again and uh our our michael rit guy is in your neck of the woods somewhere there in florida he just arrived

manuel but sometimes there's a slight delay plus we usually have is like manuel yesterday had like five points he wanted to cover uh but manuel doesn't leave openings he just kind of keeps going so i i have to interrupt sometimes and every once in a while i interrupt a super important point if it's really good i try to say hold on hold on uh say that again but we do interrupt sometimes because we we want to honor the guest and giving their five points or whatever so uh please forgive me for interrupting um but we're trying to get all the content to you we actually we actually do let people talk more than almost any talk show on the air we let them go for quite a while but every once in a while right about the time i'm about to enter i interrupt and i'm right in the middle of interrupting pardon my pardon my interrupting as i'm speaking don't start say you've got to hear this i i blew it a few weeks ago and i think robin said you can't unsee this and i interrupted accidentally right in the middle of that but he did cover that the other day he said you can't unsee this so um really good stuff so well let's run uh the commercial for zappos so some of you who have

tens of thousands of your friends are already there we hired a new programmer who started yesterday who's going to work on the app we've got some issues with the app that it's slower but as we build it we'll add new features that you don't see anywhere else so you're going to love it tell your friends about it and that's good to see if there's any other questions um i think that's it now um okay so without further ado let's bring in Kat Kerr good morning Kat hello kev has an announcement about her brother so rather than say anything else let me just turn that over to you talk about your brother well first of all i want to let people know i have seven brothers whenever i say my brother they think i'm talking about rj i am not talking about rj the wild prophet God keeps in the wilderness okay i'm not talking about him today i i have another brother and uh he he was told he would uh be leaving for heaven over a year and a half ago and he said to them no i don't want to go and i mean he hung on he had some issues not the virus hello it was not anything about the virus but anyway so he finally made the decision he was going to go and transition and just go to heaven and so he talked with his wife and cover all that the point is this he's in heaven right now and i'm very excited for him and uh i'll just call him mr t that's not his name because i haven't cleared this with his wife i won't mention his actual name mr t will call mr t and um he actually would act like growing up this brother was so much fun with us and um i even know where he is living in heaven so i'm going to share that uh to all of you by the way why am i dressed like this no i'm not dressing like the romans with this draping thing this is heaven what i'm wearing is heaven culture if you were going to go to somebody's welcome home party which is what they call it there are no funerals in heaven i've said it so many times if you were going to go to a friends or family members welcome home party in the throne room you would dress like this you would have something that shined like the stars in the heaven that was beautiful you'd have some kind of gems because gems are everywhere in heaven they represent the love of the father this is actually a snowflake because my brother's favorite time of the year was christmas and i'm quite sure christmas was displayed all over in the throne room because it was his favorite time of the year that's what heaven does they'll take things that are your favorite and actually have them present at your throne room party that they give you most people during your service on the earth whatever you want to call it someplace i keep saying with the idea for someone to want to make a lot of money and bless people you need to start us what did i call that a party depot party depot instead of a funeral okay that's what you need to do and you have every fun exciting thing there that your loved one loved and let me tell you they're watching from heaven my brother's probably watching me right now i'm talking about him uh but he loved people i'll just tell you a little bit about verse he he took care of the homeless most of his life he was probably the most like my father who would bring homeless people in our own home he'd take food off our stove my dad did my brother worked with him a lot in doing that so even though my brother brother was a great businessman he had his own business here in the city which was uh tremendous uh he even had government contracts with stuff that he didn't know it was postal stuff it wasn't like covert you know that thing that kind of thing it wasn't like the cia what did he actually go home Kat when did he go he left friday no i'm sorry he left saturday we all went to see him friday night we went to see him several times we went to see him friday night and actually two months ago we all met at his favorite restaurant which was the piccadilly so my family could all come and see him uh we didn't know at that time when he was gonna go or what happened but he actually came and we all ate is his favorite place we talked a lot and did things which was great and um most people just as a tip to you most of the time if someone's really going to go they'll have a resurgence of energy and i guess uh more focus in their life no matter what they've been going through God actually kind of does that so they have an opportunity to have people come by and see them or they get to see people before they leave for heaven and i've known that happened so many times so he kind of had that thing happen for him and so he had a lot of peace on him in the room we were in his home and so but the angels i knew were so excited but then again my brother lived a wonderful life he loved people all kinds of people my brother was never um racial or biased against anybody he fed people literally would make big pots of stew and go in the alleys of our city and feed the homeless and he did it for years and years so you know he delighted the heart of God uh by pouring himself into others which he did all the time and so let me ask you the obvious question why are you so happy today why would i not be happy he is living in the most the best place ever when your loved one moves to heaven their life radically changes from the moment their spirit bodies stepped out of this physical body they are surrounded with joy with excitement with celebration i know everybody talks about peace you think about them like in the casket or something they're not doing that in heaven people that's their body on the earth their spirit man is very much alive they're young they look like they're in their 20s they're filled with expectation and uh you know they're taken to heaven in many different ways depending on what they would love jesus came and picked my brother up himself because he loved people because he loved people he was kind to people he helped many others and said before he fed people he would pay for hotel rooms for them find them places to live it's like he's walking in my dad's footsteps and so he delighted the lord with his life and so he came and picked him up himself in his own chariot and i'm just going to add this because i want to say it there was a guest in that chariot with jesus when he came from heaven as i already mentioned my brother's favorite time of the year was christmas many times he was dressed as saint nick forget the bashing about satanic people he was a real person who lived on the earth he was in turkey he actually made gift made or got gifts and gave them to children my brother did that every time of the year at christmas time somewhere he would dress as saying i take gifts to children and he always used to say this when i get to heaven one day i'm going to work with nick i'm going to work with him make toys and he said i can give him out in heaven well guess who was on that um chariot with jesus christ it was saint nick that's amazing i'm quite sure my brother was so delighted he probably could already stand it did you say you saw angels hanging around what did you say about it his own angels he's got quite a few angels they were uh every now and then i make eye contact with them they would grin at me they were grinning i was the only one that could see them there but they were kind of pacing back and forth just waiting they knew his time was short and he had a lot of peace he would still call up people's names you know we would hold his hand and we would talk to him we actually called family members especially me called my daughters and i always let them say goodbye you know put the phone up there this is a clue even if they're not responding that he was responding to a certain level but even if they're not and you know somebody would like to say goodbye call that person put the phone up to their ear and let them say it because their spirit man can hear you hear them clearly so the angels were all excited they kept smiling and i went well he's going to go really soon and so we just all declared my um my husband my mom and jen we were all there in the room we're in them we laid hands on them release the anointing because i tell you what that does you're either healed or you're gonna go home to heaven the other thing he loved a lot besides christmas uh well people first jesus first and then people at christmas but he loved america he was standing just like those who are still standing for america to have freedom liberty and justice that was him so we took this beautiful throw that was the american flag we all anointed it and laid it on him because i knew that would bless him it would it would just bless him so anyway the angels were all excited but when you're gonna go but from their present when that actually happens there's a point in the person's life when i know within seconds that they'll leave more angels rush in they rush through and yeah waiting for them to step out of their spiritual body then all of them including their guardian angels will take them right out and i actually see them leave many times the person is undone they're grinning from here to ear or they're yelling hallelujah and if there are people in the room they'll actually turn around wave goodbye even though nobody sees them they'll wave goodbye to the people or blow kisses to their family members and then they're on the greatest journey of their life all the way up to the cosmos uh they approach heaven for the first time which is the most brilliant thing it's a spiritual world there's millions of angels coming in and out of heaven all the time there's beautiful things in the atmosphere of heaven um just like burst of the rainbow or burst of the glory all over in the sky and then you approach where there's a landing port where you get out you disembark there there's a river of life right there jesus is usually waiting to greet you and sometimes people actually jump in the river of life and they like a child remember you're not 90 or 80 or 100 or 70 you're not sick there's nothing wrong with your body in any way whatsoever you you feel youthful you look youthful and sometimes jesus will start throwing water on you i've seen this many many times people have like a water fight in the river of life but when you get out you're not wet this is heaven you get in you feel from what you feel the water it's beautiful it's gorgeous it's filled with the life of God when you step out you're dry and then jesus will escort you through the crowds and let me tell you if you loved people there will be crowds of people to greet you there um your pets will be there to greet you also i remember uh just a short note i remember seeing oral roberts hum going literally uh got to go God caught me up and took me to heaven i saw him arriving in heaven and uh there was his wife waiting for him there and she just jumped in his arms and she said come on oral let's go make some music now i didn't know anything about their their younger years in ministry and she handed an acoustic guitar to oral roberts and they all went in the throne room with jesus and oral started playing and he and they were all singing together and i found out later i think it was either billy brown or a member of his family that told me when uh when they first started out uh oral and his wife always saying they would sing and he had an acoustic guitar he would play when they did that so that was just amazing so you have to understand you're entering from your death that you just had into life and life so abundantly and so yeah so that that's what happens that's what happens to everybody who's going to go home to heaven they are not suffering they're not sad they love you but they're going to the one who made them the one who died for them and they're so besotted with the love of God in the life of God and then you have this huge throne room party and like i said there's many things there that you love that you enjoyed um like i'm sure it probably was decorated like christmas because again that was my brother's favorite thing let me ask you a couple let me ask you two questions together your mom is still alive how is she taking this and my other question is what is that thing on your shoulder what is that you mean this one or this one the first one the blue the blue thing this is the uh this is the logo for the army of heaven the host of heaven it says the h there's a h and an i with the open portal behind it it's the time on the earth that we live in now where we are supposed to work together with the army of heaven so this represents the host initiative us working and actually commanding the army of heaven as christ always intended and so that's i where because it's connected to heaven my mother is celebrating just like i am we went to the funeral home the other day uh we're having a memorial party for him and uh it's gonna be great so we discussed all that i think he was undone this man was so undone because my my sister-in-law margaret was there even brother's wife was there nobody cried we were not crying we were not mourning because we all know heaven is real there was excitement uh all around us the whole time we talked about his favorite things and what he would like to have there to do we're going to make sure when he watches from heaven he enjoys that that celebration memorial food so good that's so good this is going to help a lot of people uh because i remember i went to my the first viewing i ever went to was my grandmother and everybody was so sad now there was some conversation so it wasn't total sadness but uh we had believed at that time my theology our theology was everything that was that person was in the gray was about to be in the grave that was it there was no heaven right now and you know so there was a lot of sadness um and um you know i remember i remember when my father went home 30 years ago this year 30 years ago last month my theology had of course changed and his had not his had not and so i have this uh fantasy that on his way up because he knew how i changed my belief that you go to heaven and i i just had this fantasy that on his way up he was going steve was right you know what steve they actually say that they didn't say that and this is the humor this is the humor of the father they actually have a welcome center in heaven for those who are having culture shock heaven culture shock or they think some people think there's no music uh you're just a ball of light you can't do anything you're you're spirits you're a ball of light they don't see you as a spiritual body but i want to remind people what the word says it says to be absent from the body that's dying is to be present with the lord we all know he's not the grave so if he's not the grave and he's sitting at the right hand of the father where does that take you that clearly says when you leave this body you're going to go to heaven to be with him and also in the bible jesus said i go to prepare a place for you he's talking about heaven in my father's house that's the world called heaven are many mansions there's another clue i go to prepare a place for you he's not talking about at the end of time he means when you die you leave there you move to heaven you have an amazing mansion that he made for you you have a real life in heaven and so it's exciting heaven has a party they're excited i feel the same way having been to many peoples i've been present many times when people died and laughed and they were shocked if i was there i waved at them [Laughter] but all of heaven knows the day you will come home they know it they're not surprised God has your party ready he has rewards for you he gives right at the throne i mean you are so undone just standing in their presence seeing world coming from him it's just amazing have you gotten to see your brother's mansion at all i do know where my brother's mansion is it is in christmas town well have you seen it have you been inside i have seen the outside of it and i know because his love for that and i know for sure he is working with nick saint nick that's why he was there he was there to greet him and my brother would always say this i'll just step outside my mansion and if there's not enough snow i'll say snow and it'll snow and he was right he was going in his own heart he knew this yeah he already knew this he was all for everything i did and said it was all for all of that so he knew where he was going and he'd already told God i would love to have this and do this and so he'll be living in christmas town he'll be there where it snows all the time and um he'll be creating and inventing toys that's what he he wanted to do as a hobby on the earth and now he'll get to do it in heaven so good well uh looking at the clock let's get to the next thing thank you so much by the way you've helped i've told thousands of people who just watched this untold thousands it's a celebration it is let's talk about anything the lord might have told you about the current events right now what's going on in the government i will tell you i will tell you well well the father's continuing to talk to me all the time he's never never changed what he said to me about justice being served that is absolutely going to happen i can't give you a date he gives me dates i say them i just know this he doesn't like any of the stuff going on he does not hate the people he does not like what they're doing he despises evil wickedness harm control crushing stealing lying we all know what the word says about that but when your soul becomes so wicked you sell your whole self to the devil you're doing exactly what he wants and we know the bible says the devil wants to kill steal and destroy with it sounds pretty much what's going on right now but God is actually yes he's recording all of it and there'll come a point where he says no more and he means no more he means no more and so i can say this that is definitely getting closer but the people the thing that really gets me is the americans the true americans the moral majority who don't like evil who don't want to get you know get rid of the life they've been living they love God in our country they love helping families they love their own family they love their job they want to make a living they don't want to get a handout they're finally starting to rise up and say we're not taking this i mean they're not just making statements they're showing up places and saying it and i think there's probably so many lawsuits right now not just against the bee person who is illegitimately sitting in that spot and i think they're starting to get really concerned up there behind the barbed wire because so many people are not just saying no they're resisting everything they're saying that that is law now if they say something if they make a law that is literally against our constitution we actually don't legally have to abide by any of it but things are not understanding is there some situations where even congress believe it or not don't want what he is proposing and he just thought he could write a law and make the law and they've been reminding him you can't do that this has to be approved it has to go through a process and some of the process has to go through the governor so guess what people the governors who like life who want their their states to be set free they're point blank telling them up there in dc we're going to open up we don't care what you say the governors actually have a say quite a say over what happens in their state so those who want freedom and liberty are taking it they're telling the people to ditch the masks no more mask mandates everyone's going back to work because some actually haven't done that yet we're going back to life like we had before we're gonna have a real life and they're not going to allow guess what they're not defunding the police now that that man sitting up there can say oh he wants to that he wants to defend them he can't do that the decide in their states if they want to or not so the majority of the governors are for life they're for hope they're for freedom and they want it and they're taking it they're taking it he can't do things to stop them from doing that because they're appointed they're still in their um they're still in the midst of their time to be governor and so many people are increasing their joy is starting to spread across our country because governors are making the right decision of what to do and you know if you don't know these people the uk themselves said we're not doing the virus thing anymore we're not doing it we're done with it okay we're going to treat it like the flu but people are going to go back to work because they don't want to lose their country and i guess it's something they didn't think about the person with the bee name who is sitting behind the barbed wire they thought they could control the whole world and if you didn't know that that's the goal not just to get america they want to they can't control the leaders of other countries so when a whole country says we're not doing this anymore what do you think they're going to do they can't send an army over there and do something so this is what's happening their plan is failing before their very eyes and so this is concerning them very much because they're no longer participating with the pandemic that's what they're saying no more pandemic it's just like any other virus we're all going to go back to work we're going to have our life back and there's several countries who literally said that so those people who are even from china and other places who thought they're going to get our country and then they're going to take the whole world they have totally missed it they have missed the fact that you can't go to a country that's already free and all their people and you're not even in that country say we're taking it this is what's going to happen and they're saying no we're not so that's actually what is literally happening right now the people are starting to stand up their self the governors are doing what they're supposed to and even leaders about the country are realizing hey this is ending we're done with it God doesn't give you a timings exact timings but trump coming back what kind of thing can you say about trump coming back i know he's still got plans that he's working out right now he's first of all going to make himself more visible than he has before which is totally irritating those who are also it's not just irritating them they're deeply concerned that that president trump is actually appearing in places and speaking to people and this is the biggest thing he has created his own website now he can say what he wants to to whoever signs up for is 45 office.com that is president trump's brand new website he has freedom to speak and say what he wants to so they're really upset because what they actually plan to do hasn't happened they thought by this time everybody be kneeling and bowing down to the evil and wickedness that they want to put throughout the whole country that they were going to um implement every law every fake law that was made they thought for sure we just roll over and give up and say well we might as well do this now there are actually people saying that and i don't know what's wrong with their mind okay i have a clear mind and i want liberty freedom and justice because that's what america is made by God for God we we the people welcome God in our country so they can just about forget about what their plan is because they're not going to have a good life okay so the people are finally doing what trump actually wanted them to do to begin to stand up and come against those things trying to be crushed on them if you remember one of his last comments when he was saying well i'm going to go but i will be back and then they they the other the left was saying well these are all our plans and he looked at them and said good luck on that how about that he said saying we're going to take over everything and we're going to change everything and stop everything when he says we're good luck with that he knew the american people were not going to bow down to that stuff so i can tell you he's very happy there's so much going on right now i'm i'm pretty sure you're gonna start seeing some major things happen uh especially because of him and he is visiting the governors of course we already know that some of them have said we're just giving up the pandemic ourself and going back to life that delights him he loves it and so i just want to encourage people God says of course it's not over it isn't over till God says it's over and when it's over it'll never be the same again that's so good well let's jump into some questions about heaven i the first one i've got a whole stack of them here but the first one is has has your mom ever been to heaven my mom has not been to heaven but she has seen angels she's seen angels right here i'm in my studio people that don't know it we live right here uh pretty soon we have been preparing and packing our personal stuff to get a personal place because our this whole thing is taking over this whole place here we have very few spots we can call it personal my mom is we have angels who are residents here residents not talking about our own personal angels okay i'm talking about angels who walk up and down the hallways to guard and protect us here she has seen them quite a few times and so she knows all this is real she's heard things said to her from heaven my mom has and real soon we're going to have her on one of our shows so she can give some tips and some comments of her own my mom has a lot of comments about the laughs i've i've met your mom many times uh well the po one point to me is she was in the same she's in the same vein that you are rejoicing yes she's not seen heaven so the people need to take note of that she's not seen heaven herself and she's rejoicing with you that her that her own son has gone home right yes and we also know she absolutely knows our dad my dad uh she knows my dad is there for sure my mom is a major major intercessor she spends hours in prayer she has a diaries that she keeps when my mom writes everything down so she's written everything down the whole history of our family she's actually going to write a book about all of it herself at 90. she turned 90 yesterday she walks around she walks around all by herself she walks around she has her own mind it's sharp as steel let me tell you what she has the most amazing appetite we took her out to eat yesterday for her birthday and she loves cards she loves uh people's comments and so she actually has already almost like her own little following she also is anointed literally to call babies from the father to the earth which means she is anointed she has her own following she has prayed she has her own prayer lines when i go somewhere she'll pray for people that can't have children and she makes him understand are you going to be accountable for this child okay you're not going to just go to my mom and say pray for me you're going to get a talk to by her and uh she's raised 15 she should know right so she calls them and she literally calls them in yeah the father has anointed her to do that so we almost every person she's ever prayed for any couple or person to pray for they have a baby i mean they have on she's she's going to start a gallery of pictures and she stays in contact with them until they they have the baby we call it the baby zone my i operate from the revelation zone my mom operates from the baby zone that's good okay here's a question now you remember ellen from norway yes okay so she has this question she says i don't know if this is a thing in america but only in norway but in norway it's very clear that most people have an understanding that God the father is the greatest of the trinity jesus is the middle and the holy spirit is the third we know that they are one but only God the father knows the time when jesus is coming back he is bigger in appearance and sits on the throne with jesus on his right hand holy spirit everywhere so she sees them as a hierarchy talk about that is that true oh you mean the father's more important than the others great yeah is he the greatest of the great he would laugh he would laugh at you for saying that [Laughter] this is what he was says to me we cannot exist without one another that would be his answer to her it's not like he's more important what he does is different than what jesus does their appearance is kind of similar because i know it says he's the express image of the father doesn't mean he's an identical twin that means he operates much like the father does himself but the father what makes him different is he's the one that's why he's called the father isn't because he's higher or bigger is he's the only one who carries us in him until we're born jesus doesn't carry all of this he's probably really glad he doesn't have to do that uh jesus holy why does only the father know the day or the hour of jesus coming what he calls it sounds like he's more important that way it's not it because he is his father it isn't because he's more important like i just said they can't exist without the the other okay they're three separate individual Gods but they always operate together they are the trinity they are the three in one get the one okay the three and one they didn't say the three and three there's three and one which means they agree and talk about everything that's going to be done they understand which one's going to do which part but God isn't operating all on his own he knows when he's coming back because he's the one who will send him and the reason why he knows when he's coming back number one he's going to send him he is his father he is his son he's going to make sure that the people on this earth those who are believers are living the life they're supposed to when christ comes the father said the father said it will not be a rescue party they still don't have it right they still understand it they're coming for a glorious church that is the body of christ with no sin in their lives so hello people you can get to a place where you don't sin stop using that scripture all of sinning comes short of the glory of God that isn't even talking about living a sinful life you don't understand revelation that scripture is talking about you the sin is you're not carrying the glory you're not producing the glory of God because you have too many other things in your life it isn't about sinning sinning sinning it's that you've fallen short you've fallen short of creating the glory of God from you with your life which you will then carry and release in waves that will be shock waves wherever you go around the world God wants to see that happen the father chooses because it's his son his son died for our sins but the father asked him will you do this and he had to say yes i will do it the father gets his choose when he comes back because he knows everybody what they're doing and at that time when christ comes no member of the body will be sinning no spots thoughts or sins no wrinkles that's your flesh your rights your opinions and your attitudes showing up so guess what we got a long way to go [Laughter] yeah no spot or wrinkle it does say that a spot is sin perfection and you know even even let me give that take another scripture it talks about the spots because the father shows me all these he says when i said uh he said do not even touch a garment that is spotted by the flesh in the word that means people who commit sins people are filled with their own self and don't even care about others don't even take something they own don't take it don't wear it because there's a residue of them on it i understand all that being a seer i'll look at things and some people's garments have stuff on it you don't want your own garments collect your words what are you saying okay so this is why the father chooses he's going to make sure the body of christ will or he wouldn't said it they will get to a place where they're they have no sin in their life they're walking free of sin they have laid down their flesh to do what christ wants them to do there's a generation coming that will do that and it isn't right now right i i i can attest to that because i threw a jacket away a coat a big coat my father died in alaska he had this big heavy coat now my father had a huge anger problem now he went to be with the lord because he got his heart right he had a huge anger problem and i and i asked my mom if i could have that coat not knowing about this concept about even touching the clothes every single time i wore that jack that coat i got angry for no reason i was angry and i finally thought there's this is not a coincidence i went out to the trash at the end of our dirt road and threw it in the trash which is a weird thing to do but no one ever told me it works that way i just figured that out by myself because i i was turned getting angry for no reason people steve that happens to them so many times sometimes it's oppression they don't even know why and they've taken something from someone who lived so depressed maybe they even committed you know took their took their life because they couldn't handle that maybe they got to where they couldn't handle living you do not want to take stuff like that from people if it's a precious treasure this is what you do i'm gonna show you what you do okay here's my gavel let's say this came from somebody who maybe like steve said was angry all the time somebody maybe gave this away and it was given to me trust me anything that comes to me i do this to it maybe if i had not you take it you go i cleanse it for the kingdom can you see that steve right he plans us for the kingdom if you take a garment from somebody that you know wasn't living right because you loved them you put your hand you say i cleanse it for the kingdom and i'll tell you what happens the fire of God will come out of your hand and it will burn every bit of that stuff off i want to know i don't sit in one chair in the restaurant without touching that chair and say i cleanse it for the kingdom sometimes residue but people walk past me not saying a word and i hear what they said coming off their garments like your dad wore that coat all the time angry it absorbs literally into the garment we have to understand the spirit realm around us your words create something and so you don't want to take things from people that's why he said don't touch a garment spotted by the flesh that means they sinned in the flesh that could have been all kinds of things that they did wrong and if you take that the residue you can't wash it off in the washing machine by the way and you wear that you'll start having the same thoughts or the same expressions coming out of you and he just confirmed that i've known that for a long time so be careful take if a thrift shop if you like the thrift shop whatever you get in the thrift shop cleanse it for the kingdom before you take it to your house loved christmas and it was one of the best holidays in our house but he would get angry at christmas i love christmas so the only time of course in the northwest i needed a coat that was that heavy from alaska was at christmas time so i wore it and every christmas i wore it for like it took me about three years to figure this out i was unreasonable i was angry i ruined people's fun and i thought this is nuts so i could have cleansed that is what you're saying yes you could have yeah okay well it's really what you find what you're cleansing it with so you understand the bible says when you receive in first john 2 27 there's a scripture for people complaining about him first john 2 27 says when you receive jesus christ as your savior you receive a deposit of the anointing okay that's his what he walked in he gives you a measure and it goes in you that anointing breaks the yoke of darkness so when i say i'm cleansing up for the kingdom that's the anointing that i carry the anointing looks like blue fire coming out of you when i do that it comes out and burns it off so if you're a believer you can do that if you're not then you better go get jesus because but you need to remember that's what it is the anointing you carry is very powerful i'll lay it on a chair if i go in people's homes i'll brush the wall and release it in the whole place but you make sure that if you've got stuff right now in your home go lay your hands on it and cleanse it cleanse it for the kingdom which means it's okay for you then to to have it or take it but if if it's been something that's been worn a long time or somebody you don't know you don't want to get something that came from somebody who was really wicked i wouldn't take anything i wouldn't even take it to cleanse it but but if you like this top especially make sure that you're you're laying your hands that this was all part of my new mentoring thing i'll be doing but you get it for free right now so you said clothes but you also mentioned chairs if if i inherit the possessions of my family members of it so it's not you'll worry it doesn't matter if it's jewelry i don't care what it is it takes a second i cleanse it for the kingdom this was given to me by by somebody who was very precious um but i can tell you this if i don't really know their life it no matter what comes to that male sometimes if it's a letter i'll cleanse it for the kingdom wow i didn't know that i lived this is a lifestyle this is a lifestyle if you want to keep hell out of your home and away from you and i would tell you this if your child is started back to school please as you walk down the hallway lay on one place on the on the on the wall and you say i cleanse it for the kingdom and any of the darknesses penetrate anywhere in there will be taken out let me ask you a question that's not on my list because this makes me think of that i i had an issue and this is years ago now at a business and um there was conflict everywhere especially in this one spot and i thought what what's going on these these two uh female well it doesn't matter if they're female these two workers got in a fight and on this thing and so i talked to my friend paul who i've mentioned before on the phone and i said i'm going to walk through this building it was a huge building that's not the building i said i want you to tell me if you said something and and i went walking around first of all not through any doors or anything that i did and and he said nothing nothing nothing and i rounded the corner i went to this one spot by the cash register and he said oh what's that and i said this is a spot where two two two employees got in the fight and he said well tell it to get out of there you know you'd always say tell them to get on there and then so i said okay i did that and then i walked around and i went to like three doorways in this huge building and every and i went through the first doorway and i didn't tell him where i was where i said i'm just walking and i went through a door and he said stop and i said he said where are you and i said i'm in the doorway he said they like demons like to hang out in doorways because people pass to tell it to get out that happened two more times in the same building to two more doorways and he didn't know i was in a doorway and he kept saying stop what where are you so tell me about that do you see that too i do see it um there's so much you know there's so much i have time to talk to people about but i think because i think in the father is kind of switching me um we may have a comment we make each time we meet to talk about stuff like that because people this walk on this earth like everything's great and everything's normal and everything's okay if they at least have an understanding of how the darkness operates i don't want to overwhelm people with it but you have authority over all of it God jesus had to give you power over all the power of the enemy and one of those things he said to cast out demons right well sometimes those demons aren't in people sometimes they take territories sometimes they set up camp if somebody uh lived in a certain place and they were really wicked then they probably have some spirits around that place if you this is another tip if you move into a house that belonged to someone else make sure you take this is real important so listen get you some communion if you're going to move into a place you didn't live in and someone else did get communion serve communion do you say say just like you would the same thing this is his blood he said for me this is body broken for me and i commit this property to the lord pour the communion drink some take a bite everything then pour it on the ground outside the property and take a part of that what's left and just kind of put it on in the ground because that will cleanse your whole property i haven't never i've moved 30 times i never move without doing that and then if i ever did man stuff would start showing up and because the enemy will take whatever he can get away with so i understand what you're saying um i actually went to our church one time they used to have to ask me would you go we're looking for something sometimes you want to tell me what we're looking for something so go lay your hand on the doors and see if you feel anything well i came up i touched every door in the offices right so i when i touch the pastor's door this is what the father said i approve of him and he said i have proven him three times i approve of him i approve of him i approve of him i never even had to go in there for anything that was pastor senior pastor paul zink from new life christian fellowship i think his son tom now but but how about that yeah he's just telling me he's okay right and then they took me in the sanctuary continuing to look for it well i finally found it it was something some witch doctor or witch had done a sacrifice and poor stuff i was stuck at like 16 rows up into our big sanctuary and i could smell it i could smell it it smelled like death i kept walking and walking on my stomach was getting sick and finally i think it was my husband i said put your hand underneath there and he brought it out it was two pieces of this gnarled looking wood and God said that was i had a sacrifice on it so we took it outside and burned it and then that thing was gone i had two two events in this house well i've had more because i'll call paul because he's the only one i know that operates that i can call it uh and i smelled sulfur yeah i smelled sulfur and i and so i called paul and i said i'm not telling you where i walk and then i went to the i went to the back door which is where i smelled it yeah and and suddenly he said stop where are you and i said right here i smell sulfur here he said tell it to leave it's always told to leave so i the other one is this is i really want to know this i have a master bathroom and it's fine now but it was an add-on by the same owners here that we bought this house from and every time i went into that bathroom i would get a migraine a migraine would begin and sometimes it would continue so i i called him on that and he said tell it to leave your voices you know and then so i did okay so time passes and it came back i went back into the bathroom so months goes by and all of a sudden they go in the bathroom and the migraine starts why does it come back what allowed it to come back it will try to do it if you say nothing uh satan doesn't do anything saying does everything without permission unless somebody sold out to him like he's got permission to operate in the uh fake illegitimate administration right now they gave him permission okay but sometimes they'll come back if they once had an area they'll wait and come back to see if they can take it back again and if that ever happens to somebody you should always evict it and i actually say evicted i opened my front door and he fixed stuff like i don't know how it got in sometimes people come in and out and stuff like that every night before i go to bed i'll open the front door and say i evict you in jesus name that i missed and then i then i invite having to invade my home then i can go to bed okay so you have to understand the enemy will try again that's why some people who are free let's say they got free from alcoholism they got free from drugs the enemy will attempt to bring it back and you have to say no i am not receiving this i evict you in jesus name because if the enemy possess something even if it was an area a place and people cast it out they'll they will routinely just come to see if they can come back and the more you say no you're not you know i serve the living God i don't serve you get out in jesus name they have to go so you know if you don't come back and check they just say well they're not bothering me i guess i'll stay now let me ask you this i'm looking at the time i got a few more minutes there was one other lady who i still know and i would call her back if i if when i need her but i i brought her out this probably 10 12 years years ago and i said i want you to come cleanse my property because that was her gift and she had this ability she would say i can i she would capture these demonic and i don't know where she said them but she would capture them so she walks around my house and she would do her little shaking and i said what are you doing what are you seeing she says there's a whole bunch of demons they've been trapped here for a long time i'm just i'm just taking care of them and she would do this on two or three different places and i'd say well how did they get here she says they've been trapped here for you know my sense was decades years whatever and after she did that the very next day i had the i had this and this is at my house i had the biggest financial success at my office that i had ever had after she cleansed my house does that make sense it makes perfect sense because the enemy wherever he can be and he's just left to do whatever they'll do what they can get away with and that is sometimes how that shows up and what she said i understand what she said it isn't necessarily they were trapped in the house it could have been that they were uh on that property where your house now sits there's no telling what went on if there was a force there could have been a coven for witches that practiced there you know i'm not trying to scare people i'm letting you know this is how things happen and they gathered there may be there all the time and then they were just left and whoever was over that group died or left they would remain unless someone evicted them out of there that's probably exactly what happened and the house was just built right there but they're spirits it's not like you can put a house on top of a spirit and stop them from operating well right and just to be clear this particular situation she had cleansed the house itself but she was on the front yard this was out in the front yard where she is yeah okay then that's why that's that's probably what happened there it was probably something that happened mainly on the ground itself and then the house was built there it could affect the house just because it was on the same property and i that's why i said that's why i said when you move somewhere take communion pour on the property literally the ground pour it on the ground i don't care if it's an apartment go outside the apartment building pour it on the ground make the declaration i cleanse this entire property for the kingdom for the operation of jesus christ and whatever is there has to leave but because the devil will do what he can get away with that's how he operates remember he's he acts like a lion remember looking for those who we can walk so he'll pose sometimes he'll post demons to stay in a certain area maybe he doesn't like something that's going on maybe he doesn't like what God's doing there sometimes he'll call him and post him there i go up and down my street i i cast him off everybody's property really i run him out of my neighborhood okay wow they're not in my neighborhood we we rule we choose to rule or we sit and say nothing if jesus christ gave us power over them most people are doing nothing and to be honest we that's why so many people are going through things there's going to be a lot of people when we stop is going to run outside and evict everything off their property they communicate pour it on the property as far back as i can remember even when i was a little girl i remember intercessors doing that at places well now he had mentioned in a previous episode pokemon pokemon which was evil amanda grace mentioned um uh harry potter and um jennifer evans mentioned what we used to call acid rock it's heavy metal rock records and i would not play anything that belonged to any of those bands a lot of them had um contracts with satan seriously a lot of satanic mans and they even call themselves that the frequency they released has hell in it and i grew up in the 60s okay i was well aware of all that stuff and a lot of young people were just pulled into things because that has um uh satan himself remember he had the ability to influence people he had to when he did worship he would he would impact people to come and worship God when he turned and became filled with iniquity he reversed it he will so pull people into things and one of the main things satan loves because he creates himself is music he will take territories with music he will control people with music if you have any of those records from any of those satanic bands back from the 60s and 70s and even now get rid of them don't keep shirts with their images on it don't keep the t-shirts with the images on it okay yes image is everything or God would not have said let us make man in our image and after our likeness is how they operate so you can understand satan has his own images he also can influence and he uses things to influence people and unfortunately most of the time it's young people but people who grew up in the 60s and 70s you probably got a lot of stuff to get rid of in your home don't don't keep posters anything to do with drugs don't keep it there were songs written about drugs okay um i'm trying to remember what the name of that one song was uh people said um my way to heaven that one no not that one it was another one about a steam steamboat or whatever rolling rolling that song oh that way yeah that whole song is about not being on a riverboat going down the river that is about rolling drugs and i never took them but i knew what all those meant so yeah what you the music you play can impact the whole atmosphere of your home it can impact you yourself and i know people who are christians that loved listening to people's music that i knew were bad and i warned them about it and they did nothing about it so now they're like playing in darkness you can't partner this is what God said God says don't tolerate darkness don't participate with it you may say it's only the sound i like sounding you don't want that sound back in the late 80s i began to hear about this concept and i don't remember how my eyes focused on it but my my uncle my great uncle my my father's uncles had been missionary in a foreign country and as a gift as a gift they gave everybody these ivory statuettes and there was two of them and they were very beautiful and they're very ornate and very detailed and i started looking at that and i and i started saying these are like Gods these are little Gods these are images these are idols made and i've got someone's Gods i took a hammer out and started and smashed that thing to bits and then put it out in the trash you know people collect things from the mission fields because they look good even even today even today and i'm not just pointing at africa either it could be stuff in new orleans could be stuff in any other places okay number one i will just say this about new orleans never participate with mardi gras if you have loose all that from your soul um it is it represents something with hell you don't want to participate and people do these things don't ever have an ouija board you're actually connecting with hell i'm not saying you should be afraid of every single image out there or every single song out there i'm not saying all secular music is even bad i'm saying specific styles now they actually have christian what i would call rock bands in heaven that honor God that worship God and i know some on the earth that did that too but still it's it's who is in that band what are they doing with their personal life what does it look like what are they talking about if you have questions about that but the things about the idols don't ever have a buddha in your home i'm sorry you're asking and i christ spirit come on in my home i'm welcoming you you can't have that whole that is it the God for many that's got all the different arms don't have that in your home okay you can't bring idols when God talked about so much against idols it was those idols that represented the false Gods but satan takes the place in that false God when people do things for the false God they're actually doing them for him there's one God that's one God one person who we worship the one true God the father and holy spirit that's it every other false religion is tied to satan even the new age movement doesn't there's no new age God there's none of that stuff taking place people and that's why i used to teach i actually have some old cds that even i need to bring them back out and put them out there for people to hear because for six years God had me talk about nothing but that warning people get things out of their home not wearing things be careful where they go and most of those actually were made i'm trying to remember where i made them i think most of those i made a lot like up in tennessee mississippi and other louisiana where a lot of that stuff was going on and yeah i have them i'm going to bring them up they're coming out of them that'd be good could you do this this week could we do could you do this as we close could you lead us into prayer to lose from our soul yeah anything that comes to mind because yeah you know we're going to talk about our property and clothes too but lose from her soul yeah because people i mean there are so many people i could not believe and the father himself calls it harry potter witchcraft that's from the father he does not like it he said it's invaded society christians will be some of the first ones in line to see the new movies you can't partner that's participating if you never even read a book i'll tell you i never read any of the books because he wouldn't allow me to but people would tell me things in them i know one of the first books they wrote on for harry potter it literally talked about kids sitting on the toilet and demons coming up and stealing their soul and this is what parents were letting their kids have a part of and they get so excited when a new book comes out or a new movie comes out or even the harry potter world that is in universal which i speak against anytime i go to orlando i'm talking about that talking against that thing so what why is stephen why steve say that because in your soul or layers and you collect stuff and if you get too much darkness in there i guess you're going to start acting like it right if you watch too much profanity which is satan's language that's house language okay profanity is hell's language i've been there and so uh you need to get all this stuff out and you can do it by loosing jesus said cast all your cares on me i care for you but he also was the one who said i give you the keys to the kingdom what you bind on earth will be bound in heaven what you lose on earth will be loose in heaven and i know as an intercessor most of the time all we did was bind the devil but God gave me revelation for four hours earth's time on what those keys do they can set you free they can keep you free he said they need to lose the hell that has gotten into them loose all the hell out and when you loose it out in jesus name he comes and pulls it out that's movies actions books words it doesn't matter what it is he will literally pull it out of you and it won't be there for you to think about or or if it's in there you want more that's how addiction happens that's how crime happens so once you lose it then you bind the things of God you say i choose to bind to my soul the life of God the love of God the plans of God his celebration his joy and then nobody can take it from you that's how your soul prospers but if you've got all that stuff we were just talking about in your soul even if it happened when you were little it's still in there you need to get it out so we're going to do that so everybody can say these words uh father brother i choose as an act of my will which is an act of my will to lose from my soul to lose from my soul all witchcraft all witchcraft all satanism o satanism all hate or hate all satanic symbols or music oh satanic symbols or music i will not keep it in my soul i will not keep it in my soul show me which things in my home i need to get rid of show me which things in my home i need to get rid of i will not tolerate hell in my life i will not tolerate hell in my life if i operated in witchcraft if i operated in witchcraft someone in my family operated in witchcraft whether my family operated in witchcraft or i read harry potter or i read harry potter or had satanic images like a ouija board or he had say 10 satanic images like a ouija board i lose all of that from my soul at least all of that from my soul i will not be controlled it will not be controlled by the darkness by the darkness in any way in any way okay now we're going to wait just a minute most things going on people don't understand like severe headaches if you get pain in your head that could be somebody speaking against you or which is speaking against you if you do things for God i know a lot of leaders have that you literally when that happens because it's not something i do myself i have to say i sever all witchcraft coming against me and i mean you make that action i sever it because they are trying to control you in different ways and because you're clueless and satan will do it you can get away with you do that it will be gone it goes instantly that's something else that you can do in your life and if your children if you know your children were invited to places and they watch that lay your hand on their head and say i choose as an act of my will to lose from my child any and all witchcraft that was watched or spoken or discussed and then it will it will be taken from your children and the reason why i'm saying this is in these days one of the lying lying signs and wonders will be that witches heal and they will demonstrate it in parks i don't know that would be this generation they'll demonstrate it in parks and in the next park is someone praying in jesus name for people to be healed they'll be healed and people will go well wow this isn't so bad all satan has to do is take his hands off those people and then that appears that they're healed he took his hands off and that was for the one reason to make people believe if you look at the movies out there that show you there are good witches it is a lie from hell even in the bible it says have nothing to do with witchcraft a necromancer look it up in the dictionary that means witchcraft so now we're going to bind the things of God to our soul so you say as an act to my will it's an active i will i choose i choose to bind to my soul to bind to my soul the love of God the love of God the joy of the lord the joy of the lord i bind his words i find his words and his images in his images and his plans for my life his plans for my life i bind that to my soul refine that to my soul i bind to my soul abide in my soul his celebration his celebration his expectation his expectation and his validation of my life and his validation of my life i choose to be happy i choose to be happy jesus name in jesus name amen amen wow Kat you know what i wasn't even going to go there today but God had something else yes we certainly did have something in mind and by the way that all includes fake news people make sure you say i lose from my soul all the fake news i've listened to because even that's operated that's operated by the enemy also wow bless you bless you bless you in jesus name have a great day celebrate if you have loved ones in heaven uh they're celebrating life not death so so good we have revealingheaven.com on the bottom and then there's thekatKerr.com for a website yeah theKatKerr for facebook yeah so make sure you only go to the chat and as Kat always says she does not ask for money online uh so don't anyone that's doing that is not her so that's

said that's accountability on their part right hey cat what is that symbol on your the blue it almost looks like a diamond what is that this one right here is a shield it's a shield representing one from heaven this is the host initiative it's about heaven's army working with us in this time and actually god asked me to design a logo and chris who's our media art tech person helped to create this and what it is is it says h i the host initiative the eye is a lightning bolt and on top of the eye itself is an eye of one of the hosts of heaven and behind it is sort of an open portal that's what the blue behind it is so this represents a new time on the earth very cool very very cool well um before we let's you have an announcement you wanted to make about uh this weekend and where are you going to be tell us about that yeah well everybody most people know especially those who had signed up for um the freedom event the freedom uh conference i don't like the conference uh freedom event of what that was supposed to be in murfreesboro tennessee at global fire ministries that was cancelled because they didn't they really did have death threats those death threats have been lifted now because uh obviously hank uh changed his um changed his course so he's not going and jeff will not be there at all and by the way jeff is on the sabbatical i'm just gonna say that much right now and he probably needs it desperately and so does his team because of a lot of stuff they've been going through however i was invited by jan janssen yeah jan because god still wanted a message to go out through there so i will be a special guest speaker this sunday the 25th in murfreesboro tennessee at global fire ministries it's going to be great it's going to be on the times of god which is something god just gave me so you don't want to miss it i'm sure that it will be online if not uh i'm sure we at least will have our our facebook going with that um but just wanted you know global foreign ministers is going to go uh full steam ahead but jeff is going to be taking a sabbatical and he probably should have taken that six months ago if you all didn't know what i'll just say this too when the prophets begin to jump off the wagon the wagon you know that trump's going to be restored um a lot of them started bashing him which we all know is wrong a prophet supposed to speak the words of god they're accountable to god himself um but no one should bash a prophet you know what it says in the bible about not touching his anointed so just let me give you a heads up that's wrong don't bash the prophets hello they're the ones who hear from god and if they're saying something that doesn't line up keep it in your heart and pray for them but uh but i'm not bashing any of them okay they made a decision that's between them and god we're going to see how all this works out in the end but if anybody needs a break it would definitely be jeff and jan and their family and their team so i'm going like uh just as uh so that you'll still hear a word of god that would be powerful from murfreesboro tennessee from global fire ministries so that's my first announcement i want to make again that's this sunday and there'll just be one service 10 a.m sunday and i'm excited about getting to go and so that's my that's it for that but let me tell you what yeah go ahead and talk you ready to hear about the government yeah go go for it yes okay well you should probably watch hannity the hannity show that president trump was actually speaking on the other day he gave a few heads up about him not being invisible anymore he's also working full steam ahead to get the house flipped which we need that to happen if you want to pray about something pray that the house of representatives gets flipped uh back to republican control because we need that okay we need it the senate's almost a shooting but keep praying for that to happen to you and those of you who don't know there are the elections which every four years but there's mid-term elections which are very important that would be 2022 when a lot of this will be voted on replacing the voting for the house of representatives and for the senate there may be a few governorships in there somewhere i'm not certain about that but i do know i do hear down the pipeline but some of the governors are going to be more and more outspoken the republican ones because they have life in their states and you should know that if you're in one of those i'm in one of those in florida it's fully open the state's been fully opened by governor desantis please make sure you're praying for him to have more strength and and no sound wisdom from god he is a strong believer and he wants life for the people here and there's several other states doing the same thing so you all you hear from the uh this so they're still up to their own business they haven't changed their ammo at all i think one day they will really totally regret that because because when the news is controlled thank god there's other sources newsmax and there's a few other sources out there i know a kenneth copeland show a flashpoint and there's several other you don't know about so you know make sure they're telling the truth when you hear them because they will encourage you and empower you to know what really is going on i think trump's going to start doing that himself and make sure you you have checked out is it a 45 office.com is that what trump's new website is i think yeah 45 office.com right right 45 office.com sign up for it you'll get stuff from the president himself that would be president trump and so i just want to encourage you things many things are going on but he's going to be more and more visible which terrifies the left and terrifies hell they don't want his voice to be heard there's a frequency in it and so he's starting to speak about who to vote for in these upcoming um midterm elections which are very important so please focus on that for your prayers and of course for trump himself and his family you're not seeing the end of them trust me god's still saying the same exact thing if you ask me i'm going to keep saying the same words he said he's going to have his way in this time he's going to not just expose the corruption but he's going to deal harshly with it very harshly with it and that's to prepare the way for what is coming in this next time of god which is not the perilous times i know i get tired of saying that but people still think it is and i saw someone that recently asked me that i went absolutely not they're from a time when you won't even be on the earth people most people alive now won't be here when that happens you should rejoice about that so they'll be great it'll get greater and greater and greater and greater in the generations to come that's why this is being done now if you understand how god operated this is what he does he wipes out exposes the evil hello okay did that in heaven exposed it then wiped it out of there right on the earth exposed all the evil with no and then he wiped it out and putting over he belonged he's not going to wipe off the earth this time but he's totally going to deal with the darkness and i know i said eat cake and celebrate yes i'm still eating cake in smaller portions people maybe a cookie would do no i don't know a date and guess what that doesn't matter to me what matters is our god is still here you're praying he's got your prayers they filled the bowls before the altar of his throne and yes i've been having many times since all this started and they're still celebrating so celebrate but keep your prayer focus out there say you may say with your own words even in the atmosphere i refuse to accept any of the lying cheating stealing i'm going to accept any a new fake law made that takes away my constitutional rights i reject it in jesus name your words do something in the atmosphere to shift things so don't think you're powerless you're not powerless as long as you've got a voice and you've got jesus amen very very good by the way this morning it is still dark and i get knocked on the side and i felt like it was an angelic thing waking me up and so i thought okay i'm going to go back to sleeping i thought wait a minute i had reminded myself when i get knocked i'm supposed to look at the clock so i looked at the clock the digital this is 4 45 the president is 4 45 this is april i don't know what it means i'm just telling you i got knocked by an angel look at the clock it's 4 45 so i don't know if the four stands for four or april probably april maybe but four also means you know the number four means god's path that's what it means god's path uh or god's plans that's what the number four means number three means god's approval so he basically said my path is still 45 we know who 45 is yeah absolutely um i'm going to jump by the way i was going to mention that you said it's april 21 of 21 they've got a three for because this is your episode 21 with us on april 21 of 21. now how's that for god in numbers that's awesome okay but i'm going to jump ahead to a question because you just said something and i thought i'm going to tie that to a question that's way down to my list you said trump's coming in and they don't like it they don't like he's got a different vibration and i'm going to ask you the question then you can jump back to talk about i'm going to ask you what did you mean by that trump vibration and this world inner person said there are times when i've come into a thick presence of the lord and it feels like my back entire body are vibrating has this happened even if so why are we vibrating so talk about vibrating and vibrations if they're two different things or whatever that's a new question for you no i can tell you that happens to me off and on when the presence of the lord is so strong i my body will begin to it's like a it's like a super fast shaking uh i mean we'll shake right and then we shake your whole inside shakes that's that's the frequency of god coming into the earth but trump's vibration is increasing you're the first one who i ever said that you by the way that what he's given now is a shaking it's a shaking coming from trump himself since the enemies trying to shake us into fear the words when trump speaks him has that vibration that frequency of of of the spirit of god in them because god is shaking himself he's shaking the earth itself he's starting to shake hell itself is shaking right now they're terrified because you know satan's usually the one who does the shaking thing but god had done a long time ago so he is shaking how the spirits of darkness are beginning to shake i see them all the time like shaking trying to run away and so i can tell you we're getting closer and closer to that time when god himself is going to do something of course it's going to involve trump in it but even the frequency and his voice now has a vibration in it some people begin to feel that when they hear him speak because you know why he is our president and i need to remind you when i'm talking about this the bible says when the wicked are in power you know the people is it's going to be a terrible time people in accuracy all kinds of things happen but when that when the righteous are in power the people rejoice well why aren't you rejoicing because the left has no power i don't mind saying that the left has no power not real power they're taking or trying to steal the power but in the spirit realm they have no power to speak or bring greater evil and they can want to they want to say they want it but but because trump is our president he is in power literally won the election so he's in power for that reason but god put him there and so he is god recognizes him as being in power in our country right now even though he's not that said that officially well he actually has said officially he was the president it's going to shift and when there's a shift there's a shaking first let me tell you but the shaking that's happening in spirit right now isn't hell shaking it's god shaking well that was one of my questions somewhere here you just mentioned it several prophets have been now saying we're in for a bit of a dark time before it gets lighter there'll be words like that or there's going to be riot some riots in the cities um and maybe some people even need to make sure you have preparation for a short period and before it gets good is someone showing you any of that and if so or if not no i'm not about that she's not he's not shown that okay from the very beginning when people said we'd have civil war then they changed some other kind of war we'd have neighborhood wars and god said the people are not going to rise up and have a civil war the war is going to be amongst the left themselves they're going to start fighting themselves and god says it also but i can tell you we are not appointed under wrath and because this is not the day of his wrath that's god's wrath it's not the day of god's wrath that means anyone who rises up trying to do something they're going to get the wrath of god is what's going to happen and i would say anything like that would be uh i don't i don't know if god has never said to me that they need to be prepared for months and months and months of total darkness no food no i think and i think most people think think in the terms of a week or two or something like that that there'd be some intense times you're not getting anything like that i'll tell you where they won't come from they won't come from the republican [Laughter] any of states happens you people need to know if the democrats are in control of the states and there's democratic governors and we all know about newsome and the other one i can't remember his name most of the time the one in the old california that they've tried to get rid of like eight times and he keeps getting around it i can't speak for those states because there has been some violence in those states that has nothing to do with our our own president that has nothing to do with america itself that's not america going into war thus those governors permitting and probably paying for those different groups to come in and do demonstrations of violence and set things on fire why to bring fear to the people that's what that's all about but as far as our whole country that's not going to happen the governors who are in power right now and the republican governors aren't going to tolerate it happening they will stop that from happening they've already had meetings about that and information has already been sent out this kind of covert information i can assure you the only ones who will keep doing it are the ones who are doing it good good good good okay uh we've got various things okay here's a person wanting to know uh when jesus was in heaven he or she stayed he or she saying jesus was in heaven until he was in mary's womb so suddenly he's in mary's womb do you have any knowledge about was he the question is that was he able to communicate with god while he's in the womb during those nine months i guess is the question i know uh quite a bit about how all that happened but um the one thing i want to say now before we get off the track is right side broadcasting is another place you can go to online is that right now let me see uh oh i can't forget to say this this last sunday they had a huge event in florida called storm the bay trumperilla mega first boat parade in tampa florida hundreds of thousands of people flooded the state to celebrate trump and right side broadcasting if you go on and look for it you'll be able to see it and right side broadcasting is the one who's always showing him now when he has any kind of um rallies and stuff like that right side broadcasting we'll be putting that on so don't forget to go there and check it out you'll be blessed beyond measure to see i'm sure trump was and mike lindell yay michael he literally paid for that whole thing to happen and so i want to tell you bless mike glendale go buy his pillow my pillow really a true patriot absolutely okay back to the womb thing what jesus going in from so i obviously at one moment he's in heaven then there's the the seed in mary's womb suddenly i have to let you know it was not a suddenly in heaven okay this was planned our father is the greatest planner of all time he makes claims to be clear i think this person knew that but realized that there was a moment in time when it happened when the plan was put into effect so he's there the plan is about to happen the angel sees mary it says the spirit's going to overshadow you and whom it happens right what do you do and that was actually that was gabriel gabriel uh was present however the holy spirit is the one who brought the his name was the word that was jesus's name in heaven he was called the word the father explained to him if you're going to die for them i have to put flesh on you turn you into a seed and holy spirit will plant you in the womb of mary so holy spirit came in the form of a seed and gabriel was there also so when that happened gabriel got to make the announcement that's why that's why gabriel was there to let mary know how all that happened and i don't know maybe in the beginning i'm sure the father was watching over him and everything but there came a time jesus when he was born he had to be raised up till he came to a time of understanding which was young he was young when he knew he was the son of god but in the womb of mary i believe he was like any other baby in there he had to grow his body had to form uh into the into the the flesh body that god had chosen for him and so i'm sure the father probably saying over him and things like that but as far as communication like speaking to him i don't know that happened until jesus got older when the father literally wanted him to know you are my son you must be about my business this is why i sent you yeah that's good that's good now this person wants to know a different person wants to know jesus is on the man of transfiguration and either the father brings it says it but most this and elijah i'm guessing they were in abraham's wisdom then suddenly are whisked uh for lack of better terrible knowledge they're on the mount with jesus uh and this person's wanting to know what did they talk about if you know and did they do some sort of time travel to understand what was going on what what can you tell me about any details about that event are you talking about when the disciples saw him right yeah right they saw moses and elijah and they're all talking this person wasn't what were they talking about and then she actually he or she asked did they try and travel at that moment i think because there has been teaching i think kim clement suggested this others have suggested that there was a time travel element when moses was on mount sinai and god hit him in the cleft of the rock and there was a suggestion they time traveled into the amount of transfiguration hundreds and hundreds of years in the future what you thought i think that probably could have been a whole different incident um i'm sure of course jesus christ by the way appeared when the monk of transfiguration was they saw him in his glorified body that's what they did so so at one moment he's in his body his human body that you would normally see but when he when christ was glorified when he came out of the tomb there was such a glory on him remember even a few people didn't recognize him at that time so in front of them they saw christ in the glorified body he allowed it probably could have been an open vision he probably could have done an open vision thing where they saw you know they saw them with him up there they saw him it was just evidence to them he was the son of god and that that was right what they were they were thinking at the time in their life i do know this that when moses when god put moses in the cleft of the rock god himself put moses inside him the cleft of the rock was inside god and all of time is con is uh shown in there god's been from the beginning to the end the end of the beginning it's all inside him so when he hit he hid moses in there moses saw time begin he saw the garden of eden he saw adam he saw that he would not have known about any of that and so he said as i pass by when time passes by i said when that's what he's saying i will show you the hinder parts that's the exact oh that's what that means wasn't the hunter parts wasn't god talking about his back the hinder parts were the parts of time that had gone before them he showed moses time before that time and that's how moses knew about adam and eve and all that stuff so that was a whole different encounter that moses had with god that was a brand new encounter when when jesus was shown in his glorified body in the amount of transfiguration he could have totally brought moses and you know right there he could have just put him there with them because you know he is god so there's many different facets i guess one day we're just gonna we're going to not right now eventually write a revelation bible or bible of revelation however you want to call it probably and put all these scriptures in there with with the encounters that happen time travel that happened the spirit realm so people are beginning to understand there's things we don't see or understand that are hidden in the word of god yeah wow okay awesome that's i i never heard that explanation the hindu part means in history basically it was what awesome i always wondered where moses got his revelation about the garden of eden that's what you're saying that's where it happened because he wrote those books okay so um three different people you know we went through this last time but i don't think we kept these names you may have to remind me people this will tell people something about god was king who killed his brother is he in heaven if he knows nicodemus who jesus said you have to be born again again is he in heaven and what about a massive fire who lied to the holy spirit and died are they in heaven if you know now i you need to say them over again because i know okay yeah okay so cain who killed his brother nicodemus and ananias and sapphira i have never seen ananias and sapphira anywhere in heaven i've not seen them at all cain is there because cain did eventually repent cain knew that he had sinned but this is the thing he knew god protected him he knew he would have been killed and this is the thing why did god still want him even on the earth well number one he was still he still was producing children that was in the lineage of um of adam for some time so god wanted him to remain or he would not have marked him so people wouldn't kill him god didn't allow him to be killed that mean he had a time for him to take adam when and not adam when cain died that he went to abraham's bosom so yes he did repent unlike judas who never repented judas is in hell completely and nicodemus i'm almost probably pretty certain that he's so was passionate about god himself about him he most likely is in heaven so the only ones i'm pretty sure are not are in ice and sapphira who lied that was that was life blasting the holy spirit really rejecting knowingly knowing the truth and lying to the face of the those who are in authority lied to them that was not a good thing to do on on god said never is a good thing to do but back then it was like they they were not in heaven i'm not seeing them in him i've seen adam and eve in heaven for sure yeah that that reminds me pull it up um i may have to come back to it someone wrote me a question this morning i'm not sure which one of my notes but they said if somebody's saved and then towards the end of their life they got into idol worship um and then they they didn't give the conclusion they said at the end of the life they started worshiping idols it must be a personal thing are they lost forever is there some chance that that person that accepted christ will still make it but they've lost rewards what what could you say about that i would have more details of the question i would say i'm not god right well none of us are god and that only god knows the heart of a person and uh so there's no explanation about how did they get pulled into that how deep was that was that our artificial thing was that that was like was that could it be in any kind of idol was that like money or gold or was that like in um like idol worship as far as um um you know yeah so i would say if they're a believer and we're pulled off the track for that but never denied jesus christ i would say there's definitely still a really good chance that they're in heaven because at that time of their death christ would probably meet with them if they had a christian family or close close christian friends praying for them that absolutely gave but i can't say there's so many different ways that it could be idol worship okay if it was just like idolized if it's idolizing things like material things that doesn't send you to hell just means you're going to be a weak christian so there's a lot of um leeway and all of that but i would say god this is what he says if i got you if you became born again i have a hook in you okay he puts a hook in you that christ will pursue that even up until the time that you die he's going to pursue that because there's those words you spoke yourself receiving him it says he's married to the backslider so i can just keep giving you scripture all day long he desires that none should perish and if you already gave that declaration that is a powerful powerful thing when you receive christ he doesn't just wipe you off the books because you fall once or twice you get caught into something that's different than giving your whole life and signing a satanic agreement with satan wow yeah by the way back on the anonymous sapphire thing let me let me drill down just a bit on that i've got this question swirly in my brain uh we see it as a momentary event where where almost as if a few minutes before he they decided to talk they did they they decided to lie do you see ananias and sapphira as half having a really character and honesty flaw that was working in them for quite a while for them to be able to do this in other words they didn't make a momentary decision and spending eternity in hell for that or were they really pretenders all along do you have any other insights on i think that is long-standing sin i would have to say that was probably something that they had been um involved in for some time that i think they already had um made their decision before they were asked that even though and they do this definitely and they said the same thing they both had a chance to say separately uh here wrong we've done this neither one of them did it we showed you that right there there was coercion they did it they made an agreement this is what we're going to say infrastructure we're not backing off with this this is what we're saying even though it's a lie and i have to say that's exactly what happened because otherwise one of them could have been moved if they weren't together they had an opportunity to say no we lied about it we lied we should have told the truth they could have at either time having done this separately had the freedom to say we're lying and we're cheating god and they didn't do it they cheated they lied so that was already working in their home an agreement it makes sense that it was yeah because you'd have to get to a point in your life where you're willing to take that chance that i must have kept blessing you no matter what you did so you thought you could get away with it this was inspiring yeah it says okay um now people will look at cat with pink hair multiple visions and trips to heaven and they think every single prayer gets answered for you right away so here's the question does cat have all or most of her prayers answered instantly does she have any prayers that are still in process of being answered what is the longest prayer she has ever prayed and still waiting for the answer i have to say the longest one that i stood and i would have to say i didn't keep saying it i don't i don't once i ask god something if i even ask him it's almost never that i ask him for something not for me it's usually for others that i stand in the gap for and i would have to say i knew that i knew my family was called to do something and i was probably 14 years old um maybe younger than that and my own dad my my physical dad had conversations with me about our family and what would be called into and there'd be signs that would begin to happen and we would see those signs and so we my dad and i prayed together about this we actually stood in the mountains somewhere and like this it was very powerful declaration and prayer and agreement i never dropped it even when my dad went to heaven that didn't change anything that we were standing for i was standing for his intergenerational thing and that was probably close to 40 some years and it and it happened it began to happen the same signs he said what happened would happen and i rejoice in sin so that declaration and decree and agreement that agreement has already happened so i don't usually ask god just brings stuff to me all the time and it's like literally i hear him every day and yes that's because i have a commission that doesn't mean you can't hear him every day if you pursue him for that but he actually came from heaven and said i'm giving you a commission to be taken to heaven when i feel like it that's god to show you things to reveal on the earth i'm going to show you things to come i'm going to take you to the past and show you things how they happen and giving you revelation on the word of god and it was for one reason that they would know him and know that heaven was real so i don't have a lot of things i personally even asked for myself because i'm living in what his plan is and this is a thing i haven't backed up i'm not going to back up i won't change what he's saying to me i'm allowed to say what he says and i'm allowed to tell you what he showed me so i don't have the mix of man in me i don't have man's plans man's thoughts man's assumptions and i don't listen to most anything out there i listen to him and and that's good to have a time to give to him and even though people say stuff if it comes against what he said to you i would not receive it if it's against what god himself said to you and that's where a lot of people think well all these other people are believing this maybe i should believe that no you believe what god said to you so most of my prayers like i've stood for over 40 some years for that to happen never failing to thank him for it which is the key he told me god confirmed it that this was going to happen and i've only thanked him all those years for the promise he gave to us what that's going to do so let me ask you this is me adding to the question so there must be four or five people you could you could think of who you have asked god for their salvation would that be true people that you stood for they've asked for their salvation but you see nothing happen i don't know about that because i see the spirit of god look around the person drawing them and pulling them i have to say it wasn't very long if it was somebody i personally knew that i stood for it wasn't very long before they came to christ and most of these people probably belonged to him and were beginning to wander and i would send the host of podenon strongholds of satan trying to influence that people was the worst thing i did to stop the enemy from continuing to speak to them there's so many things we have the right as a believer to do so those things were pulled down that left them open to hear the spirit of god the body of christ needs to know you need to know who you are and just using the word what it says about your word you speak but then you can't use the same words to you can't bless and curse okay i bless i choose not to curse you bless them don't curse them because then you're powerful the more your words are pure when you speak the more things the quickly the more quicker things happen so i can't equate myself and he won't let me line myself up with how he does with other people because i live a different kind of life myself but i always tell people never give up that is the thing don't step back don't get caught in fear don't get caught in deception because there's a lot of deception going on right now make sure you're staying true to what god said read his word meditate and you know what that means ask him a question if you see something just outwardly say i would like to know what that means and i can tell you whatever i said that to him he would always give me revelation it might be a maybe a couple days later or i would actually hear someone say the very thing i had asked god not knowing and they would say this is what i believe it is i would say to me that's the answer so it's it's keeping your own ears open by not playing darkness is the biggest thing you cannot play with darkness you can't play in the camp of the enemy and expect to hear clearly in your life and the other thing is if you have fear which the enemy uses again you kick fear all i don't care if you have to do it all day kick fear out of your soul get out of your house because that what happens is it begins to stop you from hearing clearly but i can't line myself up he won't let me say well you're doing this but they're not or they're not able to do this because you can do it uh whatever he gives me to do the number two thing i would say is keep your hearing open is to obey obey what god is saying i have to live i live in life you just absolutely now you just intrigued me by because uh again i've known you for seven years i know you as the probably the most obedient person i know and you've been caught up to heaven thousands of times and he walks through your wall a day or two and then give it to you through someone else's voice who's just talking that's what you just said is that is that right it is right because it's usually somebody that i know and i think god is showing me uh anyone can hear if you ask it sincerely and you ask him in believing that he's going to reveal this is about the word of god mostly that i'll say why did this happen i wonder why that happened i'm not even necessarily saying that him i'm just saying it and then maybe a couple days later gem will say well i believe this and this was it this i think this is how this happened her not knowing that i even said that out loud and so but many times he'll use the people close to you if there's strong christians he'll because maybe he's saying that to them at the same time but but mostly he just speaks to me and most of the stuff that i get is what he says to me just like he was speaking to me this morning when i woke up he was speaking to me last night when i went to bed and he was speaking to me for several hours yesterday it's a lifestyle interesting okay this questions i've heard this before so i i think i know your answer but on on the on this earth created actual wine jesus drank actual wine in heaven is their wine and if so what is it like sorry i'm going to interrupt really quick steve you're cutting out everything you're going to keep freezing here a little bit yeah let's see jeff are you coming in yeah so steve i'm going to keep it so yeah i'm going to kick you out really quickly yeah you're breaking up and freezing right but okay i'll come back here okay here we go cat go ahead and just answer that question is there wine in heaven oh there's wine in heaven but there's no alcohol people because nothing can decay you know they use that whole process i believe i don't i don't drink myself but the wine christ drank was heaven's wine at the wedding when he made the water into wine that wasn't earth's wine that was heaven's wine when he spoke it was the first miracle he did was at a wedding and mary knew he could do it because guess what he did it in their home he made their water into wine heaven's wine all the time and in the bible when the people got the wine in the web and he said normally they give the best one the beginning of the wedding that's what the guy who was having the one thing sad to jesus and he said but you have given the best at the end and usually they gave the worst wine they had but this one is the best we've ever had the reason for that is what jesus made was heaven's wine and it was being drunk on earth for the first time so jesus every time he took a cup didn't matter where he was he would just release into it and it would turn it into heaven's wine but there's wine in heaven yes it's filled with the holy spirit okay now jeff my eye because since that was me i can't tell i see on my screen so oh uh can you hear me all right cat oh i can hear you fine yeah there's a little delay on your end steve did everybody hear the answer to the question i think everybody heard and here comes joe i don't see anybody's video but okay what's going on um steve i think it's it's on your end there's a little bit of a so this is what we're gonna do i got a couple of questions picked out as well so steve if you want is there a way you can reset your router i just did before the show okay i i did a whole cold woo yeah so what if i try to get on my hot spot yeah go ahead and try that yeah yes okay let me try and get in my iphone okay okay so i'm gonna kick him out cat i'm gonna ask a question okay i am a huge superman fan like massive okay and yes i know people everybody's saying i look like clark can i don't do it on purpose i just do and i have to wear glasses i'm sorry i'm not apologizing for it i don't apologize okay so my question is i've heard you say this before touch on this i'm going to ask can you fly in heaven yes you can fly you can fly in heaven number one why wouldn't you which is what the holy spirit says to me all the time why wouldn't you fly i mean it's the place of creation it's the life and the power of god is everywhere if plants can sing if you can travel on light in heaven if you can speak and create food and it's on a tray in front of you why wouldn't you be able to fly and there is a park there's an amusement park i was taken to that have evidence that i was taken to that in my book one it really exists they have a place called flyby that's one of the amusement things in heaven in their park and you get taught to fly there and your friends who are in heaven will come to watch you learn to fly because it is hilarious you're not really good in the beginning you're like spinning through the air i mean you actually have places for them to sit and watch you learn but the the point is this christopher reeves who made it to heaven it's what he gets to do in heaven and i hope i just bashed a bunch of liberal uh not liberal but judgmental people keep it to yourself you'll find out when you go though you'll be standing in line with everyone else waiting to learn that sounds amazing what about super strength can you like lift super heavy things well you know nothing really weighs much in heaven it's made out of light but it is substantial like the walls of your mansion and heaven don't try to run through them a portal would open you would run through the portal and the wall of your mansion but it's a real place in your spiritual body in the spiritual world you feel the ground you're walking on you feel the food that you're eating it and so i would imagine since this is one of the best things i've talked about very little they actually have the angel games not kidding at all they actually have what we call the olympics they call the angel games in heaven and the army of heaven put them on on a regular basis when they come back from a lot of warring they get to do the angel games and show how good they are the different supernatural things they do so you'll probably be there watching that yeah oh yeah steve steve hello a little bit people get to witness any you know children leaving did you say aliens did you hear what you said i did not i didn't hear what he said steve okay i'm going to try one placement i'm going to try [Music] he sounds like a computer yeah you sound like your part computer steve now i think he may have said have i been present when people went went to heaven from earth he may have said that i'm not sure can you hear me steve yeah he's like completely frozen why don't you just answer that have you seen that i can and just recently did actually that happens several ways if i am present and somebody passes uh i've been present several times sometimes family members sometimes friends one of the most recent ones is my husband's best friend who he spent time with a lot right before he passed and we were actually in um uh we were in icu in his room and the guy who was there to watch over him until he passed was undone that we came in to see him i came right from an event from the airport to see him because the holy spirit said he's not going to be there long so we go in his room and i began to call our daughters who he's he loved our daughters very much as my husband best friend and they got to say goodbye to him i held the phone up to his ear and they each got to say goodbye and after the second one did that i told this um the intern who was in his room i said he's going to go really quick and he said oh he's going to last all night i said no he's not his own angels are pacing back and forth and i said that means the other angels are going to come because they all go together when they leave and i said they'll rush in the room and take them with this guy's eyes just kept getting bigger and bigger whenever i would talk about you know that type of thing and i said my last daughter we got a hold of her and she got to say goodbye to him on the phone and when we when we hung up our cell phone these eight angels raced in the room and i told the guy the angels have raced in the room here right now he was watching his screen you know his screen that says his heartbeat is still going and they took him and his angel they all went out to the ceiling took his spiritual body and left and all of a sudden that goes and that guy goes i can't believe this he was so shocked when he said he checked he said he is gone i went yeah i told you they came to take him so that's what usually happens so it was quite got it quite like the guy the guy really got undone that that god actually does that so absolutely powerful steve hi hi if you can hear me i'll try and do that one question again and if i go out again i'll just have you wrap things up jeff if i go out again but uh the question that i had that this person had is with the with uh all the children that the lord sends to the earth the father says are in him literally he sends them to the earth throughout our calendar day if you will this person wants to know anyone in heaven see this activity of him sending children do they see children go going anything like that well they may see them leaving him but the way that actually happens is still his holy spirit who's involved in the holy spirit takes a little spirit of life some can be very tiny and if you can see my fingers or not they can be this small they're different sizes we're different sizes here it's their spiritual body and what happens is at the time of conception the father releases into his hand that little spirit of life the holy spirit takes that goes down to the earth into the womb of the mother into her and at the very time of conception the holy spirit knits and attaches that little spirit of life to that dot of flesh that's exactly there's a flash of light when that happens because your little spirit means made out of light so when he attaches it literally to that inside the mother there's a flash of light and that little spirit of life at that time begins to grow in the womb of its mother and i tell people i said that for years and all of a sudden in science they actually discovered themselves that at the time of conception and they can't explain it they actually announced we know now that life begins at conception because at the time of conception when it literally takes place there's a flash of light and we don't know what that is it's that little spirit of life of that person that baby being attached at that very moment on the earth so i think people in heaven already know that's going to happen if they're believing and they're watching their family members praying god i i would we would like to have a child my husband ivan that happened a lot and so they may go before the zone and say father are you going to send them a baby are you going to send them one and sometimes he'll answer them he may say it may be a year or earth year go by or whatever but yes that is my desire to send one to them to raise up to become somebody for him so yeah they kind of know people in heaven already know that this is going to happen on the earth but as far as being present i don't think that happens unless they see when the little one steps out in his hand because i remember myself being in the hand of god and him speaking to me and every now and then somebody will tell me years ago i had these dreams of me sitting in the hand of god as a little tiny being is that true does that happen and i'm always surprised and go yes that's exactly what happens when god would speak to you about your future and he'd hold you there in his hand or he'd sing he'd sing a song to you he has his own songs he sings to us so it is a big event in heaven when he sends them from himself to the earth oh i can't hear you you can hear me now probably you know yeah i didn't switch it on um steve dropped out but i'm going to ask a couple more questions just because i have them here and i think they're really really good okay so uh one person asked if you could explain the scripture from matthew chapter 7 verses 22 and 23 and it says many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in your name cast out demons in your name done many wonders in your name and then i will declare to them i never knew you depart from me you who practice lawlessness so the person's question is how can people walk in these miracles if they don't know jesus because number one it's a gift uh just like anybody who's high up in the fifo ministry they they may enter into i'm not pointing fingers at anybody i know i'm just saying let's say somebody's high up in the ministry five-fold they enter into a secret life of sin and they keep that sin and they think they're allowed to do it because their gift is so great well that's not even that's not god's not going to say that but when he gives us a gift if he gives you a gift let's say of healing a gift of prosperity a gift of truth and hope a gift of evangelism and he puts that gift in you he won't stop that gift from operating he will not stop that gift he says that the irrevocable he won't take it away from you so that gift will keep right on operating and they may even be doing worse than just sinning they could be doing really horrific things and not telling anybody guess what god knows it all and that's why some will get up there and he'll say depart from me i never knew you because they didn't really make a heart to heart conversion number one they took use and abuse of the gift the gift of influence the gift of other things the gift won't stop working and that's why i tell people don't follow somebody because they have great gifts it doesn't say you'll know the people by their gifts it says you will know them by their fruit yeah so if there's people out there and they're they're sleeping with everybody anywhere they feel like it because they they think that they have the right to they're so powerful in their gift and they'll even tell people if they're caught they say well mike i'm so far above everybody my gift wouldn't work my gift would stop working if god thought i was wrong that's not true either because even lucifer had a gift he had a gift to influence he had a gift to uh to be involved in worship and we all know how some satanic worship is or even that how that still influenced in the darkness he didn't take that gift away so people can operate in their gift and they'd be very accurate but if they're lying cheating stealing committing of gross crimes that god speaks about in the bible they're in trouble with god and i would not follow somebody if i knew that if i knew they were picking people up literally and they do sometimes to sleep with during their meetings and it does happen you dump that person you don't listen to that person now make sure this is a true uh and accurate don't don't don't pick up people and say well i think they're bad it's going to be found out anyway so i would say make sure you look at the fruit of the people are they operating in in holiness are there they have their lives that they're accountable are they loving their family are they living according to the word of god they can't step outside god's guidelines where this is sin sin is sin when you sin you're unrighteous okay but that gift that's why the world has gifts that are powerful they don't know god they have a gift to influence have a gift in music they have a gift and all kinds of things but if what they're doing with that gift is evil that doesn't make them okay to listen to or watch yeah and i think also this is something i'm sure you've seen heard this a lot too this scripture specifically i've seen the enemy kind of try to twist it where people almost become afraid they're like what if i serve god my whole life you know i follow the scriptures i serve him faithfully and all of a sudden he just says depart from me i never knew you and it's something that you know when i was in missions i did a lot of like mission schools raising up youth yeah that was something i was very adamant i was like that is a lie a lie from the pit of hell it is yeah it is a lie because if you're doing if you're doing the work of god the enemy will try to the enemy try to bash you and lie to you the whole time if you know that you love jesus christ you know you're doing what he has called us to do to bring the truth to give the message of the kingdom to influence people to know christ and you're helping them feeding them and you're in the trenches doing stuff for god you know what you're going to know you're going to get greatly rewarded in heaven you will have rewards that scripture has nothing to do with those who know that they're for christ and with christ that scripture is about those who are living their life any way they want to and they think because they have a gift and god isn't saying anything he doesn't care and there's been great people at that there's been people that's happened to you and probably only the mercy of god maybe somebody at the last moment before they died got them to give their christ their life back to christ and repent for that stuff but he's not talking that scripture is not about people who know that they belong to christ if you receive jesus christ as your savior and you know in your heart that's true and you're following the course he put you on then you you are going to have a great time in heaven he will not take your name or the lame's book of life okay that doesn't happen even that doesn't happen that easy he wants you to know that he's proud of you he is blessed by your life you have well pleased him that you're reaching out to others sometimes when you have need yourself the greatest thing to do is reach out to help others now the one thing is not your job to do is you can't go make somebody receive christ you share the truth you let them make that decision then you go on to those who who are reaching out back to you but your words are like seeds in the heart of that person so that would not be you people who think they've committed the um pardonable sin have never committed the impartial sin people who commit the unpardonable sin don't care that they've done it okay they don't care they hate god they hate what he has planned if you're concerned about that you definitely have not done that but if you're out there doing things for god especially like in the mission field that god has so loved people and some of the most highly honored people in heaven are intercessors and those who are in missions amen okay so on that this is a great question the final question that segways from this one and it's um basically it's uh can you share about the crowns will receive in heaven what do they look like and are they different or bigger depending on our rewards they're different they're very different from each other and actually every believer in somewhere in your mountain you might mention you have a crown room you literally have a room that is so beautiful and light just shoots out of i've been several people's uh in their crown rooms in heaven i've seen their crown rooms and there's these beautiful like pillows and things that are very ornamented by the by gemstones from god himself he designs these things and they place those crowns on them certain certain of those crowns you get to wear in heaven when you get there when it says we will throw our crowns at his feet that's something that will happen at one time with all of us there but you can actually wear some of those crowns like the crown of life the soul winners crowns they're all different from each other they're not they're not alike at all that's amazing so cool i can't i can't wait to see them you know it's interesting one just a side comment i was thinking about i'm i've i'm somebody who's been blessed with a very big imagination and there are times you know i i'm i doubt dabble in filmmaking and all kinds of stuff but there are some things that come to my mind that i do not know how to describe in words like i'm like i've never seen this before i don't even know how i would materialize this in the world and part of me is wondering and like there's specific things where i'm like i'm wondering if god is showing me glimpses of certain things like you know almost one-upping me he's like yeah you think that was cool he's like check this out you're going to see this in heaven you know he is definitely right now doing that and in the past when people would get though that they were afr they were not i don't want to say fear fear but they were hesitant to share it with others like paul wouldn't do it in the bible okay paul's like i'm not even going to try to tell people what this is like but in these days of greater creativity and invention some of the things you see may be things that actually begin to happen on the earth this is what i have always told people get a journal please people get a journal just go get you a little journal it doesn't have to be anything fancy and write down what you saw if you can if you can draw it draw it if you know what it does write what it does and then date it and don't get rid of that that might be something god's going to send to the earth and then he may give you more about that thing he's done that with me many times and i do know there's greater inventions light is going to be used in many different ways it's going to be used to color our hair it's going to be used to paint on this i should have done that or i should have presented it the thing that will happen once this whole shift happens and the darkness is like wiped and pushed back and creativity invention will explode god's got things he's waiting to release until this whole thing is dealt with the justice comes why would he end things if he's bringing some of the greatest things ever he's not gonna let the evil have it okay but he will give it to the most unexpected people maybe you're not a professor maybe you're not even good like an electronics or a mechanic or something that won't stop god from giving you something so make sure you get a journal i've got many of them i'll draw it i'll draw it you know and write down if you have an ipad or something you can do that on i'm old school so i've got tons of journals like that i've saved over the years of things i saw in heaven or things i knew would be on the earth this is exciting time if you're young you have one of the best futures of people who've ever been on the earth because of the great things that will be happening and being invented amen yeah and i think so you can said a key thing about light and i think that's been the the the key link between all these things that i'm like i don't know how to describe this is crazy all of them had to something to do with light so that's really cool you said that um kat thank you so much thank you for rolling rolling with it as we experience technical difficulties um so uh obviously revealingheaven.com what are some other ways that people can get a hold of you support your ministry buy your books yeah well this i have two websites i have revealing heaven.com which is about my my company where we produce things about heaven and put them in the ears products and stuff a lot of the messages and stuff we do have flash

just a second here many of you who may be new we have a platform that we've been building for three years we've been actually online just a little bit over a year tens of thousands of people that you know many most are probably believers or conservatives it is open to everybody but it's very conservative friendly so you can say what you want so let's run that commercial so you'll see that go ahead jeff [Music] [Music] there you go it's zapping it's also in the app store uh just an x8pip zap it on on both your devices your iphone and your uh the other one the galaxy i can't think of the name all of a sudden but yeah on those other ones all right uh i think that's good for now i will remind people before we bring cat on that uh tomorrow is ivana tia and then on friday we have the canadian prophet barry wench if i'm saying that right we'll ask him how to pronounce that so looking forward to it um okay i see one question there all right well hey without further ado let's bring cat curry in there she is hey cat hey good to see you good to see you today um um how's everything oh everything's great you look like you're particularly and the lights are because you know we keep moving them around so i'm not sure where to hold my head i forget they've already got the camera like we're supposed to be because i feel like if i'm not right in front of it then it's all messed up but that's why i'm not a tech person okay had knowledge no head knowledge wanted okay i just got lots of revelation i'm a detailed person but you're not detail in the tech area so it will show us your uh little it looks like almost like a scrabble pieces there i see the 28 is there a four that's 420 you're going to turn it a little bit because the shine the light's shining off of it funny this is our clever way to keep people from copying over our stuff it's just april 43 yeah definitely being the 28th the 8th the 40s yeah we we do a lot of this we bought you know someone wrote to us this morning that they someone else was copying us on another channel so we thought we tried to keep our own content as those cats so yeah 28 2021 people that's april 28th 2021 yeah i'll have to say that again in the middle somewhere yeah it's it's unfortunate how many people will try and and it's basically theft of content and then they try and make money off of them so that's unfortunate yeah well listen um let's jump into anything you might have to say government-wise and then we've got lots of questions about heaven so i'll throw the floor to you i have to start with a comment about another extremely unintelligent um desire of the bee person to go ahead which i can't even believe they did this you all by now know the green plan that was given by you know who about the cows and whatever else it was about to eliminate the cows oh i know and travel and stuff these are just craziness from people who don't really know what they're saying but they can't get rid of that stigma on them the left so therefore they've made a whole new thing they're going to put out there that uh they're going to go ahead with the less cows thing that was actually given at the beginning i think they only hurt their self and they make a really unintelligent regulations like that because now they're trying to limit every american to one hamburger a month right yes they don't know they're in america right because we love hamburgers and uh that's just not gonna work i'd like to know how they're gonna go to the all the millions of people they're gonna run by everybody's house or a restaurant and see how many hamburgers do the restaurants have to eat well they have to do one day a month hamburgers only because i can tell you that isn't going to work people you need to get back in your office and re-figure that thing up because you make yourself look more and more ridiculous thank god this is america the land of the free and the brave and that's what the way we're gonna stay i would just say as always god has not changed his mind about anything and people go why do you keep saying the same thing because he's saying the same thing no i'm not making updates to give you like some other people i'm not going to tell you something that god has not said as a prophet i have to say what god says and he is still saying all of this stuff is going to be pushed back taken down and set back the way it's supposed to be and we will run our races in the greater glory this is very powerful i just got back from tennessee global fire church where i spoke on sunday that would be april 25th 2021 yeah and i guess it was so powerful it got taken down but what they don't know is we have the audio recording yay team at global life and they will be sending us that and so we will put it out there somehow not sure how uh if nothing else i know we'll make a cd out of it we may do a podcast but we'll have available for people to hear because let me tell you it will jump start you into this whole new season entering to entering to you know you can still produce your destiny and take authority and rule as a king no matter what's going on actually will help when we begin to doing that instead of repeating what is wrong we need to start talking about what is right that's good that's good well okay well if anything else before we jump into some questions here any other you got it i just know there's still things going on behind the scenes no matter what's being said or people thinking or ha is happening you don't know the whole story and you won't know until it happens yeah i just know god says still stay excited that shows hell you are not afraid of what the enemy looks like he's doing talk about what god is doing bringing the greatest days ever on the face of the earth because your words make a difference in your own life and in your own soul as well as what we release into the atmosphere here in our country and all over the world because god's touching the world not just america that's good so cat what i'm going to do now is i'm going to throw up there's been a controversy about which is your correct facebook site there's only one and jeff throw up the actual picture of her facebook page and okay there's the url see it says the revelator cat curve that's what it will say up top in the url that's not what when you punch it in the search engine you type the cat cur right there now look down below you see where it says down 109 000 followers circle that see that 109 000 followers fake bank accounts do not have 109 000 followers so when you see that you know that's the real thing if you don't see something very close to that number you know you're not on the right thing what else jeff anything else she's about in the back okay okay on the about this was started april 29 2016 tomorrow is the anniversary that it was started so that's what five years ago april 29th yeah the anniversary of that tomorrow so that's that's the legitimate facebook anything else is not so that's right okay let's cover one more thing kat uh did you or did you not say as a couple people have reported that if you took the covet vaccine you would not go to heaven did you or did you not isn't that amazing i don't know who made that one up but i'm going to be very biblical right now there's only one reason why you don't get into heaven you reject jesus christ right you're not going to hell because you wear jeans you have jewelry or you wear makeup or you you have that there's only one reason why you don't make it and you have up to every moment breathing your last breath and i believe even right after that you still could because christ has the keys of hell death and the grave we'll go over that another time but i never said that absolutely not did not say that i myself am choosing not to have the vaccine i've probably been asked that at least 30 times just in this last week even when i greeted all the people at uh global fire i think about 400 showed up and they didn't even advertise it because of our little thing that we mentioned about a week ago steve they had all those other people show up that's amazing so i say no my choice is no i don't need it i'm not taking it there you go now you have that officially set right and i you know i think i have one son that i he's either had it or he's talking about having it and his mind is made up from what i can tell but i i don't intend to take it you know i i just don't i don't need it i don't want it i believe there's treatments in case you get it so i'm not telling anybody not to do it let me tell you something we get extremists on both sides people are angry at us because we don't tell them they're going to kill themselves or something and then the people get angry on the other side because we're we we're saying we're not going to get it both sides think we're being completely irresponsible everybody has a choice that's just everybody you have your own choice you make your decision what gives you peace the bible says follow after peace again i'm going to be very scriptural so follow after what gives you peace i have peace not having it there you go steve has peace not having it there there you go there you go all right well let's get some questions about having for anyone that may not know uh cat car's been to heaven well over thousands of times and god often woke up the father will walk through the wall uh one lady wrote let me just start with this this wasn't my number one but she asked us today or the other day she said if cass says the father will sometimes walk through the wall or god will walk through the wall and talk with her and we haven't covered this for a long time this you don't have to have an exhaustive answer but give them maybe a short answer on she'll say well how can that be when the father says nobody can see my face and live just kind of recap that for new people yeah i'll be scriptural again this must be scripture day yeah okay john in the book of john we're talking about the disciple john the beloved he said you cannot see the face of god and live and yet in the book of revelation okay look up revelation 4 you'll find it it's in there where god the father sitting on his throne in heaven with the rainbow coming from him caught john up and it's written in the book he saw him sitting on the throne he saw the rainbow coming in and out of him he saw his face he had flames of fire lightning bolts were coming from him those are lightning bolts of love he clearly describes him and yet people he didn't die and that was god clearly saying when you are born again when you're born again okay you have access to heaven not just when you die god may catch you up and show you you may have encounters there um you may have visions or dreams of heaven itself and and it says the eye is not seen nor ear heard nor entered in the heart or mind of man what god has prepared for those who love him and those who are going to go to heaven unless and accept the spirit of god shows you clearly the spirit of god took john up in the book of revelation so he could see the face of god and see him sitting on the throne knowing at that moment he didn't die you're not going to die okay in these days if god chooses to allow you to see it then just be happy because it's it's you're not gonna die okay just trust me there's even been sinners caught up and shown the face of god and they didn't this is god's sovereign choice and uh i can tell you others were caught up and saw the face of god they didn't die and but if you're sealed in the blood of christ that is for all eternity you will have access you'll be welcomed when you come home to heaven you're welcome before the throne of god he will embrace you um and so there that's my answer that's the shortage well and then there was that one other answer there's lots of other things that could be said but god god spoke i can't remember mr aaron miriam or if it was to to other people he said with moses i speak to him face to face as one man speaks to another right right there absolutely right that that was said he did say that when god came down and had them brought out of the tent of meeting yeah they were grumbling and complaining about moses who does he think he is the only one who knows god and god said when i speak to moses it's not in dreams it's i speak to him face to face that came from the living god if you want more you're right steve that was in there that's good that's good okay well i'm gonna slip in a few of my own i've been uh biting my own tongue for a while i'm gonna give a few of my questions so here's one you said heaven is as big as i can't remember if you said our solar system or galaxy it's that big so the question is if i have friends who live a hundred thousand miles away because they're their farms out over there their ranches what do we do we get in transport and drive through the country do we drive through other cities in heaven to go visit how does that work if heaven is that big we're not all there's billions of us so how does that work you just think you want to go there and you're there there's so many different ways yes you can do that by uh thought transport you just say i'm gonna go see my cousin joe and instantly you're there like outside his door you can step into kiosks there's a kiosk that's sort of like that's what they call them anyway it's like a big arch like along the streets of gold with steps and beams of light are shooting out i actually uh was taken to several lows several times and i saw people step in they said where they wanted to go they step in the beam of light and instantly they were on the other side of heaven there so some people like to travel they still like to drive you know i guess you could drive most of the cars don't really have wheels per se most cars fly in heaven but there's all different ways you can transport you can ride on light you can ride on song and having to travel across heaven uh there's bubbles you can step into and they float you there it depends on what everybody wants there's always different ways to travel so are there towns and cities along the way in other words heaven has like i'm thinking of the wizard of oz there was the emerald city so there's an emerald city here and there's a diamond city are there things like that yes and actually the bible says that heaven is a country and a city it actually mentions that in the word of god i think it's in hebrews hebrews talks a lot about heaven by the way people you should check it out um so anyway it says it's a it says it's a city it says it's a country it says in the bible earth is a shadow of heaven that gives you a good clue except nothing's dirty nothing gets old nothing ages they certainly have cities i know the names of some of the cities there and even part of the countryside there's a friendly forest there's a valley of the falls there's a mountain of spices there are literally places that exist in heaven uh there's cartoon village there's video land all these wonderful places passionate paradise which is about the love the absolute love of god these are literally places that exist there so yes there's many places to go and see but what people don't realize is their loved ones who are there are making a list of where to take them when you get there so it's not like you wander around you can't get lost no matter where you end up you'll never be lost in heaven nobody gets lost in heaven but yes there's very beautiful countryside and there's amazing cities with real supernatural things to do there's amusement parks there's rodeos there's sports arenas where every game is played as worship to jesus christ because jesus gets all the points well now i'm trying to remember cat if this was you in your book because i read your books but someone i read said that people like billy graham or some people their rewards are so great that their mansion was as big as a city was that you or is that someone else i did say that i said that i said there's some people's mansions that are the size of new york city i am not exaggerating i'm not and that means there's many different things on there yes your mansion can be tremendous you know your mansion could be i don't know 50 000 square feet but then there's other things on there that he's blessed you with or created for you with on this massive piece of property and there's even places for friends to come and stay if they want to stay you know there's not time clocks or uh calendars per se but people want to come and visit for a while they actually have places for them to stay that would be exciting and fun wow i thought that was okay here's my next question um so i picture almost everybody in my head i'm picturing everyone because i live in the country i love the country so i picture everyone in the country with many acres surrounding their uh mansions but do so the question is do some people like to live in a nice fancy housing track close to their friends do people live in housing groups of housing or does everybody have uh swirling acres around them or what how does that all go well you know what there's nowhere in the bible that says you only get one one house okay he goes to prepare a place that place has different doors i've said this before this is the supernatural side of heaven with some people's heads they can't really get it there's no limit to space in other words even on your own property let's say you got i don't know 100 acres a thousand acres depending on what you like let's just say for instance you have 10 acres 10 amazing acres it's on the crystal sea with beautiful palm trees with creatures that talk and sing and the flowers sing it's beautiful but you have interest in other areas and god knows that so you'll walk on your property you come to a door a real door a beautiful door they're made all different colors and shapes and you can walk around the door let's just say this would be the door you can walk around the door and you see the front and the back of the door but when you go in and you open it standing where you're at you can literally see another place that belongs to you another piece of property that could be in the mountains so spices where some of your families are because they love it that means you step through that door you're on your other piece of property the mountain spice is you go enjoy all your family do things with them uh explore stuff and then when you're ready to come back you step through the door you're back on your original piece of property that's why they call it that's why they call it heaven yeah and i was trying to remember if you had what your answer was if i said because you said there was you get you told us about there's a sea versus ocean and i like the crashing waves of the ocean but are they not crashing away are there crashing waves anywhere in heaven yeah especially at the surf park they have a surf park that's like hundreds of miles long wow his along you know the the crystal sea they call it the crystal sea because uh it's filled with crystals and gemstones and rainbows shoot up out of it that would be like your ocean having that it's an amazing thing yes the waves do crash you can't surf on a wave that doesn't crash and then you have huge surf spots there uh but i i want to jump ahead to the end of the bible where it talks about the new earth and it says there'll be no more seas so people picture this earth the new earth with no ocean no he didn't say there wouldn't be an ocean actually on the new earth there'll be one massive land mass like we had originally here i mean huge massive and all around it will be this massive ocean because wherever the father goes that that flows from him so he'll be on the new earth it flows from him even in heaven now underneath the throne out into the streets and you literally see this beautiful gorgeous people jump into it and they put gemstones up out of it that comes from the heart of god that represents revelation and love and life and it goes all over heaven to become this massive ocean that people i have big sailboats or they both have all kinds of things yeah even like old type ships with the massive sails they have them have them in heaven so on the new earth we can't escape ever having an ocean because as long as the father's with us that will flow out of him oh wow now and then about the are there any people uh groups or groups of people that say we like living you know they're the type of people that on earth they couldn't wait to go next door and share brownies or go across the street are there people that live close together on purpose like next door like almost like a tractor but i don't know probably two they have places similar to that like it's it's massive pieces of property that will probably come up next to each other but they have ways you just walk through these like i don't know through these top these places i wouldn't call it a tunnel it's like uh things of light um sometimes you can't explain it it would be like a tube made out of light you step in and you're in instantly into your other family members mansion they have that they do have that i think i talk about it in one of the books but they also have places like let's say you live in the city of heaven where all these beautiful streets of gold and all these amazing things are but you loved you vacation in the mountains well in the amount of spices you'd have another place very similar to that with many many many rooms in it and all of you together would go there to enjoy time up in the mountain spices together so it's almost like a vacation place but you have more than one of those so you have your main mansion but you have many other things properties the proper word is property he made a place for you that's your main mansion but from there you go to all these other properties that are yours and some are like family type places to go to and enjoy all your families together and this is probably a silly question but i've never heard it asked i've never asked it myself we don't probably get dirty per se although we could play in the mud if we wanted to i suppose but we don't sleep per se there's no night so that must mean there's not showers in the in a shower in the mansion is there anything like a shower or nothing like that there's nothing like that because no matter where you go or what you do yeah if you want to dig in the mud or the dirt and build things when you're done and step away it's not on you anymore it's only on you while you're participating it's just like the crystal sea you go in there you swim you feel the water going through you and all around you but when you step out of the crystal sea you're totally dry that's heaven you don't ever have to clean up you're never going to get in a place where you have to there's no bathrooms in heaven is the problem i love that well you know i remember you said that there are sports in heaven they play football and i remember you said you're playing football to win points where jesus said rather than crush your fault but so i i'm thinking sweaty and muddy and dirty but when it's over you walk away clean as a whistle yes yes that's right okay okay now this one i i want to ask this about okay so i people have heard me say before my dad barely made it to heaven he's been gone 30 years um this year and uh he got his heart right he's with the lord but his his rewards are probably slim so he probably has a less than mentioned than many people would have so someone had written it and asked me this question if a person wanted to build or add on to their mansion because they like to build my dad liked to build things would he be of a mind to add on to his mansion and build things because he liked to do that regardless of what he's different i've seen people's places in heaven that made it on their deathbed and it was the most fantastic actually was margaret my cfo my sister-in-law i saw her ex-husband's place in heaven he got saved my brother and margot went and prayed with him to be born again got saved and he has this most magnificent it's like an a-frame the most glorious looking cabin you've ever seen probably i don't know eight thousand ten thousand square feet wow on uh on a river that comes off the crystal sea because he loved the fish i saw him there with his dog pepper i didn't even know he had a dog when i came back i asked margaret and she said yeah he had a dog named pepper so i i knew that was him i was seeing so i'll tell you why they don't want to change it steve they are so grateful beyond measure that they number one didn't go to hell that the love of god and because of christ they were able to be there they love everything he made for them because your mansion is made by jesus christ most people don't want to change it they can bring in things they picked up like beautiful things that people give them but again the other thing they can do is people do actually build things to hold big events like they will put up different types of buildings and stuff they hold big events on their own property they help others who are doing that they make things and do stuff i bet that's what your dad is doing but i do want to say this god just said to tell steve his dad is delighted every time you say my dad did make it to heaven wow wow i love that hey thank you when you say it well yeah and i mean because you people have talked i've been kind of an open book you know i'm my sister i have a sister that to this day and we pray for i'm standing for our salvation and she will yeah but she has said a few years back she says if dad's going to be there i don't want to go well that's her temporary position because she was abused but she won't hold that forever but um well let me ask you guys go to heaven they all have so much love for each other really will people just don't even think about those things um they go with forgiveness already in them and all they can't wait to do is to see their family members when they're there in heaven wow wow now i wanted to ask if there's are there people like my dad probably felt he would go to heaven because he knew his heart was right but if are there people who suddenly at their death find themselves ushered into heaven who are startled because they didn't think they were going to go oh yes that's why they had the welcome center which was one of the places that god took me and showed me and the lord has taken me back again and showed me they actually have a welcome center in heaven because people some people are in shock some people aren't shocked because they made it but they did make it i guess they felt like they hadn't achieved some kind of level of goodness or something but because of christ in them they're there and they actually say there's actually people who are funeral directors on the earth who are now in charge of people coming to heaven that are in shock like is this heaven is all this are people really dancing are they celebrating are they making noise do they have music here and they'll come say come on we're going to show you and explain all about this and then they take them to the welcome center and when they leave there they're just running so free and excited about because i actually get to see a lot of things in heaven when they take them there yes this is this is where you're at this is heaven you have actually made it here that's really it so then i have the opposite question are there people who were convinced they were going to have an inner stun to find themselves in hell i think probably most people inside their self already realize that hopefully as they're dying they will uh yell out that they repent for their sins and uh still have an opportunity at that last moment to receive christ there are some people who wouldn't receive it no matter what you did because they're so deceived um by man or by the enemy himself sometimes the enemy does still make promises to people if they do wicked evil things and some people don't think there's either place so depending on the mercy of god or their family what they're standing for i will tell you this they all usually know by the time they're going because there's a traveling thing in that it's not like you die then you're there you have the demons will come and get you and take you there or fear starts to consume you as a believer that spears never going to consume anybody when they die but i'm telling you people do know that they did not receive christ they fully rejected him uh when they're there when they do go go go to hell so george everybody make sure you receive jesus christ let me ask you about right see the romans one or two it says that those that did not have uh the creator did by nature the things that were right and they they were a lot of themselves and i think that meant that so we have things like the aboriginals in africa and never heard of the name of jesus over the decades and hundreds years we have the first nations people in here before the white men came and brought the teachings and how did how do those people end up who never knew jesus and never knew god i mean we have chiefs indian chiefs we talk about the great spirit is that how they get in or what i will tell you again the scripture this one's the scripture again in the book of romans it says in romans that uh god said i make myself known to every man that would be mankind he makes himself known to them they know there is a god as much as they want to say there isn't there is nobody he said i make myself known to all mankind so he does and i would say the native americans probably have some of the greatest encounters with with god himself and with the lord they were spiritual people and yes god did make himself known to many of them and i happen to know they also had encounters with angels because on some of those totem poles i have i've seen some of the faces of the host carved on there and that one encounter i had out in the middle of the desert in arizona where i saw one of the the angels were over the western territories his face looked like it had facets in it and he was actually wearing images of the eye of god on himself and the holy spirit said back in the days before the white man was here this being would be out there warring and they some of them you know would see him and they would take the images he was wearing and put them on their on their homes and on their clothes that they wear and they knew that that being represented god himself and you have to understand uh there have been angels in many places that did have encounters and speak to people so i think the native americans probably had a lot of encounters of their own before men came and actually said what the name of god was and i think that probably happens everywhere or god would not say i make myself known to every man so they do have an opportunity to say yes to him and you know even in the in even in the the other country i think it was paul that saw the the statue to the unknown god and he used that to preach the gospel to those people so they knew there was a god they didn't know the name of him that's good that's really really good okay you talked about aborted children of course going right to heaven and many of them are there waiting for their parents and others of them their parents never show up because they didn't receive christ that's right and so we talked about uh people who were childless could then ask the lord to adopt i mean it's uh the question occurred to me that if a woman was childless and she had always dreamt of having twins she could say do you have a set of twins whose parents didn't come can they do that can they say i want to raise twins that no one was able to raise when i go to heaven absolutely yes and there's they actually do and god knows your heart already that you wanted them so you would be on purpose taken past that place which has beautiful meadows all these little babies are playing because little babies uh even still what we would call a baby they already can laugh talk play sing dance and many people go there and take them as their own and uh and then they raise them they'll grow very very slowly even in having them grow slowly and those people get to raise them as their own so yes you can do that that's really really good okay uh all these questions a lot of them are completely disconnected from each other but um some of you talked before about if someone really likes to cook they like to cook from scratch they're in their mansion so because they like to know you don't have to spend money on anything but do they go out and some find some free flower at this place and get some free lists here and they start their coverage with supplies or what how does that happen if someone loves to cook all the time from scratch this is the difference between earth and heaven you don't have to stock anything you're in there in your amazing kitchen now you know i'm not cooking i'm sorry i've cooked most all of my life and great dreams not gonna cook my glorious tables with all my friends and family probably 100 people some some homes have tables that will seat 100 people everybody sits there and say what they want and it appears on the plates fully done amazing you eat it and then it disappears and your plates are clean again that's going to be my mansion but some people i was taken to someone's mansion whose greatest pleasure was to cook for their guests and there was this kitchen it had gadgets and i didn't even i didn't even know i didn't know what they did but they were making the salad and all they did was say like i need lettuce and cucumbers tomatoes um all these other things they listed and they all appeared on the counter in like these baskets already clean they didn't have to scrub them or anything wow and she was uh peeling these carrots okay now the carrots one reason she they were cleaned but she wanted to peel thinner i saw this one pick up a carrot and peel it and when the peeling came off it disappeared there was no garbage when she was done and it was perfect she cut it up she was making this salad to feed like 50 people and i watched this over again like there's no garbage there's there's no there's no trash to pick up and so i was amazed so yes you can cook if you want to cook i love that and and we talked about there being stores where you don't have to pay i think we did what you do is everybody uses their particular gift in heaven it can be making things out of glass making things out of wood beautiful things that they have created and they have shops and sometimes the shops are actually in the people's mansion so you know live somewhere then go somewhere else to use your gift it's all designed around your mansion it's on your own property people come depending on what it is if you have an ice cream shop it would be right there people come from all over having to eat the ice cream that you have made and that you're offering in your shop you get to scoop it and put it on the stuff and everything the same thing with jewelry stores i was taken into a jewelry store on the city streets of gold and it was a it was a a jew it was a jew who had a jewelry store who received jesus christ and it was in this big diamond this was his store and a facet dropped down people walked up inside i saw the showroom everything in it was free he he caught the gems that came from um there's a place you can go get all the gems you want to design jewelry and stuff if you make that and some can be custom made for family members coming to heaven and then you go in there and then you can take it they put it in these beautiful little satchels and you take it with you every kind of thing you can imagine that's beautiful they have fabrics things are made out of fabrics out of leather uh glass metal whatever that gift is it's your passion to use that's what you do in heaven that's why there's so many things to do in heaven interesting okay here's a question by the way jeff i'm getting a real echo in my earpiece i don't know if anyone else is telling you but that's just me there it went away okay cool uh so i'm thinking of someone like rush limbaugh who went home to be with the lord recently and um do people like him who loved political science and what was going on would he have an interest in having an or the ability to see who's president when who's coming even if he can pray it in or is he completely oblivious now once he goes to heaven he knows nothing about who's president or anything like that oh no he's fully aware of all of that everyone can watch they go to those beautiful places that i actually is in one of the one of the sketches in book one it shows you these places they're called the portal but they're actually building the structures and you walk in walk up the steps and look over this beautiful railing maybe a thousand people could go in here to time you look down and see all different kinds of things happening on the earth and so if you were interested in that you could totally watch all that going on except one good thing about heaven no one is concerned about the fraud and all the other stuff going on right now because they can see what's going to happen they know what's coming up next well they do yeah they can watch a lot of that and they're up there cheering us on down here they're excited about what god's plans are they see god's plans even though they can see some of the stuff influence of the enemy they will see what god's plans are so they get excited and the other thing rush will be doing is when somebody new comes to heaven they actually have meetings where they get to come and talk and share and everybody wants to hear what they have to say even though they could have washed them on the earth and they will give testimonies like god spared my life god gave me this revelation about this thing he empowered me to speak boldly and i was so excited they kind of give their testimony and these places jammed full of people in heaven everywhere because they want to hear from someone who has just come from the earth i love that i love it okay here's when i was talking to a man yesterday on the phone friend oh friend he'd lost his wife very very recently in their best best friend for 40 some years and god has through multiple prophetic voices told him that that he's going to be married again soon and he's probably close to my age a little bit older and so here's my question he said people can look down in the portals of heaven and they see these births and marriages these these pivotal moments in time so his wife who went before him that she looked down to the portal and see him getting remarried and rejoice or what he will rejoice greatly really he will literally rejoice sometimes they'll even ask jesus can you please send them and someone else because i don't want them to be alone no they know this they know one day when everybody gets to heaven you're not going to end up there with three wives you'll have three best friends and everyone knows that they're so happy that god sends them someone else to have so i have somebody else in their life and not be alone [Music] that's good that's really that i never heard that asked and it just occurred to me today you know you know because i would there would be that part of me that would have felt funny if that ever happened to me and if i ever had to get decided i was going to get remarried i forbid that that would ever happen but but you know that in heaven everybody in heaven would be happy for that interesting very very interesting okay now that's the end of my couple of questions here's some more uh listen this keeps me asking me are there different levels in heaven i keep being asked that different levels of heaven i would not say um levels per se like you have to live at the bottom of heaven it's and i've actually heard people say that they thought that was true it doesn't say that in the word of god everyone has access to the father everyone has access to this throne room i think it's more per se how much property has he given you for how much have you poured yourself out for him how many people have you loved it's not like he keeps count but the more you pour yourself out on his behalf the more reward you will get they're definitely layers in heaven i think not level is not the right quite word layers there's layers in heaven that you can go into and you go up and go into other places that aren't necessarily on the ground to enjoy there is a place called passionate paradise where because of your pouring out of yourself you get to go meet with jesus and he gives you his own songs to sing and you're still worshiping him but you are you're you're standing on this platform when you're raised up and everyone in heaven at that point will hear you singing these songs of adoration to jesus christ so honor is going to be given nobody worships anybody except jesus christ they adore the father and the they also love and adore holy spirit but jesus christ is the is the groom for everyone who fears the bride everyone will love him first more than anyone else and he honors people for what they did in their lives even people we never saw or heard of like maybe some little grandma prayed in three moods of god nobody knew their name but they took authority over the any enemy to prevent things from happening or interfering they prayed on behalf of so many people who had answers to prayer were healed and didn't even know why that happened you're gonna know you will know those people who did that in heaven god will make sure that they're honored really good um you talked about spending time with jesus and and in the past and then if you said there was a garden and whenever you want to spend time with the lord he would come and so here's the question if if you spend time you spend a couple hours with the lord this morning or today because i don't know if there's morning noon or night they're just today and you go to your friends and see your three other friends and you say i spent a couple hours with the lord today three or four other friends could say the same thing we all spent a couple hours with the lord today too private time is that would it work that way yes you people need to understand the word layer is so important in heaven you yourself are a layered being you have a body soul and spirit those are layers of you okay but they're still you your soul itself has layers it's your mind your will and your emotions god made layers holy spirit is an unlimited layer being so holy spirit can be everywhere at the same time the same way jesus does that he takes a layer of himself and sends it somewhere but that is a whole of him jesus does the same thing jesus can do the same thing he can be in more places than one at a time but it's still fully him that's hard for your human mind to understand or conceive because we can't do that ourself here and yet people are seeing another country's preaching and jesus would reach and take a layer of them we have a layers of ourself too it's involved in our soul the layers of our soul are all of our emotions and he'll take it and send it to a foreign country to preach maybe even while we're sleeping that's still you when people see you they'll say i saw you you were preaching here you pray for me and that all is real that's not something that's made up so jesus has the same ability being the king of kings he has many layers so he can be with different people all over the world right now and it's a real encounter he's really with them so in heaven that's just the same way it is interesting very very good here's a question from one of the viewers is does god grieve too does his heart break sometimes does he grieve or is he just joyous all the time it says in the bible that sometimes he weeps over certain things so i think he does sometimes do that it isn't like us like if we grieved and it stayed in our soul it would affect our whole being that doesn't happen to him but there are some things that he's not happy with or some things that does move his heart okay it moves his heart i know he sings over us he laughs and um he loves to be with us he doesn't like evil he cannot stand or bear evil he doesn't like it when anything happens to any of us but the one thing he despises the most is when anyone messes with his babies he does not want people messing with the unborn it is like one of the worst crimes it even says in the bible that if you you were involved in abortions that would be better than um be better worse be worse for you and when they say millstone in the bible i'm not talking about a little rock millstones are the size half the size of your house they grind they have like water mills even back in the old time sometimes they still have some these massive things that that weighed probably tons it'd be better for you if your punishment was having one of those tied around your neck and thrown in the sea than what he's going to do to you for you messing with his unborn because he chooses to send them here for a purpose when you end your life you are really probably going to be on the worst side of god possible and just to clarify for anyone who's just heard that you're also saying or i don't want to put words in your mouth that anyone who did that is doing that has done that if they repent there's forgiveness and that that can be there's absolutely forgiveness there's absolute forgiveness you can repent for doing that and i've told many people who had abortions repent of what you did when you get to having the very baby that has life ended will be given them back to you to raise that's the mercy and the love of god but people who do this for a living and never repent i wouldn't want to be them oh wow so you're saying if somebody had an abortion i know i think uh jim baker's wife that she's been married to 15 years whatever it's been had five abortions and then she adopted five children but you're saying when she goes and she talks about it publicly so it's her public testimony yes uh lori i think is it when she goes to be with the lord she will have five babies to raise yes wow wow and the same thing for anyone else who's had multiple and the same thing for those who've had multiple miscarriages they would have those babies to raise absolutely yes they will have their babies when they get to heaven that's just crazy grace you know that's good good greedy grace um someone wants to know if you've seen samson in heaven and if so what does he look like i'm just curious if you've seen him i have seen samson i actually just answered um i think hank kind of asked that question i wanted to show i actually texted him the answer and uh he said he figured that to say you know hank doesn't care if you talk about him if it's good hank it talked about samson's hair must have had the most glorious hair because you know his hair was his gift right it was his right and i said i had told hank well samson has won the best prize ever for the best hair in heaven and now he's in his spiritual body in heaven of course we know that but your body has definition in heaven even though it's living in a spiritual world in your spiritual body it's sort of like being on the earth you can hug each other and touch each other so yeah a samson was really had really muscles on muscles he did even though he was extremely muscular his hair got anointed that hair and as long as he had the hair he had supernatural strength so he was already strong but with that hair that god gave him that blessing and it gave him supernatural strength and most of the time he enjoyed it himself what he looked like but i was saying at the end of his life he chose to let god have his will his hair grown back out he did wipe out a lot of evil people even in the end with his supernatural strength so yeah i've seen samson sims and totally made it wow awesome good thing someone wants to know and i don't know if there's an answer to this this is can you describe a typical day in the life of those are in heaven there's really day always day right it's not like there's days and then there's another day they actually they kind of keep track of things like that according to events yeah people have more than one event to go to they have so many events to choose from everybody's you know you just know and someone could be standing like um if my dad is in heaven my brother who's there now was in his own mansion in heaven and out in christmas town if my dad was gonna have a big cookout and invite people he would just say hey tim i'm having a cookout make sure you come by i'm going to get started soon my brother would just leave immediately and go there to my dad's ranch and that's how people know things are happening and then there's things heaven puts on a big event heaven puts on in the throne room outside the throne room along the crystal sea the father always does all kinds of things so everybody can come and enjoy them you hear that announcement and you go so i guess if you kept track of the things that you did i guess you could keep track of all the events you went to you would just know that you've been really busy lately so you wouldn't be so the language of heaven you would never say well remember yesterday when we did this and tomorrow let's do that that wouldn't be in your in your vocabulary would it yes you have to change the whole way you talk but you could say this uh didn't we have a good time when elijah came by and he was showing us all these amazing things that were in heaven that we could go and see and know about and that does happen and they went i can't i can't wait to go there it'll be exciting to go visit those places he talked about so that's really how you talk about it you'll always say didn't we enjoy this or did you love that or what was the best thing you've been to so far or what are you planning to go and do you learn how to talk when you're up there but it's different talking about a spirit realm and it's different talking about things when there's no stopwatch or whatever and people also say if you pass somebody on the streets to go wow we need to get together i'm just going to let you know i'm going to have something planned or you let me know when you've got something planned and will come that's how they handle it interesting and you know speaking of elijah's visiting with elijah who stands out in heaven that you've seen as far as they turn out to be a real character they're just a hoot they're they're joyous they're having fun anywhere from the lord himself down to anyone you've seen does anyone stand out yeah king david really yeah he's a red-haired guy right doesn't he have red hair he has really red hair he's got this beard that comes to a point and he loves it and not not in a way like israel but he loves his beard but he on purpose everyone who goes to heaven is going to get a chariot ride but he'll come by and just get you unannounced get you in there but his chariot goes through the sky of heaven he takes you on tours really cracks he'll crack jokes the whole time and he'll laugh and laugh and laugh king david loves people and the other person that really stands out you get undone besides of course jesus christ i mean you everybody feels like you're just going to melt and step inside of him he's going to step inside you which he does sometimes and then you you burn with such love for him is spiritual love but it's the greatest love ever so being with jesus who is also a character you hear people laughing all the time really walks with you you're going to not stop laughing the other thing you're going to see jesus at is if somebody's having a party if someone's having a party that includes dance not dance like earthly dance but fun dancing like old type things and how many do like waltzes and stuff and some of these big events that they have jesus has him at his own mansion and i was surprised to find out he had one but god said well he lived on the earth as a human he certainly deserves his own and his home engines mainly one big dance floor with dessert tables all around it so jesus loves parties that's why he was at the wedding that's why he was invited to weddings and so if there's food and flowers and fun i know he's the king of he's a king of war right now and he's our fierce warrior but in heaven he didn't have to war and he was liked and recognized as being fun to be around even by sinners he was captivating he still is but enoch i have to say even looking at him which is you get undone seeing i i can't say ancients that's not really a word in heaven you see the relationship the strength of the relationship you have with god on the earth why god took him and kept him and his eyes are like emerald green and you hear him coming before he arrives so no one is ever going to be bored they are captivated by the presence of being there and yes many people throw themselves on the ground of heaven and actually kiss the ground of him and say thank you jesus thank you god for for letting me come here you see that happen in heaven and people run up and they'll hug people and say we're so glad you're here no one's rejected no one is despised and just so people know this every tribe tongue and nation will be there there's no ethnicity there's no racism there's no rejection of anybody who's in heaven they're all loved not just by father son of the holy spirit but by everybody there so no one is alone in heaven everyone is honored in heaven and loved and everyone is not just loving them they're excited that they're there and you really understand that people are excited to see you that's amazing hey one last question you talked about the ethnicity jesus was born uh a jewish man and it's the father a lighter skin than what yeah so say just describe it because i have heard actually teachings about that go ahead and describe what you're going to say well i've seen jesus on the earth and i see jesus in heaven and uh if you get close his skin is a deep olive color it's great he walked down on the earth i mean he didn't get a second skin he had his body back when he came up to the grave he got his body back and uh it's in perfect shape but he kept the scars as a testimony you know the holes and the hole isn't here the holes down here this massive hole right here wow that they had to put them to there or he this would not have held him on the cross okay so you see that people think that they're they're precious and priceless to people because they know he paid a price but he definitely has beautiful olive skin he's got dark um beautiful hair it's waves it's not like real tiny tiny kiki but it's kind of waves and i've seen when he begins to release the glory from himself the hair can turn actually white really from the glory coming from him uh enoch has his skin is not pale at all because you know enoch and elijah both have their natural skin that has been kept by god all this time you know they didn't die they never died you just caught them up there and they're still there in heaven so what color is their skin what color is eating it is he whiter or is he darker you have everyone needs to understand did they live the country they lived in they couldn't have pale skin they would have they would have burned up from the sun obviously because a lot of people spent more time outside back then god would have given them the right kind of skin to live in that region which would have been very sunny so they both have nicely like nicely tanned skin i've seen and elijah and and they look in perfect condition they look like they're in their maybe early 20s maybe early 30s there's they're timeless right now even the physical bodies are timeless so there's no wrinkles in anybody's skin not even them it's quite a delight you just walk through heaven looking you don't know where to look there's so much to see and enjoy and people do make lists they give them this little thing and they put notes in it and they say when my they put their family members name i'm going to take them here here and here and this one here here and here so they're making plans for people wow before you get there they're going to have a whole a lot of places to take you wow very very good well that's our time man this is so good

to go on to it we are in the app store as well you go to zappa.com we are very facebook like it's not an exact copy but it's similar so if you use facebook you'll be able to use it there's tens of thousands of you all on there now the more people you tell the more of your friends will join that so if you want to talk politics or pro-trump or anything like that you're welcome to do that and you will not be um we're not going to come on and say that's fake news i've told people several times it will never be our job to determine if something is fake news unless it's something really really blatant that's the job of the viewers or the users before facebook got woke and did all that they did if you posted something and people disagreed they would write to you and they'd say that's that's fake they they may not have used the term news but they'd say that's been debunked that's the you know the users will self uh clean the list they'll let you know or they'll write you privately so that's the way it should have always stayed but uh facebook had a different idea which is not a good idea so all right that's uh i think our preliminaries let's bring kat in here there she is hey cat good to see you i was just complimenting her and her brand new haircut looks really nice and uh yes he's looking very spiffy is it it's more blonde in the back isn't it yes it is you can see that is it normally that blonde in the back it is it always is there's no pink in the back part at one time now all god said was we need you to have pink highlights in your hair and within a couple years of doing that it was all pink i have to jump my entire head is hot pink and the holy spirit said um you don't need to be quite that [Laughter] but there is a way if if i had time um i could pull some of the white from underneath here and have like streaks which is what i like so um it looked better but yesterday last night everybody has heard most people we have brand new little baby kittens born um and some of them are outside so i had to stand outside in the floor to heat and so my nice new hairdo kind of went flatter than it was supposed to be and that reminds me because we were talking about your hair and use it and you said the mentoring program is about to begin and so tell people about that but the reason i'm bringing it up now is because you said you were doing something different with your hair during the mentoring thing which i didn't quite get the connection but go ahead at one time also my hair was extremely radical looking like it had this kind of spikes sticking out um i liked that god said you're going to go softer for a while because i'm going to introduce a whole lot of people that don't know you and i guess that would be more acceptable i don't know but he told me a couple weeks ago okay you're going to go and you're going to go radical because of the mentoring program which is revelation on the army of god and i don't mind just telling anybody it's called spirit force and what is that well it's not the air force and it's not space force that should give you a little bit of an idea is spirit force is as operating fully as the body of christ it's going to be such it's going to be such a crush to the enemy's plans i'm talking about the spiritual enemy okay um it's gonna be powerful it really is it will be free so don't worry about paying something i know my cfo goes free i want god said it'll be free but one thing he will allow us to do is we will have products available probably like t-shirts hats all kinds of gear that is either a cadet a captain or a commander see god's getting all of this from the time it took me to drive from my home from my office to the salon in 15 minutes he downline downloaded the entire spirit force mentoring program in me that's just how he does it with me so it'll change your life forever we'll let you know when you can sign up for that not yet but he said you will look a little bit more radical because you're going to be fierce against the enemy and i think it might start something new even in the fashion industry some of the stuff we'll have available but also the hair so if i look fierce it's not against you it's against my worst enemy and your worst enemy is against hell so there you go absolutely and and um very i don't know of anyone that's doing a whole mentoring program for free so don't don't think it's uh less valuable because it's free it's very very valuable people keep saying have can explain this have her explain which capture in fact i have a question or two about that have her explain this she's going to be doing that yes i am it's not going to cost you a dime but you need to sign up for it talk one more time about for now about that logo did you say that's the logo that the that the angels wear what is that yourself yeah yeah yeah this is the logo for the for the heavens army this represents the host of heaven and um it's an age and an eye it's the host initiative the father literally caught me up to heaven and and he held out a scroll and showed me the scroll a scrolling heavens not a piece of paper parchment paper you unroll it's a living thing because it's heaven there was this living scroll that had movement in it and life in it and when he opened it i saw this whole thing shoot out that showed me that it was us commanding the army of heaven the host initiative usually a coup or anything that has to do with an initiative is a group coming together some type of group well you all know about the what is it the avengers initiative or something like that anyway the host initiative is something god's always had planned even before you were on the earth he planned this the army of heaven will not complete their entire destiny they weren't made to protect heaven they remained a war with us and that's what this host initiative will do in 2014 uh he he gave this to me and chris our great media guy tech guy art guy he does a lot has wear a lot of hats he actually designed this from a little sketch i gave him it's an open portal behind this hi which means heaven is coming in we have some big ones there you go oh nice wow and you're very classy you can put this on your car it's a magnet it's amazing i can see a little bit better you see the h in the eye the eye is a lightning bolt that's just gonna tell how they were kicked out of heaven that's what that is and the little dot the dot on the lightning bolt is actually an eye of one of the host of heaven because they don't all have round eyes they say that again they don't all have what they don't have all their eyes on around the army of heaven some are like this is like a diamond shaped kind of an eye see it yeah and even has facets in it and i have met some of the the army creatures that look like that and so that's what that is it represents the army of heaven and us uh warring together with them because you know we don't pull down the strongholds people people try they die okay you can't do that but it says in the bible our weapons are not natural they're not they're not fleshly they're spiritual they are mighty to the pulling down the strongholds that would be the army of heaven that's why he made them and so and god always planned that from the beginning even when they didn't have an uh enemy to fight the army was made and so we for the first time literally in 2014 they were released to come i saw millions of them coming to the earth they will be a great part of spirit force training so you won't escape knowing about the army of heaven working together with the army of god that's us on the earth it will be very powerful very good i'm looking forward to it well kev before we went on the air you said you had some something i don't know if you used the word harsh but or intense but it was against it related to the government let's just tell us what you got it's kind of good news actually although not for them i think that for the first time uh well not the first time but in in quite a while they are experiencing fear i'm talking about the left now they're never going to tell you that they don't tell you anything actually except they want to brainwash you with but i will assure you of this that the foundation they built this whole fake thing on the stake administration the stake uh uh presidency the the the election stealing all of that that was all planned they planned it but what happened was they built on a foundation of darkness and a foundation of evil if you don't think they're evil look at the laws they're trying to pass in this country one of the things i have to say that i knew would happen god knew what happened you know god doesn't tell you everything at one time he knew eventually the foundation that they had built this whole thing on would begin to crumble number one god said i guess they forgot america is already free we are free we will be free and they can't make us not free good yeah we got it it's in our blood it's in our everything yeah it is it's on everything we have and they're trying to take every symbol away i think if we take the symbol away this won't be here anymore that's a joke okay because it's in us it was put in us from the time we were born it's what god made america for the land of the free the brave and the stubborn that's true and i still remember the comment made on on the you know on the fake inauguration day when trump turned and he said well good luck with that that was his comment to the left you know thinking they were actually had won and were taken over he said good luck with that he knew so many things already that would begin to happen number one they don't have the military on their side and let me tell you who they love the military love you know who number 45 that's who they love and guess who is our president number 45 that's who our president is if you didn't get that his name starts with t so when you hear me say the b person that's the fake that's god cause i'm actually a villain so if you don't think god doesn't have comments so the villains and the illegitimate side fear is falling on them yay and that's okay because guess what they are not an authority god reminding me again like he needs to he said remind them remind them they are not in power they have stolen when you're in a racing olympics and you lose you don't win you have no authority no say there's no celebration okay that is taken away and so because nothing has happened against them like literally coming dragging them out they think they've won let me give you a lesson when the devil thinks he's won he gets sloppy he gets extremely unintelligent i'm trying to be polite and he'll even allow arguing amongst the ones he's been controlling that's already happening so there are many so many people's eyes are being opened that if this continues if they get their way the fake ones you know the fake administrators they get their way we're not going to have a country it's finally getting in their head we this is the left this is the liberal speaking who have big businesses the big business the high tech and even the media already beginning to understand number one they're not getting their promises fulfilled case you didn't know that you probably didn't in order to do this whole takeover the left had to pay off or bribe or make promises guess what china some some high people in italy were involved in this uh the high-tech people were were also bribed with promises of what they would have for doing this the media was all these people even some of the medical facilities not all of them they were bribed by the left to continue the virus any way they could to keep us separated to keep our mouths masked uh because they don't want us to oh lord if they ever get together they're gonna find out what's going on guess what is happening anyway so their foundation is beginning to crumble this is what the god what the father said it's beginning to crumble before the very eyes they thought it would simply be easy we're here we're taking over yay and then nobody wants to do what they're saying and the ones who voted for them don't want them anymore so guess what people getting a whole lot closer closer to our day of celebration okay i've got my pillow ready right here confetti we went out and got some cake the other day just to remind i said go out and buy some chocolate cake so you get those great big pieces it's supposed to be a piece it's more like two meals worth you know but yeah we're celebrating but i mean you know that that event in tulsa uh not last weekend but the week before lynnwood and all the people were there 4 500 people inside and no one had a mask on and it was celebratory and and people were saying enough is enough we're done we're not doing what they tell us anymore and that's spreading like like a good virus yeah more and more of us are saying that's it they're already getting backlash from we the people we've had enough okay and i will tell you this that if they're even if there wasn't there is a covert plan but even if there wasn't the rednecks in this country would handle it yourself and overnight there'd be a whole big change they might be finding some bodies somewhere i'm not being unkind i'm being truthful the truth will make you free not more lies i will be attending uh i'm not even sure how much of what it's about right at this point just the other day i was invited to attend a major rally i don't know it's a rally it's like a summit thing the governor will be there governor desantis yay i love you well he's a good man it's gonna be in orlando and i'm actually getting backstage passes i'm probably going to get to meet people and stuff like that i'm not a speaker on the platform but i will be available if they have questions for me they're they're bringing in some profits that they know are still standing for truth and for freedom in our country and i just got that invitation so uh i'm looking forward to that maybe i probably can give a report on it after after that that would be awesome i mean robin bullock went there to mar-a-lago and he said the people the the kitchen workers were all watching i don't know if it was the livestreams or his show he didn't say but they they knew who he was yeah i think they know who we are i get more comments about even new people say i've never saw you before i found you on the live streams i went back and watched every one of them i could and i get more comments uh telling people saying thank steve for elijah's dreams and that is one of some people it's their number one place to go to for truth steve you need to know that remember remember when i said to you that god said to tell steve he's one of the most important people on planet earth right now i remember you saying that i had a hard time believing well it's happening it's happening that's amazing that's amazing well i guess let's get into some questions for about heaven for anyone that's new cat's literally been transported to heaven thousands of times god or god will walk through the wall so she's got a lot of revelation and we get a lot of repetitive questions so we try we're trying to give new questions be sure you go back if you ever on the youtube channel under the video tab you can see every single show we did with cat and every single one of those we have questions about heaven and we try not to duplicate too much so they're all new and fresh revelation but if you're ready i'm ready yeah i just want you to know that people people have said along with telling you thank you never have they been so excited about heaven and not just heaven but their future here because they said i have really learned about the father i've learned so much about jesus my relationship of intimacy is increasing and now i even have revelation of holy spirit but knowing where we'll be going one time this is people saying this i have so many letters and things from people and emails and texts and comments they're excited about their life in eternity but also right now and that's because you and i and god we know that was god's plan to do this every week they know every single week there's probably people all over the world right now watching this right now on this broadcast hi everybody we love you yes we do it's may 5th may 5th oh by the way it's not may day mayday is may 1st we should sell okay that's me first okay it is may 1st here's my little calendar that i don't have attached this is the the cinco de mayo which it just means the 5th of may yeah and i don't know what it celebrates but it's something good i think it's independence for mexico i'm not sure the huge festival they have i think my mom when she was in um arizona got to celebrate that with my uncle one time it is huge it's everywhere and most of the spanish communities have that and it is a big day to celebrate they eat food they they probably have dance and i have not attended one yet but i've heard a lot about them awesome hey and someone send us i don't normally do this on the air but i i was thinking the other day why don't we have someone that's on the level of the prophets that we're having on elijah streams from mexico and i haven't found one i mean there's people that will prophesy don't get me wrong there's thousands of people that prophesy that we want we want to find a prophet from from south of the border who prophesies on this level who gives specific revelations so if you have some of those write to us and we'll begin to say it'll take us a while to go through it and and see but you know we got a very once from canada had a super anointed word for the for the country of canada the other day it was just like off off the chart anointed and we'll have barry back so we got canada covered but we need mexico coverage well let's jump in uh okay so this is my friend liz and she's asked this a couple of times so i told her i would make sure i asked you this so she said um can you please ask cat to speak again about i she'd heard this and i had not heard you say this cat she said to speak again about how our father is always writing notes and designs and has actual angelic scribes or stenographers around him he's always planning and designing jotting things down i have a couple of friends that watch you and cat faithfully and they've mentioned that i've not heard you say that have you said that i have tell us about that well there the it takes me always back to you know how heaven operates of course uh those scribe angels are under gabriel i'll let you know that right now every angel or member of the army and if you ever meet one of the heaven's hosts don't call them an angel they want to be called the host that is very distinct about who they are army's all under michael of course all of the worship angels in heaven were under lucifer and he got that one-third of the angels he got they were worship angels who believed him because he led them and they believed his lies and they were all kicked out with him so guess what when we worship we replace them most people don't know that satan does not want you to worship he doesn't want worship in church he doesn't want it because we replace what he used to do and that is uh either lead in worship or worship now some of them didn't get not every worship angel got taken to seraphim who are over the thorn of god have one of the most beautiful voices i've ever heard in heaven they dip down out of a glory cloud you hear them worshiping in the throne room so they're still there but most of the worship that's why it's important verse 3 that comes from here it goes up to to god before his throne but scribes the scribes the messengers the couriers the worker angels in heaven the ones who deliver the body parts down to earth uh ones are sent to record messages those are scribes and i i woke up one time and two of them were actually sitting on the end of my bed with a word from god and they had this thing written down i couldn't understand the language i don't even think i may have told this a long time ago but they held out this this like almost like a notice or something they say we have brought this written and and the angel said from this day forward god the father will be recording every word spoken by every leader in the body of christ wow whether it's listen to this part whether it's got a good report or not so your words matter make sure they're not wasteful words or even harsh words or profane words for heaven's sake you don't want that written down and it does say that in in heaven you'll be held accountable for every wasteful word so you can imagine if you're speaking things beyond wasteful wastefuls just things that disturb trouble or things like that um it's not nice word you speak to people but let me tell you when you speak words that draws brother against brother or you repeat gossip god doesn't like the repeating of matters but he he was very distinct and he didn't give a deadline on that he just said from this day forward the father will be recording every word of every leader in the body of christ it's a five-fold ministry especially and those who call himself a leader in the body your words have been recorded for probably right now probably about 14 years leaders and you're you're not saying every single person you're saying he's recording the of the leaders those who lead us in the body of christ that's right that's right wow if you repent for some that you spoke he'll wipe them out well i was gonna yeah that's what i was gonna ask if that was your record if you're rewarded for everything you've done you've done good or evil you're saying if you're saved are the evil things uh are they're wiped off the notes so when you first get born again everyone's is every sin or everything you ever did from that point back in your life is wiped out from that point forward you're held accountable yourself for repenting if you do things that are wrong that are sin um if you lie cheat steal if you become a drunkard you know where you hurt people uh i can just go through the list it talks about it in the bible right if you commit adultery people that's not okay with god i'm talking about people who are believers right now if you do any of those things if you use profanity you need to say to god in jesus i repent for those things i did jesus will come according to first john and he will wipe it away and make you go from unrighteous to righteous again it says jesus is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins those are the ones you repented of and then he makes you righteous again this is all scriptural but those scribe angels were sent from gabriel by order of the father to give me that message and i never forgot that and um so i've i've always watched my words but i really watch them from them a courier may actually come and hand somebody a message sometimes they didn't handle it we're telling you about it so the courier scribes worker angels will care for places in heaven who care for things on the earth all those are in tribes god makes angels and tribes and so that's good god does write things down he has books he has a book of these days that we're in now he writes things down like when you say yes to what he wants to do he records that and then when you obey he really records your obedience really people who are willing and obedient will eat the fat of the land by the way i was going to tell you this is when i said this is from liz this is from your friend and mine liz it's on the same text that we're on and she wanted to know she wanted to know she wanted to know about the whole design aspect too does is god making notes about designing things did you say something about that yeah he also does that i think the holy spirit gets involved a lot also with him the holy spirit is a very creative designer himself holy spirit loves to uh is involved in drama he's involved in drama and anything that releases things in movies he's involved in movies and writings really really oh architecture uh for the earth holy spirit is very much involved with that so i'm sure the father and he i see them in his board room god the father has a board room with the throne in it and sometimes he'll call people that are already in heaven and to hear things he has to say they get so undone they're so undone he invited him to listen but he and holy spirit sometimes work on projects sometimes jesus and the father sometimes all three work on them but holy spirit is definitely a creative designer uh that's part of his what what he does and when there's anything he designs for apparel for architecture they're already drawing them and they'll drop them into the mind of man or he'll just give them to a specific person saying and i i will say this i'll add this that i happen to know that in vietnam watch vietnam that's something he specifically told me about would be leading in the apparel industry because they don't use um they don't use asbestos they don't use formaldehyde they don't use poisons and i've seen more and more of their clothing checking out their products like for home accessories and god said they're going to be huge in the market and i'm going to turn their heart to be um not not communistic anymore but want to work together and so i i can release that as a word that you'll see more and more stuff from vietnam because a lot of people are ditching china that uses harmful stuff i have to say whenever i say that not every person in china is wicked please don't believe that it's normally the leaders and those who back their leaders just like hitler everyone in germany was not wicked and evil okay that was hitler satan used him those who were a part of what he was doing is evil they were evil i met people in germany they're very kind-hearted they love people they care about people they still have the stigma but you watch vietnam it'll begin to rise up in the clothing and apparel industry a lot of stuff i find that was actually made in vietnam i'm probably going to be visiting them one day god's going to uh bring me together with some uh industry over there to learn about stuff so yeah mom's i want to ask you about you said movie so the question is sort of a multiple choice uh do you mean the holy spirit gets involved in christian movies only or just allegorical movies does he get involved in star wars type movies yeah what kind of movies does the holy spirit involve himself in well he is called the drama king which means he loves excitement he loves intensity he he loves beautiful things he loves he loves things that move the emotions of people in a great direction never anything in the darkness the only time he does anything if it's a movie just bashing bashing darkness to pieces where good always wins good wins over evil which is really what star wars is about and i did not know this but jen said yesterday was star wars day when they say may the fourth be with you it's crazy but i myself love star wars and what it stood for you know in case anybody wondered stan made it to heaven people um of course he's marvel he's not necessarily star wars but i just had to throw that in there for free um stan was the marvel guy who even even to his very end was designing and creating stuff he always always like star wars george lucas who started star wars always wanted to show good over evil awesome never in the movies was he's for evil and in those movies there's almost no bad words and almost no sexuality is in in the star wars movies uh there's like sci-fi violence like you see robots being blown up and stuff like that but it is for the good i'm telling you the movies are exciting and fantastic um and and i still appreciate watching some of them that's a good decent fantasy did you literally see did you literally say just now that the that yesterday the fourth of may that the holy spirit himself said may the fourth be with with you is that right did i hear you right they they actually do say that in heaven but they actually say that on the earth may the fourth be with you and i want you to know that the force in those movies was god they actually they probably hit it they probably have hidden it but i in the day was here when the first one was released i was getting sick when uh it's called a new hope of all things where you will look when you meet the main characters in star wars and that would be luke you know and um princess leia and all them and how hope was being brought by guess what a remnant of people to come against the evil fantasies it's true i'm sure steve is seeing it and so um god i know that the hope the new hope actually shows in heaven and you can actually sign up to be characters in that movie it's heaven has movies but they're they have to be decent they have to be exciting there can be no evil things there's no witchcraft no witchcraft in heaven and the thing about star wars is they never had witchcraft okay they did a great movie showing villains that weren't witches that's that's a good tip right there um which is a real there are no good ones i might as well add that for you too but i myself actually god's gonna hand me produce movies one day i knew i would write them but then the father came to me said i want you to get a marker and write on the palm of your hand these words and he said i'm writing him on my hand at the same time this is how he does things with me and he he wrote he said right on your hand heaven's producer and he was talking about me so that's how i knew that's how i get new assignments and uh there are some of the best movies that haven't even been made yet that'll be on this earth some will be about christ some will be about the spirit realm and the truth about this being around but some of you some of the best action adventure movies you've ever seen that will be decent but powerful without profanity without sexuality without witchcraft and and there and they haven't even been made yet but i already know people are saying god's dropping things into me like this and people look at hollywood well stop looking at the way it is now because god's about to do something with that you know you don't know this about me i don't think i told you this but years ago before i kind of got attacked in my health but i was at an airport in cincinnati and i've got a man who was kind of a simpleton um you could tell he was he had a the chronological age was or his mental age was probably like five or six but he was an adult he was doing the trash and he would come along and he would tell everybody who they look like and he'd say you look like a plumber or you look like this and he came up to me and he said excuse me sir can i talk to you and i said yeah and he says you look like an independent film producer and i sit and i was taking it back and then he uh so then he left for a while he did more things an hour or two went by because it was a long way airport i was in the restroom in one of the stalls i heard him come in and begin to tell people who they look like he never ever ever repeated that same thing yeah and then i went back out to my same place he came around he didn't he acted like he had no idea he'd ever spoken me ever and he said excuse me sir can i tell you who you look like and he go and i said sure he goes you look like an independent film producer right and i was stunned and i knew it was the lord yeah i didn't go back back in time like two years ago i'm at a cpe with a prophetic roundtable and de havilland is her name first name african-american woman and she's talking to me i just didn't matter and we were just talking she stopped in mid-sentence she goes you're going to produce christian films and and all of a sudden you know so she didn't say i've had like four of those so i know i i've got the same heart that you do that that just because we are prophetic people doesn't mean god won't give us these other kinds of tasks which is the same word for everyone watching just because this doesn't mean you won't also be that right your abs that's absolutely true especially in these days we're in why they're so important before we start getting accelerated again people and i encourage people get a journal i don't care if it's like a dollar notebook a spiral notebook if god has given you ideas for witty inventions or apparel draw it you may not know how to make it but if god gave it to you then you're responsible for it eventually at one point there will be places you can take that and have things made but even movie scripts okay even books and but i know movie scripts is a if god could have had movies on the earth in jesus time he would have used them that's why he told parables a parable is a movie without the screen they're huge on movies and he will be showing so many powerful things in movies right now in our own theater there's probably one thing i'd even go and see because the rest of it's very dark and um but i can promise you that is going to be changing also so write it down if you gave me something especially if it has to do with the movies and i am an avid moviegoer but i always check out what's in it before i go see it that's good that's really really really good awesome awesome okay khalida had a question she's worded it a couple different ways she lost her sister in january uh cletus is an assistant to one of our writers so she's connected to the prophetic but she says our loved ones go to the to a portal and they declare over us declaring for their unsaved ones what she wants to know what kind of authority that carries on earth and she also asked at the same time she said uh when we gather with the family and are sad about my sister going to be uh to heaven would she her sister see that and how would she feel when she looks down and she sees us being sad as her so she wants to know if her sister is sad when she sees that um no not really you mean the ones in heaven right no one is sad in heaven there is no sadness at all nobody is sad they're living with life itself they're living in the presence of god they've already been shown some of the future for their loved ones on the earth so really excited i'd have to say everyone in heaven is excited especially right now because they know about the big shift that god's gonna do um they're not sad when they when they when they when they look down they see the great things god is doing but you have to remember even if someone's not doing something right they see holy spirit they see the angels of the person they see the activities that going on in the spirit that god is moving towards those people to bring them to him so when somebody from heaven looks down it's not like you just looking across the street it's not like that and they're living in an atmosphere of even beyond hope truth and they know that if especially if they stood for that person and back to the first thing where they're declaring over their family members it has a great effect on that person if you spoke over your family members while you were on the earth even though you're in heaven the words you spoke are right here going around them it's like i walk past people i'll hear voices around them that is their family members declaring oh yeah they don't forget you trust me they're right there declaring over you to know christ to become a believer and that they will see you again they'll see you in heaven one day and those words what happens is when someone's on the earth praying for them and in heaven they're declaring over them they get caught in the smack of those decorations and then the increase this is how heaven does it boy if you know how they really fully operated i don't have time to tell everybody everything but the way they operate in heaven is magnificent it is absolutely magnificent god takes every opportunity to draw somebody to him and you use many different ways on the earth but those in heaven absolutely will go to a portal and uh if jen can hear me i wish he'd go get me one so i could show it um anyway so anyway i'm just letting people know that god that created places in heaven that when you're there you can walk up going this beautiful building you walk up steps and you look down to this massive opening maybe a thousand people are looking down uh people on earth would call them the balconies of heaven uh but they have made these places and they can look down they see you on your birthday they see you at christmas they see you having babies they see you getting married and i know when my daughter got married in december i know my dad was watching my grandmother my great-grandmother i know casey's friends who had passed on were all watching from that portal in heaven but they also go there to declare over you and oh here's one right here um i'm hoping we can get out of the plastic i'm just gonna i'm old school people okay i know we have technology but i'm very spur at the moment people yeah let's look at that this is a picture and all the little things around this opening are people let me know if you can see it there you go now you can see yes wow there's hundreds there or there could be hundreds there you see the columns the big columns right with the blue the blue at the bottom are like a media it's a media source really a monitor it's monitors and the ones on the right of this picture these two different ones will show you you'll begin to see your family member about to get um born again and everybody will get ahold of ready go quickly to a portal watch your family member get born again and then the ones on the left they'll begin to show the faces of those who are about to come home to heaven that's how they know so these places are all over heaven and yes your family members go up these steps right here and uh they look over this big balcony and they'll declare on your birthday they'll sing to you they'll send these pedals if you begin to feel peace when someone's passed they're throwing peace petals petals like flowers really yeah with the peace of god they'll throw them over top of you and they'll they'll begin to consume you and so yeah these places are real this is one of the when the first places i was taken to in heaven and so uh and it's very huge this place right here would probably hold a thousand um and when those thousand people cat when those thousand people are looking that each one of the thousand will see the whole thing as if it's their own movie screen or what no it's like they're really here over you okay so they look down and looking down on me like if my dad was watching me right now it'd be he's right there watching me like like not from far away it won't be far away okay it's like they're there and you can feel their presence sometimes you may smell their uh favorite flowers or cologne um or if you liked cookies or brownies and you begin to smell them baking that probably means that family member is watching you from here wow and we we have these on my website revealingheaven.com if you're interested but god help me make them available you know i think for a very small fee because you know we we pay for the art we pay for the coloring and the printing and uh and so i love i used to travel and show these i'd carry them just like i am now and show them to people and i'm just going to show you one more this is in the nursery of heaven with an angel i actually met him and he's holding a little baby that was miscarried and the parents will have that baby when they go to heaven one day and uh and when they have them they'll rock them in their arms and they'll sing songs of god and the breath of god nourishes their little spirits is that i can't quite see the the photo um is the baby not quite fully formed yet i can't quite tell uh it's wearing a purple or pink outfit can you see it now yes yes is it fully formed yes it is okay okay it's kind of small so wow so it's as [Applause] oh there you go so i said oh there you go so it's as if it's a brand new born baby like days old yes yes wow and they they already they can laugh and play and sing and they can walk or run really [Laughter] that's really really really good well i guess we have more questions i better get to i have so many more questions but um to clarify when when the thousands are standing around that portal and they look down you said it's as if they're literally here it's like three-dimensional is everyone seeing the entire portal as if they're in your living room they're all looking at the same place with seniors no everybody sees what they desire to see everybody sees their loved one or maybe it's their pets that are still on earth people still love their best no they see only what they came to see right so everybody could be seeing something totally different when they look now it's just how god does it and last week you completely blew my mind and some of you that were watching because i was talking about my dad barely made it to heaven but he made it to heaven and you interrupted me and you said the lord wants me to tell you that your father loves it every time you say he made it to heaven i had no idea that kind of thing would happen does that mean other people's loved ones are hearing them say talk about how they got to heaven and how they barely got to heaven and that kind of thing yes yes that's just amazing that's just blue i have been thinking about it all week long too so yeah i tell people you want to say hi look up and wave you have said that that's not talking to the dad they're very alive their body's dead but they're they're not dead i remember i think i was on a cruise with you when you said that and i thought you know okay that's a nice thing but i didn't mean to disbelieve it but but this sounds more three-dimensional believing it there right there you know yeah that means my spiritual father wade taylor went home in 2012 and he used to say god's gonna give me a healing ministry and he and he always prayed for the healing but he one day he intimated i can't remember how it came about but maybe all the healing ministry will be when i'm in heaven do some people have a healing ministry in heaven i don't know i don't know i don't know how that would work unless maybe they go to visit the babies in the nurseries and just love on them it's not probably like healing bodies obviously their bodies aren't there nobody gets sick nobody's handicapped there's no blind people in heaven everybody can see it but he can hear everybody i think i thought he must have meant when i'm in heaven i'm going to have a special anointing to pray for healing on earth but that that's what i thought maybe he meant i i've never seen that i've never seen that happening okay okay that's a great thought though okay here's a question um can i ask my angel um this is interesting i mean it might be he says can i ask my angels i think they mean the host i suppose they ask my angels to draw their swords and cut off the heads of any and all devils that i find that are attacking me and if not what can they ask them to do okay you cannot ask them you can't kill a demon people right right you couldn't do it yourself at all okay number one you're spiritual you're physical that's just not gonna happen um if you if you had a physical sword it would pass through them it wouldn't do anything to them all right so this is the thing you you can have them bound and and your guardian angel number one is not one of the hosts i have to let you know that those are totally separate the guardian angels come under gabriel okay your garden angels mostly look like people but with wings okay uh the hosts don't mostly don't ever look like people they look like creatures um or they're made out of things like light or sound i mean but they're real and they're they're they're fierce they can battle the demonic they can shred them but not kill them and i mean they they will literally shred them they can leave marks on them they can't kill them i've seen uh if i find that i'm going to show it on a live stream i'll just hold it up and show it to people i literally took a picture one time when i first invited heaven's army according to the protocol the father gave me invited heaven's army to be one of my weapons they began showing up outside in the sky over my home and one time not kidding there was a whole group of them the ones that looked like lions at the world guard they had some demons in chains and brought them over my roof and i got a picture now sometimes really i'm not kidding i'm not kidding they were showing me the ones they had captured and were dragging either for judgment um because i have been in the courtrooms in heaven where sometimes demons are dragged up and judged and then the father deals with them they're either thrown in a dry place or they're thrown in chains um that's what spear force is all about you're gonna learn so much about that so i don't have time or won't answer any questions but i can tell you you can command your your army if you have an army now your guardian angel is mainly to protect you from a car hitting you or maybe the plane blown up and saving you from that uh that's mainly they're with you from the time you're conceived you're guarding angels there's usually more than one and if you saw them most of them even my own looks like a 40-foot like muscular human with massive a massive wings he's got golden hair i've seen him since i was little he goes everywhere with me he has literally saved my life like physically saved my life many times and i felt his arm hold me so i let me get hit by a car so your guardian angel does those things if you want them to fight demons you better invite heaven's army to be your weapon the army fights the dark army they pull down strongholds which means it says your your weapons are mighty to the pulling out of strongholds that's right there that's heaven's army okay they can go and put on strongholds of demons that have built themselves against you to cause you to lose money or even bring fear to you and your that army will go and literally yank them away from you and either put them in chains and send them somewhere to be dealt with but they won't be there anymore you'll find out freedom coming to you that you don't have fear anymore but that's why we've been beat up for so long we were not aware that's what they were made for although that scripture is there people don't have revelation on it the army of heaven is one of our weapons okay they're not going to be your best friend don't sit down and have tea they don't they don't that's like going to an admiral of the navy or somebody in a high-level military position and say come on over to my house today we'll have honey and tea and toast okay they want orders to deal with the enemy whether it's our natural army going against an evil natural army or spiritual army going against a dark army you have to you have to say i take power over all the part of the enemy that is continually keeping me from closing this deal to community keeping me from owning a home that's a block for me i command my army to go and pull down the strongholds of satan that's keeping that from happening that i will have favor when i go to apply that would be something that you would say that's very specific that's very specific because you're saying if there was something that god intended you to prosper on you're not talking about he's hitting you around he's not talking about at this moment you're not talking about i'm sick and i'm you're saying there's a deal that needs to be closed and i can command the armies to take care of the deal right yes but also you can also send that same army to potent spirits of infirmity if you keep getting hit with the same disease over and over again the same sickness those same army that belong to you you can come in and pull down strongholds of the spirits of infirmity that keep attacking you attacking your family that will also be finally god's just going to say i'm giving it to all the body of christ so that's why he designed spirit force it is a force to be reckoned with how i have a force to be reckoned with with this spirit force because you'll learn how to do all these things that you're hearing me say i lived that way i had to do it myself i had to receive it i had to operate in it and you start with 100 army army members when you invite them now this is a thing if you have sin in your life forget it because they hearken under the word of the lord they'll look at you to see are you speaking the right words in your life you know if you're using profanity they're not going to listen because christ doesn't do that so if you're being hateful to people if you're wrongfully accusing or abusing people yourself i'm not saying judgment needs to happen about the situation and you're bringing facts about somebody doing something i'm not saying that i'm saying you're going around gossip and slashing people or doing it on facebook or youtube don't bash your arnold in there look at you and say guess like i won't be doing anything for a while well that's kind of it can't is that a little bit the same principle where the scripture talks about husbands love your wives and god that your prayers be not hindered in other words if you you're mistreating your wife your prayers are literally hindered they're not going to work no and that's the way they were sent they they were given boundaries just like when god sent you know wherever god posted angels he put a boundary around them they're not go beyond the boundary and so that's why your angels the army is sent to war against the dark army they're not going to kill your neighbor i'm not going to kill your neighbor's dog they will just they'll probably say god just take me back to heaven okay you you are going to be accountable for your life if you're going to operate even the army of heaven they have protocol they have to follow a military person i know my husband was in the marines our military cannot act on their own can they steve they have to have orders from headquarters they have to have orders from the captains of where to go what weapons to use where is this going to happen the army of heaven is the same and the thing is this jesus didn't say to the army of heaven i give you power over all the part of the enemy he said it to the believers you can't send that army without saying first and some people don't like protocol they're probably not getting much done every time i send my arm you have to say i take power over all the power of the enemy that is colluding or a part of the line cheating and stealing let's just say you know behind the barbed wire i command one million of my army to go there begin to pull down everything that's being hidden every lying word every contract that's being signed behind the scenes i had to give them uh orders that were definite and they were strategic but i had to take authority over the darkness working there first or they couldn't go that's why we have to have spirit force and i'm going to read this really quick don bradley hello uh he said what are my chances of getting a message to cat i've tried for months an important question she has not covered in their conversations how is it that good people often end up in health they reject jesus christ there's only one reason you're going to howl you reject jesus christ i don't care how nice you are unless your sins are forgiven and they're blood washed you're not taking the flesh of you you're not going to heaven and polluting heaven with with darkness and that's why god he did not want us to come he wouldn't have sent his son people always say how can a loving god send people to hell it's just the opposite he loves us so much he makes a way for you to come to heaven but that's the answer to your question right there you must receive jesus christ as your savior so all your sins selfishness and any wickedness is wiped out of you okay we're born into sin because of adam you remember that you all have an opportunity your entire life and even at that moment of death you can say forgive me of my sins i want you and he'll take you so and if people are praying for you especially so if people end up in hell it's because one reason not because you wore blue jeans or jewelry it's because you rejected the the price the son of god paid on the cross so you had entrance into heaven i was watching the program recently and of course there it's a play it's a play on tv so it's it's a program and the husband wasn't going to church but he was saying i'm a good person all week long why do i have to go to church one going to church doesn't save anybody we know that but being a good person doesn't save anyone either because because our righteousness is filthy rags the lord says so it's a it's a it's a huge difference so you can have okay so what about cat um a producer in hollywood they make pretty good movies they give millions to the poor but they never receive christ you're not going to heaven it's just the way it is there's only one way to heaven and i always if i go someplace for the first time i said let me make this perfectly clear there's one true god there's one godhead the father the son the holy spirit those are the ones i follow that i honor that i worship that's the ones in the bible and you will not go to heaven unless you receive the sacrifice of jesus christ because he nailed all the evil in he had put in his body that was nailed to the cross he's the only one who can forgive it because he's the only one who ever took it in himself when he drank the cup no one else can give you entrance into heaven and i'll say so good luck if you think you can find another that's good that's really really good uh hey one last question and this that's our time but was jesus giving some sort of example or was he just dealing with a situation when when he he meets the the guy at the in the the demoniac at the gather at the gatherings and and they said to him have you come to torture us before our time and he sends them into the pigs or i think they may have even requested to be sent in the pigs and then the pigs ran off and went into the water what was that all about what was he doing and what was that all about it was a it was really a kind of a hint or tip or whatever that i even have i have on my bio right now then my hobby is torturing demons you torture them with the way you live because back then most people didn't know about christ they weren't watching how they lived their life and even the way i live my life i do it to bring glory to jesus christ christ in you and i want to point this out real quick people look at the scripture and say wow you know we make glory for god no christ in you is the hope if you think christ doesn't hope for things what about that scripture the hope that your life will bring glory to god by the way you live it the way you manifest like him talk like him uh love like him that's what brings glory that ties in with the scripture all have sinned and fallen short of the glory again if you're not if you're not creating glory by the way you live your life all these scriptures are what christ wants for you that's why he died not just give you hell insurance so you don't you don't go to hell although that happens he wants you to be just like him okay then you come against the darkness you don't tolerate it you don't participate you bring life and hope with the word you speak you shift things in the spirit realm by taking authority over the darkness that's how you make glory for him christ in me and so my life i give him glory so he didn't have to hope for that anymore he's going to get it but i can tell you there is one way to heaven and that is because god doesn't want heaven to be just like the earth that's good that's so good well kat thank you so much that's our time hey tell people cat how to get all of your i see we have on the screen revealingheaven.com that's one of your two what's your what's your other one or tell talk about those two sites well i want to mention one more day tomorrow is the national day of prayer in america okay make sure if you're not part of the group you take a few minutes of your day and say

somebody takes the program and puts it up i i'm going to people's sites a lot even the profits that i follow and i'll see it come up and then i realize oh someone just put it up as a brand new one and i don't know their date so they put the sense of matter where you see it you'll know what date and time we said that so that'll help you all we're going to keep the preliminaries shorter today because we have two shows back-to-back after cats after we have this show with kat um it'll be about a 15-minute break and then we come on with mr clark and that'll have it's it'll be really interesting mr clark who many of you saw in tulsa and he'll be in tampa in june and i'll be there i'll see some of you there if you don't wait too long to register so we're going to jump right in to cat here be sure you subscribe to lijust.com and if you're not subscribed to youtube we recommend that you see all of our videos right there together and you're notified go ahead and throw that up there uh if you go to youtube.com and i put this elijah list or like the streams in the search box and that will come when it comes up click on the thumbs up click on the red subscribe and click on the bell and then your devices will be notified if you are subscribed you can watch it without being subscribed but it helps to have you subscribe all right let's bring kat in here hey cat hi we just got sat down just before we went live and we're trying to do a little more entire today because of the two shows so we appreciate cat jumping on there a little earlier than she sometimes does so cat you had a couple clarifications or maybe one main one and then uh any comments you have about current events and then we'll go into questions what happens so what you have on your mind great well i spent probably every time i traveled back in the day when i was traveling non-stop i was usually tired i'd do like three four hour meetings or whatever i began to mix up my worms so i wasn't actually making a mistake i just got my words mixed up and i'm so famous for probably from 2010 to 2012 continually saying moses that would be noah and moses together so that's what and people would kind of freak out oh my god she said the wrong thing no i do know that adam had a house cat but i also know adam can put the animals on the ark although i have said that before so this is just a clue that you know that in the future if i do that i'll probably catch it or somebody out there will now um but the other day the last broadcast we were talking about like science fiction movies and uh people had all kinds of questions about having some things i just offered to share i like star wars because of the decency that's in it this is what we were all talking about and then it was exciting and fun and actually had some spirit realm truths in it and i do know george lucas wrote that series he wrote i think he was definitely in charge of all the movies and he did compare it he was uh advertised i mean interview thank you holy spirit interviewed by some big top news network asking him if the force was supposed to be the trinity and he was asking point-blank questions which he kind of scooted around so i do know george lucas is still alive on the earth i'm hoping he can do some movies with me eventually spirit realm movies that'd be exciting but while i was talking about george lucas i added in there things like i said like the avengers that stan stan is the one who's in heaven people yay stan who wrote all the marvel uh comic book comic books see there they were coming the comic series he also did the movies the marvel movies which everyone knows was fantastic it was always good over evil that was something i was trying to get get to you that's it's good sometimes to show evil as long as goodness is taking over it good over evil is what god is all about stan is in heaven george lucas is still on the earth so we can go ahead now you know so so somewhere close to you saying the word george lucas you jumped to this other thing and you said and he's in heaven people thought you were saying george lucas is in heaven and apparently it got complicated because there was something being passed around it was some rumor that george lucas had died or something so it was weird but yeah i'm glad we clarified that so yeah i try to if i have time but if not y'all just gonna have to let it go okay then the point is stan did make it to heaven and um god does not mind great intense exciting movies even secular movies can be good for us if they have a good moral and a point which they're both stan and george lucas did that with the movie so there you go there you go all right well before we jump into the questions about heaven anything you want to say about current events at all yeah i certainly do i think the left is getting pie in the eye a whole lot of it too and by people they never expected to throw it how about that i don't mind saying that at all uh i think the fake news is finally catching on that them colluding that's a big word for me okay that means coming together or agreeing with uh to help promote the left and dump the conservative righteous people or at least the right people um and they're they're paying a price for that because they're realizing if it keeps going the way the left has planned which it will not be our new normal people stop saying that they realize they won't have a place their self because if they keep going because you if you didn't know this that um social socialism which eventually goes into communism they want everything to be equal no one's higher than anyone else no one has more than anyone else nobody's pointed out more than anyone else that's the whole thing about communism um that's what happened in all these communist countries nobody has a life they control them they take everything away give you handfuls of little things that they allow you to do but you have no rights or voice that's what that happens and so these newspapers and even some of the networks especially the one that starts with an fox some other people are realizing this person is insane and they're not even doing things with a process they're trying to make laws and be a dictator and they have said those things their self so they're not happy with anything that's going on up there behind the barbed wire or wherever they are at this point that's good news for us because guess what they're kind of having to whether they like it or not agree with us that america is free even they've said that america is a free country but you know what they want to take our rights away our guns away and our voice away hello thank you for waking up people in the lab and can i ask this question of clarification cat because someone wrote to me just a little bit before the show so it's on my brain here but uh using just the b word the one one who's over there whose name begins with b are we supposed to pray for him to prosper as the leader of this free world absolutely not because it says pray for those who are in authority people those are the ones who took the right way to get elected to have approval but we the people have this country we the people didn't vote that person in we actually didn't vote a lot of them in there was more fraud in that whole election and not just for the presidency and the real truth is we know who is the president who won on 2020 stopped saying the prophets are wrong the winning was for the t person number 45 won he won one one people in a landslide it was stolen and 80 million people know it was stolen they know it was stone and they're not tolerating the stuff they're saying we have to do what we will be doing i happen to know a lot of people who are really ticked off right now about the stuff being said but what i was trying to say was they are going ahead with what they wanted not what we the people need when you sit in an office and you're duly elected correctly and legally you have a voice you are in authority those who steal who steal hide they are not in authority legally in any way not in the spirit realm not in the physical realm they're not an authority so we shouldn't pray for them we should pray for them to be fully exposed in every lie be exposed that's what god's saying pray they'd be exposed and taken down and those who rightfully won be put in the offices that they were elected by we the people who have the say in this country that's what i'm saying so guess what those who think they're in power and want to be in power aren't in power and so that scripture clearly says those who were in authority stolen authority is no authority there you go that's good you know that's the first explanation i've heard that was that was really clear that if you pray for those in authority if just because he went through a ceremony doesn't make him an authority i never quite thought about that like that really good that's really good well okay anything else before we go on to this next subject anything else before questions well probably just one more thing if they were truly in rightful authority they would be open to us we will be allowed and have entrance into the places where the rat they're not doing that they don't want to show their face they don't want to come out public and think they're afraid they're going to get taken down by some rednecks out there and they probably would because i know this that american people who are free plan to stay free and they'll just take stuff so long before they start speaking out against what is wrong there you go that's good okay that's good thank you so now we every time cat comes for those of you who may be new cats of all the people who have had visits to heaven there's been a number of them i think as far as anyone i know i've never seen anyone that's had that many visits thousands really over the last 20 some years right cat yes and i still i'm taken all the time yes if you took on an average week i don't know if i've ever asked it like this how many times might you suddenly find yourself in heaven in an average week i don't count anymore because it's like somewhere throughout the day somewhere throughout every single day either the father is with me jesus is with me holy spirit speaking to me i'm being taken forward in time he still does that too and shown the end result that's why i can literally say celebrate uh but it's ongoing that's the only thing i say it's ongoing and i don't usually even get a notice like hey we're here we're going to take it heaven i'm just there i'm taking them there and every every day sometime during the day i'm taking them and then and again for those who are new cat tells the story sometimes like at a time when she was at the grocery store she reaches out to get a can or something and by the time she brings it down she's been to heaven had a visitation with the lord and brings it down puts the item in the ground so you'll have a moment in on earth can be how long in heaven like that how long might you have been in heaven at a time the only way i can explain that is you know if you go somewhere how you know automatically you know if you go off somewhere that's we're going to go take pictures at the beach or whatever that's a good thing uh you know if you've been there for quite a while you've taken so many pictures and seen so much of that beach rather than running out on the scene and taking a few pictures and going back that's the only way i can explain it every now and then i actually glance at the time for whatever reason and then i'm taking i think four hours earth time was probably the longest i can say and that's when the father spent four hours explaining about the soul what a human soul looked like how i operated why it's important to know about it um how to cause your soul to prosper i mean all of this stuff he shared with me and my reward for listening to him and being obedient to share it he showed me melchizedek so i can tell you how important these things are these these are encounters i don't have dreams at all i don't sleep long enough to dream people i'm not having a vision i used to have visions i have encounters there's a big difference that's good well let's jump into some questions then because we at the 40 past the hour we have to go because we gotta get ready for the second show so here it is uh when i was a very young young in my faith i told the lord to get out of my life i still struggle with the fact that i did it and it makes me feel empty and ashamed i do believe god's word i think he means about god's forgiveness but i think i think about it often and i become plagued with self-doubt regret so my question is because i'm doing all this has god forgiven me if you've already said you were sorry to him that's all he needs to hear we haven't talked about it yet but we probably might take time the next time uh we will talk about the sea of forgetfulness which is very very important all that we talk about in the forgiveness of sins and it says the father remembers it no more he's serious if you've done something wrong and you have repented that father i'm so sorry i did that i'm so sorry i said that i'm so sorry i put you off sometimes it's not even really a sin it's just something you were afraid to do he forgave you at that moment you're just reminding yourself about it and usually the enemy will help you do that god is not upset with you he wants to take you further and do more with you but until you get that out of your soul that he's upset with you or hasn't forgiven you the enemy is actually crushing your ability to go forward so let me tell you his forgiveness is now and forever and when you repent of something the enemy will remind you of it but you have to say no i repented that i'm going forward with god that's good that's good yeah you know i played with that idea for years i think well if god if god truly forget forgot about the sin then when i tell him lord i still feel guilty for what i did how does he handle that if he can't remember so so is it like he goes what sin i have no idea what you're talking about he literally says what sin okay so it is like you're reminding him of something you repented of he he can't he can't address it because he doesn't remember anymore guess who's telling you that stuff is called the enemy you take you just if you hear that you say i take that thought captive that's what the bible says to do take it captive you're not coming back i'm not receiving that anymore and eventually those thoughts will stop coming to you because the devil who's doing that to you it's not god uh he'll stop it because he's wasting his time that's good okay this one this one has been filtering to me on and off for all over the weeks and i finally decided i'll go ahead and ask it because it wasn't nothing i needed to be my question but when the word says the dead in christ will rise at his return aren't their souls already in heaven if it's actually their flesh that's rising how does that work in heaven so i keep getting asked i'm sure you must get asked that all the time so i do but i've actually seen all that so people i've already seen the day the dead and christ will rise it will be the most powerful light display in the whole earth people um your physical body will be resurrected on the day the dead and christ shall rise that's literally what will happen it should tell you right there your body will be brought up out of the grave your spirit man with your soul and that your spirit and soul are never separated i've heard people say that to you they say you know your soul goes to hell but your spirit goes to heaven no your soul and your spirit are like one thing okay you couldn't think or make decisions if your soul was some other place and uh so your spirit people in heaven will know before the people on the earth the day the dead and christ will they'll know first they'll already come prepared in the sky waiting and when that body comes up out of the grave their spirit man will go right into it with their soul and he will glorify you in that moment that you can never sin never be sick never die ever again that's what glorified means so that's what it's going to look like and whether they spread your ashes on the river and they're everywhere you'll have a real light show like my brother will my one brother who passed on because people are taking some to new york some are going somewhere else and and like all the all of the ashes a-s-h-e-s ashes back together because that's still your body he knows where everyone is it'll come from here here here and go shh together and then your spirit man with the soul from heaven will step into it you'll be glorified forever it's gonna be the greatest day ever if i was still on the earth i'd probably want to be in a graveyard somewhere to watch the show yeah you know and i used to because i used to struggle with that theology because i was dealing a different theology where we they said you didn't really go to heaven at death that was only so then but then as i began to get that straight in my head it has to be a separation of this person that you have a funeral for let's say they're not they haven't been burned up you haven't been cremated that person you'll say is this john your brother well it's his remains john's in heaven is this is remains was he live or dead he's alive this is dead so the dead in christ the dead in christ that's the dead body it could have said that's right we'll rise first room do you know why because to god he made your whole being he made your body soul and spirit it's not like he made this for this time then you won't have it after that he didn't make it like that he made it to be eternal all right it's eternal but we get glorified we who are get going to heaven and we come back it says that those in heaven will get their body first then those who are alive on the earth when that happens so people will be on the earth they will be glorified instantly at that time then caught up to heaven so you will always have this body through all eternity it'll look young it'll it'll glow it's been glorified whether you're on the earth or in heaven when this happens so you always have the body he's not just had the body for just a certain amount of time this is sleeping and he actually said in the bible they sleep remember when the girl was dead and when peter's mother they only sleep so to god the body is sleeping it's not stop existing it's not breathing obviously on the earth but your spirit man is always awake it's always active and your spirit man with your soul in it is going to live in this fantastic spiritual world with all these great fantastic things to do and you really don't miss your body when you're in heaven because you're in a spiritual world you're touching the ground you're eating the food it feels the same right you do this in heaven well you're not you can't see me i can see you but if i touch my hand does it feel like that in heaven am i does it feel like it feels like you have a body in heaven yes it does and actually the funny thing is when you're on the earth and your spirit man steps out of this physical body when you stop breathing when the brainwaves stop and they said yes sir they've passed that's what the doctor somebody will say you could be standing right there looking at them but you can touch yourself okay you will have clothes on people i'll get crazy questions you will have you'll have this beautiful amazing robot when your spirit man steps out the angels are waiting or jesus is waiting to take you in his chair yet you can hug you can have jesus you could actually hug your angel at that time if you want to because you're not on your spiritual body you touch you feel you you smell the flowers in heaven you see the aromas um the life is so much greater there yeah so you know that reminds you that we used to watch that i thought it was a pretty anointed uh program de la reis i think was the angel and touched by an angel and then if someone died um then then you would see them step out of their body on the program it was very helpful for me to actually see how that might look and then they like sometimes they're wearing the same clothes but they're all clean other times they might have been wearing a robe so so what are they clothed with since people will say well then what are they clothed with at that moment all kinds of different things and i said it would depend maybe you're wearing your favorite thing you know but once you get to heaven you actually are given your robe of righteousness and you're given your gown of salvation those are usually presented in heaven normally people if i'm present i see them wearing a really nice gown type thing not like you're going to the ball but something very nice like tunic tops and pants but you get that gown of salvation and that robe of righteousness in heaven given to you you get a whole wardrobe room filled with stuff to wear so don't worry they'll have something for you to wear when you step out of your body but when we make our spirit realm movies that we're going to make everybody everywhere will understand how that works that's good and when you're walking around in heaven and everyone's got their own choice of clothes does it look more like you're seeing everyone in their ethnic outfits that they might have preferred on earth or or versus everyone's wearing a white robe or white robe or versus everyone's got these different outfits that nobody on earth has ever seen so where is it where are we in that mix everybody is so excited to see what you're wearing number one because it's almost unlimited your wardrobe is so fantastic some changes color some has light streaks coming out of it they have a whole different way in heaven to create your apparel now the robe of righteousness is the god of salvation that's made by jesus and the father they make those two pieces of the most special pieces you own you know well you have they're yours and everybody likes to wear them there are times in the throne room which expands as big as it needs to hold everybody in heaven as they're having special events everyone at that time or that point will wear their gown and salvation in the robe of righteousness to special events but any other time it depends on what you're doing are you going swimming in the crystal sea are you going to surfing in the surf park are you going to be in the valley of the falls diving down waterfalls are you going to be in the mountain spices it depends on what you have chosen to do at that time your apparel changes and if they're in that throne room for one of those big events and everyone's got their robes of righteousness does that mean everyone's wearing the same color no your robe your robe of righteousness is decorated by the father according to how much you loved people he'll take gemstones from his very self and place them in designs on your robes so the robes are mainly all different well okay good because i'm thinking i was picturing okay if everyone's this is an event everyone must be wearing their white robes you know glistening white okay it's not that at all okay i like that okay someone wants to know is it okay if i donate my organs on my death is there a problem with that i don't think there's any problem with that whatsoever unless you're expecting for someone to bring you back from the dead but i think if they did if they did and i'm not saying they won't uh the fact that you don't have organs in you probably wouldn't make a difference he could make you more okay all right um by the way speaking of bringing back from the dead you said uh not that long ago that there were some of the miracles we have in front of us on this earth will include someone who's been completely cremated at the funeral and they come back they're resurrected from their life to life is that really true and that means they're not just dead they're dead gone dead i know for for a fact because i was shown that god said what difference does it matter i think what he's going to demonstrate is he can raise you from the dead when you're cremated right uh yes i was taken forward in time not like 50 60 70 years in time i was taking part in time and was watching a funeral of this young man who got born again through this friend of his he was a christian and no one else in this family was a christian they blamed the death of their young their son who was probably in his late teens on this friend so they said don't invite him to the funeral we don't want him to come and they had had this young man cremated they'll say this their son was already cremated and up up front for the service and the holy spirit told this young christian man where the funeral was and so here he comes uninvited walking down the aisle the god hadn't told him what he was going to do yet he was obedient and he's walking down this aisle and i saw all these people saying who invited him why is he here we don't want him here he walked right down front and the holy spirit said take the lid off the jar and command his work to come back into his body and their ashes and they were freaking out in this funeral service this is an actual thing that will happen in the earth and all of a sudden out of the jar came the ashes like a whirlwind and when the whirlwind stopped the young man was there alive and everyone in the funeral service ran down front threw themself on the floor and gave himself to jesus christ hey i gotta ask you what if i may have mentioned this one time off the air to you you know maybe when you visited i don't know i had a prophetic friend he hasn't written to us for years but 20 years ago he wrote some for elijah's and he said that one day this is is i'm asking you if this might be possible not if it's going to be but would this kind of thing be possible he said that the specific singer karen carpenter would one day be resurrected on this earth before and i said well why would god he happened to be related to her so he had skin in the game if you can put put it i said why would he do that why would god resurrect someone 30 years later at that time he said because her her work wasn't done so my question is is something like that possible or are we really stopping at the funeral and that's as far as it goes i think most people would stop at the funeral because to them it's final i mean most people in their head you're dead you're dead but not necessarily in god's i'm not in his understanding whatsoever so i can just say this we all know in the bible he kind of did that right they were dead they were in the grave and when christ was crucified on the cross did not the graves open and people were walking around that's my answer to you that i think god is god and what he chooses to do either to manifest or demonstrate something i believe he can do it he's never shown me that so i can't say i saw it i can just use the bible always it's my example that that did actually happen in the bible that's good that's good all right different subject someone's talking about you know we send them the the uh host of heaven which is god's army a site we each have hosts assigned to us if we take advantage of it so this person says when i'm sending the host how broad can the mission be can i tell the forces to tear down the strong holds using the north korean government to oppress the north korean citizens or is that too broad or outside of my authority what would you say to someone like that i think if it's specifically about north korea you would be in a alignment you would align with god that he wants that to become a democracy that's what he has continually said to me about north korea he said i will make north korea and south korea one nation without communism and without a war so i have to and if that's if we're using it symbolically that would be different but if that's what people want to believe i would pray that they begin to manifest the heart of democracy in that country to start to begin people give people more freedom than they've ever had before and let that be a demonstration of god's love and his goodness now if it's another country that's really oppressive uh and usually it's the leaders i have to be very honest normally it's not the everyday citizen most people in foreign countries who are in communism don't want to be there that's why they escape that's why they try to get out so i would totally pray in any country i always send the host begin to pull down any oppressive wicked evil leaders or people under them who are pressing and crushing the people that the host should go and pull down the demonic that's controlling those people when people are wicked and evil it's the demonic controlling them and we need to get our eyes on who is causing this to happen i know the people have to in some way agree to do that but literally it's the evil that's been sent on assignment by satan to steal people's identity make them wicked and evil so when i send the host it's always against the dark army satan's army or evil wicked high high place demons i always send my house there like i'll send 100 million to venezuela to begin to tear down the tyranny that's there that's causing fear killing the people i'll start in certain areas instead of just saying a whole blanket for the country if you're more strategic and pick maybe one thing like start targeting human trafficking because i know god's going to do something about that and so in these foreign countries where people are stolen from here and taken somewhere else we need to pray for exposure in those countries where that what human suffering train where they're being taken and what's being done to them that's something you can target it needs to be strategic when it comes to the army of god you can't just say go tear down every evil thing you have to be strategic you need to learn how to say that that's something that spirit force is definitely going to address we're going to talk about that in a minute because there was a question about that um but if so if someone who asked that question said okay got it i need to be specific and maybe i'll focus on kim jong-un and say begin to tear down the blindness that is over him you know you know and let's say he's doing that and 10 000 other people throughout the earth are doing that if your eyes would be open would you be seeing 10 000 groups of heavenly armies just going all to this and because the individual person is likely not going to see the result of their prayer the same day or the the result of their sending if you're going to be strategic when i send my army i say how many are going where i'll send 100 million here now you mean i have 100 million and i have a whole lot more than that because i've been doing this a long but you can say i'm sending 50 of my army you can't just say the army of heaven you have to say the ones that you command and in order to do that you have to say i i accept heaven's army as one of my weapons my mighty weapons and from that point on when you send them you must say these words i take power over all the power of the enemy operating in human trafficking in china you know or or italy or somewhere else in mexico and i command 50 members of my army to go there now to pull down the strongholds that is hiding and helping that to happen in jesus name go host make toast the one thing the army cannot do they were not given authority by jesus christ to have power over all the power of the enemy that's ours that's why in any military the general the captains the colonels they give the commands that are then carried out by those under them they can't just decide we're going to go here and attack they have to have orders the army of heaven is the same way they have to have orders if you're commanding part of that army that's with you all the time now since you invited them you're responsible for sending them on assignments and missions but you always have to say i because i've been given power with through christ i take power over all the part of the enemy bringing drugs into my city and i command 100 host members to go expose where the drugs are who's bringing them who's selling them expose it right now go host but make toast in that area that's how you have to do it good now can't um unfortunately our time has gone i have to i've been watching it more than i normally do because normally we don't have to watch the clock that closely yeah today we kind of have to so thank you so so so much people go to revealingheaven.com like you see there below or go to catker.com there it's a little different um the one site where you could give to cat is at catker.com is that right yes that's right okay so that so these guys products in one and it's things in the other materials together all right everybody um i hate to eat men let's next week let's talk about that spirit four spiritual force mentoring we're gonna do uh because we ran out of time today because people wanted to know about that all right everybody thank you blessings and we'll see you all again see you all again tomorrow bye [Music] you

very popular that will help you a lot um back to youtube um yeah let me just talk about this whole area of we we've got several people contacting us and one and michael my other guy was noticing that people were people were complaining and pointing out whatever that uh they were being written to by us it said elijah streams with our logo and saying god told me to contact you uh the logo on it and tell you that you need to donate into my orphanage that is never us that's a criminal fraudulently representing us and stealing your money so if anyone asks you for money they're criminals and you don't you want to report them don't honor what they're doing don't they some will get in there and they'll say well we uh we want you to sell you bitcoin they'll say they'll say it's me and then they'll they'll say get a hold of me in my whatsapp that's a clue that if they're able to do that on facebook go ahead the remember when when you see a comment and it appears to be from us if it doesn't have a gray background behind elijah's dreams it's not us so unless it has this gray background in the name in white it's not us and it's just a scammer now is that on facebook or youtube this is on youtube so if you're in the youtube comment section watching any of our videos and you see a comment that looks like it's from elijah's streams with the same profile picture but it doesn't have

or seven that are right here working on this right now we were talking about the way we used to look when you're younger i've been married 43 years and i was telling the team most of them have never seen this photo i'm gonna i said hey while we well and i shared it with them they said while we're sharing it with you keep it up i'm going to show our viewers what i look like 43 years ago when i got on the day i got married and there he is actually hair over my ears long sideburns big honking glasses which were so in in 1978 of course my gorgeous wife and we were married at a christian summer camp so there's like a bridge and we're standing on the bridge and i've had several people walk by see that photo in my house and they look back and forth to that to be back and they go you are unrecognizable uh i was like every bit of a hundred and thirty pounds i think right at that time you know soaking lettuce as the expression goes but anyway back then the the texas these people say oh look at that old-fashioned blue tux that tux was so in if you got if you were wearing the blue tux um that was kind of like making the rounds if you look about 1970 everybody was putting on the blue touch not anymore but you know and they were flared on the bottom i'm sure but anyway i just thought i would share that with you all right let's bring in cat good morning kat how are you good morning well i am recovering still from being with my grandchildren and anyone who has grandchildren knows exactly what that means just multiply your lifestyle your activities your energy by a million times because that's what it's going to be like when you're up there and you have grandchildren and these are the younger ones they're like you know five and seven and nine you know where there's no limit to the energy or their abilities or their activities you just have to learn to blend in with them and make sure you're in shape before you go and see them okay and whatever you do if you're going to go horseback riding make sure you have gotten in really good shape for that because that was a little bit different than i remember and my husband was actually kind of bucked off which turned out to be he was not hurt in any way did you go on were you on a horse cat i was i i loved i used to go horseback riding i was throwing up a horse that we did these barrel races and then no not bad but then the other one was at the same summer camp the same year and then you'd run to the horses you'd get the line of horses and then you'd run to the one end the horses would run you'd hold on for dear life and somehow it bucked me off my foot got caught in the stirrup oh no and i it was like dragging me not very long god was good and i got kicked not only did i get bucked off because i was my horse my foot was cut it kicked me while it was while i was down you don't want to get kicked by a horse oh man none of that actually happened we just went on a trail ride oh you just made that up we went on a trail ride it was by the stockyards they're in um near dallas fort worth where you get to see the longhorn steer they actually parade them down the middle of the road and everybody gets to see them i've never seen such a sea of people i just my point about texas was this it's wide open people it's wide open the people are happy no mask you mean no masks no mask people are you kidding me they are free free and they're very happy and there have been absolutely no reports of deaths from the virus whatsoever uh and that they've been free now i think it was maybe two and a half months not one report people keep that in mind when you listen to the fake news okay so they're very free the people are there their spirits are very high right now everyone is working everywhere it's very busy they're building like crazy in texas and um and i always enjoy going there it it's always felt like freedom and let me tell you this they will never take texas ever not with as many guns as they have there hey by the way uh jeff i'm going to just ask you this question uh catker's sound is great but she's been characteristically uh fuzzy do we do anything or do we just hold your arm yeah originally i was going to slow down but now that you brought it up we'll just cat we're going to boot you out of the the chat and then have your people click back in and then we'll add you back in sometimes so we'll see you in a minute yeah originally we were talking about it backstage and originally it's like sometimes it corrects itself but it started to and then it started to get sharper and then it went away again so uh wow so yeah and by the way i hope some of you are going to be in tampa where i'm going to be in june um 17 18 19 i think it's in tampa at the uh i don't know if they're calling it health and freedom that was yeah it's in june we got married yeah okay we're back we're back kat are you there you there can you yes i yes i am here thank you all right you look sharper this time it's not a hundred percent but it's better a lot better than it was so awesome anything else that you wanted to add to the whole texas thing and no i'm just saying that um it's really a great state and um you know they fought to be free themselves and they have had a lot of um um they've had what being my husband is standing here now they've had had a lot of opposition when they wanted to become a state back in the day and they had to fall fight different battles to make that happen and they're free they're going to stay free they call themselves the free here in america they don't agree with anything in the left in case you wondered i'm sure there's a few stragglers there in the group but most of them are 100 but for the constitution and all that uh america was made for and it was really a joy to be there there wasn't a lot of sadness like some states i've been in uh really freedom and liberty and and celebration awesome by the way i i love god one more thing so much of god was there i i if you ever in texas and dallas fort worth visit mercy culture church i can definitely tell you that they are a bonafide church who teaches the whole word of god uh understands the supernatural uses the host of heaven they have three services today but i'm telling the seraphim were coming down out of the ceiling during the worship so if you ever wondered you live in fort worth check out mercy culture church that's where my my kids go and i had a really probably one of the favorite highlights i had was getting to attend services on sunday wow amazing wow and i i assume on everything you've prophesied before as far as trump coming back that thing um you still hold strong i will never turn back or change especially since the father continually talks about me to me about the days of celebration and the people being fully aware now of what happens when you invite not that any of us did we the people never invited what's going on in washington we didn't vote for it we didn't invite it and we don't want it but this is a really good eyeful for those who ever wondered what it would be like to live in a a country of socialism or communism that's what they want and they are not going to get it it may look hard right now but you hang on to your freedom we are america we're a free country that's how god designed us to be and it is going to happen everything god said would happen would happen the exposure will be so tremendous and it will be known it will not be hidden they're not hiding what they're doing now with what they want it's not going to be hidden what they've been doing and what they really believe in so just hang on your hat and get ready to have a party i'm just telling you uh there are things still going on behind the scenes and we know people who know that so it's gonna be god which is even better than good that's so true so true well i've got some questions to start asking you regarding heaven when we say we're talking about heaven um we we talk about heaven every time some people then throw in how does this work how did what about the host of hammond which is one of cat's major teachings about setting the host so we will talk about any and all of that today uh and with that cat i have your first question is from abby i'm just going to read it as short it says oh it's actually a testament um hi quick testimony of the goodness of god i listened to stephen cat last wednesday cat talked about sending out heaven's hosts to expose drugs coming in and out of our area i did this on thursday specifically for my area south uh west wales southwest wales and that's over in the uk the police force had the police force had quote the forces largest ever heroin seizure on friday the next day the next day he says thanks to kat for her teaching all of your livestreams now that's awesome yeah that was not a mistake that happened either because one of the greatest things that the that the hosts do is exposed they'll expose the darkness and they do that many ways they'll actually say things into the ear of those looking for the drugs that could be the police force that could be special swat teams whatever it is and they do a lot more than that but that is one of the main things i send them for is to expose things and the same thing happened in our city too that they were new drug people moving in that had been cleaned out and they were taken out probably when it took about a month to get them out but they were taken out and so don't ignore the fact that you're not using something god gave you to bring the results we need in this country totally yeah totally okay i want to jump to this cat i'm looking at my nose part of me for looking down here i've got lots of questions swirling around here and i wanted to jump to the ones on the host since we're talking about the host so um and the long and short of it is cat wouldn't explain if we had more time there's the angels the angelic and then there's the hosts which are not angels they're fighting beings is that about right they're cree beings that fight they are parts of uh i can say this i'll just say the way father is there are the angelic tribes they're they're created for a purpose to work on behalf of uh the heaven or to help on the earth and yes third of them were under gabriel one third under michael that was the army because the the archangels these this is michael it was lucifer and gabriel they were assigned one-third of each of these angelic tribes but the ones that were made for michael are called the host host the host and where it talks about the host in the bible they're talking about the army of heaven michael is over them gabriel is over the angelic that look more like us okay many of the army people army members in heaven and those uh they look like creatures they don't look like a human and if you saw one you probably want to hide from it although you probably shouldn't do that they're designed a certain way and made to be the army they have eyes in their back literally in their back on their arms and their heads so they see everything operations of the enemy no matter where they are on maneuvers being sent on assignments and they only come to fight an army member a host doesn't come to give you a message it's not going to deliver something to you that would be gabriel's group right there so yes they're designed as angelic tribes but part of them are called the host and i have heard them say themselves don't call me an angel i am of i am of the host which is that whole group the warriors and cat when in the when jesus was born it says there was a heavenly host saying glory to god in the highest were these the armies of heaven yes they were and that's actually why the shepherds were so afraid if you go back and read that scripture it says that the arm the the people the shepherds were so afraid their bodies hurt they were sore like hurting sore afraid they weren't hurting them but the sight of them when gabriel came he announced the birth he was glorious he was beautiful and that they were undone but when the host appeared that was the army and they began to sing it just kind of really it they got undone because they had never seen anything like that you know when you see creatures these creatures who are very well skilled okay don't think of like a lizard crawling on a rock there they have outfits on and they have weapons with them and and they actually had to have choir practice in heaven because the one third that was kicked out were the ones that lucifer was over he could only deceive the ones under him none of the army none of gabriel's groups ever believed lucifer and so when they were kicked out we replace that whole group and we worship that's why the devil doesn't want you to worship we replace that whole group that worship so the army had to take the place they had to be the ones who come and sing so yes it's it's it that's exactly what it was and the the shepherds were very afraid when they saw all these creatures appearing but they were worshiping the lord on the on on the day of his birth i have a question i don't know if you're if you understand it this way i have understood that um that satan a lot of the movies they remake say the same thing that satan did not yet recognize who the messiah was when he was born he didn't know what it was and yet the heavenly host the armies of god met the shepherds in the field abiding in the field and told them to go worship the savior who was christ the lord he went they went and found him yeah and when they went and found him how come satan wouldn't have known at that point this is the this is this is the messiah this is the savior it never mentions in the bible that satan was anywhere near the birth of the savior i think that's probably why it wasn't announced abroad you know satan doesn't know everything he can't he's not like um he's not like michael or the holy spirit he doesn't know everything everywhere all at the same time he has to have scouts satan has scouts those demonic means going on scout out things they get information and bring it back to him and he wouldn't know there's some things he wouldn't know and because that birth itself other than a few knowing like the wise men that wasn't announced city wide or or even to other places that that was happening and i think god did that on purpose because once they found out remember when the wise men came they went back and they didn't report that's when herod started looking for him they started looking for the messiah because it was announced to them through people around him that his star had been seen and he had been born until that time there was no awareness that that actually was christ the messiah and i think that whole birthing was hidden not just from the the people there but also from satan it never even says he's anywhere near there now he's there for the crucifixion it talks about that he was there when he first started to go in his ministry but he still wasn't quite sure who that was but the birth thing i think was just kept from him completely okay now that makes sense that's interesting all right more questions about the host um you had actually answered um because people were saying that okay now you actually answered that one now okay um i want to make sure i did maybe uh oh do how do we know how how do we know how many hosts or army hosts are assigned to us to be sent out to do things i think you touched on that last time somebody wants to how do we know how many do we have and then you said cat the more you obey and send them out on their assignments the more the lord will give to you so how does someone know who if they're not a seer how do they know that they've got more to send out i would just say trust what he has said that's what the father said to me also the more you send them on assignment because he doesn't want them sitting around doing nothing okay your your neighbor your your spouse can't send your arm you have to understand that you are actually a commander when you invite heaven's army to be your weapon one of your mighty weapons it talks about in the bible it says they uh you know they're they're powerful spiritual things and they pull down the strongholds you don't get up there with your hands and pull them down but the army literally goes and removes demonic strongholds over you and so you are responsible for sending them on assignment and they need orders just like the physical army here does and if you decide i'm going to do it once a week well i don't know how long they'll want to hang around they want to go all the time and i tell people make a list of the general things you know like pray over things in your city over your family if your kids are at college come against any demonic at the college where you work against there i mean if you just think of your everyday life how many opportunities they are to send them to put on strongholds and to shred what the enemy is doing to crush the darkness and push it back they do every one of those things but you have to say it you can't expect them just go go army and go do this number one i've explained before the army of heaven has not been given power over all the power of the enemy they were designed to fight that enemy but you have to take authority over the darkness before you can send them before they can go and so i can tell you you start with 100 this is exactly what happened to me and i invited them to come and be in one of my mighty weapons as the father instructed me and coming through the wall of my home were that army and i i see them anyway they're in the sky they live over my home they're not somewhere way up in heaven if you're going to command them they're over your home in the sky sometimes you can see their images right there over your home and some people laughed about that until they started seeing them yeah they're there for for to get orders so yes i can tell you i won't tell you how many millions and millions i now have way beyond that because i never have stopped sending them since 2014 i've been sending them when the father taught me about commanding the army of heaven he even had a prophet come by and tell me you have mastered commanding the army of heaven so now you may go teach it and still telling you it's not a joke you can laugh all you want to but as that girl got a result got a report it happens immediately you're not sending them and waking waiting weeks for them to fulfill that assignment because there's no time in the spirit realm and they're fighting these spiritual beings it takes minutes so finally all the time continually sending mine to different countries to especially america right now since you live here but there's people overseas now come in there's probably about a million people right now commanding uh different uh groups of the army of heaven around the world wow so and that you said takes minutes so let's say i and i've been sending him for five or six years um and there are days when i just forget so uh that's i'm hoping i haven't lost some of them but i but i send them a lot a lot but if you said it takes minutes and i i were to say well i want you to go to dc and for the next 24 hours you're saying it look they might have accomplished that in minutes and be done that depends on what you're saying to them when i send them there i send them in waves like when i say i i want more exposure there's still other things there's always new things being hidden or brought into dc uh different uh things that are going on that we are not aware of so almost on a continual basis i will send them there and i would say to them i take power over all the power of the enemy operating in hidden things and wicked evil things in dc i command you for the next 10 days for waves every hour on the hour for the next 10 days you will go a sweep through there expose everything down every street and every building hidden underground hidden above ground hidden in the sky hidden through frequencies and sounds to pull down the strongholds of hell empowering these wicked people and then you can begin to expose the wicked people and totally pull back what they're hiding that it will be known and that will be seen go host make toast in dc now that right there they probably just went right now i send one million right now to go and do that so i just sent them on assignment this moment while i was speaking to you wow so that's those watching you just heard it they said well how do you do it she just said it in a sentence boom there went one million right there it's that cut and dried yeah and so are we to look at it as and i've been drilling down on this trying to get myself and others just to understand it because the angels are powerful beings subject to god as far as the hosts that are scientists are we to look at this as if we're their boss or at least their boss on earth or how do people are their commander that is the proper term it's an army you will command we command when god said in the bible which almost nobody understands when god said in the bible command ye me you don't look at that sentence the way it's being said i have learned from heaven you you flip some of these sentences what he was actually saying was show me you can command really okay that is exactly what that means show me you can command because we are commanders was christ the commander of the host of heaven yes are we his joint heir yes okay did they create do we have creative ability yes we do because we're made in their image uh there's all do we rule and reign in this world why are we kings and priests unto our glory that is uh positions of authority and dominion a king and a priest of different positions of authority and dominion that are eternal christ said that you we are kings and priests who are god those are spiritual levels of authority there's things in the bible that people don't understand because they don't have revelation but it says there's mysteries that we need to seek out he gives me a lot of revelation on the word of god so trust me it's in there what christ did he is the lord of hosts he's the one who designed this whole thing to operate the army was made for us to command but in commanding that means you take authority over the enemy first you give them orders about where they're going and what will happen when they get there and how long to be there if it's more than just one a one-time thing it's just like the military operates on earth except it's heavens and they're a lot more powerful than the ones on the earth so good yeah yeah i you know all for many years now i'm a light sleeper i'll sleep for a couple hours and all of a sudden i'm awake nuts wide awake just kind of awake wishing so then i'll pray and pray and pray and pray but once the commanding thing and the host i've learned that so i can i can send them while i'm in my bed so but can i my wife's asleep can i in my i can i in my thoughts send them or must it be spoken you must speak it i don't know of any general out there i know no generals nobody who commands our military is not going to go up there and say something with their thoughts okay they want to number one the army wants to hear you say it now you don't have to yell it and you can go into another room if you want to but it's something that's spoken it talks about us speaking how powerful our tongue is and one of the things we do with this tongue now i will say this i always have to add it you can't be sinning and do this you cannot be a believer and sin willingly and think the army will listen to you because there's a scripture that says the army hearkens under the word of the lord well he's not out there sinning right he's living right he knows what has to be done he lives in righteousness and then that army will listen and they will go so some people go and never worked and said well what were you doing and what were you saying were you blasting people were you swearing what were you doing and then they look really guilty and they don't tell me what they were doing but i can tell you right now the angelic your army will be listening for your orders but if they see something else like you're shredding people all the time they'll definitely go back to heaven if you're doing that you won't and you'll never know and you um you said if you see if you you obey and send your hundred god will give you more um so i'm gonna drill down on that a little bit if somebody says i got this now that i understand i'm doing it and before the show's over they've gone into another room they've sent their hundred can they say lord can you give i'm gonna can you give me a hundred more real quick because i've got this other thing that i want to say will it work that fast you you can't ask for how many comes he he will send them trust me there's billions and billions and billions of the army of heaven and he is very faithful within a week i went from 100 to a million i'll just like that 100 to a million because i was sending them i made a list of things to make sure i sent them on and let me tell you if you watch the news you have a full-time assignment with your life if you hear them talking about something negative you better go send that army to come against whatever that is and if not then i wouldn't watch it because uh i'm held accountable if i hear a report from somebody that i know is legit and then i will send the army to deal with that if it's if it's if it's natural people doing wicked things like human trafficking they said i just heard that there's this many people being held in human trafficking i will go inside and i will say i take power over the part of the enemy doing the human trafficking along the border of mexico specifically and i commend you to go now hold on every stronghold of satan let them be found let them be people be protected let them be restored and pull down the wicked people and their activities let them be arrested i'm very specific about that 100 of you go now to that territory as soon as i heard the report i sent them so if let's just say this if you were in our legitimate military right now right now and you knew that people were coming in let's say people saw flying in from some foreign country bringing ammunition and bombs and stuff would you sit there and say nothing or would you call somebody in the military and say i just saw activities i know that are bad and they're wicked that you mean to do harm it's no different with heaven's army okay if you know this thing is going on especially in your own city you better be sending that army to deal with first the spiritual forces that would be the army of darkness that would be the demonic and they build platforms in the sky as more people sin in the area there's bigger platforms of the high-level ones and the army will heaven's army will shred them and bring them back to the ground so their ability to see is is uh is hampered is desperately hampered so this car strategic training in part of spirit force is going to really totally include about the army and we have just start when does that start when does that training start it's going to be starting soon i can't give a date oh okay okay you started to say we have 10 year olds we have 10 year olds that command heaven's army they literally will ten euros when they find out about things going on they will send the army to they will say i take power over all the part of the enemy dealing with uh if they know somebody in the neighborhood is not doing something right deal with this stuff going on in the neighborhood if they know that even bullying is going on in their school like a whole group of bullies they say i take power over the enemy controlling the people doing the bullying i command my army to go right now and pull down the strongholds of satan controlling them inspiring them empowering them go now in jesus name and i'm telling you what they clean up their school from the bullying wow hey it just this just popped into my head i have a feeling this is going to apply to someone because that's the way my gift works if if if a wife knows and has found out somehow that her husband's having an affair whether he's admitted it or not what can she do what should she do as far as the host how did how would you send those what would you say she would say i take authority over the possibility of my husband doing wrong immoral activities i command my army or they could send four or five i command you to go and find out and expose the truth about the situation right now that it will be known and that it can be dealt with that would be the number one thing you would say you can also say i will send the army of heaven to speak and impress uh my speak to my husband the host also speak to people not like i'm talking to you but they will speak in their mind about things like i sent them in traffic control and i tell the host to say everyone in every car you would say these words to everybody's driver i will stay focused that will pay attention i will not be angry uh and there's never any accidents see there's just so much to try to tell you in one time but whether it's a someone who's doing something immoral in marriage or activities you know that are going on if if maybe it's something in the church that you may suspect you just can't go up to that person you may try to go up to that person i think the best thing to do first is pray and say god i i'm i'm i'm covering the situation god that if these people belong to you you don't want them doing that god i break the power of the enemy trying to bring them down and steal their identity and steal their destiny in jesus name that will be stopped that would be your first thing before you even sent the army to pray over them that that might be found out and stopped and the demonic stopped because i'm telling you it doesn't matter what it is what evil it is what evil act it is or or violence it's all promoted from hell every single bit of it is uh this earth would be a different place the new earth won't have hell or evil or wickedness on it would be a different place to live but while we're here you know the bible says we're in the army right everybody we are the army of god on the earth the army of heaven works with us it's that simple that's good okay when i first started hearing you talk about the hosts being on platforms and what you're right we're not going to exhaustively get any of these answers because you that's why you need people to take that uh spirit course uh thing but for those for quick study i it took me a long time and i'm still not sure i understand you know if someone is standing on a platform i get that here's a bunch of platforms of people standing but we don't have too much in real life where there's platforms built so why does the enemy need platforms to stand on why can't he fly through the air and do whatever he does what's the point of shredding a platform why do they even need a platform if he can kind of well the same thing i started with hell does not know everything that's going on at the same time they they don't have that ability they're not the the godhead they're not the father son or holy spirit they all three know everything that's going on no matter where it is at any time on the earth they know that they already know that now michael can give assignments to the army because groups of people pray michael will send them but michael still not us okay we are the sons and daughters of god we are joint heirs with jesus christ what he did we have the ability to do that army was designed and created at the time god made it was for us to command one day that's what we're supposed to do and therefore the way this whole thing operates like on the earth and even satan talked about it when satan showed those places to christ remember on the mountain of temptation where satan came because he didn't know who he was he was trying to find out if he was the messiah and all those crazy things he told him to do he said look at these beautiful places i have that was spiritual things he had built because when people sin and wickedness that's why there's some countries that have more wickedness and evil that no one's been taking authority over doing anything against the way they operate in the spirit realm is both sides are in this spiritual realm it's the original realm this physical realm that we're in right now was not the original realm the spirit realm was where everything lived and moved and did everything they had the ability because of people giving permission to satan to use them or because they're in such great sin they can build places around that person over their home there's places in the sky built like facilities built they're also on the earth they're built used by satan god has his own that are built because of the glory and because of us praying and so these battles are going on all the time but because of the days we're in that god has decided to have this time in the earth where we get to rule and reign with christ we ourselves will take authority send the army to pull down strongholds it says your weapons they are not physical they are not natural they are spiritual they are mighty to the pulling down the strongholds there is your scripture right there and so the army goes and pulls these down where do they pull them down from well number one they're around you if you're if you're in sin or if you're in lack or if you're in torment that means they're around you doing things that you can't see so your army number one will pull them away from you and throw them in a dry place the platforms are in hope like regions let's just say over mexico there were so many platforms because of the longevity of evil being there the demonic and these principalities and other beings of wickedness the more people sin that platform in the spirit i'm not talking about a physical platform it gets higher and higher they see more they control more are the mnemonic in these areas unless somebody there sends the host to shred the platform they go through them like buzz saws in the spirit and it's like dust they have nothing to stand on they fall back now they have to build them back up again as they get more uh permission from people to be evil to use wickedness and evil in the area so this is all what goes on in the spirit realm that we don't see unless you're a seer i send them all the time to shred platforms over dc uh over certain areas where things are going on and and i've seen them they go through like a bus on the oh really thingyman's who have spent generations building these high-level places they fall and all their ability to see and know falls with them so it transfers them from what they're doing so if let's just say like i'm in 20 i have 20 acres around me and let's say i have that 10 year old son or grandson or granddaughter and they've learned to send the host and maybe i don't see it a 10 year old can see generations of platforms that are built somewhere in my area and say i take power over all the power of the enemy i send the host out and i command them to shred the platforms over that 20 acres in the strength it'll be about like that well they could do that but you can even do it if you know if you know wickedness and evil is going on in certain areas another place that has a lot of high level platforms are in let's say las vegas would have a lot of dark activity there because of what it stands for because of what's going on there they have a lot whenever whenever i go i will send my army on purpose i'll see serpents wrapped around buildings in las vegas and stuff because they've been there for so long when i go on there i have my army wipe everything off the buildings they shred all the platforms but when i leave because i don't live there they'll start all over again trying to take control in the spirit through wickedness and evil and stuff like that but uh it's like a full-time assignment but if you understand in your area is the most important area to take authority over because we will create regions of light and glory which i was taken and shown on the earth the behold regions where there's no sin and no sickness because there's so much of god there because the people have been taking authority through christ to clean that stuff up that the devil won't want to come in those areas so there's a reason why why the army why not because of what is coming that god intends us to live in okay now let's say someone's got some uh falling away from the lord child a grandchild they know where they live and they send the host to shred the platforms around that child shred the platforms wherever that child maybe they're growing and have their own children by now can you shred the platforms around wherever that grown man or woman uh walks or moves or drives i'll command you to shred every platform that he or she comes in contact with today you can do that and that's why i sent them a lot to you when when college was in and uh i would teach friends how to do that if they had children who were attending universities for the first time and not having good reports going on i would tell them how to take authority over all the demonic that was operating in that university they their children were there so they had the right to do it your greatest ability and the power you have over the enemy is to fight on behalf of your family your family your close friends but when it's something community-wise or even city wise if you live in that area you have every right to pull down those strongholds whether it's violent crimes whether it's human trafficking whether it's drugs whether it's witchcraft whatever it is that the enemy has you yourself aren't facing those things you're sending the army to deal with it okay wow now someone sent me a question or a guy that came to me today they said when i speak into let's say they believe in host already or maybe you know is it possible that sometimes when i speak in tongues i'm sending the host well i don't know that that's actually what that prayer language is for i know you build yourself up in the holy spirit when you pray in tongues that doesn't mean there's necessarily something you're praying against you understand there's something you pray in tongues just it builds up your spirit man it builds you up and brings a closer relationship with christ but i have seen people and i have myself prayed against specific things this is before i even used the army i would come against specific things if i didn't know i knew something was happening didn't know what it was i would totally pray in tongues and say father i'm praying about the situation and i would just pray in tongues until i had a release that that was being dealt with tongues are very powerful the enemy cannot stand it when we pray in tongues you cannot stand it when you love people and you cannot stand up when you when you worship when you worship christ and so if you ever want to bless god just do one of those three things be kind to someone who's not being kind to you it pierces i am serious when you're kind to someone who's blessing you trashing you even online you just say i bless you that's why it says to bless your enemy don't curse and that's why it says that you literally send spears into the enemy who's causing that to happen you don't even know the warfare you have what happens in the warfare when you do these things but there's reasons why god puts it in the bible the point is this we represent heaven on this earth we're citizens of heaven we came from there we're supposed to be like christ we're not god but to be like him and live the way he lived and be powerful like he was powerful that's one of the reasons why he died on the cross he knew when you received him it's like him multiplying that power and authority in the earth that love and life in the earth and so the most important thing is what you're saying your your tongue you know the power of life and death is in your tongue so that means you say things that are right that are righteous that are powerful for god so commanding the army is one of the things that a powerful way is to use what you're saying to bring down forces of evil by sending the army what is the as we're wrapping up here what what is the area that you wish people would grasp uh more about sending the host or that's harder for them to grasp it's harder to get or what do you or what do you wish what do you what would you like to tell people the most that you haven't already said about the host today i will tell you what god said to me it's the way people will live and not die in these years coming really oh yes he absolutely said that to me he was very very i mean when when something really important that he once the father comes to me in person either comes in person and talks to me or he catches me up to heaven and talks to me uh that's how i learned about ask for grace for abundant life every day you get filled with fuel from heaven number one that starts your whole day if you get up and it's just you out there getting upset getting angry complaining oh let me tell you there's a new thing about do not complain that doesn't make the father happy you watch ourselves to make sure that we don't get into a spirit of complaining because that's not going to draw the life of god to you or to other people and uh a lot of people have a lot of things to complain about right now you give that to god don't complain you still that's why he said to celebrate he'd rather have you be celebrating in your life than complaining about everything that's not happening if you complain a lot it literally will hold back the blessings god has for you and again it's what's coming from here but what's in here in your soul is what's going to come out of here so i think the most important thing about the army is to make sure your soul is prospering uh before you start to command the army but literally this is what he said to me it will keep you alive the host will protect you they will keep you and all their all your ways you send them before you go anywhere in your car you say you're going to do traffic control there'll be no hold ups delays breakdowns or accidents i do that on every trip before i leave not just here but every city i will be in it's a way to keep you whole and it's a way well while i'm going now when i'm flying in that plane i don't just say protect me are you kidding i take authority over every demonic being in every airport controlling any person in every airport and i command those to pull those down away from those people so that they can be free i send stuff down from the plane into every city the glory of god the life of god you invade these cities this is how you rule this is how we're supposed to be i don't do this because i think it's a wonderful way to spend my time i do this because i have been asked to do it and i didn't say no but i'm very accountable for my life and no matter what people say about me out there i'm just going to forgive them all you know don't waste your words spend them for something that means something for god uh but if we were living a lifestyle it's called heaven culture you live on earth as they live in heaven they don't have to battle the enemy up there but if you want your life to run free and filled with hope and life that's why you take authority over the enemy every intercessor he told me would love this whole uh thing he's released in the earth about commanding the host that every intercessor i meet has no problem doing it and some people say well i tried a couple times it's not something you try it is something you do it's a lifestyle if you live your life for christ it's not your same old life and all you do say well i got jesus but you live like the devil that's not that's not really having christ if he's in you sitting on the throne of your heart and you're running after him to have his presence in your home if you want your home to be like heaven on earth it can be it can be that way but how much of god do you give your time to how much do you spend time with him do you ever even talk to him i'll look up at the father and i'll say i want to be just like you and i feel just showers of joy coming on me because he knows i mean i want to love like you i'm going to take authority over the enemy like you do i want to have vision and purpose in my life like you do i want to create new things in the earth like you do do you know he loves that instead of coming home all the time and saying i don't have this i need this why don't i have that why don't you speak to him about what you think about him he will show you his goodness your life can change in one day by making the decision to live your life in christ it says doesn't say that it says find yourself in him and live the way he lived on the earth he had to live on this physical earth he made decisions himself but his hope was to change every life he met and offer them things you don't have to force people to take it but if they don't even know there's hope his name is jesus christ how are they going to know so good so so so good cat thank you so much hey tell people we we've got on the screen it says revealing heaven.com tell them about what's there and then tell them about your other website too if you would yeah revealingheaven.com is my this might got my store on there it talks about events which we will be adding events so

to me if you want to be a guardian we have the guardian zone for people who give on a continual basis we develop a relationship through different ways i i do pray for all our guardians um so but that's katper.com click on the treasury i also will say what steve said i never email you i will never send you a comment i don't have a facebook out there where i ask for money not even to give to other people as he said those are criminals there's a lot of new criminal cyber criminal activity out there where they'll try to steal either your identity or they'll make you think that you're some there's somebody you're that they're not and they'll ask for money for all kinds of things don't give those people money those are criminals i don't do that okay all the stuff i offer like today is

represent heaven and the earth and of course we'll have spirit force which i can't charge for that either it's a mentoring it's a way to mentor you it's almost like heaven's army boot camp kind of a thing with strategic detailed understanding but not hard to accept usually if i speak to you it's like a child because god talks to me like i'm eight years old that's why i don't have a lot of big words and anything that i say your horse will be powerful it will be exciting but it will be fun and i'm telling you it will be worth waiting for it will help any christian in this world will be able to sign up for it most of it will be online i will do some tours eventually where i actually do spirit a spirit force like a camp or something or uh or like a mentoring series as i travel that will be coming too but it's what the father wants he wants the body of christ to know what it means to be in the army of heaven and you know every weapon you have and how to use it against the darkness

forgotten i've seen that and i forgot about it until paul just mentioned it so uh wow so good to talk to you you're looking very red white and blue today i've got my red white and blue tie on so about that that was holy ghost oh yeah that happens a lot with you and me we often wear the same colors and yeah pretty fascinating that was like my siblings you know if you have a sibling that you see a lot that happens a lot so that's probably it and i want to let you know that there's no way i could pos i usually forget my birthday because i am so busy i forget all holidays including my birthday no not this year not this year i have had to look at over 500 birthday cards here's one right here wow that's a lot of birthday cards woohoo look at that it is crazy you know um i'm and i'm gonna have a special broadcast tomorrow on my birthday um just to celebrate with everybody probably have a piece of cake and thank all those because there's no way we can send you know we send thank you cards for people who send a gift but for the birthday cards that's not going to happen so we're having a special broadcast just for my birthday tomorrow and uh we will all celebrate together and god is helping me to celebrate all the time so he really wants me to celebrate especially this year because of the greatness of this year and so thank you for wishing me happy birthday awesome well good and happy birthday again and again and devil blessings to you so tell us about um anything you have to say about current events and then i know after you're done uh you said you have something personal that's the personal thing that you just shared is that right yeah that was it that was my little bit of personal life going on right now is the birthday thing which is consuming everybody well you're a party girl you know you are always setting your party i mean that's literally you used to have a catering business right and you would then set up these things for other people yeah right we used to do big events for our church for our 4 000 member church i was head of hospitality and you know i wasn't that kind of a person at the time i don't like to i don't mind cooking so much really but not not on a continual basis so um i cooked i bought food cooked set up for big parties all kinds of events at our church for five years and god said i'm gonna put you on hospitality in new life so i'm making ahead of it and i went wow it was huge it was huge but i had so much fun doing that so i did learn a lot from that so i guess he was getting me ready for this time to i wasn't always known for celebration maybe fierceness against the darkness would be the number one thing uh and loving people but now i can end on my my biography you know head of hospitality for heaven there you go well yeah i mean you you are there if you if you were more serious back in the day i could see how god used that because you're the one that's always shouting woo hoo you know that wasn't the old you you're saying right you weren't you weren't like that in your early prophetic days no it's starting in in 2015 when the whole first round of elections came he began to change me to be a person of fun and celebration so that was a big curve for me to do that and uh and then even now he's kind of doing another positioning to be head of spirit force which is a commander um so we're going to have a good mix of me in these next two decades probably of doing things i haven't done before good good good well anything do you have anything to say before we go into questions about uh current events oh um no i want to talk about current events right now yeah yeah yeah well if you haven't been paying attention i hope you're all watching flashpoint you know on the victory channel or hank kuniman at lord of host ministries and there's several others there's actually robin bullock and um i could just go on this list you know then you get yourself in trouble because you don't remember somebody johnny and love there's so many other people out there talking about what's going on right now in our country and i can tell you it's looking not good for the left and i always have to bring up the things they never will tell you okay on the fake news and that is this they're losing in so many ways which god had me say that you know several weeks ago they were going to start losing all losing in all of their efforts to do things the border control is beginning to change and actually there was a whole plane full that they've been trying to send them in illegally and according to our constitution illegally many different ways a whole plane full of them arrived at an airport and they were totally rejected and they were told by the governor i'm trying to remember i don't want to get in trouble with it but you probably could find that out if you look on there uh or uh maybe right side news or newsmax probably has something about that i happen to know a whole plane of illegal immigrants probably some of them criminals because you know that's what they've been doing to us we're totally sent back where they came from and they told the airport uh if you have an issue with that tell them the governor said we're not taking them okay they're coming in illegally they have no identification they have no papers filled out we're not taking any of them so send them back so that was a fail that was a fail for the left to try to bring them in that way because right now they really are uh probably even in the secular arena beefing up security along some of the borders because the people behind the barbed wire won't take accountability for that whole thing they open up and so that failed another thing that's failed is this whole thing about you know abortion at birth which is insanity and let me tell you what god is not happy about that at all they've also had a whole fail with that thing another fail i wish i had a fail button i'd be hitting it right now but in texas they passed a law that from the time you hear the heart beat there will be no abortions no abortions will be allowed so guess what yay state of texas there's another plus one awesome go texas man and this this is one more thing i gotta share this is very awesome you all know about uh you know newsom who's a nuisance right in california california governor is just now being told he has to pay 1.35 million dollars for the uh law fees for the i think it's the harvest church there who sued him yeah so what guess what newsome lost again they lost it's another fail for them they have set a precedent in the court that that will not be allowed anywhere anymore shut down church services because they're relating it to the virus and that is actually a president in court i used to work in law for eight and a half years i was uh i worked for a lawyer and so i learned a lot about that and when they set a precedent it's really hard to break that precedent so anyone who does that in any state now is going to be in a lot of trouble uh with the with the court since they said this is a precedent we're not bringing any more cases like this nobody will be allowed to do this anymore so there you go there's three fails for the left right there wow so good so good you know you know yeah and we you know this is a whole new era that we're entering into you've said this is the kingdom uh era or the kingdom what did you call it the kingdom kingdom i showed you that started around 2012 right that's right yes you know and obama was still in office and he had to go stand in the middle of the country what's what's your take on that why why did the lord say the kingdom age starts now and obama's in there doing all this obama abomination no god likes to come in the midst of dartmouth spewing itself and he brings a great light that shatters the hopes of darkness now you need to understand we have hopes in our own lives that don't you know christ has a hope right christ in you is the hope of glory so there's hope on every era every area and every um in every realm is the best way to say it so even in the spirit realm the devil hopes to take over now he's hoping to use the darkness he is positioned everywhere in the world it's going to fail it will still fail so badly for them it's going to be a great loss for hell all this whole thing that they've tried or attempted to do to take over not just america but this world it isn't hell's time okay and so they're going to be shown a great defeat and so they will lose all the hopes they've ever had of doing that nothing will happen uh of significance or hell until the tribulation comes and that's a long ways away and so god is going to have his way in this time so even back in the day when darkness was still in the white house at that point god brought a great light and that was the time he chose we stepped off of a spiritual uh ledge or edge into a whole new time called the kingdom age and we started a whole new age and part of that age is the season we're going into now i know you hear a lot of pastors and evangelists talking about reformation that means change that's what that means that means you're going to reform and make things better and start something that'll be great for god that's going to be part of all of this but god really is setting us up to see very clearly what happens when evil tries to take over and i'm still going to use the word try because they haven't won right won't win so god started it then in 2012 really and in 2014 was when he sent the army of heaven for us to command you can see god has his plan he's working right and then in 2016 he puts trump in to start this four years of us changing america the heart of america and so much was poured into the people to see greatness and taste it and know that life can be great and god you know trump always included god in everything he did so he allowed god to come back into our country that hasn't been wiped out because when somebody illegal steps in and tries to do things that are illegal that doesn't wipe out what god has done so god has started setting us up in 2012 to be prepared for these days it'll be some of the greatest days on the earth so we need to celebrate understanding and knowing that you're manifesting and speaking things that are not as though they already were and that's what we do every time we celebrate you're telling the devil i'm not afraid of you i'm not accepting your plans i know what god has a great times for all of us in these days for for the spirit of god for his son and for the father these are great days that's what they're saying in heaven and so we're about to have a big taste of heaven on this earth so so so good such good news yeah the news just gets better and better i i was open i don't i don't watch the news anymore i just don't watch it this is someone like me people knew me for the last all my married life i've been married 43 years news every day not now i mean i see a couple headlines throughout the day on the internet but i my soul is so much happier these days because happier when you don't let the darkness and the fear get in you know um and you know the thing is they know that they're messing they know the left knows they're messing with your soul they already know if they can get it in you you'll begin to believe it so people beginning to drop all of that fake news and the doom and gloom and the lies your soul will actually begin to prosper just because you've done that i'm not saying to be ignorant you be innocent of it don't be ignorant we know the enemy's trying to do things always come against him always tell hell i'm not accepting what you're saying i won't take your plans i take god plans i serve the most high god of heaven and earth and we're going to see great things happen in our own soul even throughout this times that's why the celebration is going to be so powerful that sounds so good well for anyone new cat's been to having thousands of times over the last 20 25 years and so we ask her every wednesday a series of questions and questions about heaven jen says you had a girl a little girl right in i think it was i don't know how old she was and you had some questions from her that you wanted to address yeah look at a cute little this is her cute little stationary can you see it look at it what's her name by the way danielle or daniela my name is daniella and she's 10 years old and i think we should have at least one question from a child steve every single wednesday because they have the best questions okay yeah we'll do that so she asked three i'm going to put them all into one this is all about heaven she wants to know if unicorns are in heaven she wants to know if there are pink ones i love this question and she wants to know if heaven has beaches and so daniela you're going to be so excited to find out that creatures what we would call animals here on earth are called creatures in heaven are every color in the rainbow you will be amazed i literally have seen unicorns in heaven and if you get an old bible the king james bible they're mentioned nine times the unicorn god even talks about his own unicorn in the bible i think psalms 29 is one of them i'm trying to remember the other ones but i know for sure i think probably psalm 29 but if you get a king james version and you search for unicorns in the king james version you'll see nine times he's mentioned it and so they are in heaven they definitely have pink ones in heaven and there's a whole area in heaven that has beaches for people to surf on to play in uh it's a beautiful place it's called the wipeout surf park they have parts in heaven amusement parks but this one is literally made for people who love the beach now just so you have a heads up there will be no bikinis present people not about getting sun on your flush it's you and your spiritual body enjoying the water you can swim under the water breathe it you can surf hundred foot waves and you might fall off a couple times but you won't get hurt that's good yeah and we and for the parents that want their children to to write in questions we do tend to get those and if they come in if it hasn't been asked before we try to get new questions uh then we'll try to to put those to the top we just do a couple each week so really good one really good one what did i want to there was something i was going to ask you uh oh it'll come back to me there was something i was going to ask you okay so are you ready for my question now this one is mine yes i had doreen's permission my wife is dream i had permission to ask this one and this is a question not specifically about her situation but about what this would be like when it happened so when she was six about 60 years ago uh give or take a year she and her two brothers were in the back seat of the car a couple days short of christmas her mom and dad were driving they had a sudden head-on nobody saw it coming and her parents were instantly killed and so that was that she was six years old her aunt and uncle adopted her so and uncle have always raised her his mom and their mom and dad my question is and our question is what is that like in a situation like that mom and dad are there suddenly they're not there do they come to themselves do angels come and pick them up at the same time and take them together do their own angels take them separately because they're two individuals do they look at each other and say what just happened do they say where are the kids tell me what would happen in a situation like that well any time a believer passes um at the moment that happens and they're not in their physical body will go from there okay they've stopped breathing there's no life their spiritual body has stepped outside of their own body of course they will see each other because they're both now in their spiritual bodies they'll number one they'll be young they'll have no pain uh the trauma of what just happened will not affect them and i know that sounds wild to people but you're not in your natural mind or in your flesh so your flesh won't respond in that situation the joy the lord would begin to pour over them even a situation they can see that their children are there and the holy spirit has probably already told them it's going to be okay for them they'll be raised in a godly home they're going to be loved so they would already have said that the moment they stepped out of their spiritual body you begin to get revelation either from jesus who's present or your angels who you will see for the first time and of course you would go together with both your angels taking each of you so you'd have that journey from here all the way to heaven you'd still be together there's no fear there's no concerns like what's gonna happen now or are kids gonna be alone um that's already put in you begins to fill you with waves of love and and celebration and the father might start speaking to them in their spirit uh or their angels like i said saying it's going to be okay your you know your children are going to be okay uh your mansions are ready we're going to escort you home to heaven that kind of thing is exactly what would happen and of course from that time their parents would still be able to be able to declare over their lives as they're growing up and uh probably send blessings to them as they're growing up jesus would bring them blessings probably from the parents in heaven and so that's exactly what happens what doesn't happen is doom and gloom fear agony and suffering like mental or emotional suffering because that accident happened if they don't die and they're injured and it's not good maybe that would be a whole different story but the fact that they left and i will say this sometimes and i've seen uh in a situation where it actually happened right before the moment of impact their angel will actually come and grab their spiritual body out really is that true i you know there was a movie that is they will sometimes do that but not all the time is that what you're saying yeah for whatever reason and i don't know why if it's just uh whatever their angel has decided at that moment knowing that they won't live or survive it um i actually got to speak to somebody i don't remember what state it was but somebody came up and asked me a question after the meeting saying our son had the most horrific accident and it was horrible what happened to him did he feel any of that and the holy spirit said no his angels took him out took his spiritual body out and just took him right to heaven because they didn't want him to have the impact of that torment on him so they just grabbed him on up out of the vehicle before the head-on happened he never felt a thing well so even though moments later he would be torment-free anyway they didn't want him to experience even a moment of torment even a second of torment well i'm sure the father had told them just get him i'm sure the father for whatever reasons that take him before the impact happens so many times people don't realize they didn't they they were just taken they were just taken that's really good now kat you said before uh a number of times that um when you're mentioning heaven is done you're going home so that's the only other question i want to ask about this kind of a situation like for dreams parents is it likely that their parents mansions were done and so was time did the lord see ahead of time that this accident would happen so he started building they started building the mansion how does that work were there mansions ready for them having been pre-built before this accident i'm sure that i do know this from the moment you're sent from the moment he sends the father sends that little spirit of life that's your little spiritual body at the time of conception he sends it and the hand of the holy spirit and the holy spirit comes in the in the mother's womb and knits and attaches that little spirit to that dot of flesh that's being formed and at that moment life begins in the womb it's not when the baby's born it's when that happens when he said i knit you together in your mother's womb that's what he knit together that was your spiritual little being to that god of flesh and from that time they start working on your mansion okay let's start building it the father himself knows the very day you will come home however that happens he knows when you're going to come home most likely they probably timed it for the time when they knew that that would when they knew that that would happen they probably had their individual mansions probably right next to each other already ready for them now when children pass that's different uh they live with grandparents already in heaven or great-grandparents in heaven they usually will well raise up those children until their parents get there but for whatever reason god had already had a plan of who would raise them because he he knew that they would be great in the kingdom doreen certainly is great in the kingdom and was going to have a powerful call in her life to be married to you and so god had pre-planned that part of the lives so i do know that's what happens many times when there's really even no reason for someone passing their mansion is done in heaven for whatever reason and i don't know all of them sometimes you have a special reward that will start something new in heaven and he has given to you that person you pass a reward and that's why they go to heaven and their mansion will be done okay wow that's good stuff um that did create a new question for me you mentioned the children who are raised by their grandparents is there a time in heaven this seems like because we think a child grows up leaves mother and father and cleaves to a wife or if you go to heaven you have your own mansion so if you're raised by your grandparents in heaven is there a day in the future where you say time for me to move out and have my own mansion seems like you would do that oh oh you mean children being raised yeah the children grow up yeah then they grow up and then it's time to have their own mansion one day well that will depend on a lot of things oh wow if the child is young or let's just say it's a baby it still eventually will get its own mansion everyone comes home as the father son or daughter no matter what their natural age was on the earth but most of the time the mothers want to raise their children and if they want to raise their children in heaven then they will keep that child young sometimes the very age they were when they left the earth like the little boy uh who was playing and i think he got hit by a car on the street is i think he was seven i couldn't remember the name of the people now they were people who traveled and spoke and he was so he died at age seven and went to heaven twenty years later his mother died on the operating table she was taken to heaven she saw her seven-year-old son playing in the streets of gold and she ran up to him and hugged him because she was in her spiritual body and she said oh you're here you look so good we've been doing and he literally turned this is his mother's report that i'm given he turned to his mom he said i've been playing with my friend's mom so to him pass by on the earth but he was the same age and he said mom you can't stay you're not done with your life she went back to the earth and for years her and her husband traveled around the world talking about that incident that god had kept her son the same age he was he didn't get any older 20 years had passed so when she got to heaven and she's there now she will get to finish raising him in heaven but eventually he gets to a timeless age he will have his own mansion probably near where his parents mansions are and so god has a good plan for all of us some people see their children as babies if they see them as babies they'll be babies when they get there sometimes people see their child as like a young teenager or something like that when they get to heaven that's the age they'll be now we had we raised three children are all grown and married now but doreen had a a miscarriage early on before our youngest was born and we don't know if it was he or she so we've named we've given it a name that works for both boys we don't know what it is so we gave it a one of those names that works both ways and so now we go dreamland is going to be with the lord one day at different times probably um we're gonna raise this child it would seem like so who's raising it we got we're in two different houses how does that work you'll be right next door to each other your mansions will probably your properties will probably be very next to each other you know people still do things as as as family groups they remember who their parents are and whole families do things they tour all over heaven there's other places to stay beside your mansion that are in heaven i wouldn't call them hotels or condos or chalets in the mountains and people do it's not vacation it's your whole life and so they do many things together i've even seen some mansions that i would haul the only way i can describe what they look like and then picture people people picture them there's some mansions where the families were so close that there's this massive piece of property where all the properties join but they have a way where they walk down the hallways and all come to an area where they're all together they can eat together celebrate have have events together and so sometimes it's like that if a family was really close but no one's gonna feel alone and uh they'll spend time with the the one who was their dad with their mom and sometimes they'll go on groups together and do things together picnics together people love picnics in heaven that the ants are invited but they eat their own food oh that's good that's good all right let's go through some more questions i'm looking at the time by the way give me a second i realized i didn't plug my computer in and so i'm now going to do that or we're gonna have a problem in a few minutes so give me a second folks pardon me and you know what i did i realized that i'm supposed to be hardwired oh come on steve you can do it from this angle i do actually have two different cords to plug in one is the hardwire that i thought it was oh okay just here sorry about that okay um here's the question has cats seen what is happening in the heavenlies concerning israel right now does god show you any of that kind of stuff or is he keeping you on more personal stuff oh he has been totally talking to me about israel and uh you know um whether people like it or not he's still causing his chosen people we are all chosen right we're chosen one of the chosen people those who've accepted jesus christ as their savior and let me tell you the jewish race they were the first ones on the earth who represented there was a god of heaven and earth and so god honors them for that there's a lot of other stuff involved with that but i can tell you he still loves israel and i knew that netanyahu would not be leaving because god kept saying i'm not done with him yet and just because the illegitimates are in the white house here is not going to interfere with the fact that he's going to protect and keep israel and he reminded me god reminded me what he had said several years ago to me every time they attacked israel i will expand them and so all they're doing when they do that is setting israel up for expansion to take back more and more territory that is theirs god said it will prosper them even more and he said i will repair what has been broken and he said these are my my people and i'm not going to abandon them and he said i'm also not done how about this one i'll have this one he said i'm not done with netanyahu and trump's relationship let's just throw that out there for free okay there you go said that to me just a couple days ago so he's been talking to me i have sent probably i don't know 100 million of the hosts over there to israel to pull down strongholds of satan coming against him to tear down the words that were spoken against them he's i he asked me to do that so i did and i know you think that sounds weird that he asked me to send them but that army is an army of heaven that i command according to what jesus christ said and so i sent them and they do all kinds of things to intervene i remember when they had the desert um the desert war and windstorms would come up and hide them they would keep the enemy over there from attacking israel all kinds of things god does supernaturally to protect them so all i can say is this watch for israel to expand and watch for for trump and netanyahu's relationship to continue because god has plans so good so good and there's a lot of prophetic right in that because you just prophesied a couple of other things like see you soon mr trump yeah okay uh let's see um this there's a bunch of talk on the news about aliens i've heard you talk about aliens we've actually recorded a show with robin that airs monday and he talks about what people are claiming supposedly about innings it's all in the news they keep putting it up there they want people to believe that aliens are getting more and more and more busy so what tell me what tell me the truth about aliens i'll tell you what god has said there's nothing that wasn't made or created except it came from him right and this is his answer to people god said to me i didn't make a race of people or a race of beings and then abandon them on other planets there are no aliens there you go from god himself there are spiritual beings people and sometimes they can appear sometimes they may not appear uh they can even if it's on hell's side they can mock all kinds of things and there was somebody who said they went were taken to the rings of saturn this is a known person they were taken to the rings of saturn and they met aliens who gave them higher enlightenment than what even god had and that person ended up by rejecting jesus christ and what it was it was actually uh it was the religion of demons is what it ended up by being those were humans disguised as aliens but when you say yes to something you are totally can be deceived and sucked in so they came and invited him to go with them this actually was an encounter so this is the thing people have encounters and you can't talk them out of that encounter you can't tell them it never happened you can't tell them they didn't see anything because they had an encounter but was that encounter from god or was that encounter from hell and was it from the from from the darkness most of the time things like that concerning aliens and attacks and doom and gloom that's all about hell's plans to use another way to deceive people to get them to believe stuff there is no other third choice when you die there's no third place you can go and build your own place and rule an absolute freedom and have power in the cosmos there's god in heaven or there's satan and hell and that's the whole thing about the aliens they're wanting people to believe this is the devil want people to believe there's a third source you know the gods of the egyptians the gods of the minds all these things all of there's only one true god there's one true trinity and then there is the devil and all of his deception so there are no aliens i know of no alien robots which doesn't even make sense okay if it's a robot created by a million people that's not an alien so they don't even know what they're saying when they talk about those things anything that brings fear or destruction into the mind of somebody the devil uses fear first if you can't use fear he'll use deception so be very aware of what's coming up and talking to you make sure you test every spirit that appears to you and ask them are they of the spirit of the most high god who sent his son to die for the sins of this world that's what the bible says to ask it so i know of no aliens and all the places i've been out in the cosmos in the spirit realm uh for so many times probably thousands of times never seen an alien people there's either the the darkness and evil and hell or there's heaven and god and all of his angels and you need to understand that melchizedek has flesh on him people he's ahead of a whole tribe of angels that have flesh not that they're going to appear as aliens right so any attempt by people governments movements religions whatever to make you believe there's there are aliens is one of those things i've listed they're all attempts to draw you away from the one true god jesus christ is that right either that or make a lot of money yeah yeah or boy they want to prove that there's alien crashes in these certain places you pay money to fly over the sites of the alien crashes they'll even say we got alien body parts how do they know if there's so many parts but people will go like crazy i know roswell new mexico i've been there i spoke there one time they have an alien or a martian on every business is to make money okay even the mcdonald's has a spaceship that looks like it's crashed on the mcdonald's and they have people go there and tours they'll stay for weeks trying to find where the aliens are out in the desert so they're not gonna find them well whatever i try to take to make a bug um jeff is is your sound i think can you people turn your sound down a little bit it's feeding back i think i don't know people will hear that but okay uh uh please ask cat what our spirits do while we are sleeping at night do we go on assignments or communion with jesus or what happens with our spirits are we all on 24 hours a day or do some people really just sleep and other people are on duty well i i can just i'll always go back to what i was told by the father by jesus by holy spirit yours your man your being was made wonderfully and perfectly you have a physical being you have a spiritual being in your spirit body inside that is your soul while you are sleeping sometimes your soul is made in layers i've explained this before i'm gonna have my um my artist design like a model that i can pick up and hold in my hand and show you how your how your soul is made then you'll understand so easily how god does this the holy spirit himself is in unlimited layers of himself when you invite the holy spirit to indwell you he'll take a layer of himself and send it into you is still a hole with him but it's a layer and so that's the way your soul is made sometimes when people are sleeping jesus will take a layer of your soul you gave yourself to him right so he has the right to do that and you'll send that layer that looks just like you to a foreign country to preach it's happened many times and when you're done preaching he'll get it and put it back inside of you while you're sleeping you may dream that happened but if you go somewhere and people say thank you so much for coming to our country for bringing the truth for praying for healing and they can't get it that they'll say well i wasn't there but they probably were while they were sleeping so that's how that operates your soul has many layers those layers are images of you i always tell people let's say this is your will your will is very solid it runs down into the very up and down inside the core of your of your soul and off of it come these layers like if you took a book and put the covers back to back every one of those pages would be an image of you this is how he made you and when you get born again you give yourself to jesus he takes a layer of you that soul of your soul and seats it in heavenly places so if there is a it does kind of describe it in the bible he uses your layers of you which is a real you and when he takes it out it manifests as a physical thing can share the gospel can intervene on somebody's life it's just what what he can do sometimes it'll take messages to people and people go you came to me and brought me a message that's how that whole thing operates that's why we're so supernaturally made by god so if you belong to jesus get ready for all kinds of things to happen because i think at one point you'll know that he's doing that it may not be right now but i keep telling people the spiritual veil from the spirit around the physical realm is getting thinner and thinner until we step into a time where we will see angels with us all the time and they may bring messages and we'll see them bringing messages and so we're going closer to that right now we're not going closer to hell in this time we're going closer to god and knowing him you know when you you're teaching what god showed you about the holy spirit putting a whole entire life layer of himself the holy spirit doing that that was kind of like a life changer because i had always seen you know i was raised to believe the holy spirit would use the word the rather than his name holy spirit holy spirit like this almost uh nebulous gaseous force like star wars but then when you said he puts an entire layer of himself in you and john wimber used to teach about when you when you pray or when you seek the holy spirit dial down don't dial up dial down i put that with that teaching and then when i talk to the holy spirit i don't know if this works for you but it kind of works for me if i if he now if i now understand that the entirety of him lives in me that i'm saying holy spirit and i'm seeing him right here now of course i'm not god we're not god but he lives in us so how do you see the holy spirit when you're talking to him do you see him hear do you see it where do you see him in your mind well because uh holy spirit is unlimited layers of himself people go how can holy spirit know where everything is at all times no matter where it is it's because of who he is he is in unlimited layers of himself it's him and that's why you are the temple of the holy spirit or the dwelling place of the holy spirit this but the bible says when you invite him he comes into you he's living there all the time he also still has a base of operations in heaven he has a new one on the earth when jesus said there's one coming after me that was holy spirit who'll walk along beside you who will guide you and who will comfort you and he'll share things unknown things with you that was when jesus went home to heaven holy spirit literally came and now has a base of operations here on the earth and that would be in every one of us that's where space of operations is where okay and he's there you can talk to him like i'm talking to you right now you can just say holy spirit i need to know this i need to know where this place is or holy spirit i can't find i've lost my keys can you please help me find them he's there to help you show me more of god can you give me light on this scripture he's there all the time waiting for you to ask for help that's why he's there so when i see him literally that's the only way i can describe him i see him as a whirlwind of fire i see him as a whirlwind of the rainbow of god i see the outline of his being like you see you know when they want to show an invisible man they show you the outline of him i'll see his being and i'll see a fire outlining this whole uh his whole body he's still got a body just because you can't see it he's got a heavy eyes and uh so he's there but when you invite him that's why the the devil doesn't want you to do that because it brings power into you because here's a member of the trinity moving in you now you've got two of them people when you receive jesus christ he comes to live in you that's what it says he comes to abide in you and so i hear jesus talking a lot here holy spirit the more sensitive you are to listening to hear them but you need to say something to them if you're wanting a friendship with somebody you don't ignore them then all of a sudden well i'll go visit them once a year i'll say hi on the phone if you're in relationship you speak to them whether you see them or not you're speaking they hear you well you know jesus and this was the revelation of the father and the spirit i guess all of the above all the trinity he goes you have not because you ask not and then when you do ask you has to spend it on your left so you don't get that right but the the personality and the temperament of the godhead is they could constantly pour out and they probably do but there's a whole bunch they don't give you unless you ask right they're saying i i there's so much more i can give you but you're not asking for it is that right that's right i was going yeah say have you seen any um i don't even know how to ask the question but have you seen the results of someone finally getting hold of asking god where they never asked him it's like god saying finally you're asking me yeah yeah actually that happened to me one time when i was younger i think it was about 19 and um had just picked out some in the mirroring that some people some people know if they listen all the time my 500 hours that are out there i didn't put those hours out there everybody take me and i didn't even know it but at one time i got married not to the right person i just picked someone out thought well i'll go travel and have a good time i wasn't in love i didn't ask god is that weird uh so finally six years later of being tormented i said to god this is what i said to him and i said so what do i do i'd rather be alone god i made a mistake i'm repenting and say what do i do and this is what he said to me so now you ask me that was the father that was the father of god but now you're sort of like hilarious and sad all in the same thing it was because i didn't have to put up with this six years of torment make sure you're marrying the right person people and so god this is what god said i might as well add the rest he said you're ending the contract how about that that was his next thing you're gonna end that contract my word says what i have god has joined together let not man put asunder and god said there's too many people putting themselves together with never asking never seeking me and he said that's not going to turn out well sometimes so he told me you will go repent to the person that you married repent for marrying them repent for telling them that you love them i didn't i never even knew what love was and i repented to them and god forgave me that sin the person forgave me but they they they didn't want me anymore so we we ended that relationship we went to court had it ended and then i said to god i don't know if i want anybody and he said you're not going to get away with that i have somebody i picked for you from the beginning and then i met my husband i've been married to 43 years now this would be year 44. it's a lot different being married to someone that you actually number one you love them okay when there's love there there's something to bring you together there's the bonds of matrimony that's why it's important to get married people don't live together don't do that and and young girls don't fall for something saying well it'll be good it'll be like being married or not if we don't work out we can just leave that is not god's plan he wants you to be bound together you make a soul tie with that person god brings you when you get married it makes all of the physical activities okay you can look it up in the bible and find out what i'm talking about um but my life changed when i married the one god found for me and he actually said you'll have three daughters years apart i need holy seed brought from heaven to earth so don't discount that doesn't mean your marriage is going to be perfect that means you're going to work at it you're going to pray you're going to have time you spend together praying as husband and wife and even though you've been married for years please make sure you still take a date and have a date with each other yeah that's right that's good that's good so i i'm hearing people men and women saying i just heard you say it's not good for men to be alone god's gonna god has the right person for me because he had the right person for cat and i'm hearing people say i've been praying for 20 years 30 years and i can't find this me what would you tell them to do to somehow get in touch with god on what what's wrong or to ask god what should they ask god i guess i think number one um i wouldn't sit there and do nothing of course i would be about the business that god gave you to do for him whatever it was he asked you personally to do for him i make sure that your priorities were definitely in order in your own life like just how are you treating everyday people how are you how are you treating people uh is jesus your number one because i know i've heard people say and yes god does say it's good to be married it's what he planned for you to not go through your life alone uh i would say this say god i am ready for my spouse and now i'm going to trust you to bring him and i will know that they are the right person and when people say something so simple you don't need to fast and pray for weeks or really cry cry cry because you can make that itself into a burden that your soul will be begin to hurt or begin to even almost mourn for somebody to come don't start running around looking everywhere though i definitely wouldn't go into every single place and just because someone's nice to you that means you make sure number one the person you're looking at make sure they're not married to someone else that's not going to be god he's not going to give you someone who's already married to somebody else so some people get desperate enough well they were happy and they made me feel good and i was hurt and broken and they came made me feel better none of those say it's god i can just say sincerely say to him i'm ready for the one you prepared for me and i'm gonna start saying god's bringing me the right person instead of saying god one of you ever going to bring me the right person it may be your only own words what you are saying yourself keeping them from you so you don't have to start looking maybe there's something wrong with me i can't fix it what what is it can i fix start just saying god i'm trusting you i know you're bringing them i'm excited that you're bringing them that will do more for them to come than you say it looks like i'll never have anyone and every time you see somebody happy you're sad make sure your soul is in the right place for you to have that permanent relationship with somebody and then begin to celebrate that god is bringing somebody to you and uh i can tell you this that marriage is marriage marriage is a good thing and it even says in the bible that if you find somebody you love them and they're a great person now and you marry them and they're not even a christian yet god said that will sanctify that person in that marriage and that you pray for their salvation i would certainly look for somebody who was born again if at all possible i would maybe even ask for god to bring somebody who would not be opposite of what he has for your life because i've seen marriages either make the person and be a part of their destiny or be the opposite and i tell a lot of people be happy with jesus so much so that he's going to have to bring them and show you and say this is the person because you're spending so much time with jesus that would also be a clue make yourself uh be in love with jesus christ first and then he'll probably bring that person and say you know this is the right person for you that's good that's good that's going to help a bunch of people watching okay i'm going to put two questions into one because these are they're they're not the same question but they're related they're saying what does cat see happen uh when with when communion is taken uh do you see things happening in the spiritual realm that is more powerful and what does she see happen when when people speak in tongues does she see something happen that's different give me any anything on those well i i'll start with the speaking in tongues which is one of the most powerful things that happened to me uh besides becoming a believer i received my um evidence of speaking in tongues when i was 18. and i was at a crusade a youth crusade and it was just a wave of holy spirit coming in i said yes i invited him and he he came in i started speaking in tongues so a long time ago i felt the power of god come in me i saw heaven open and actually yes it was like fire coming down out of heaven that was holy spirit he manifests either his images of fire i already said that like uh waves of the glory and the rainbow of god uh and there's always an experience that you have when he moves into you and i felt him come and saw him come inside of me but just watching and meeting seeing people receive him i actually see in the spirit tongues of fire coming upon the people right before they start speaking in tongues so i still see that happening what manifested in the natural way back in the day the book of acts i still see those manifestations happen in meetings like whirlwinds i hear the sound of whirlwinds i see flames of fire on people and so that is a powerful powerful thing is something that god wants us to have and and operate in what that gives you it brings power there's no other way power and boldness in your life so make sure you're pursuing that the other thing which i already forgot what the first question was yeah the community what do you see happening within communion first i'll tell you what god thinks about that uh i remember being i used to pray for our pastors like behind the scenes on the platform like behind where the big screens were and um someone came up and they were serving communion and they was like it was wonderful and they were serving and everything and all of a sudden i hear god yell i heard him audibly and he said this is a holy thing and he said it three times this is a holy thing this represents the sacrifice of my son this represents the blood that was poured out over you this is abiding in him when you do this this is a holy thing and i wanted to be holy and i mean three times i heard him yell that like i was shaking on the back of the platform so i write all this down and take it to our my pastor and say pastor this is what the father is saying that we need to take this is a powerful serious thing god looks and watches to see who is taking it out of the gladness of their heart remember it says in the bible to make sure that your heart is in the right place before you even take communion that does represent his body that was beaten in the blood that was viewed for you it brings wholeness in your body in your mind and even in your soul when you take communion it also wipes away things that the enemy has left on you maybe uh maybe oppression or something when you take communion it's like this glory comes from heaven and wipes and goes right through you when you take that and so i wrote all this down and gave it to him and the next week i think it was the next week or sometime in the next month somebody came forward and started speaking and all of a sudden they almost fell out and when they came back up they said go get the communion we have to take communion and they said god wants this to be adjusting and then he starts yelling it is holy exactly what god said to me thank god i'm yelling it is holy it is holy it is holy and i tell you the holy spirit fell on everybody in that meeting and people began to weep and repent for taking it as a light thing and many miracles happen in that service so it is a holy thing and i will tell people when you move to a new property whether it's been used or brand new you need to go outside and take communion and pour part of it on the land and say i claim this land for the kingdom and i declare that anything on it that was done not right is wiped off of this property and you if you could see you would see the fire of heaven come down and go over the whole property or inside the house and wipe out anything the enemy had left as a residue from somebody who lived there communion is a powerful statement saying you're accepting the sacrifice of christ the love of christ the redemption of christ and the power that's in that blood so that was a good question i'm not going to add a question to that that's our time and i don't want to add anything on top of that because i want that to be the parting one even in my own so you know i've been taking communion every day and dream will remind me because she sets it out for me we take it on our own time yeah we've been doing that for about 10 years i think almost every day and i really feel like probably we're alive because we're doing that because i think you know i we both had some close calls with death during that time but i just feel like you know so well well can tell people how they can get a hold of your site you see we have on the screen that says revealingheaven.com what what can they get at both of your

train you in different areas of your life there's many interviews i have with people like patricia king i think joan hunter other people may be on there that interviewed me and we also have many of our own um uh revelations that we reveal and we share and talk about on catcare.com and catch.com is the only place you can go online to give to me i always have to tell people don't give to me through facebook don't give to me on youtube those are probably fake places asking for money for me i don't do that you only have one place if you want to give online go to catker.com click on the treasury and it shows you how to do that you can be a guardian zone member i'm just excited my whole focus is what god said if they're there you'll share and so my heart is to share whatever he sends me if it's the grocery store if it's down the street to a neighbor's house no matter where it is i'm always going to talk about heaven and god and jesus christ so for me that's my focus unless people ask me sometimes i don't even remember to give my name because it isn't about me god wants uh people he loves it when people bless me i love it when they bless me i love it when they send me notes and precious pictures and it makes it worthwhile to i don't know what my husband is saying oh this is just about uh this is just another card my husband brought me and wow you're getting really getting lost because i don't know oh you want me to open this okay let's see let's see somebody made this to cat happy birthday with love lots of stoning law and love from twin sisters liberty and hope how about that they made me this little thing how nice i never know what people are going to give me do you know where do you know where you're going to be that you can announce where you're going to be in the next couple of weeks or do you not know those i will be in uh colorado and golden colorado and that will be june i think um 11th and 12th i will be at uh um um i'm trying to remember gateway on mount zion with my friends david and d.d and they have a powerful uh warring worship team they're awesome so my husband's getting better so i do know that and so june will be the next time i go june i think i float on the 10th or 11th it's like 11th 12th or 13th it should be on our facebook somewhere that's golden colorado i'll be there and then i think i will be in um orlando when i get back i'll be going to that journey uh it's for patriots and prophets and other people in orlando and um it's gonna i'll be there for about five days i know i think desantis governor desantis is coming i think you've been invited steve are you coming yeah i was invited but i was invited to both and so on the same exact days there's in orlando and tampa so the clay clark one is in tampa that same day and i got vip tickets to that but i was also invited to the to the one in orlando and okay now what do i do and i you know um i finally decided you know a cat kathy walters had given me a word before we had ever seen clay clark do anything in tulsa weeks before that she contacted me she said there's a guy named clay clark god said you're going to connect with him and then later we both found him doing that big old tulsa event neither one of us knew he was going to do that popular event so it was totally that was that was why i decided to do that but man i was like tauren so but the fact that florida is making two massive events for patriots i'm not surprised because florida uh god calls um the atmosphere over florida his battle station on earth many many many of the hosts are there and sent out from there and so he absolutely said that i was going to be going and so i got an invitation i got the vip stuff that was really precious of them to do that for me so i'll be there the 16th through the 19th in i think it's being held at the gaylord palms but i did see the second event and went wow florida's going to have so much glory on it you know and all this this speaking on behalf of what god's plans are for this country that's what both of these events are about is about liberty freedom and justice and the people standing up on behalf of god i'm looking forward to it and then i think also in august i'll be actually in south dakota how about that and so we'll be listing all these places and i'll probably be going to north carolina in the fall um and in certain places so i have about four or five invitations that i'll be putting on my website well i love that governor christie noem from south dakota she's uh she's precious i mean i don't know her personally but wow you know there's a desantis in florida there's some amazing governors you know so it's going to be fun the next few weeks are going to be uh epic you know by the time the halfway to the you know we're on there on the 19th which is the last day for both of those tampa and orlando that's doreen's birthday and our anniversary our 43rd anniversary of the same number of new years is is on the 22nd and i don't know we might be back home by then but by the way clay called me the other clay clark called me the other day and they were like a couple hundred short of filling that venue with that rodney howard brown's church with ten thousand people so and here i don't know how these big years is but i mean these things are it's going to be epic in the spirit realm over florida that weekend you know so it's going to be very powerful and we we do have open heaven here um in this state because of god's activities and plans well it's a it's free number one and he made it was going to be free he made sure it was going to be free he picked the right governor the right president you know our true president does live in florida people uh number 45 lives in florida he may or may not show up at the orlando event at the uh one with the governor so we'll see what happens i'm just excited i'll probably give a report about all of it later maybe we can both give a report at one of our one of our uh chat receivers yeah that'll be i might do a quick live from the from the lobby of that thing or something i don't know how crazy it's probably gonna be crazy loud out there but well listen i better

when we go into the video portion that's the elijah streams part of it so those that that love what we do and are being blessed by when you donate into that and so into that that you're sowing into the nonprofit elijah stream so uh let's see i'm gonna have to remind you to be sure to subscribe to license.com so you'll be able to get all notifications from us uh when we have things important to

red subscribe and then the bell needs to be read when you when you hit it that means you're subscribed if you click on it when it's gray you just unsubscribed yourself so don't do that just click it again if you do that so um hey jeff let's go ahead and run to remind people of our social media app app uh which is on the app store and on your laptop or desktop on on zap it so go ahead and run the zap [Music] and there you go so there's like tens of thousands of your friends uh on zap it already it's very facebook like it's not a copy but similar in the way it feels so that uh if you want you know some of you are frustrated with facebook as i am where you're getting really tired of your content being censored because it's too conservative when you're on zap it you will never be con uh censored for being conservative and you won't be sensitive for being liberal either nothing will be censored for if is if you're harassing someone or or overly doing something like you know putting inappropriate content or you know too much profanity or whatever it won't it won't be being censored because of your point of view because that's not why we created that god gave us this platform basically to go back to the future to the way facebook used to be when they were something good then they decided they were going to be your enemies if you were conservative and they made themselves your enemy uh they made them themselves the the judge jury and executioner if they didn't like the content if you talked about abortion in a conservative fashion planned parenthood and all the different things you know you were called fake news and everything else so you know they get to pay the price for that was we go to other places so so there you go all right um i think we were caught up let's bring in kat kur today it's cat car wednesday stephen keck here hey good morning this is afternoon where you are in florida yeah it's still my morning though starts at noon yeah what time do what you tend to go to bed at what time about six or seven a.m that's what i thought so those are your some people have in fact one of the questions i have for today this isn't question and answer time yet but they'll say yeah what do you do to prepare for the visitations of the lord well it sounds to me like the answer that is you don't do anything and yet you're up all night what are you doing all night working yeah you're working on stuff because i don't do it in the daytime and number one if all of your if people are here it's hard to um put down the revelation whether i'm recording it writing it down whether i'm making sketches of the spirit realm i do a lot of that i'm still rewriting the movie script i mean there's so much going on i'm finishing the content for the spirit force mentoring thing i'll be doing and i do that at night i don't do that in the daytime and i god made me this way to sleep four hours and be up 20 hours and i'm i'm also working on book three i mean this i have this whole list of stuff i have to do that i have to pull that revelation out that he gave me and there's just different ways i have to put that down and if there's anyone around or if there's distractions it's hard so he just comes when he feels like it i have nothing to do of when he comes to see me that would be god holy spirit of jesus when they come to see me or take me i really there's no way to prepare for that because they choose when that happens and i am open to any time they want and that can happen in the middle of the day it can happen in the middle of the night normally not when i'm praying and my prayers aren't like most people's prayers i'm declaring decreeing i'm making rulings in the spirit realm um as god taught me to do which is very powerful i go in the middle of the night in the street that's what i'm doing at two or three a.m i'm sending the host on assignments and strategic places and things to do so that's what's going on with me at night so i when i go to bed i try to beat the sunlight coming up if i go to bed at seven that means i'm getting up at 11 it takes me an hour afterwards i'll be talking to god or whatever so i come out usually around noon so my morning is noon that's it so good morning to you then i'm going to ask you some more questions when we get back into this because i want to ask you a few more questions about that but you said you had a couple of things to share before we get into the official question and answer so i'll let you do that right now yeah i just want people to stay excited and he's god's always going to give me special things to say to everyone to keep them in that place of celebration and some people like saying what do we celebrate because that's truth that's proving to god that you're trusting him and what he has declared about what's going on not what man is saying or assuming or what the head knowledge is telling you if god said something and he meant it he's not changing it it doesn't matter if it's weeks or months later he is still focused on what his plans are for this time and if everything anything was ever true it's exposing the darkness and that's absolutely necessary and then he's repositioning people right now i will say that some people are moving literally don't do unless he tells you to do it and if he tells you to do it he means it okay and so he's moving people to actually somewhere within their city to other states some people he's setting you up for what he has been talking to you about probably for 10 years to do i know people personally who are just now beginning to step into a new place and i can let you know this when you step in if you've been following after jesus christ if you've been losing stuff from your soul sending the host of heaven that's operating on earth like they do in heaven when you step into that place and he says it's time it will be like walking in a dream it's the only way i can explain it is so supernatural when he opens those doors for you that no man could open that no one can stop you from doing what he has declared you will do don't lose your faith and whatever you do don't step back and i won't stop saying that i can tell you this i can smell because i smell not just aromas but i smell angels i smell the other side right before something happens and i am so filled with excitement right now about this major celebration that is still going to happen and god said people will literally be running in the streets they'll be calling everybody they know saying god is doing this this is really happening i can tell you that i've heard stuff from um from the right side not the right side group that does a broadcast but from god's side that things are very very close and some major things will start happening of people giving up i'm talking about some of the democrats are actually going to be giving up what they're doing or telling about what really happened and one of the news medias i'm not sure which one it will be is going to actually allow um stuff from the right to come and be said on the network which they haven't been doing that at all but once they realize they will lose everything if they don't and there's a lot of major industries and people who sided with the left who are now changing their mind and i'm hearing about this every day but it is going to begin to be in the news that people are realizing how much of all this was a lie how much of this was planned for years to take our lives away and actually take our country hell is having some very bad times i can tell you that for sure hell is probably gnashing their teeth and weeping because they cannot stop the most high god from putting in place what he wants and who he has chosen and i will say this you're going to see a whole lot more of trump coming up and no one can stop that i know he has a big announcement something he's going to be doing on july the 4th so look forward to that date i'm not saying that's the day everything will happen but i'm just saying one of the greatest fourth of julys we've had in a long time is about to happen so i'm excited for everybody out there awesome and then this morning robin bullock texted me now robin doesn't doesn't he's texted me a couple of times but he's a busy man and we're busy so we we don't get that much outside of the broadcast time and then when we're in the broadcast time before the broadcast and after the broadcast we'll visit a little bit but this time you know i was i'll sit up in bed i've got one of these beds that raises up and i'll sit there and work and and i'll have my worship there and i'll do it all there and all of a sudden i get this text i wasn't already discouraged but there was a little bit of thing like come on lord hurry up you know and brahman said the lord told me to text you and to me and encourage you stephen he began to prophesy to me by text that this was very very close what you have to know folks is robin doesn't do that for robin to do that from the lord he told me a couple times during the text god told me to text you this and tell you so i know we're close god doesn't tell the prophets the date he just doesn't do that you know um it's just nothing there's a place in scripture about the 2300 days that daniel got in the 1350 days or whatever but that's rare that's extremely rare so rare we can tell you hey there's that one place well you know even jesus even the lord does not know the day he's coming back so there you go right there when the father says it's done and it's ready he will send his son when he when he will be coming back so even that it's just the way god's is his mo it's the way the father operates okay and so stay excited that you even know and hear what you're hearing but celebration ahead of time blesses the heart of god but it puts something in your soul the more you think the celebration and don't think this is going to last forever the more you think celebration and when you begin to operate in true power and authority with the revelation you're all about to get through spirit force your whole life will change the way you look at the days you're in will change the god is setting it up for us to actually not put up with the enemy and to crush and push him back it's going to be some good days ahead it's not all exciting you know man yeah that is exciting i'm in sort of i usually am in pretty good mood anyway but um after that text and then back in with kat and steve you know it's exciting because we get to you know encourage each other and build each other up and we're all on the same page that this thing is is looking imminent and by the way i mean if i i almost would maybe i'll pull it up next time and read some of the things that he said but you know one of the things he said is you know when the devil came out of a person sometimes he would try and rip that person a little bit you know damage him on the way out and the lord said be quiet and come out he said the enemy the devil is about to come out of the out of the united states that's what he said he's about to be or at least this big old principality whatever however that would be and he said he'll try and rip a few things on the way out but it's going to be okay folks you know he'll try and cause a little damage but he's lee east going bye-bye uh in some fashion which is why cat's been probably saying long before any of the others that we are coming into some of the best of times you've been saying that for the four or five years at least yeah we're coming in we're not at the end of the days when everything's getting darker so you've never changed that story so well are you ready for some questions and questions okay i want to come back to what you were just saying and before i go to these first ones you said in the mornings or overnight you're declaring a decree cat if there was a way for you to quantify how much time you spend setting hose are we talking about sometimes during the night you spend five minutes to send them out you spend ten how what how much time do you spend sending it out probably hours really really yeah never talked about this really i have it's a lifestyle if you're a commander you can't sit around and wait for something to happen oh here's some bad news another enemy's attacking here now this is happening i don't tolerate any any of the acts of darkness i i'm in a position now where i can take authority and send the host to deal with so many things that minimizes it or stops it completely and that's why it's important for people to know what you're going to learn in spirit force is not just something you do when you feel like it it's going to be a lifestyle this is a lifestyle i remember the day a prophet contacted me and said that god said you have mastered you have stepped into mastery which is kind of mentioned in the bible and even sent me this banner that said mastery on it and i and he called me and he said this is an unknown prophet but so accurate let me tell you some of the powerful ones aren't even known he said god said you have this day mastered commanding the host of heaven and to keep going forward to higher levels to do more damage to the darkness when you speak things move immediately and instantly and the hosts know i'm serious they're excited to be a part of the army that i command i can't command someone else's army it's it's a personal thing and that's the way god made it it's like your salvation is personal you know your experience with the holy spirit is personal well commanding heaven's army is a personal thing it's the way god always designed it for us to send them out on assignments and missions but it's the commanding our army our natural army and our military i know a lot about them they can't act on their own they have to have people in high places and high authority with the right authority to tell them where to go what to do and that might get passed down from you know the generals on down to the other levels and then eventually to the lieutenants and the sergeants or whatever to give out the command to actually go but those main decisions are made from the highest level in our military especially on huge missions or very strategic missions and i say strategy is the most important thing even in sending heaven's army don't send them with just a blank thing don't just say well go over to this area and destroy the darkness they're not really going to know what you mean you have to be specific and how you talk to them yeah think of an example of how specific you get well like i did this morning i was taking authority over the all of the operations of the enemy that would try to prevent this broadcast from happening and that was against humans or spiritual beings of darkness on every level of frequency in every realm that would be the spirit realm and the natural realm i i took authority in all those areas first and then i told them what i was taking authority over and why i said to prevent those who would interfere by tearing down blocking delaying interfering with any sound reception with any of the camera reception with any of the operations in either of the studios with any of the people who are trying to come against us in certain ways to let that fail that people try to interrupt broadcast or stop them let them fail pull down the strongholds of satan that are empowering those people are giving them information which they do all the time and stop and crush the plans of darkness that's why we are here to take authority over it jesus said i give you power over all the part of the enemy he didn't say that to the army of heaven he didn't tell the army of heaven i give you power over all the power of the enemy the lord himself commanded them told them where to go michael who was the high archangel who's over the army he then would give commands also to the army just like we would do it levels here you have to do the same thing in the spirit realm with the spiritual army because they're fighting the spiritual army of darkness so when i was done giving their command and what they would do and how long they would do it for how long would they do that assignment until well past them when this broadcast is done and then i say go host make toast of the enemy's plans and and i even say how many i'll say 100 million when you will do this assignment and they will shoot out like beams of light and they go to where they're going they transform into weapons and begin to fight against the spiritual darkness that would interfere with anything that we're doing or saying right now they can even block the mind of some of those people who would like to take us off so they don't even hear the broadcast i mean it depends on what you have planned to be strategic with last night i was out there sending 5 billion of them to go worldwide to make a sweep for a sweep for the next 30 days 24 hours a day to expose any unseen unknown wickedness evil cheating stealing lying controlling whether it was spirits or people or humans to pull them down and to stop the activities and make it known where it's talked about on television where it's shown in magazines where people will see and know what's going on and i sent 5 billion last night out to go do that and immediately they went and they're going to go to every state and then every country even some that people don't know about yet are about to find out about it and god the father could if he wanted to send 5 billion or 100 billion but he's put it into the hands of men doing most of the sending right yes because he in the father always gives me scriptures he said i said that i put you in charge of the earth i put you you as the body of christ those who follow christ he gave us authority in the earth you have to have flesh to do that or spirits will be here taken over everywhere they have to use people to do anything even evil or wicked but we that's why we have to have flesh on us we have to know christ in order to have authority to speak like that is called ruling christ said you will rule with me now in this lifetime and in the life to come well that's not just sitting somewhere hoping something changes hoping you will be rescued okay it's us taking authority and being accountable for what we say and do in this earth that's so good so good and chad you know you're a seer so you literally see the light you'll see the beings you'll see the creatures um i i've operated in the scene from time to time but it's kind of rare and i'm contending for more of that but a lot of people write to me and they say if we don't see them how do we know we can send them we don't see them go how do we know we have more if we can't even see the ones we've sent how would you answer that thanks faith faith faith okay if god said he was sending them and he told us how to command them you need to be doing it you walk by faith not by sight the evidence is what you begin to see happening about the things where you have sent them to do things some things happen overnight immediately like even in my own city things will be changing in certain areas that i sent them out to deal with and it will eventually eventually you will see them over your home they don't go back to heaven if that army is sent for you to come in they'll be over and around you all the time wow for you to send them out with orders to go so okay and i um so i've i've sent a lot of them i don't think i fully realize that once he's sent more because by faith i say okay i must have more because i sent those out there so by faith i send more the more i sin the more he gives me the more he gives me the more i have around me all the time to sin is that what you're saying that's right that's right and you're usually what happens is you start with a hundred it immediately you go within a couple weeks to ten thousand if you have been sending them on a daily basis okay i don't take a break seven days a week i'm sending them usually in the evening and then in the day time and the one thing i always do with this army is i will actually say i take every time i go to go somewhere i take power over all the part of the enemy that would seek to attack or harm me or delay me in any way as i travel whether it's down the street or through the air i command the host of heaven to hold on every stronghold of satan there will be no holdups delays accidents or breakdowns of any kind whatsoever you will keep me from all those things they literally will do that no matter where you go and you'll find that you never have accidents you don't have issues in the airport at all and i will actually say i will have no issues at check-in at security at boarding and i have had so much favor and all those places because that army is involved in that so yeah i mean i mean if we could see it and uh when you walk in this is just a curiosity because you're here i don't know if you see all the time maybe you do but when you walk into the terminal and you're gonna head toward the ticket counter are you seeing your hosts scurrying doing things do you see them going ahead of you they will go up and they'll speak to the people usually behind the counter like she needs favor they'll actually say that to them and the people will hear them thinking it's themself and that i've also seen uh other things happen like that will someone if anyone walked in with any of the darkness they usually will run they don't want to be near me because the the power of god the more that you begin to take authority and you actually are commanding that army the light in you grows because you're making connection with god you're obeying what his plan is you have a light like a fighter coming out of you and at one point if you continue to do this when they look at you they'll only see the fire and that will bring great fear upon any of the darkness around you wow oh man and one last question on that when you're sending them out throughout the night everyone's asleep you're doing it will you go let's say that there's a second cousin twice you move some are way up there but you know that the enemy is playing with them you don't have direct contact in life but you know that their eyes are blinded to the gospel do you send host to unblind them or to to kick the demons away so that they can see clearly would you do that kind of thing oh yes i have a huge family just so you know i'm not talking about when i talk about family i'm talking about the ones that live with me here um i have over a hundred family members in this city alone and there's some of them not living right and i certainly will i'll tell the host my my niece who lives on this street my second cousin who lives on this street i'm sending you there i take power over all the part of the enemy trying to twist their mind bring them into deception i command you to go now and pull down the stronghold satan that are causing that to happen and release the life of god into those people and i will see almost immediate results of them beginning to change just by things that they're saying to other people not even having a direct conversation with them knowing that god is doing those things that i ask of besides i also know when people in heaven are declaring over you they look down to earth they see the activities of holy spirit around your family member they see also the activities of the angels that are the angels the guardian angels of the family members you're looking for and uh and if you made commands for the army of heaven before you died went to heaven they remain around your family member until they are drawn to christ oh i like that i like well we had said we were going to try and get at least a question or two from children and my and this one says my daughter and this is a few weeks old my daughter who's six years old she wants to know if she can write giant ladybugs and have it i think you answered a similar question about um uh the horse with the horns all of a sudden i can't think of the name the unicorn yeah yeah so this one's a ladybug writer she wants to know she can write a giant ladybug that's and her name is paisley paisley okay oh well hi paisley that's an awesome question i just love it when children's imagination is not blocked by reasoning things because you know most adults when they grow up they stop they have to reason everything that comes to them sometimes you just need to believe god but children have no problem absolutely you can write a ladybug but one time i had a child about four and a half say could i have a conversation with an aunt said yes however i will make her small enough that she can actually meet the aunt herself this is in heaven she can meet the little aunt herself and have a picnic with it and have all the conversations so the father doesn't say yes or no to me that's never going to be a yes or no i'm a detailed person he's detail that little girl was just beside herself knowing that one day if if he caught her up to heaven i mean he's still doing that if he caught up to heaven you know before she dies he probably would shrink or small enough to meet an aunt in person we're talking about the god of everything right the one that we lived in that can be as huge as a planet or galaxy if you wanted to but even while we lived in him this is what i love about the father even while we lived inside of him he made himself while he's sitting on the throne small enough to step inside himself and play with us and dance with us and sing over us wow good answer good answer now here's one um that you you know she's talking about you know household salvation here and let me just read it because i have a question regarding family member's death the fam the bible says you and your family will be saved or can be saved um she wants to know that includes extended family members if it was extended family members like her her husband's uncle who was very loved by him this is kind of a it's not worded quite right but there was this extended family member who was an uncle and he was killed before he and all of us became christians so none of he was killed before he became a christian he was catholic but he didn't practice even that and she's basically wanting to know i don't know if the question is since god is outside of time if i if that's my extended man family member and i got saved would god step outside of time and affect a family member that may not be your question but it's mine i understand what her question is her desire is to know was there any chance for him to be in heaven basically that's what she wants to know there's every chance he could be there and i will tell you why because there have been some very wise people who've been a part of your family it could have been somebody 300 years ago i know this to be true that they could be declaring not just for themselves but anyone in their family lineage my grandmother my dad's mom used to say that all the time i say it myself that even if i'm not here i'm praying for the generations to come that will be from my family line they will accomplish what god wants they will know jesus christ as their savior i'm standing in the gap for that family line to know christ and to live for him in the earth that right there that statement right there why they were here standing on this earth making that declaration that gives every right for the army of heaven or for the holy spirit to go and pursue that person down the line right and pursue them to get them born again so there's every chance that that happened that's good that's good that's good all right uh here's one um the loved ones who've gone before us uh there's three a b and c a do they wish um do they wish we have not grieved so much for them b do they wish we knew how happy they were so that we could move on and see do wives or husbands in heaven rejoice to see their spouse remarry on earth okay those are all very good questions and i can tell you all three the answer is yes everyone in heaven who is living in the glory and the love of god in the unbelievable creativity and understanding of god's heart wants everyone to not grieve for them that is a greatest desire to look down see them celebrating that that person is living in heaven in joy itself not missing their final destiny which is to use that gift to god made them in heaven they haven't missed anything they're not losing anything by living in heaven so i have literally heard people in heaven say i i wish they would stop grieving i wish they realized the power and the love that i'm living in that one day we will absolutely be together and and of course um uh of course people are always happy to see a spouse get married on the earth and i'll tell you why everyone in heaven knows that no matter who you end up by marrying if let's say your husband went to heaven they would want somebody wonderful and powerful the new cries to to marry the wife they left behind so they wouldn't be alone then no one has an issue with that when they all get to heaven one day nobody will be married to anybody i will use derek prince as an example of that i always use an example of derek prince he had a wonderful wife loved her dearly she passed on to heaven and he remarried to somebody wonderful that knew jesus christ and and he also loved them and then later in heaven i saw him with two other uh people i've seen difference a couple times in heaven and those were his wives that were his wives they were best friends all of them um they had their own mansions but they did stuff together all over heaven nobody was jealous or upset that during that time frame when you weren't together you weren't alone so i tell people it's perfectly okay when when you're when your spouse dies and goes to heaven it's perfectly okay for you to find make sure it's the right person don't be unequally yoked together in other words it's really hard if you marry someone unnaturally yoked together doesn't necessarily mean that they don't know christ because i know god has plans sometimes he knows he's going to be born again but is don't marry someone who's into wickedness or evil whatever you do they won't change unless it's a divine thing make sure that your hearts are right you both love jesus christ you're all for what he wants for your lives when you remarry but there's nothing wrong even in the bible it says that's acceptable and no one in heaven is upset or angry with you they're happy that you're not alone and i'm trying to remember what the last question was i remember the first i think that was it yeah i think you got it i put it over here but it was that um well um that segways to another question i keep getting asked is is does god have the one if let's say you're only married once has god picked for all time and eternity the one you're going to be married with or does he give you a perfect person in that vicinity is there the right one and if there is and when you remarry is there another one that's the right one i think if you if you uh you know that this is what god wants and you have to follow after peace i i do know in my situation i absolutely am married to the one god told me i picked him before i sent you to earth so i can't ever say he may not be the right person we both love jesus christ but we are both very different trust me but i'll be married 44 years this year and just today told my husband how much i loved him interviewed him and besides jesus christ he is my number one my husband is and i pray everyone can have relationship you have to work at it you can't just say well i'm in love for 10 years it kind of burns out you have kids you get too busy you better make a priority to spend time with your spouse make a date day however if it's two hours or maybe get away for a couple days if possible that would be great but i'm just saying it's like anything else you work out your salvation daily that doesn't mean you spend and get reborn that's not what that means it means you work to get closer with christ go to higher levels in him so it's like anything else you have to work at that but i do you think he has somebody for everybody he has something for everybody and i've seen people just marry any old person and it was not good then i've seen people marry someone you never thought would work out and they got born again on fire for god i think you need to really make sure that you're hearing holy spirit and the father but certainly it is good that man does not dwell alone on the earth to have somebody just by god designed marriage that we uplift each other we pray for each other and have fun we have to have fun together and in your case because we met bing bing was with us in israel your husband is being captain being yeah god in his sense of humor gave you the perfect person for you who loves to fish and you don't even like the smell of fish is that right i told you he would challenge you um i tell people i might i don't like list is the devil number two is seafood and then he picked a fisherman and that isn't something he just likes to do that is his gift that man can catch fish anywhere in the ocean in a creek in a lake it doesn't matter he is excellent at it no matter where he goes mostly he does catch and release now but i remember the day when he dragged him home and then oh they would smell the bait would be so bad in my freezer the ice cream tasted like fish yeah i mean if you had ever said what if i never tried to picture who your husband was i wouldn't picture him wearing a captain's cap who's captain being and he used to drive the big boats or something like that i don't really really know what kind of boats he is not afraid to go in the open ocean he has ocean charts he knows the depths he knows he knows how to operate is something god put in him he did take courses he of course he had to take courses to to get a captain's license and to learn more he's taken the the coast guard course so when he was in between a job at one point he would visit the yacht basin and look at all the big boats just because we we'd do that for date days that'd be a date day we go get dinner then we walk on all the docks you know how many there are in florida i think i've been to every boat basin and yacht and so he loved him he would look at all he would learn about him so at one point the boat tree which was a huge boat distributor hired him to actually demonstrate the 50-foot yachts because nobody else was intelligent enough they were not fearless then he would train people on how to use them so he got to enjoy every aspect of the boating and the fishing thing he's good at it wow he also makes me the best cup of hot cocoa ever in the world neat couple uh okay now i get this in one form or another quite a bit okay i know there's no romance in heaven in the way we think of romance this person wants to know do we kiss in any matter in heaven even on the cheek do you greet someone to kiss him on the cheek is there anything like that in heaven oh yes there's an awful lot of hugging i think hugging is everywhere um they never would have put up with the mask thing ever because people face the face everyone is greeted with a hug or they will kiss them on the cheek you're not in your physical body so number one you have a lot less of those um desires that's a good word a good way to put it you don't have a desire to be one with somebody okay you have a great desire to have friends to have a friendship to enjoy yourself together all over heaven that is always there the love of god is a substance it's not just a feeling the love of the father the love of christ but everyone probably is more in love with jesus christ from a spiritual heart kind of thing when he comes anywhere in heaven everybody runs to be with him they want to sit near him they want to talk to him and everybody knows that eventually when someone goes up to heaven he will come up to that person and step inside of them wow nothing like you begin to burn with that same spiritual passion and you will love everybody once jesus has done that he'll try and look up through your eyes and you'll see everyone in heaven different than you ever did before he really does love us and experiencing that in heaven face to face with him you're not angry at everyone anyone in heaven even if you had a neighbor you couldn't stand or a family member you couldn't stand you know you want to run away that kind of thing that doesn't happen in heaven everybody cares they do things together it's the best place ever to be it sounds marvelous well here's a question about it now this i'm not one that ever would like to lift weights it's no fun but this guy loves to lift weights he says what he goes i like to lift weights what form of body will i have in heaven muscles and bones will i have muscles or bigger muscles i don't mind hearing if i have bigger muscles in heaven i have no intentions of ever lifting a weight to get it i don't care but this guy wants to know probably if he could lift weights or at least when he have bigger muscles i understand that a lot of guys ask that same question you know or or they're short they want to be tall i want to be six foot when i get to heaven i went i think god would let you have the six foot thing i don't think that that matters to god whether you're taller or shorter or whatever there's no possible way you can build muscles that you don't have your spiritual body now you don't have you're not some little wispy things gonna float through the walls in heaven your spiritual body might float through the walls down here tell people don't try to run through your wall on your manager when you get there you'll bounce off um because you're in the spiritual world in your spiritual body it operates in many ways in other words you can feel your arms you can lift things everyone is super strong in heaven you could lift a car with one finger in heaven if you wanted to uh you could move real heavy things it's just amazing how that happens in heaven so if you want to do it because you feel strong that's going to happen anyway okay you're going to feel strong but there's no people don't really work out except for this one thing i know the angels the angel tribes in heaven have what i would call heaven's olympics and i think you probably would want to be a part of that even if it was just to maybe be there to coach one of them or something if that's something you love to do they actually do have a different um entire member oh they have maneuvers they practice they actually have olympics in heaven it's not about winning for them it's about showing off the strength and their activity to improve in every area of their life because when they go on missions uh they don't have like muscle muscles but they can build their inner strength and their understanding and even their techniques they have powerful techniques that are that are done in these uh angel olympics i think that's where that whole idea came from and there are champions in heaven that people they all encourage and yell and watch all that happening nobody feels let down or like they weren't good enough everyone's excited to get to see something but the angels especially it's something that's like a tree to them it's a special event that they have up there in heaven and and i have seen a couple angels that actually competed in there and they were excitedly talking about the games that were about to start but the thing you have to think about they're not all on the ground of heaven some are strategic movements and maneuvers they make in the sky of heaven so this is some some big event that god did this for the angel tribes to give them something special for them in heaven so that person will probably be there all the time watching them practice you know that doesn't mean this question i don't think i've asked this before but at the resurrection people are caught up now they're in glorified bodies now they have bodies isn't there a time isn't there everybody gonna have glorified bodies in heaven and that point won't be spirit beings but we'll have bodies in heaven for a season i don't really know people have probably different time periods what is your thoughts on that well where there will be times when the when you all have spiritual act or actually have glorified bloodies would that be a different thing then the day the dead and christ shall rise is the day you get your body back right if you're living in heaven you die this body this sleeps you yourself which is your spirit man with your soul in it they have to stay together that the heaven and has the most glorious time you actually can learn more get more of intermittent intimacy with christ but they have royal university they have all kinds of places you can go to get more understanding about life and how to live in heaven and even in the future they have creation lab where you can practice doing different projects and stuff about life itself and so one day all of us who believed in jesus christ and received and every one of us will at one point have our physical body back again and it will be glorified and i can tell you you will look amazing i know remember in 1982 on a mountaintop in north carolina the lord said because of my obedience and all that i have been willing to do for him and to surrender for him and not for myself he showed me myself and my glorified body and it was amazing i was wearing something that looked like living fabric they were like little round i don't know gems or beads of life it almost looks sort of military-like or maybe something from the renaissance that has sort of a i don't know i can't explain it was beautiful filled with light but my hair was very long it was long and it had some waves in it it was different colors that was in my hair but my faith was timeless and god said this is how everyone will be their skin will be timeless your your faces will glow with the glory a life will flow and search through your body you'll feel so strong and so excited about life itself so i enjoy that for maybe about maybe a minute and then it was gone but i never forgot how i felt at that time at that time it was just an amazing experience so people will probably do things differently a little bit differently once they have their flesh back on that flesh will be strong for everybody there will be no no just marks you know there'll be no um handicaps like there'll be no burn marks there'll be no discoloring of your skin and that doesn't mean everybody will be just have white skin either it says every tongue tribe and nation is represented in heaven so i've seen people of different nations in heaven i've seen people with black skin red skin even their spiritual body will adapt to the physical body that you have of the appearance of it it says everybody will be known as they were known on earth but i'm sure there's going to be all kinds of new things that are created and the new earth is it's not like he wipes away the whole physical realm he blends them together they're be spiritual and physical together but nothing will age decay get old nobody can ever get sick nobody will ever be able to sin or want to sin in that glorified body it's a tremendous day to look forward to for all of us who are in jesus christ very cool okay now this got slightly cut out but i think he got the essence of this i think i had seen this once in his fullness but it got cut off on the printer because when i'm worshiping i feel like something is shooting out of my abdomen it reminds me of the care bearers and then i got caught here i think the care bears have something shooting out of their album i think the question was does that sound right or are you seeing anything that was like that i see it now coming out of people yeah i see a light yes and if people are very creative if i'm in a meeting and sometimes people go they think you know i'm just like they won't know what i'm doing because i'm seeing so many things and the spirit realm is fully open when i'm in meetings i see the heavens i see the portal open i see all of heaven watching i see people's family members watching them down in the meeting when people come in i totally can see and know those who've been close to christ or who've been kind to people or loving people you have light coming from every pore of your body but if your creative person out of your belly will come rainbow shooting out if you've got creative creativity in you whether that would be like an artist a musician a photographer it doesn't matter creativity shows up like that because you know the father was the original creator with of course with the word with his son so i see that i see light like sometimes if people release the anointing a lot wherever they go they have like flame throwers it's like the fire of god coming out of the very core which would be and you know why you you call it your belly that is where the the heart of your soul is when god says guard your heart that's your soul your soul the center of your soul is the very core or center of your being that's the heart of your being or the core of your being that's where many things come when you speak against darkness things will come out the anointing will shoot out against the darkness it breaks every yoke of darkness even when you pray even though it comes from here stuff is released from here uh your soul is where what you think what you choose and what you demonstrate and the power and the light of god comes from that source so it's this is the center or core of your of your soul is right here in the middle people think because it's your mind you will and emotions they think it's up here in your head uh your natural brain is not the mind of your soul it's what you gather from god is what you get from god it's what you use and think about with him and that's connected to this beautiful gorgeous kind of a spine that goes down into the center of your soul where your will is in the very core it looks like this big column it's strong god wrote things on it before you sent him from himself and off of that come all these images of you and they move like in the wind of the spirit they move like this all these layers are not stagnant uh that's actually going to my uh my um prophetic artist his next assignment is to do the soul for me i've already sketched that he's actually going to paint uh the model type of it and also what it literally looks like in the spirit well this kind of what jesus was alluded to and he says if you drink the water that i get will it will become like uh out of here is the belly depending on the on the translation will flow rivers of living water is that what is that what he's describing yes it's like the life of god and i actually sometimes see people almost like a well is in them and it pours out um that's exactly what he means out of your out of your belly which is the core that's your soul your soul is i will flow the life of god and i was in somebody's home in california of all things and when i we pulled up and i got out i was invited to speak at somebody it was a huge home and i saw angels when they opened the door i saw their own angel surfing on the river of life that was coming from their inner emotions i told this person later they they swept and wept them up and they said we spend so much time worshiping god in our home their children uh their their spouse did they let people come in they they train them on how to love god it was all about intimacy of christ their angels were really surfing they have so much release that river of life from the innermost being it was actually taking over their home and the angels were surfing on it that's great nobody i i have never you know i'm 60 almost 66 i've never heard anyone describe this how come i mean jesus said that but we never took it literally he kind of meant it literally didn't he i should say he kind of he meant it literally he mentioned we thought of it as a great spiritual sort of concept or something it depends on what scripture somebody brings up i've been given revelation on so many scriptures that gave me no one can talk me out of the fact that any of this happened to me they can't try to convince me it's not real i live it i've seen it i've experienced it i've seen other people living it as being a seer you create an atmosphere in your own home and when you create this life you have a god when you visit it's released in other people's homes and that's why i tell people make sure you know you release the when you go to someone's home when you see anointing into the door handle or whatever you can do you're making a deposit of god that comes from you that you created with this intimacy with him but those rivers of living water i've never seen that much at one time that their angels were surfing on they actually had waves of it going forward that's crazy all right this guy says i'm native american from the uh keynote nation q-u-i-n-a-u-l-t daniel his name is daniel from the keynote indian nation on the washington state coast and i was wondering have you seen our native american ancestors in heaven oh yes i actually have it says every time tribe and nation that would mean the american indians or other native amer native indians to their country i have seen them and i i have the holy spirit talked to me one time about why some of them wear certain images that people think it was something they thought of god said i've always had seers the loser said the holy spirit god i've always had seers on the earth that would see things and they would duplicate the images that they they were wearing like angels or some of the hosts they would duplicate what was on their outfits and they would put their tents they would wear them on their clothing and i think that one symbol you know everybody knows it's like this that has the dot in the middle i know the enemy will try to steal anything like the eye of god or the illuminati people whoever they are they always show this big you know temple thing with an eye at the top that image belongs to god the enemy tries to steal everything these native americans i have been in several areas i've actually spoken for one tribe before the uh i think in pull you up i think it was called pull up washington state i've talked to several members of several different tribes of indians and there is so much of god in the light of god around those people seeking and this is that they would say the spirit of god or the spirit that came on the wind and they worshipped not knowing it was him but at one point sometimes christ would just make himself known to them and there's a lot that are believers out there and everybody always ties when you hear what the name and meaning well they have witch doctors you know the devil's everywhere no matter what nation it is or what tribe it is but some of them are so close to god they understand the movements of the spirit before they get born again so when they're born again they under totally understand that that that is the real thing that god is the holy spirit is and so i have seen powerful actually was taken out in the middle of the arizona desert you've probably heard me say this before and i met jolt and he fights with lightning bolts on behalf of the western tribes in western america really america he's a regional ghost of heaven and he had those symbols like this all over his being but they were alive this is this is heaven they were alive they had real living eyes and every one of these like a breastplate he was wearing it was absolutely wild his eyes were shaped like the diamonds just like that symbol was he had lightning bolts coming off of his hair so i you know if i had time i'd do art all the time and then let my artist finish it but it's just fantastic to know there's so much life around you that you're not even aware of that well i mean in our generation of course i was a child of the 50s and 60s and 100 but you know i loved watching cowboys and indians but then as we get older we're talking you know there was an implication that all of these native american um costumes were all from the devil and here to you you're putting a totally different light on it i don't know this thing reminds me of bamboo but they got these plates with all these different strips like that you're saying i don't know what those are made of or anything maybe it's a bone but but you're saying a lot of those were copied from actual angelic beings yes that they were god expected them to model after those angelic beings i'm guessing yes because you know if you've ever seen real real totem poles which they had them near somewhere if the tribe was well established and it was a pretty big tribe they would actually have totem poles either at the at the beginning or opening you know some of them play some different places so i know if you're hearing me you're native american i probably didn't visit your area but i have been to a couple and saw some of these totem poles which are posted usually at the entrance or in the center sometimes and they have things like faces of eagles people you know one of the one of the um living creatures has a head of an eagle face uh they also have different images uh but some of them even back then i wonder why before i actually met or saw a couple of the um living creatures their faces are cut with facets like a gemstone like you know how they make facets on it sort of how the totem poles are made they are cut like this with facets with angles in them and i went that that that host i met jolt who pretty much ignored me he was busy fighting the enemy with these luck this lightning staff but i got a really good so i sketched him and took him to my artist and he did him for me and uh but even his face was caught and i went in my head i'm thinking wow that looks like the face of a totem hole and then look at the images he's wearing on his being you know what is all this and and the holy spirit left me and said we have always had seers on the earth and they would see this very being out in the desert fighting they were seer so they saw them no matter what and they they copied some of the angles in the structure of his face even the ear was like um his hair wasn't like soft and it was like sharp and that had lightning coming off the tips of it and so the lightning bolt that eye of god thing those are symbols that were in heaven that was embellished on this being and god said that the native americans who saw him then copied the way he looked put it on totem poles put it on some of their tents or the whatever they lived in what they wore they begin to wear those images satan always wants to take credit for everything guess what he does have credit for almost nothing except stealing and copying yeah wow okay here's some we have time for one more i think um okay so we've talked about there was even things like people that if they died and went to heaven now and there'd be so advanced you'd see even things that like electronics in heaven or and then you've also talked about old things like old 67 chevys or 50 you know and so there's got the old you got the new so the question is when people died hundreds or thousands of years ago what were they seeing in heaven did they see the advanced things like our electronics or or even what's our old things at 57 chevy or what do people that died i guess they're trying to figure out what time periods people experience when they go to heaven do they experience their own time period or what what do you what kind of insight they have on there they experience life in heaven it it doesn't it doesn't change they saw the new which is why paul who was caught up there were some things he couldn't speak about number one he didn't know how to explain it so he saw people doing things living certain ways even the way god made i mean if you were caught up let's say you died back in the year 1820 and you went up there and saw people wearing really cool outfits but they were flying okay they were riding on light i'm not saying a vehicle with lights sitting in seats i mean you literally were riding on waves of light if you stepped and saw people stepping into these kiosks with light beams shooting out and they stepped and they more than likely would grab that person who was from 1820 and take them with them this is how they found out they experienced it they had no problem accepting that like wow this is a powerful this is this this is because of jesus christ this is where he lives and so there's all kinds of i've just call it supernatural it's beyond the future it's eternal you're seeing eternal life lived out in heaven right now and and eternity only gets better we're only understanding now with the revelation god gives what has been going on in heaven how they are still connect to us even talks about some of the future things that will happen in the in the bible make sure you've got a bible and you're reading it god can bring revelation and light on the scriptures if you ask him but i can just say for us for those who belong to jesus christ who accept accepted his sacrifice and confessed their sins your name literally i've seen the lamb's book of life it isn't just a look book you open it's a lie that book is alive and when you open it it speaks really speaks that book speaks so you know one day you know it talks about the wicked i don't like to talk about that part but they it says they will stand before the judgment seat well the judgment seat of christ is with christ they'll stand before the throne of the living god and everyone who comes up there he'll have to show them this is where your name was blotted out and when he opens that and says their name it won't it won't be found but they will know at one time they knew him but they just decided they were going to go totally with satan and i do want to say this even when somebody sins christ is going to pursue them if you ever gave yourself to him it says that he still is watching for the backslider he wants them to know him so much you have a future in heaven you have no life in hell there is no life in hell you're in heaven to really live in hell you have no existence except to die over and over again and so make sure that you know jesus christ number one know him and that salvation that gives you entrance into heaven itself that blood that wipes away your sins your name will be written in that book that gives you entrance into heaven and life is only fantastic exciting it's fun there's moments you get so overwhelmed by the goodness of god in heaven but we can experience it in our life down here on earth don't just think when i die it's all going to get better the things you choose the decisions you make and what you are saying because of the power of christ can change your life right here on this earth so good so good cat thanks so much man okay so on your uh we have

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well hello steve schultz here with the elijah list and elijah streams if you'll notice both above and below we're recording this tuesday afternoon at 206 p.m but this is being recorded for tomorrow's episode which is you'll be seeing this on june 8th i'm sorry june 9 recording it on june 8 to be aired on june 9. so we'll put that ticker across the bottom on and off so you'll be reminded of the fact so you'll actually be able to know two things when did we actually say what we said and when did you watch it so uh it could be maybe a little confusing but if you're like me you'd want to know both of those facts so so if cat or any of our prophets say something you want to know when it was actually said not when we said it was said or not when it aired it's not as important as when it was said so all right so welcome to another episode of elijah streams we'll bring kat on here in just a moment a quick reminder that uh to subscribe to elijahlist.com it's always free uh that way we can notify you at all times of anything happening new and then uh as usual we will remind you to subscribe to uh to youtube's channel of elijah stream so you go to youtube.com and in their search box you type elijah streams either one or two words it doesn't matter and up it will come when it does click the thumbs up click the red subscribe and the bell always make sure it's red before you click on it so thumbs up a red subscribe and the bell alright uh i think that's it let's jump right into bringing kat on for you and here she is i'd say good morning because i'm used to seeing it morning but it's after what is it like five o'clock your time right now yeah it's a little past my my breakfast time because noon is about your right you said you told us last time you go to bed about six in the morning something like that yes yes but i had to get back up at 9 00 am to take care of some stuff so my day was a little different today but here i am and i'm excited to be here and as he said this is actually the day you see this will be the 9th of june 2021 so people can't take these videos we make and put a fake date on it i do know some people actually will show some stuff and say this is new stuff and actually it was it could have been taped three years ago it's still good stuff but but it may not be what what what we wanted to say for this time so i'm also going to repeat here's my little this is my technology there you go right there right there that's the date you're watching [Applause] so i'm not very techie oh yeah well we've gotten both screens are doing it so people will be well informed so cat so we're going to jump into questions in just a few moments on heaven and and other things related to the kingdom but anything you have to say about the current events before we do that yes really um some real exciting things are definitely going on and as i said in the past you're not going to hear them from the uh the fake news and uh or neither on other social media that is uh owned and operated by liberals you're just not going to hear it they don't want you to know every time somebody has failed at something or some law they want to pass a bill they want to pass failed miserably and i can tell you what california is opening up on its own and i happen to know that they can no longer prevent people from having um not having their services anymore it actually went to court and they upheld the the the lawsuit that was stopping everyone from going to church and everything so i'm very happy for them i'm celebrating yay california hey go california so the person who's been a nuisance to you newsom i don't know what's going to happen to him but probably not going to be very good i know he's getting his stuff from people higher up than him and probably even more wicked but however it's all going to fall and crumble because we know that satan is not going to win at this time and i'm always going to encourage you don't step back don't stop celebrating now celebrating doesn't mean you ignore everything it doesn't mean that you don't take authority over it absolutely take authority over everything spoken that you know is not of god there's the plains of satan say i reject that in jesus name it will be cast down any words you speak that agree with god are very powerful at this time so make sure you're doing that the other thing is this oh i've got something that's new right now it's really cool so i'm going to go ahead and let you all hear it and i want to thank people who sent this to me but when i keep talking about how much the left has failed um okay i think i'm going to turn it on here we go [Laughter] i mentioned that on one of the shows we did and four different people sent me four of these things so um it's going to be a lot of fun using it we're going to have a lot of opportunities to use it the holy spirit said so even though it may not look to you that things have changed there was definitely a huge shift and i can tell you on july the 4th i'm not naming dates that this is when everything will end or even begin but there's going to be a major shift in the spirit i heard hank talking about that too but i had heard also and i had other prophets contact me who i haven't heard from a year said the expectancy and excitement in them has exploded on the inside for victory so i want you to know if you're feeling that that is what god wants you to feel we call those things to be not as though they were it makes a difference in the spirit realm also wherever i've been going lately i've had such powerful activity of the army of heaven around me but i've got reports from other people sending me this stuff and boy i'm telling you what they're really busy right now so you definitely going to hear more about things that are failing they've already had to admit and if you didn't know this they've already had to admit that the virus was created in the lab in china certain people knew about that and they've taken advantage of all of us as a lot of people very upset right now we're the ones leading the left they knew all about it they want to keep us apart they want to keep us muffled it isn't going to work here in america we are the brave and the free and the righteous amen that's so so good you know they tried literally to humiliate and destroy and and obliterate anything that came out of trump's mouth when he said that originated in a lab he called it the china virus they called him racist they called him crazy they called all things and they many of them knew all along that it was from a lab and and they just because they had the media the mainstream media with the lame street street media you know they they had you know they just sat there and lied and lied and lied and they gave each other high fives in between commercial breaks they knew they were they were trying to destroy him with their words and with their coverage and now coming home to roost uh you know using a mixed metaphor they really do know that they're they're affecting your soul by saying stuff the way people get brainwashed not just in foreign countries anywhere that people want to use that method they won't tell you the same thing over and over and over again until you believe it whatever your soul is filled with is what you will believe that's why we encourage you not to listen to the fake news or any reports from people any wicked evil stuff and one of the new things going around that they're trying to do is say that good is evil but evil is good and i never heard a clear description of what the message is they're trying to give right now to tear america apart tear our values apart even our lives apart by trying to convince you that good is evil and we know that's a lie from hell we know where that came from so don't believe that that mess and those lies and yet we're in a season now and if you can you can feel it in the atmosphere where there was a season where we were so careful about everything we said we didn't want to say too much and people think we're crazy if you've noticed that that's there's a shift in that and we're even on this program we're getting a little more bold and brazen and and and right back at you kind of thing and we're not apologizing for it you know there be so many things are failing them on the left that they're right pedaling as fast as they can just to stay afloat and not look like they're sweating but they're they know they're losing so oh yeah they're very very very afraid of a lot of things right now and i think some of them are actually becoming convinced that their plan is failing and you may see some people withdrawal from that stuff it may even be a few people at the top that are going to just drop the whole lie because they're going to realize they won't have a life and they're already been found out there's so much more evidence being gathered without even you knowing about people that have so much it's almost outrageous the evidence they have against the left against all those who lied and they and the people who lie can't get away with it because they did it openly and it's all recorded so i think if i were them i'd go find a prayer chamber and start praying up to god maybe changing what i'm saying or you can't force things onto people you can't take a free country and convince them they're communist that's just not going to work and boy god's going to make sure everybody knows that that that that lie of communism is not good it is evil and we're going to stay free in america and the more people i meet as i travel around the country you're right steve they already have freedom is in their heart and they are openly speaking against things they would they would never say before no one's forcing people and a lot of establishments are saying no i don't have to wear a mask anymore everybody knows that whole thing was made up and it was a lie to keep us muffled so we couldn't come together for heaven's sakes if we all come together as as the body of christ and as true americans this country is going to be in a good place because the lies and the evil when it's rejected and it says when you reject the works of satan he will flee from you so make sure you're staying powerful that's good i'm going to jump into some questions and answers now some of you if you're new kat has been to heaven thousands of times and many other people are going on trips to heaven these days before it's done i'm going to go i haven't gone yet but yeah yeah but it's going to happen but one of the first questions and i'm going to get some kids ones right after this first one but there was a gentleman he filled like two pages with questions and all of them were kind of hard to get a handle on but one of them he said is how can i because i understand we're supposed to celebrate cat says we're supposed to celebrate and eat cake and he said how are my supposed to celebrate he goes i understand that on the one hand how do i celebrate when there's human trafficking and slavery and abortions how am i so how am i supposed to celebrate amidst that what would you say to that i would say that he set the table in the presence of your enemies and one of the way uh we really do uh put a thorn in the flesh of satan and by the way he's the one promoting and using and empowering people to do all those wicked things you're not celebrating instead of doing something about that we're celebrating because we know it is going to come to an end because even that is going to be fully exposed and it will change everything's about to change for the good of god and satan is going to the biggest blow he's ever had in his kingdom except when christ rose from the dead so these are powerful days and of course you're not supposed to be ignorant or act like that doesn't matter you are supposed to be taking authority over all that wicked evil stuff you're supposed to be commanding the army of having to go pull down the strongholds of satan that is empowering that stuff to happen so we are calling those things to be not as though they were by celebrating and if the father said celebrate like it already happened he means it because it is going to happen and it's better to have celebration in your soul operating in the power of god then repeat all the wicked evil things that are so uh so sorrowful and suffering we know that's in the earth and it won't ever really totally go away until we're on the new earth christ comes and wipes out everything at one point and everything changes for our life then but while we're here now we make a difference against the darkness we have a right to celebrate when we're pushing it back and crushing the plans of the enemy because we're actually helping to keep stuff from happening you have no idea what would have happened or what has happened already and in the background you don't know where so much of this is being exposed openly to people who will do something about it so you have to still celebrate and keep that in your soul so you will be ready when that happens so good so good all right let's jump into a couple other a number of other questions but we start with kids questions sometimes and here's a little four-year-old uh parker who says he wants to know if he can be a cowboy okay here's the full question can i be a cowboy with cowboy guns in heaven he knows there's rodeos up there he says he knows there's rodeos out there he wants to know can he be a cowboy with cowboy guns he can definitely be a cowboy all the time if he wants to and there's even places you go to in heaven to enjoy all of that they have rodeos in heaven they even have cattle drives you can ride on a cattle drive like in the old wagon train days and yes i'm quite sure he can have cowboy guns nothing in heaven hurts anybody so you can't shoot and hurt somebody with it but i'm sure that you can dress fully out as a cowboy and enjoy yourself uh actually living it in heaven instead of just pretending you'll literally be living it so hope you enjoy continuing to to believe for that i can imagine since there's contests and and games in heaven and amusement i used to love to go to disneyland as a 10 year old and we'd go to the shooting gallery and and you'd shoot and it was so it was one of my favorite things to do in all of disneyland because we didn't have guns at home we had toy guns but but and then they got politically correct and i don't think we think he can find a shooting gallery anymore but i can imagine there being shooting tests i mean economics my point was there's no weapons in heaven that could harm somebody there and actually nobody could be harmed anyway i mean nobody can get injured harm hurt handicapped or died especially i'm sure if you go to the rodeos up there's all kinds of shooting galleries and things like that you can take a part of roping calves uh even riding a bunk bucking bronco i know that happens but the horse is talking to you the whole time you're being bucked and that horse is saying there's no way you ride me you aren't staying on me and so there's a whole new um understanding about life in heaven that wouldn't happen on the earth yeah i could imagine that this is my imagination going wild where ta tag tag in heaven is a little different thing everybody has guns and you and the guns can't hurt you but they can go through and they kind of tag you with their guns and you do that whole well they do have paintball guns down here where people actually do that i i don't want to be part of it because i don't really like getting very messy i was the kid who wore gloves in the sandbox people i wasn't going to get it oh you did no wonder wondering you don't like fish you wear gloves in the sandbox that's a new one yeah i did my mom will actually validate that for sure she lives there she knows i didn't want to get sand down my hands and i live in florida what what about that so anyway there's so many fun exciting things to do up there but i i guarantee you i saw john wayne i guarantee you going cattle drives you just drive the cattle from one side of heaven to the next you have a big uh barbecue somewhere along the lines along the way and it's so much fun to live there so i love the imagination of children i think it was a brand new brand i don't think it was i know it was completely new concept when i began reading your books and stories seven eight years ago whatever it's been now and you said there's amusement parks i'm going what amusement park and i because we didn't know what you did for eternity but you sure didn't do go to shooting galleries rodeos disneyland type activities go to old car shows have cooking contests buy eating cut you know but you're saying a lot of those things are fun things that that were probably originated in heaven and yeah shadowed on earth if i could put it that way right were you startled the first time god showed you an amusement park in heaven i i could have been startled because when i go there i'm like eight years old i mean every eight-year-old expects to expect to see fun things but they'll ride on the roller coaster where goes on part of the track then it goes through the sky and back to the other side of the park back onto the track so there's a huge difference being enjoying these things in heaven than there is on the earth and that was one of the first things they showed me was a fun place in heaven so i've never done anything he showed me uh when you get up there there are some people who have to be taken to the welcome center because they're not quite sure they're in heaven that you could love god but they never expected the fun to be there although the father said you must be like a little child to enter into the kingdom of heaven so we should have all expected it and for those who are new you describe again quickly for that you said in heaven is it like 50 50 50 fun that we would have called secular it's just fun and the other 50 percent worshipping is that about right or how how would you describe that i would say 50 is is holy and a wonderful and powerful with the presence the absolute presence of the living god consuming you going in you and around you hearing him everywhere in heaven all the time nobody has to say i wish i could hear god in heaven or the lord he'll show up all the time all over heaven to spend time with you but so part of it is what i would consider if you're going to the the church and the parole of god is there and i'll see the seraphim coming down out of the ceiling from heaven i see all these beautiful things there's such splendor in heaven but the wonder it says heaven is a wonder it's a wonder and it's splendor the wonder is the fun side and absolutely i would have to say 50 50 half of all of heaven is about fun and excitement and and enjoying yourself up there with all of your friends and family the other half was all about being with him being his presence and sometimes jesus will ride the roller coasters with you or he could even be a cowboy himself i'm sure he's probably done that before i want to ask about this this wasn't on my list but you had said if everyone has a garden at their mansion and god jesus will come and spend time with you which of course unless jesus and the lord or whatever can be all places at once this would never be possible i heard you say once that you can spend as much time with jesus i think you said it i don't want to quote quote it wrong as you wanted in heaven which is impossible in any kind of way that we would think of and can i be selfish for lack of a better word and spend lots and lots and lots of time with jesus just me and my and myself and i of course you can and you know he wants to be with you also but i've i've explained before that you you are made even you yourself every human has a layers now every doctor and scientist they know that you have layers in your physical body you have layers in your spirit man you have layers in your soul which is also a spiritual thing the bible says your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you choosing all your emotions which should be joy happiness and celebration those are emotions and i know there are other ones in heaven those are mainly the ones you have in heaven are all those fun emotions exciting emotions so they as father son and holy spirit they are limited they have unlimited layers of themselves and the layer of them can step out and be someone they could be a hundred all over heaven different ones it's still him and still them and that i know you know heaven should make your mind go bonk yeah because it's heaven so yes you do get a garden it's a part of your mansion and jesus gives you a key now that key may not look like a regular key you see on the earth it could be a beautiful piece of uh jewelry or something on a chain that you would wear maybe around your waist or something and it's alive when you pick it up it's alive and you set it in the lock you set in like a sunset when you do the garden gate opens and only you have that and christ has that when you go in that garden he'll come every time to meet with you kev when you when you're with the lord and you've got all the time you want with him the will people in heaven say to the lord one day could you explain what happened on earth when such and such happened and what what can you ask him to explain something or are you so enraptured with the present you don't look back in the past and have questions you were so enraptured with him that all those type of memories those type of memories if they would be not good memories maybe they were harmful maybe they were traumatic they're like dust they are so like dust because to you and have none of that really matters and mostly you don't even think about it you may give they give testimonies in heaven but it's a powerful testimony to give about his power and his love for you but most of the time you're thinking about how joyous it is and how powerful and amazing it is the price he paid for you to give you this beautiful place to be with with him forever and ever whether it's this the whether it's uh heaven that's there now or whether it's going to be the new earth and the new heavens that he will make one day for all of us so at that time the new earth won't be just our home their home is heaven our home is the earth i know you go home to heaven but when he makes the new earth it will be our home and he's going to put all of us on it first this is at the end of everything he'll put all of us other believers on the new earth he will come down on the new city of jerusalem all the way down and it'll sit on the earth and we'll be together forever although we will go all over in the cosmos doing things and creating even with him things so he had this plan before we were born when we lived in the father he had this plan with the father on what would happen and how they would handle it and he always had hope for you to know him and i had these these words come to me maybe an hour or so ago i was just sitting and i heard the lord say if they really want to know me tell them to stop begging tell them to stop thinking i can't do this this is never going to happen if they want to know me they have to say not necessarily jesus come and rescue me jesus take this away they need to say jesus i want to know you i want to know you like i've never known you before i want to know about you i want to be like you that draws his heart to you if you want him to come say something that makes him want to come and when you're focusing on him it says when you when you pursue him and seek him with all of your heart that would be your soul then you're going to find him and i remember when i was seeking him i would just say i want to be with you i want to know you more i said that for a while when as i was growing up and one day just saying that he walked through the wall of my home and he never stopped coming after them his heart is for you to know him above all else no matter what we experience to go through even right now the greatest thing you can do is look up look up and say i want to know you more you know i'm going i want your will your way so blesses his heart help me to love others more the one thing i've encouraged you not to say is don't ask for a mantle of humility don't ask for it before things happen to have you get humble because you're going to have the accelerated version of that and my brother tried that one time it didn't work out well yeah i i used to ask for faith and i thought i'd changed my prayer up i said yeah i say well i i want uh faith but lord i want the gift version of faith i want the gift of faith i don't want to i don't want you that means you're going to go through trial so your faith can grow that's what that means yeah i want the gift i want the gift version okay here's elijah who is nine years old he says is it true that people went to the moon and landed on it or is it a lie do you know did god tell you that is absolutely true that is absolutely true we here in america we have a landing on the moon that actually did happen uh a couple of astronauts armstrong neil armstrong them were strong believers and i don't even know if anybody they quoted the word of god they prayed while they were on the moon that was not a fake just like people try to convince you certain people will try to tell you the earth is not round boy they have missed it completely jesus sits about above the circle of the earth people i would say that's round okay and i've been out through the heavenlies earth is round all the planets around it's just the way god designed them to be so you just have to believe god when these things happen but i have always wanted to be an astronaut my whole life now god says i am but i don't need a space suit [Laughter] convince me of these uh these um these things that they come up with in their own mind they think that there's a middle earth and people keep looking for the middle earth it's it's the only thing that was ever in the middle of the earth would be at abraham's bosom which was above hell and that's not even it's still there but no no one's in that right now you're never going to find it because it's a spiritual place this physical body can't go looking for things in the spirit hoping you'll find them that's good that's cute all right here's a question and i'm going to dovetail from something you told me a few episodes ago where i had i was just talking and i said to you that my um my dad made it maybe by the skin of his teeth he but he made it with the lord and he's with the lord now and you interrupted and you said every the lord says every time you say that your dad loves to hear that and i thought wow that was done did that build me up but so but i thought oh how would he you know he'd be busy in heaven that but he would stop and want to hear that which made me think on behalf of the viewers what kind of things might they say that would bless the heart of their relatives that have gone before them would they say things like i'm so glad my mother made it i'm so glad that the what what kind of things would they say here that they could be overheard by their loved ones in heaven that would bless them i think the greatest thing anyone could say just look up and say i'm so excited for you that you are living like you've never lived before i can't wait to be with you one day i know you're keeping a list of places to take me to and i'm looking forward to it because you're showing them you have faith you really believe heaven is real you really believe that they're there that that blesses the heart of everyone in heaven wow that's good that's really really good okay uh here's a question from terry says i have a question for kat she says the father carries us inside of him before we come to earth like little baby spirits is there a finite number of these spirits inside of him and will all of them eventually be sent to the earth is there a quote last person sent kind of thing like when like when the last one sent that's the end of time what what would you know about that now who's that who asked that question terry terry you have a really good friend with the holy spirit okay because he's actually the one who put that in your mind almost never and all the years i have done this has somebody asked me that question now i was told the answer by the father himself because i'm willing to lay down my life give i'm giving my life away trust me i am and i love everybody watching even those who are on the wrong side the wrong track going down the wrong path my heart is that you know god don't miss your destiny don't regret that you had opportunities to know christ and let them pass you you don't want to get in by the skin of your teeth but they're even happy that do but i can tell you that was told personally to me by the father and it's usually a young person who figures that out and yes i may as well say it publicly now it's okay to say it publicly the father said there is a number and it isn't infinite there will come a day when he sends the last one that's why i tell people when the world ends it's not a date like march the 12th or whatever whatever it will be an event and that's what he's always had me say when this certain event takes place he will no longer need the earth nor the physical realm he created it the whole reason he created this earth and physical realm was so he could send us from himself let me take a drink everybody's like what what and it actually makes sense the answer does make sense and what they said makes sense if he has a number whether it could be billions that lived in him there's no limit to inside of god if you could look inside of him you would see no back or size to him there's no human body parts inside of him there's this beautiful powerful river of life that you can see flowing up there's these massive gemstones inside of him that have fire in them around in the water around him and that's what causes the rainbow to shoot out of him that was something else he showed me but he told me because you're willing to do this i'm going to give you the answer to a mystery that's always been the day the earth will be needed no more is the day i send the last one from myself wow wow wow first time people publicly first time you you were listening at the right time it makes sense if you were god and you carried all of these billions of little spirits of life he knew every one of you when you were that inside of him you played with him you swam in the river of life that's why we like gemstones because they're inside him they're stones of revelation they're stones of fire inside of him it talks about him in ezekiel 28 go look it up so that's where our life was you could ride in and out on the rays of the rainbow but you couldn't go any further you were a little spirit of spiritual being you couldn't go find someplace in heaven to live you only lived in him before you were here and then he decided it was your time to be sent to the earth had you born in the earth why so you would have flesh you'd have a flesh body not just a spirit one and so that was his purpose why would he need to keep this physical realm or this earth that's why he says he's going to roll it away right she's going to roll it away and make it all brand new have a brand new earth it will be physical and spiritual bound together forever and we will live forever and ever with immortal bodies at that time so somebody heard the holy spirit yeah that was a first well who knew i did i you know i almost didn't read that one because i thought i didn't know where to go yeah wow that's really really good um so someone wants to know cat can you tell us if you've seen any of the founding fathers presidents i guess they're thinking like george washington and and the like benjamin franklin i don't know she's his name or i actually have i actually have seen some of the founding fathers and this is the thing they're wonderful powerful most all of them many many i'll say many were powerful men of god or women of god you know i mean the president's had wives and uh that betsy ross and all these other powerful women that did things for for us here on planet earth i saw many of them in heaven george washington was one of them and i know right now many people bash him and falsely accuse him it's easy to do it when he's not here to defend himself so i will okay he was powerful he prayed over almost every battle that they went into he had miracles and some of those battles george washington did benjamin franklin was a powerful man of god god gave him those inventions to bring to the to uh you know he sent them down him so we would have him on the earth um thomas jefferson um a paul revere i mean i have seen so many of the founding fathers of this country and they are in heaven wow wow oh that's just amazing and okay oh here's one that i i almost didn't uh read but i'm just going to read it can you please ask cat what god thinks about the death penalty i will say that it talks about in the bible about what he what he actually thinks about somebody he's all against murder he's all totally against wickedness and evil and it says that you will pay for crimes in the bible it says that and i will just say this to you god has a justice system himself and justice is going to be served these people people who got away with wicked evil things and we sometimes have to create laws good laws to protect us okay if you know that there's going to be a uh that you will have to answer to your crimes and most all of them know that there is a death penalty when you do certain acts of evil and wickedness i am not against it i am not against the death penalty i think if people did wicked evil things they murdered a lot of people and did it with vengeance and they loved to do it it's something that they actually thrived on doing it i think that they should pay the ultimate price they took lives and this wasn't like in war and war it's a little different if evil people are attacking and then you are the army who's helping to defend and protect uh why do you think god has an army why does he have an army what does he have the host of heaven to push back and i know that some of those demons are punished very severely by god for attacking people they shouldn't have attacked so there has to be somewhere a code of ethics that protect the people that protect our lives or people would be going around killing anybody they want to by the way that happens in a lot of communist countries just to give you a tip about that in some countries they have no such thing they don't even have a legal system now most of these people uh who who are uh have the death penalty they've been to court they got to show evidence against stuff like that they had a day where they wanted to try to defend their self and they gave evidence that evidence didn't stand up to what really was the truth and the truth that was found out i think people better think twice before they decide to have a life of crime yeah yeah interesting okay how frequently does cat couple fasting with her prayers i live a fasted life i don't just choose a day to fast i fast all the time uh there's some things i haven't even had or eaten for like six year period there's certain things usually the best things are my favorite things i'll just lay them down or god will sometimes ask me to lay them down um so i live a fasted life we went to israel with you and you were not allowed to have pizza i don't know if that's still going or if that was during his israel no it's still going wow no chocolate ice cream no pepper and no pizza and it's been six years since he said that to me well that's now that's that's a sacrifice and i mean it literally is because those are things you really really love yeah okay so so you're a pro fasting you know even though i am you know things don't happen without fasting and prayer certain things that are really maybe tough things or really hard things coming against you it even says that jesus said some things don't come out they were talking about the time when the demon the disciples said why can't we cast this demon out of this person and god says jesus says some things don't don't happen without fasting in prayer it makes you focus on the power of god and what is right with god and what he wants and his desire that's what fasting is it's not about you not eating although that's part of it it makes you focus on what he wants in other words you're not feeding the flesh you're feeding your spirit man but living a fasted life means i could go and not even eat i could eat for six days and it wouldn't bother me because i don't eat very much food anyway so the hard things for me to really and one time he had me do the royal fast better be glad we're not all doing that he wouldn't let me wear my favorite clothes he wouldn't let me go to my favorite places this is really just you know um stretching my flesh or putting my flesh even down even more and so it wasn't even about the food thing it was about not doing everything you take it for granted and i like to go here i'll go do this today i want to see that and so for like a whole year i did this royal fast but i was different at the end of it though because i didn't depend on those things from my life it was the presence of god wow i'm glad i asked that uh someone wants to know what happens in heaven if you've seen anything happen in heaven when a shofar is is blown i guess they're wanting to know if there's something unique about a shofar being blown on earth does something does it move something in heaven i guess that was probably the question well and the spirit realm it absolutely does every time somebody blows a shofar i see rainbows bands of the rainbow shooting out really and oh yeah i do i see bands of the rainbow shooting out uh of the shofar whenever i'm around anyone who does that that's god putting his presence and his frequency in that shofar blast and i know that the for a blast can mean different things some it's like good old get ready for war or coming me or just honoring god announcing and declaring with god something the shofar is very important they play them in heaven they blow them in heaven a lot that's interesting wow okay uh so many people say that you see feathers when i guess they mean when feathers fall down like you're well you're in the room and there's feathers fall down the angels are present can you tell us about this and have you seen other manifestations of heavenly activities like oil gemstones gold glitter and that sort of thing a lot of people don't know that's real or not oh there's one one of it is really a personal thing about angels that the holy spirit told me this i would see angels during meetings go to the upper part of their wing where the feathers are smaller more delicate and they actually would brush them like this really and i would see them falling down nobody can see the angel but i would actually see them and people would in that meeting find feathers or later find one on themselves that they didn't have before some of them are very very fine and white and wispy very beautiful the other thing i saw going on when i'm in meetings you have to remember everybody's guardian angel comes with them so if you're from like five different countries and ten states or something you're seeing all these different angels you may not have ever been in the presence of before and other angels probably haven't seen each other for quite a while some are have friends i know how an angel how an angel demonstrates they want to be a friend with another angel they actually will take one of their bigger feathers they'll actually pull it out and they'll hand it to that angel pull one out of theirs and hand it to that angel they exchange feathers really it's a sign of cool that's cool well and then okay that then begs the question are there some angels that as we speak are becoming friends and they're going to be friends for the rest of eternity then because they just met yes wow very cool i love it okay here's a guardian angel question and i think i understand it says i'm curious this is laurie l-a-u-r-e i haven't seen that spelling but lori i'm curious what it's like for a person's guardian angel if that person is sold out to the devil and of course i think you said everyone has guardian angels i don't know if they leave at some point but like let's say you've got a hitler okay does guardian angel stick with him or do they just say i'm out of here at some point i can't answer for hitler he had a lot of demons around him all the time um i know that most people almost everybody has more than one almost everybody has at least two guardian angels and i do know this even if somebody is not living right the guardian angels stay with you they they may walk a little bit further i think i mentioned that before maybe to you or to someone else that if you're going through a part of your life where you are just giving yourself to the darkness enjoying it loving it it does concern your angels concern for you they were sent to watch over you protect you and uh and the angels can say things in your ears without you knowing you'll think it's your own self saying it sometimes like i like you me here in your mind i need to study my bible more i need to get a bible i need to start praying i need to start you know checking out some of these things people are saying about what god is doing right now that's probably your angel saying that to you they always speak they don't speak like you know they won't act like it's them saying it but they will say so they're there to help guide you to and help you and when you're not doing right sometimes let's say somebody's been a christian a long time and they decide to step back and oh i'm just gonna go do it i want to they may want to kick you in the seat of your pants and the reason i say that is because i actually have talked to somebody who saw this husband and wife would witness all the time in the streets and and they did it really good and this one day i guess the husband wasn't really feeling up to it and so here come this person and the wife said you go ahead and minister them i'll minister to this other person well she was a seer so she was across the street talking to person and she looked and and her husband was not really putting out the effort to connect you know they were say have a nice chitchat talk and she saw this guy's angel behind him with his foot raised like he was going to kick him in the seat of the man really and the angel was saying you know to do better than that you need to do this person needs christ yes she could hear the angel so these angels have emotions we have emotions i mean they would they're not robots that's what i say all the time so they get happy when you spend time with god they get happy when you help people oh they get blessed when you help people and maybe even people that haven't been nice to you when you reach out to give to others or do somebody you see somebody in need and you actually give them something your angel rejoices and looks up to god and say thank you for letting me be their guardian angel wow wow well you know that that makes me think of a question about you know over the last probably especially probably in the years since i've known you six or seven years seven eight years whatever has been i've had more activity of angels um where i will be let's say i'm napping and i'll be like that they'll just hit me on a thing and i know it's not the devil because it's nothing bad there's nothing slimy i haven't had a bad dream but sometimes i can't figure out why did you bother to wake me up if i'm napping there's nothing significant about the clock there's no impression what was that about why did i get you know i don't mind it it didn't slime me but why did i get away awakened without another impression like this well number one they're probably trying to stretch your flesh [Laughter] if anybody wakes me up i'm just going to start declaring i'll start declaring a decree i start uh you know just adoration for god and then i'll lay back down if it happens again i'll just stay up and i go out i'll go outside and start talking and ministering to the lord myself and tell you how much i love him appreciate him i'm so grateful that they made me me i like who i am because christ chose me to do this and i said yes to him i thank him for the opportunity so maybe you should try that but the reason almost all the time i'll have angels and i'll see them uh every now and then i won't see one but they'll come up behind they'll tap me on the shoulder i know that's my angel saying i am here i'm here i got your back you know and so i even sometimes for me they'll come up and they'll nudge me like this even if i'm talking and i remember being in a prayer room in florida this prayer room was round it was so holy and anointed they'd never let anyone speak before you would come in and worship you had to take your shoes off have your feet washed it was this really powerful place but they invited me to come and talk about heaven i could hardly stand up when i walked in the room there were so many angels i almost couldn't see the people that were there wow and these angels were jostling everybody and everybody could feel they have they were going like this to everybody in the room was feeling that and it was the angels that were present were so excited that heaven would be shared in that room it wasn't me it was what would be said that got them excited so i'm i have a picture of me barely hanging on to this pulpit they found and brought in there i could hardly stand up because of the presence of god there crazy wow that's fun stuff okay here's another supernatural sort of question this is kaylee i don't know how old she is i uh one time i was rocking my baby in the night and i dozed off but when i came to for a split second i and this got cut off this is one of those that got cut off on the printer so i but i remember most of it for a split second i saw she doesn't mean like when i finished reading it wasn't like i thought i saw i saw my mother standing in the room and then it was gone and i think the question was could that be real was that okay would god do that would her mother do that so talk about that for a moment there are too many reports of that happening the evidence is already out there it has been for years and years every now and then whether to bless the person you see the blessed person in heaven especially if it's someone who's just went to heaven every now and then for whatever reason god decides he'll let you come back for a brief moment he doesn't let people come back people don't come back down here and live here that's not going to happen i know the cloud of witnesses sometimes they're sent to give a message to somebody specifically and i've seen a couple people i've seen like enoch and elijah down here on the earth uh they were sent by god just because he felt like it to say something to me to encourage me i i have seen my dad not actually on the floor ground i've seen this my ceiling open i saw my dad in heaven and he just said good job said to me good job but every now and then i've heard too many people with real great integrity that they would be awakened somebody that they knew had died they haven't walked through the wall and just said i want you to know i'm so happy and i'm doing great and they would smile and then they would leave so i'm not going to say that's impossible god is sovereign and what he chooses to do to bless he's going to do it awesome and this was a bit sobering and i've had this kind of question myself so it's not my question but actually their son's name is elijah elijah my son elijah passed away at 27 weeks in the womb with a heart defect i prayed and prayed but god took him anyway i always feel the sorrow in this my question is why does god send a baby to earth just to take him directly back is there a reason for that also is it possible that they could have a heavenly purpose instead of an earthly one and that's why some were taken away so obviously someone's grasping for meaning without this being this woman's fault god burst puts this baby in and then it doesn't make it she's so she's what can you tell someone like this that's not an easy question to answer but again i know that god is sovereign one i i can only give examples of what has happened before what i've actually had to say to people i had friends um my daughter had friends up north in washington state and they had prayed and prayed for a baby to forgot to give him a baby and the baby was growing in the womb and doing well for a while was doing well and then she was having issue after issue after issue with the baby in her womb and then um when she went and had a sonogram i think she was only maybe weeks away from it being born wow um i know that when it was born she got to hold it and the family members got to hold it and they just was was telling this little baby even though it had already passed that they loved it that they would see it in heaven one day and she's been totally healed from all that but this is what god said to me um that night now this was probably the night before he was taken or when he was taken uh god said to me these words and he's never said before he was struggling so hard i decided to take him so it was a response that way the baby what was going on with the baby itself that was struggling to survive and it wasn't a good report that she was getting they said that it wouldn't live at all beyond a certain time and it was still a lot it was living for a while god said it was struggling so hard i just took him and i have him he is with me and i gave that word to the mother and it healed her whole heart and i said also to tell her you will have other children and she did have other children i will also say this which will probably tweak the mind of a lot of legalistic people out there god is god and when he decides and makes a decision for something it's going to happen i do know this there have been people who god sent a baby to sent this little baby to them he needed him in the earth it was about he needs certain time when certain people are born he times your birth on this earth and sometimes if there's issues that arise either in the mother and the or the or the birthing of the child god will reach in and take that spirit back now this is wild but this really did happen took the spirit back and he said i put it back inside myself and i will send him again now how about that people how do you like that god is sovereign he's the one who carries us he's the one who sends us to this earth and he said i need him in the earth and i will rescind him in other words he'll knit him together in the womb again and then that baby will be born in the earth because he's supposed to be one of the greatest leaders he said he's going to be a great leader in the earth i need him here so instead of just letting him live in heaven i decided i'd take him put him back in me and i'll resend him wow you know kim clement did a um had a song once it had to do with the the towers that fell in 911 and he talked about the children i don't know how many children perished in the 911 i don't know if there was a child care daycare or anything there but but there was some children there had to be some and he sang a song about children that worked and the words go and i'm going to give them back to you i give them back to you so that makes me think of that was god potentially promising to take some of those and put him back in the earth i'm absolutely positive that's what he meant because that's what he had explained to me and there were pregnant women that did pass away and and and the baby passed away also the little spirit of the baby so the possibility of if the spouse did there's a possibility that they could remarry but he would still take that same spear that same little baby and put him in the womb of this new wife marrying this person because he needs that baby he needs that person on the earth when they grow up and i think kim was absolutely correct that there were some that god kept and he will rescind them and that's what the only way they can come is through the womb you have to come through the womb like christ himself he couldn't just make christ okay i'm gonna put flesh on you and stick you on yours now you're there he had to go through the womb of a woman he had to have the blood number one but he also to have to be able to operate on earth like a human and feel everything we did but he didn't just wave a little wand or something like that that he was going to be here he made them go through the womb of a woman so when he rescends these little spirits because remember one day there will be no more he will have sent all of them at one time that's the event when time time stopping doesn't mean by the way i need to add this time stopping doesn't mean we will stop existing that means they won't need to count hours and days and months and weeks anymore time also you know time is tied to this physical realm and even in heaven before the earth was made which i've been taken back they didn't have clocks on the walls they didn't keep track of things they didn't have calendars weeks and months in heaven it was timeless so at one point when time will be no more which is what the bible says that means we won't need time to keep track of this physical body or the physical happenings heaven operates the same way god does how i heaven operates by events they don't have days when next thursday i'll meet you somewhere three days from now i'll meet you somewhere you just invite someone to come and be a part of what you're doing when you're ready to do that thingy just to make an announcement we're gonna have a celebration party you know my mom has joined us here so we're going to celebration party for that please come and it doesn't matter about days and minutes it's when it happens it's an event so when time is no more we'll still have events and get to do things but we won't have to keep track of the days and the months yeah that's okay and this seems to be a day for people to you know question some of the hard questions here's a question about the guardian angels and it says my mom and i have the same question for kat um if we all have at least one guardian angel and you said we all usually have about two each yes um how is it that things like fatal car accidents still occur when that's the reason they're there is to guard you that's one of those questions i just can't answer because i don't know i don't know every single plan of god or reason of god i don't know those i don't know all those answers of course because every single one of them are individual the people are different their purposes are different god's timing for when he needs them but the thing about um i know some young people were caught up in heaven because he appointed that to be their time to go home there was usually if someone young comes home to heaven he has given them a very powerful uh position not to labor so you'll labor no more no doing something with god exciting and amazing are being put over something in heaven that's a reward but sometimes it's your destiny like the young girl marissa that i found out about when i was caught up to heaven saw her she was 13 she passed away and it was from a skiing accident don't stop skiing just because i'm saying this but god knew the day she would go home and even a prophetess had prophesied to her mother when she was a little baby in her arms the prophet said that baby will not live a long life but her life will impact all the earth and it has impacted all the earth maurice's life and god told me it was time to choose a leader from the youth to be over the youth activities and preparing for the celebration that's coming and i chose marissa to have that position that's why she went at age 13 so that i can give as an example of why sometimes some people go and we don't understand it you will understand it when you get to heaven one day yeah and i think that story isn't needs to be told i suppose in contrast to someone who's trying to comfort someone who's lost their child and they said well god just needed a member of the choir or something like you're not saying this is a common thing that god needed something this is that was kind of like the exception to the rule yeah what he was telling interesting okay this one had just a couple more here that will be wrapped up for the day this one had written quite a number of paragraphs i'm just going to have to summarize she went on to say madeleine that there's a truck big old truck coming to one thing and she was coming to the other and there was about to be a collision and one you know it's very difficult to explain but basically she gets on the other side the truck driver gets on the other side they somehow made it without hitting she sees the truck driver do this in their hands like i can't believe i almost hit this woman she says you know cat's a seer she sees angels she sees she wants to know from your perspective what would what would have gone on because she said it was not possible for that to happen is there any way you could describe what what that might have looked like if you'd seen angels or whatever yes absolutely when that happens it's because of the spirit realm itself it it involves the spirit realm the spirit realm was the original realm before the physical realm was made the spirit realm supersedes and has authority over the physical realm and i actually have met some people that experienced something like that they were in a car headed for a head-on collision and they actually with their eyes open saw themselves pass through the other vehicle they actually passed through they saw the people in the other vehicle vehicle that should have hit him hit them what happened at that moment of almost impact was the spirit realm engulfed the people tony engulfed in the super the supernatural realm and they were in the supernatural realm when that passed through the physical vehicle which supersedes it so nobody would be harmed or hurt in any way they would actually get to see themselves passing through that and that's actually happened quite a few times already in the earth wow i will use an example in the bible when they were going to take jesus and throw him over the precipice we know we were there right we went yeah we were there we saw that place and uh and people used the whole thing saying jesus let himself down by a rope the bible doesn't mention a rope doesn't mention about jesus going down the side of the hill it says he walked through the people you didn't say that i think the crowds and people aren't thinking in their head man he just walked right through them that is exactly what happened jesus sidestepped and i mean that's all he did because the spirit runs over he sidestepped into the spirit realm was invisible to everybody there but because it's a spirit realm he walked right through literally through the people till he was all the way through them he stepped out of the end of the spirit realm and he was back in the physical realm and as another a short example of a miracle i had myself and and i actually did um encounter that i had worn my high school ring on this finger right here for many many many years um so i got it when i was in 11th grade i weighed about 89 pounds that was that ring was about a size five or four and a half and i never took it off so by the time i was like 40 you know uh there's no way you're going to get that ring off of your finger that's a long time and i'm double jointed so that's why i have big knuckles people uh i'm double jointed and so god had told me before take that ring off your finger i need to give you a king's ring and he had repeated it to me about four or five times and i said to god i understand that means i'll have to have it cut off and it's okay but if there's another way i can do it let me know because even though i'm not it's not like a treasure to me but it was something special because i was the first person in my family to graduate from high school and and my parents were very proud of that and they paid a lot of money it was like 60 some dollars but when you're feeding 15 people that's a lot of money and so i said well i would love to keep it intact and god said but you but you must take it off and so he didn't see anything more so a couple weeks went by and i just went in in the restroom to wash my hands and all of a sudden audibly the father says to me take the ring off now and i didn't think i grabbed i grabbed that ring and i pulled it through the bone through the skin because it engaged the spirit when the father wrapped the spirit realm around my finger i grabbed that ring the physical ring and pulled it through the spirit realm right off my finger and i still have it today it's whole it's never been cut i'd already told my mom several times he keeps he keeps asking me to take it off i ran out in the kitchen and said look mom and i showed her the whole ring and she said what happened i said you told me to take it off and i did [Laughter] so i do know that's how that works the spirit realm and christ himself also when he propelled the boat remember when he stepped in the boat it says and then they were there the place they were going in that boat was like 50 miles away okay when they he met the disciples at the shore stepped in the boat usually they go by boat to the other shore so they can minister that's not what happened that time it says he stepped in the boat and then they were there immediately so guess what they did they engaged with the spirit realm christ engaged the spirit realm and instantly instead of being there instantly they were on the shore just like when he stepped in the spirit room and avoided all the people that's something that is going to be happening in the body of christ and over the years there's been three or four people that have told me stories about suddenly they were at their destination there was supposed to be four hours i've heard that one i've heard so many times that i i don't not sure that i had that happen although i think i've accelerated and i think i've got some place in record time that is not supposed to be possible it's amazing how often god does that you know so that's what happens it's all about the spirit realm the supersedes this physical realm we all were leaving we all might my team went somewhere i think it was like atlanta and a couple of them drove their cars and they got back it's a six hour drive from atlanta to jacksonville they got back almost two hours before we did literally called us from here and i'm like you must have engaged a spirit room and said all they know is they were driving and the next time they looked out it wasn't it wasn't where they were driving it was a city that's crazy that's crazy but i believe that i believe that one wow wow cat you're stretching us but it's in a really good way gutster thing is well listen cat tell people how they can get a hold of your youtube site so i always like to have you share that yeah i have revealinghaven.com and revealing heaven is the name of the book the two books i wrote about heaven i am still working on book number three um and i didn't pick that name either i actually chose a tour guide to heaven and the holy spirit said we want to call it revealing heaven yeah he gets his way so revealing heaven.com is where you find products about heaven or the spirit realm where you'll find my books and other things that we have available for sale and then catker.com is a whole separate website and that website is completely free to go to there's all kind of videos interviews there's spirit realm truths that i talk about in there there's testimonies from people and it's the only place on the planet that you can give online to me so all these fake facebooks and youtubes that have my picture on it and say give me money and i'll help orphans or give me money and i'll go help people build this that's not my facebook uh people will put things or things type underneath my picture they'll even take the current one i have now and use it to to convince people that it's mine but i don't ask for money on my facebook or on youtube that's not me so catker.com is the one way that you can give if you'd like to give and i do thank everyone who helps to support me and everything that god has us doing we're all going to get very busy in the days ahead i can just say that everyone watching yeah we are aren't we so much well kat thanks a lot that was good by the time always zips by with you and me because the stories

say real quick yes um the spirit force mentoring thing is not happening right now uh god just likes to know certain things are going to happen it is going to happen there are certain things i'm still having created to have available for people and i'm still putting together my whole mentoring uh thing to see how many days that's going to be it will be an online course it will cost you nothing god will not let me charge for this mentoring he's hoping the body of christ will uh will watch it and be a part of it and learn how to rule through revelation as a member of the army of god we're the army of god on the earth we're not the host of heaven that's heaven's army but we're going to be working together even more and so we will let you know weeks ahead of time when the course will happen how you sign up for it eventually i may do a tour of different states and have like three days to teach it in person but right now we're planning to do the online thing so spirit force like the air

few weeks ago uh we're happy to have paul with us we hope to have him with us for many many years he's done a great job we've met him through some of you remember the story but but we met him online and we hired him uh and we're very happy to have him here uh let me just tell you ahead of time you now i remember you're watching this on wednesday the 16th so for you the next show is thursday uh june 17th with johnny in low and friday june 18th with ivana tia and things are really amping up in the spirit and with that in mind let's bring cat curry in here oh god i know we're not naming eight right now well i can just talk the rest of the show does she need something in her ear does she mean no okay i hear you now i couldn't hear when you were talking a second ago oh okay uh all right well so my question is you can hear me what what's your sense of how not not that we're naming dates but how close things are as far as bursting forth trump coming back and all that do you have a kind of a general sense i think something will happen um significantly before that actually does happen i know people are feeling a greater expectancy right now than they ever have before i've actually been hearing from other prophet friends saying it's got to be close because the expectancy is rising up in them and they can't like they can't stop it from just exploding on the inside of themselves and i i tell all of them it's not the one thing you wish would happen because i do know god has a timeline and is it is soon much sooner than people would think it was i know that what we're experiencing now will never be our normal and i i don't every time i say the new normal there is the new norm is god everywhere and freedom everywhere but i do know something is gonna something has shifted in the spirit realm already to set up all the rest that will happen but there are a few things that actually have to happen that will p people will see you know about it won't be something that will be hidden and it will have to be with the exposure that is that that will actually happen and especially in at one significant point it will be everywhere all the time like all day all night when when the great exposure that landslide starts happening and it's going to be one exposure after another naming people naming places naming the things they lied about the atrocities they committed it's all been recorded in heaven but it's not just recorded in heaven there are groups on the earth that were assigned to do certain things like what i'm talking about this the i'm talking about humans right now so you understand not spiritual but humans that the humans on the earth have been given specific assignments to keep evidence have so much evidence they don't know what to do with all of it and that all the evidence will be used one time where it's going to bypass the courts it's going to go past any uh any special groups looking at checking in to see what this evidence is all about it's going to be something so major that happens that triggers all of this exposure and so this stuff has to happen before trump is put back where he belongs he he is our president i have to say that again trump is our president at this moment he won the 2020 elections and i will say this more and more people in the general public are actually saying that uh even those who were waiting to see what would happen having seen what was being served to us now which was nothing but a bunch of lies deception and um you know compromising your soul with fear and other things the people of america have had enough of it i think one of the releases that shifted was the people like saying i'm not taking any more of this i know i've said that myself but i've heard other people say that i've just been in texas i was in tennessee i'm trying to remember other places i've been to recently and that is the atmosphere in every state i've been in the people have had enough for the left enough of the lies enough of the control and people know now of course it's already been proven that china did create that virus in a lab for the purpose of destroying america and certain people no i'm not talking about trump himself at all certain people knew this lie they were promoting with that lie and using it to keep us isolated to keep us muffled the mask isn't about whether you're going to catch something or not the mask was to take your voice away that you wouldn't have a voice that's what the left was that's what the devil wants and so that has been the main things we've been putting up with the social distancing you're not getting together people aren't listening to any of that stuff anymore they're doing what they want to they're living i think itself has been released into all of us into every state in all of america and it's already starting to flow over to other countries like in the uk and and other countries around the world are beginning to grab that as truths for themselves and i think that has to come first the reality of what they did and what their intent was it had to be seen and understood in the heart of everyday americans because some of them were still like no they're not really that bad that's not really what they want but there's been so much of one thing after another they made a lot of mistakes so i'm just going to push my fail button again and i can tell you that is what the left is done because they didn't get all their little ducks in a row the ducks have started biting them actually and even some of the people who followed them who were paid to do stuff are coming forward and they realize themselves even though they were paid to do something wicked their life would be taken away like everyone else in america if the left and the liberals had their way they would turn us into a communist country and they're not going to do it to america god has assured me over and over again that will never happen but people will see and understand what you get when you go after that lifestyle i think the reality that's the number one thing that had to happen was the reality of the majority of america had to see that those were lies that they were used themselves they were abused themselves they were cheated things were stolen and kept from them and that was all well planned out by the left and that reality is hitting hard in many states and there's this buzz going on online but not just online in the streets even in the store i've heard people talking about it so that is a reality of being known that people realize now they were controlled and on purpose by people they never dreamed would and different that that they would do that or want to do that but money money sells and money buys but money is not go going to steal our country here so i want to encourage everybody if you're hearing that buzz going around make sure you join that and say yes god let us know all along we knew all along that that the enemy was involved in all that so i think that's the major thing is we're going to hear it not just in the streets or in our churches or in businesses it doesn't matter where people are they're all hearing the same thing the proof has been given even without seeing the actual physical evidence because we have lived through this last year in a way that we never thought we would in times experiencing times but the words and the lies and the continual crushing crushing crushing of what america stands for why god created it what our hearts want what our hearts desire what we voted for was justice liberty and freedom and i think that really had to clearly be seen and talked about everywhere before god could move into his next phase of his plan but the expectancy that's rising up in the hearts of people everywhere but especially the prophets right now is get ready for celebration and of course the father says that to me outside don't stop celebrating i will set a table in the presence of your enemies and our enemies right now are the fake government the illegitimate villain who is sit and who's put himself in that seat who has no right and no power is about to be taken down and so i'm celebrating with everybody else that's because you know a lot of people are saying that disciples say when will these things be and what will be the sign so we can say that about this particular season what when will these things be when will trump come back one of the mos you know god said you know my ways are not your ways but he would tip his hand and show us some of his ways his ways at the tower babel babel how are we saying babylon his ways were when it was time for god to move the enemy got confused and started coming against himself when it's time for him to move now the enemy gets confused and starts coming against each other so if you want to know how do you know that the time is imminent how how do you know that it's close it's because people the the left the enemies of god many of them not necessarily every single one but many of them they just begin to fight amongst themselves and you're right each other that's a sign that it's imminent you know the prophets let me just say this one other thing we'll jump into this other stuff the prophets of old and there's a couple of scriptures i wasn't prepared for so i won't do a full thing on it today but the prophets of old it would say it the scripture said and i'm paraphrasing that they longed to look into and see the time when these things that the spirit within them was telling what happened they were not told the time they were not told the exact season but they longed to look into our day there's a couple of scriptures about that yes in a few weeks to read it that the prophets wanted to know when these things would be the disciples wanted to know when these things would be yes so so that's why we can could have told you way back then this is going to happen and this is going to happen and this is going to happen people would say well when well we like everyone else hoped it would be yesterday right but god doesn't tell when very very rarely but he will show signs and one of the big ones is the enemy turns on himself suddenly and they don't get along and they start reporting each other and a lot of them that's going on now so that's a major science yeah it is and um i do know that the father was telling me that if any of their loved ones anybody's loved ones if they could come back from heaven it would be for one reason and that would be to be a part of these days that we're walking into right now that they will want to be in these days of greater glory of the power of the living god being seen everywhere once that darkness is crushed and pushed back the acceleration of the signs and wonders and stuff is going to be so quick people will be seeing something almost every other minute being reported or even shown on on the internet so get ready for some of the greatest things you've ever seen or heard and the darkness will tremble and begin to crumble because they already know that the foundation they thought they built you can't build a foundation on sin and suffering and evil and wickedness and think it's going to stay very long in this time these are the times of god and seasons of god they're not the times and seasons of the enemy in darkness so good well any last thing you want to tell us before we go into q a uh i'm just excited about seeing the hearts of the people beginning to rejoice now i see almost nobody around me or the places they go no one's wearing a mask unless they really want to and no one's stopping them if they want to but it's a part of freedom and that was part of what god said the people being when you understand what the enemy has done our enemy the fake government the freedom begins to come into you already we're not going to have to wait for someone to be seated of course trump will be uh we won't have to wait to that moment we'll be so filled with freedom by the time that happens we'll just be celebrating with our true president okay it's so good all right well for those who may be new uh cat has been to heaven many many times thousands literally or god will sometimes walk through the wall she's a seer so she sees the angelic she also sees the demonic you see when you see one you can see the other so so we ask a lot of questions about what heaven is like it will be like for us but people uh when they have the opportunity to ask kat then we'll ask her many other questions so this is supposed it's supposed to be mainly about heaven but we often get into other areas yeah if you're ready i'm going to ask you some things starting with the other areas let me give my quick commentary i've heard for years people say like they're in china when they're in other uh places they're saying well we pray for persecution to hit the united states because persecution hit us and because of persecution we have now drawn closer together so that's the question that's the thing that i've been told for years and and i think that's the backdrop for this question and this says i receive many christian newsletters that highlight christians in foreign countries who are persecuted for their faith in horrific ways could they call upon their angels to or host i suppose to protect them or is persecution in martyrdom part of the life god has called them to endure i think if people knew how to command the host of heaven that's not a request that's an order there's a big difference and people will always cry out not that god's got a deaf fear many times god will still come in and rescue people and do things but we're entering into times where he literally wants us to command and it even says in the bible god says these words command ye me he's not telling me to tell him what to do he was saying i want to see you command and that's how he talks he talks sometimes in riddles he wants to see us step into the place christ was the he was the lord of hosts he was the commander of heaven's armies those armies weren't designed to protect heaven and i know people hear me talk a lot about this i'll never get tired of it i see them around me all the time they're in they're in this room they're outside where i live right now their their heads are shoving down to the ceiling uh so i can see them so they can see they can see through the ceiling by the way and so they have desired this time themselves have been looking forward to this time when they wouldn't have to wait to get in order while they were in heaven if we we are the head of an army we give commands to what god would want done and if we live our lives surrendered to christ we're not going to ask for something amiss they're not going to listen to us anyway and so these are powerful days the way we carry the glory is we literally will go to places and release it uh you know it talks about christ in you is the hope of glory did you know christ had hopes also the hope that you would create glory for him in carrying it it's one of the reasons why he lives in you and all this has to do with what is being prepared right now for us so yeah there's a big difference in saying god please come and rescue me i'm tired of the enemy beating me up you crush him you crush the planes of darkness you push back the forces of evil the army of heaven was created it says they are our mighty weapon they are our weapons are not physical they are not carnal that's what the scripture means but they are mighty they are spiritual to the pulling down of strongholds so most of the time when you're getting attacked it's a stronghold of satan that's been built around you you may not even done anything to deserve it satan will kill steal and destroy anything you can get away with it's going to be a lot harder for him in these coming days and generations when the body of christ finally stands up and becomes that powerful spiritual army of god taking authority over the enemy because christ gave it to us and so it's a huge difference yes those people in those countries could totally make a difference over their own lives their churches their congregations and more and more i'm getting emails phone calls or uh uh letters asking me to please train or teach these leaders how to command the army of heaven that's good why if and the question comes to me if martyrdom of course there are martyrs we're not going to doubt that of course if martyrdom and persecution is so wonderful uh two questions why isn't it in heaven and second question is if it is so wonderful then why are mission stories filled with people getting rescued from persecution if this is something you're supposed to go through then are you then are the mission stories the people that opted out so they didn't have to but i mean everyone else is getting that you know so people kind of tend to glorify persecution i've had several people that i know this is i can't wait to be persecuted i'm not going to criticize that because maybe god's put that in them i but but the mission stories and the and the glorified glorifying god stories are people that were rescued from the lion's mouth god didn't tell the story of daniel in the lion's den and talk about how wonderful he was and then and then the story goes he was slaughtered by and eaten alive by life it talks about he was rescued he was rescued and you know what steve like anything else in the world as time goes on things do they they're a different way you deal with things a different way you send things travel it all changes as we go into different seasons of god we're in a whole new season of god when we ourselves because of christ because of christ in us because of the authority he gave us over all the power of the enemy and then we get trained on how to use that power that he gave us it's going to be a different way of living life will look so different probably even by 50 years from now people will be shocked if you could go forward 50 years and see how powerful a god in us has changed this world it's got to happen christ has to have the reward of seeing us operate in levels of authority that he desired for us to have so this is what the father i love when the father says something his words mean so much he said in the past in the past you you died right you died for him in these days he doesn't want you to die for him he wants you to live for him and crush the darkness so in these days he wants to keep us alive on purpose all right and that will happen because the army of heaven will keep you in all your ways at all times if you're living your life you know the way the bible says it's not that hard people don't sin right don't don't don't lie don't steal don't crush don't hurt don't partner with the darkness it shouldn't be that hard to live your life in the light with the light creating the light carrying the glory stopping the enemy crushing him with the host of evan pushing him back sweating platforms this is what we're supposed to be doing as the army of god and the bible completely says that we are we the army of god will be working with the army of heaven together like never before in these days that alone would prevent it from all going to the darkness right now there's no way they have a chance and the worst day in hell is when they find out one more person finds out about the authority and dominion we are to be operating in right now in this earth so now you glorify god by living and not dying the only dying you should be would be your flesh your opinions your thoughts your own you know you full of yourself that you can die to when it said take up your cross daily it was to crucify that part of you your selfishness your anger your rights you know spewing on people but when you walk righteously right now the righteous and the just will be the ones who are blessed right the ones who are living for christ will have long lives on the earth because he needs us to live a long time in these days to walk in such power and authority and demonstrate for the world to see the knowledge and knowing and understanding of the glory the power and the glorious light of god will be seen known and heard all around this world because we we as the body of christ will be taking it and doing devastation to the darkness no matter what it's involved in and we speak into the land the sea and the earth listening just like it did to christ so this is the days we're in it's not the days of death and destruction and takeover by hell these are the days hell gets crushed yeah so next time someone says i'm praying that you'll have persecution you might say why don't you pray that there's no persecution there's prosperity so we can continue to fund the gospel and share the gospel because you know all right i know i do know the scripture that says in this in this day in this day now you have to remember what days they were saying this in and these days you will have lands property and wealth but with persecution right persecution didn't mean you were going to be cut asunder and destroyed and die that could be voices speaking against you people speaking wrongfully against you uh persecution today is different than what it was 50 years 100 years ago and it's going to totally change because god's going to bless the righteous the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just and the righteous and god will bless those who speak for him and live for him so you have to think it isn't 200 years ago people this is now the days of glory uh living in the kingdom age on earth as they live in heaven and they're not attacked and you're right they're not persecuted in heaven uh they're not cut asunder they're not having being stolen from them they're not receiving lies from the enemy you don't have to live that way you're supposed to live above remember the scripture you're above and up beneath what about that scripture that's right all right uh here's the question are there places in heaven that cat has asked the lord to see which he has not seen yet i don't ever ask him i'm so i'm so undone by the places he takes me and shows me he shows me places he wants revealed and for a specific reason and sometimes it's tied to an event or something they may understand and see one day when they go to heaven but the only thing i have ever asked was the father that i could know him more and be be with him more and he has certainly answered that for me uh showing me himself and i know people are probably gonna ridicule me saying these words but yes you can see the face of god the father and live because you lived in him you chose him you chose his son you chose holy spirit your soul your sins are forgiven okay you're white that's what it says you're cleaned out of the sin why do you think you have to get would you get to heaven he's not going to reject you from the throne in heaven when you come home to heaven you have a party and a celebration he's going to reach out and pull you to himself well he has the same love now you have that same access right now so we should be getting to know the father like we know his son and if you don't know his son jesus christ better be your number one before you try to do anything else in this world that you think might impress him that's good you know it says in two places because because god there's one place where it says you can't see my face and live he said to moses there's two other places where it says moses spoke to god face to face and then we come together in the new testament we're baptized in the holy spirit which is god himself in the spirit and with the holy spirit living in us people think you don't dare look at god with the holy with god living in you you think wait a minute that doesn't make any sense god lives in you that's right and you don't dare look at him what what sense does that make so many people have been caught up to heaven i probably say probably the last 15 years every year it increases and actually have seen the face of god now when i say the base of god i'm not saying like you walk up to someone on the street you see the fullness of every feature of them but you can see his head you can see the the rainbow moving in and out of him and waves of glory you see his eyes you can see through that glory and see his eyes and flames of fire and never have you felt such waves of unending love that consumed the very core of your being you don't care what happened on earth you don't care about the stuff you lost you don't have your whole list of questions you said you would ask god one day they will melt in the presence of his fire and his glory and you will not want to be apart from him which is why his son loves it his son loves him that much wow wow wow okay when we get here's a question when we get to heaven uh when we graduate there will will there be a time in the future of course the heaven doesn't have time whether it be a time when we've seen it all or is the father always creating new spaces in heaven so they want to know i think you know i think at the core of this is like well i see it all and finally just say okay i've seen it all and it's almost like a boredom sets in this is my words i'll never you will never ever not now or in all of eternity ever be bored he will never stop creating he'll teach us how to create like he does we'll create places we're not going to create a whole new race of people and to be over them i wouldn't want it nobody would want that if you understand what the fathers had to put up with france and yet loved us we're not going to create other human beings and not another race will be over on another planet when i say that i'm saying exciting things to go and do we'll we will learn just like the father how to create we are made in their image father son and holy spirit they create okay uh they create they travel to the spirit realm they have understanding they have hearts bigger than you could ever imagine their love is for you but all the time if there was time there is always continually being new places created in heaven for people to enjoy number one reason the father says is every time that somebody new comes home to heaven i have to create a new place so they can use the gift i put in them to bless everybody in heaven really really so you've been thinking the millions still heading that way and that will be there there's always going to be new places made that we can all go and enjoy so there's things that are intense exciting amazing splendorous filled with your mind is always going like blank when you see the things that are there so beyond your imagination or understanding and yet no harm is involved with that nobody can ever get hurt nobody can get lost nobody's going to get sick ever can you imagine just living that way but all the other stuff added to it that you walk past the building and things step out or you look at the painting it becomes alive and it begins to smell you go to your apparel closet to pick from your 500 different things you could wear and some of them will speak to you the words of god literally his words some will sing different places where you go some will join in with other people uh what they're what they're singing i'm talking about your outfits i'm gonna be talking about you uh understanding that heaven is unlimited in what god has for us but you are his sons and daughters don't limit god but don't limit yourself either don't think you've been so bad he can't forgive you oh right the bible says that if you repent of your sins he is always going to be he's always going to be just right he's always going to forgive you your sins and cleanse you of all unrighteousness right so don't don't think god's going to throw you away in a hole because you were so bad there probably people a whole lot worse than you were that ever we're on this earth and repented and are in heaven now for sure by the way that that that creates a question my brain and my brain poor my program my poor people that know me oh they say how do you come up with these questions i've never would have even thought that question so this is a new question so i'm not gonna walk down the three streets of gold to see a friend's house walk inside and say man i've got the same model that you have my dining rooms here my living rooms here i've we must have had the same model no you mean home you mean right yeah it's about the same exact our rooms are in the same place we've got the same that will never happen steve everybody is unique and the father treats you in that uniqueness that he made you in and no one is ever one thing nobody ever gets tired in heaven is just going down and you may not walk you may fly you may ride on one of the bands of color you may ride in the wings of the spirit you may step into beams of light and they carry you somewhere if you want to go see your cousin on the other side of having you step in these light kiosks and the beams of light come out and grab you and then the second you're around the other side of heaven at your cousin's place being undone uh and it isn't just the outside of the mountainous the way he made it on the inside you can imagine if you always wanted to live in your waterfall but that waterfall is inside your mansion i love it i gotta have one of those coming from nowhere pouring down bringing the gems from the heart of the father loving your place that's never gonna there's no mildew it's not gonna get that people always have these these head questions they connected to earth no if you want a river flowing in your mansion you can jump in anytime you want to and uh it's just it's just like that the flowers are living in your wall they're not just in the base they're singing to you they're saying hello every time you come back to your mansion no somebody may have a mansion built in the amazon there's like an amazon jungle part of heaven and there's no ceiling and you're in these massive 12 trees that support the whole home and and creatures come in and out from that live there that come in high say hi and people come in and they they're caught up into this little stream that takes them up into this person's mansion that's built in these massive trees or are on the edges of these 200 foot waterfalls and a sky mansion where it's the most sci-fi supernatural futuristic um style and design i have ever seen anywhere in heaven so you're not you're never gonna sing something that looks just like yours so this is a day for new questions in my own brain but have you ever been uh in a scene in your mansion or a person in a mansion who says let's say their daughter maybe they live on the other side of heaven but but they probably live next door but our friends or whatever and they say you know i wonder what they're doing and you and to us we get on the phone we just wanted to talk with you talk about i wonder what so-and-so is doing and by the way i also wonder what so-and-so is doing do you do you get on the phone the phone or what do you do there is no phone because when you say something your your voice is captured and as you're saying it the person you want to know about is hearing you no matter what you're in heaven they hear you just say it you don't need a phone you don't need something to hold up and talk into you just say and they hear you and then they'll speak back and then you will hear them say it back so really or or each mansion has a portal really serious it would be like your own private elevator that takes you through this you know sci-fi everything yeah i can hear that story tomorrow you're standing in front of it it's like the most glorious kind of elevator that goes up down sideways whatever you stand in front of this portal of light you say i want i want to go to my cousin susie's home you step in right from your mansion and when you step through you're in their mansion wow no no invasion of privacy issues in heaven right there's no invasion of privacy anywhere [Laughter] okay this one says my mom has been asking me to ask cat uh about the angels with six wings in the temple do you know why two cover their face into their feet and then she quotes isaiah 6 2 above him were seraphim each with six wings with two wings that covered their faces the two that covered their feet with two with two they were flying they wanted to know why if you happen to know why they covered their face or their feet they're they are so much in the presence of god uh the glory is so powerful when it comes out of them and there are times themselves that they are undone by the glory of god himself that they as a sign of honor or even humbling themselves and they certainly don't have to they're not going to be kicked no one's going to be kicked out of heaven by the way i've had that question um it's not like you turn bad when you get up there oh no you you we look through your book and sorry you missed it that doesn't happen but back to the to the um the the cherubs of the cherubim uh the living creatures are the ones i like to talk about the most people come into the throne room and they can't wait to see the father but when they see the truth they're like wow they're uh so undone by the hugeness of them in the in the glory in the splendor and the eyes that are looking at them all the time in the front in the bag and and the fire they're in their eyes and they have hooves that they walk with so golden hose for their feet but they walk upright like us so there's so many things that in great detail i have seen uh the seraphim live in the glory cloud over the throne and they come down all the time to worship god and they turn to these blazing balls of fire as blue fire their hair becomes blue that turns into fire and it's so awesome even to try to look upon them yourselves and sometimes they will hide themselves uh at that moment in time they're giving themselves to god all over again and so they will they'll cover themselves with all of their wings all those wings have eyes in them they see all the time and no matter where they are what they're doing it is about the holiness of god that's what it's about but why they do that why do they cover their self and even the ones who are around the throne and the ones that hold up the armist of the throne these four living creatures it talks about in revelation that one has the head of a lion one the head of a man one head of an eagle one the head of an ox that's just single head but the ones that hold up the arms of the throne are are like on their knees they have four heads now you can imagine being caught up to heaven and these people who think there is no god he's a weak god he doesn't care he has no power and they're caught up and they see just the ones who are holding up the throne without even seeing the face of god probably think they're going to die die from the holiness and the power that is in them and if they're ever there when the father decides to move his throne and out of their very being come these wheels within a wheel that looks like a gyroscope that's what it looks like here's all these living eyeballs on the rims of these wheels that spin within each other and when when the both of those two creatures with the foreheads when those come out that's the spirit of that living creature this will get your head undone they move the wheels move and the throne moves straight up and it moves across it goes places even brings it down to the earth sometimes and this is one of the one of the positions of the living creatures uh to do to do whatever god asks becca it is the greatest thing in their existence that they get to serve him but you can imagine seeing things like this and you know ezekiel saw it as if this song had to live a normal life i don't know how he could even live a normal life after having that that encounter with them yeah you know what the brook when he saw the throne and these living creatures the wheels that said the spirit was the spirit of the living creature i understand how that happens i understand that i've seen it but back in those days when they had no knowledge of almost anything but you can imagine somebody who speaks against god all the time just because they're ignorant or they're afraid or they're afraid it might not be real to see one glimpse of something like that you would you would never forget it never and so i don't usually have uh questions i don't almost never ask him anything i am so grateful to be a part of what he has asked me to do you know and i have to stay humble um i've always been a humble person i never was full of myself even when i was little i had helped take care of 12 of my siblings i always had to consider others before myself and i didn't mind doing it you know he just made me that way he actually to do what i do now to be able to go and see all that power and glory and wonder he actually took his hand something from himself and he actually put his hand in me and said i'm setting this in place that you will never weep or mourn every time i send you back to the earth you will not cry to be here with me because i need you to be on the earth and so i never and all the times i've been there's nothing in me that desires to go there and live now because i will miss out on what he asked me to do wow now this is me now because i got a new question for some reason today i got lots of them uh okay so you know there are there are on this earth beautiful people that we would look at and go he or she he she's beautiful he's handsome and then and then you have people that were not blessed let's say they were blessed with the opposite that you know their whole life they were never looked upon as anything but less than plain have you seen people on either category go to heaven and face i guess a mirror if they have mirrors in heaven and look at their look at what they're wearing and look at themselves and look man i am amazingly i'll say beautiful or handsome or whatever what what have you seen i actually have seen that many times i've seen i've seen people greeting now people have to remember that people don't see me on purpose he doesn't allow people to see me um those who live in heaven he won't let them see me because they would be asking me to give you all a message and he won't let me do that i have so many times for people who newly arrived and they they're not quite sure they know their body feels good you know they haven't really seen herself yet they know that they're glowing they can see the glow and the joy and just surges of life life life in them but when they start walking down the streets of goal their friends go man you look so good you look amazing they say those very words and then that person who knows these people go what did you do you are so amazing look at you you're glowing you're young you have life i can feel the life coming from you yes they have those conversations all the time and i have to say this those who lived such a powerful life of servitude who gave who helped they may not have been the nicest looking or maybe the most beautiful person on the earth the glory the beauty of the glory of god will be on them when they walk down the streets and people will run up and go i have to know who you are you have so much life and glory the beauty and splendor of the father is coming off of you in waves they'll never again say boy you need something to help you even if they were laughter you know people are mean that someone they're young even sometimes they'll pick on kids maybe not not look the best maybe they have marks maybe they don't look uh quite right um no one says that in heaven walk in the beauty and the splendor that comes from the father and they will that will happen when they step out of their body if they could see it of course i don't know if you can see yourself as a spirit in it in the physical mirror on the earth there i'm quite sure when they get to heaven they do have uh looking glasses and they're called looking glasses they do and you speak to them and those looking glasses will talk to you and that's where that whole thing came in that that's how it came out that's how it came in that movie the different movies that have had uh stepping through the looking glass or else and all that stuff like that the things that we call fantasy that is actually ideas and things from heaven that drop down into the mind of man so you do have a looking glass that's more like a personality that speaks interesting now you know of course on the earth uh because of sin because of what the devil is wrought on the earth there are people that are literally born unrecognizable their face might be deformed and all of that and of course that's that's the curse of the enemy but god loves the soul yeah the spirit in that person but but we we've heard that you know you go to heaven and everyone recognizes you knows you as you are known there's a person who was never even recognizable because of deformities does everyone know who they are the moment they see them i think they know them because they're in their spiritual body you have to remember that too but nobody has any deformities there are no deformities in heaven god didn't make you deform he didn't make you that way something happened in the womb of the mother or maybe it was in the genealogy of one of the other sides or something down the line there are certain uh appearances that people have or characteristics that are carried down to generations no god made you to be amazing and when you get to heaven people will still know what you they're going to know at you even if your face has changed and they see the trueness of who you are uh but the spirit of that person would be recognized you know each other by the spirit and i tell people i'd rather have anyone on the earth not know me by the flesh but know me by the spirit that's what the word says we should as the body of christ know each other by our spirit you should recognize the spirit of the person you know what are they like what is their fruit like how is how do they live their life and you recognize that about everybody in heaven but let me tell you people are undone when they see people in in this beautiful spiritual body that god has given them that is what they would have looked like on the earth had they not been you know we live in this fallen world and things do show up and like i said before sometimes in in birth marks or the way that you're even even your appearance looks but in heaven you have nothing nothing of that is in heaven you'll be perfectly the way god made you in his independence he wanted you to have those and i do get this question a lot if someone was completely mentally impaired where they they couldn't communicate much less or some can communicate on some level but they can't work and voice it others simply are mentally impaired so that they pronounce it better but they repeat themselves they don't really know reality some of the some of them have been put in uh homes because they don't they're not part of society because they can't even think or communicate does this per this person of course shows up in heaven perfect when they're saved and that's the first question is how do they get saved but the second question is do they have memories of earth that they would that they talk about even though they were mentally impaired if you know happened to know that i think most people who are indicating mental mentally impaired emotionally impaired and the way i hear a lot is it's like they were a child they think like a child they don't understand or can't comprehend things like an adult would or somebody who was old enough to know things they just would never know them i think that the memory that they would have would be more like their child likeness you know than maybe things that were not good that happened to them i can tell you that everyone will be in their right mind that god gave them and have full understanding of who they are and how life operates and back to answer that one question you said you know well people get bored in heaven you'll never know everything you'll never get to place where you know everything and all that there is but these people who are handicapped impaired i know people that had young people uh well they were like full in their 40s but they still acted and talked like a five-year-old and eventually they passed away and i said you're five-year-old the one who acted like five is not five anymore no you don't keep any impairments none of those impairments will be in we'd be in heaven with you at all it'll be this is it'll be like it never happened because now you're living in the way god intended you and his plans for you to live uh without being in a fallen world and that's how people most of them are so overjoyed and overwhelmed that the love and the presence of god and this is the answer the other answer to the question if they think and always act as a child god makes himself known to them that's exactly what he said they'll still have an opportunity uh to receive christ even if it's at their death or as they're dying or when they've stepped out of their body he will meet him and present himself to them uh most children just trust whoever they're with you know in their life most of them are treated pretty pretty well maybe not as a part of society so that's kind of something new that they'll learn to be a part of everyone else in life itself but no one has any uh bad memories or things that hurt them they don't come to heaven with wounds in their soul uh they're overwhelmed because they will have the understanding that now they really are their self and not who they were when they were on the earth you know and the the other questions kind of likened to it where i get asked this a lot someone had a parent who was maybe they were mean or abusive they they did not know the lord and then they they you know years before they died they developed alzheimer's and all of their capacity to receive the lord who is gone they have no they don't know where they are they have no memory from minute to minute and i get this ask ask a lot how does that person get saved or can they get saved when they're like that they can still get saved because god can speak to their spirit their human mind and i say your brain your brain is the human part of you your mind is a spiritual thing actually that's why your soul is your mind that's a spiritual thing it's not a physical thing your mind your will and your emotions are a spiritual part of your being and god can speak spirit the spirit he can even people who are unconscious and then the hospital if you speak to the spirit they will hear what you're saying uh not just because i know that happens but because people who have recovered would tell people i may have looked like i was out and i was no responsive but i heard what you said to me and i heard you they didn't understand that it was the soul that they were speaking to but god in in the word of god he says i make myself known to every man in other words if there's no other way to reach them oh god i know we preach the gospel that's that's something that is needed in this world god's probably never going to stop doing that on this earth at all to to speak to tell the gospel the truth of the gospel uh we all need to tell people that so as soon as they can they can know him but he does make himself known to every man they're going to have a choice before he just they decide that you know one would throw him into hell their mind wasn't right they never had to make a choice so now they don't count it says he makes himself known i can't answer how he makes that i do know it's spirit of the spirit but i know that something personal god does because his son died he died for everyone and he says that he desires that none should perish perish doesn't mean don't die cherish means don't leave his presence forever and live in the lake of fire that's what parish is yeah yeah wow okay different question my mom loves animals and the zoo she loves the zoo and wants to know if there's a place in heaven like a zoo that has all sorts of animals meaning it all together in one place or do they just want to do animals just wander all over heaven i think they have boats there is a place they call it the park the park is where many of the uh that they they don't call them animals now by the way they call them creatures they're creatures in heaven uh they have a mind they have they can think they can speak to everybody but a lot of them like to visit and so some of them will leave the park and they go and visit pretty much the park is where their home is that's where they're uh appointed places but people will come from everywhere in heaven to visit the park isn't like a little city park it would be the size of many states that would be about really really every kind of yes states yeah the size of states they have dinosaurs in this park that god put there so forget the reptilian seed people think of something else to talk about um the reptilian seed i don't even want to talk about that but there's dinosaurs there's there's creatures the behemoths there's things that you would call like dragons or aragons um so many different creatures we probably never saw on the earth that just lived in heaven or some that lived hundreds and hundreds of years ago that aren't on the earth anymore but are in heaven um and then there's other places like a lot of the smaller ones like squirrels and squirrels and other type of animals they like to visit people's farms they'll just stay for a while if you have a farm if you have a ranch they'll just come and stay and they'll visit with other ones that are other creatures that are there not necessarily the people and and everybody expects it they're just everywhere they show up sometimes i have a conversation with you and it's too late to call me crazy okay i gave up my mind a long time ago you could not do this and hold over 20 years of revelation of being there in person and you don't care what anyone says or things if you know the truth you live the truth you know the living god you know his son you know holy spirit who never stopped speaking to me why because i have a commission i was chosen i'm part of a generation like seven generations of people knowing god and seeking and pursuing him i still had to choose for myself i had to choose i was a very quiet person growing up i didn't have much to say to anybody about anything i wasn't really into hugs at all my mom if she were here would verify that she caught me the strange one i would help until morning till night i would help her i was always on my parents side that was strange um even when i was eight years old wow but i was uh he just made me different so things don't hurt me when people say things or write things or lie about things i ask god to forgive them and i ask him to not even write it down so don't waste your time i'm not going to write it down and god's not going to write it down because i've asked him not to i've asked him to forgive all those i want them to have a chance to get to heaven i want holy spirit to pursue them with everything within himself to get them into heaven everyone deserves an opportunity to know christ well you know you just kicked in the question i have had many times uh i think i know the answer but i'm going to ask you on the cross jesus said forgive them for they don't know what they're doing and when stephen was being stoned my name he said lay not this to their charge did god answer that prayer immediately did god forgive those people that were killing him immediately because jesus his son asked for it yes that means don't even recognize they've done it people can have that kind of mercy they really can it's like they don't ask for mercy they become mercy for other people and the greatest thing you can do even now you may not be being stoned but if people are like slandering you or trying to wound you with their words the greatest sacrifice you can make is to tell god to not even write it down act like they never did it that is the greatest probably almost the greatest mercy and love you can show to perfect strangers or those who are even your enemies what does it say in the bible it says to love your enemy one of the ways you love your enemies those who are using abusing or saying horrible things about you is to ask god to have mercy don't write what down what they're saying don't hold it against them and you release the greatest power of god for their salvation you do that because you're not taking that you're not going to take that right then you're going to hold it against them it's something like christ would do and we're supposed to be like christ i'm not saying put up with people beating you up physically and stuff like that they would have a really hard time if they tried to do that some of my brothers some people have more mercy and grace than others do but and if you just not say nothing rather than tell everybody how bad and mean and horrible they were don't say anything and privately go to god and say i just have to forgive them i'm going to forgive them my flesh might not want to but my soul is choosing and i know that's the question how do i forgive somebody that i can't stand i can't forget what they did it is an act of your will that takes your flesh away from it all your emotions are set aside and you say i choose his neck no will to forgive that person and name that person god will take that forgiveness he will pursue them with everything within him but you won't carry that around like a yoke for the rest of your life so you do yourself a lot of good but you do something great for them even though in the natural people go well you had the right to do that it's true you do or you can be like christ when you you use the term flesh you don't worry about your flesh but you're you know so it's another way of saying that when you can't when you say i can't forgive someone is it is this accurate to say you don't have to feel forgiving you just have to do forgiveness with your mouth with your will all right yeah okay it's not that you go oh i forgive them it's not like that from your heart when you choose with your will is so powerful it's very powerful when you choose as an act of your will that means you're bypassing all your emotions all of the stuff that you were feeling you know rejected beat not falsely accused and uh and you wanted what do you want do you want revenge or do you want justice because when you forgive people like that you're opening up a door of justice in an immeasurable amounts that doesn't just help the person to have a chance to know christ and be free from what they just did to you but it takes that stuff out of your soul and god then will give you justice every time and he just gave justice to that person um you know god desires that we operate in justice it's not just a word it's not just an action it's a lifestyle wow so if someone and we'll wrap up with this because their time's up but if someone carried for decades i'm not talking about myself because i've walked through forgiveness but let's say someone's carried in their heart for decades decades i'm talking 30 40 50 60 years a parent maybe they've even died since then and they've carried the horrible hurt that their parent what one or both parents did to them abuse them maybe even sexually and physically and verbally is it too late or can they now say you know what no regardless of how i feel i choose to forgive them now it's what that will do for you at that point in your life people can't walk around with bitterness and let bitterness get in them it'll ruin your destiny it really will it may even ruin other relationships if you're carrying that kind of stuff on the inside of you and i would totally encourage people even if it was years ago and maybe your family member or friend did make it into heaven and you didn't know it think how great you would be when you got there that you know in your heart you chose with your will to forgive them even though that trauma it's called trauma you don't want to keep trauma inside of you and it will end up by making you isolate yourself from others that's what happens when you have unforgiveness in you or your soul gets so full of it uh you can't stop thinking about it that's all it covers you it eats away at you all day long you don't want to get to that point in your life if you have you can still choose to forgive that person and lose all of the hurt and the anguish the anger the suffering you can choose to lose it from your soul in jesus name and then you bind the love and the life and the presence and the power of god you won't even think the same it's like you only be able to think of that situation it will not affect you it won't eat your life away it's important to choose to do that and it you know it doesn't cost any money to do it it's an act of your will but i would encourage people if you want to live a full happy prosperous life the bible says even as your soul prospers you will then prosper and live in hell so make sure you check out your soul seeing if you've got anything hidden in there uh that shouldn't be there it's for your own good that god can use you and do things for you and you literally will begin to prosper if you choose to change even though it's been decades and you really literally suffered emotionally or maybe even physically from that stuff you'll not even act the same or think the same you'll be so filled with life so i want to end on something really good with god he is about to touch this earth in ways he never has before these days we've been living through will be like dust and like just little shadows and dust and then when people who never saw the hand of god move on their behalf and think he doesn't care will never think that way again the celebration the rejoicing the restoration and all the power of god will be talked about for decades to come in these days and you will be able to live in that part not live barely live through it but not just barely exist but live at the fullest measure because you're living in a powerful time where you will see the hand of god move and you will know it was him that is why we need to celebrate and look forward to our life with with great joy so so so good well kat your uh your website revealingheaven.com

but you will be seeing it from wednesday on so cat travels more now that things are loosening up and so as she travels more we'll record her when we can get her and then we'll air hers on wednesday whenever possible so so throughout the program down along the bottom it will say you see this was recorded on 6 22 21 to be aired on 6 23 so it's only one day ahead of time but that way if cat says something either prophetically or some other thing that you want to remember when that was said you can see on the clock behind me when she said it and the date and you'll see on the screen below when it will air so that'll help you uh even when we do all of these things and explain that we still have we kind of were laughing about it because people jump in and all on different times they didn't hear the announcement so they'll say they'll start writing notes and say steve do you know your clocks wrong and so we're kind of going well we tried really hard to let you all know but people jump in and out so uh i guess just if you if you see the comments below when somebody's telling me it tells me my clock is wrong you can just jump in and say um this is what he's recording it but look at the screen along the bottom something like that all right so we always encourage you encourage you to subscribe to lijust.com it's free that way your inbox is receiving daily input prophetically and we will always be able to get a hold of you to make a special announcements also youtube.com we encourage you because all of our programming is carefully uh organized at youtube.com when you go there go to elijahstreams. i'm sorry you in the search box at youtube you type elijah streams one or two words works now when that comes up along the bottom click the thumbs up the red subscribe and the bell so we'll do that one more time at the bottom click the thumbs up the red subscribe and then the bell i say red because it needs to be red before you hit it once you hit it it's supposed to turn gray if you hit it and it was gray and it turned red on you then you just unsubscribed yourself so hit it again and then you'll be back into the right place so all right we have a lot to cover today so cat car is waiting in the wings and let's bring her in there she is hey cat how are you back in florida but i guess you since you lived there you're still in florida i'm still in florida but boy talk about busy busy um the faith and freedom coalition did a great job with the road to majority that was the name of the event i was at and uh met some powerful people who were doing things for god that would be politicians business people um just lay people doing uh powerful things amazing things and all kinds of doors were open that was god's plan and my main purpose was not to go as a speaker on the platform but to be connected to the other speakers to be connected to politicians and as i just said uh business leaders places i've never been to before they had people coming from across the country to this event and i think they were probably right at it could not i could be quite a little wrong but maybe a thousand people or more were there and um you know i found out for sure one thing for sure i can't just show up somewhere and think i gonna be like everyone else that didn't happen and my husband was with me and it didn't matter where we went or what time of night it was we were descended upon by everybody who loves the revelation we had so many hundreds of pictures taken of us and with us so they're probably going to show up all over on facebook on youtube i've already seen some of them and i never have met these people personally very few did i actually know personally johnny and elizabeth enlo i did know and of course i'm actually got to meet ra robin bullock and his wife and of course they were great i really enjoyed meeting them and that was just standing in line to register at the hotel really and it started there and never stopped with people coming to see us hug us thank us it was really kind of fun in a way but quite eye-opening that when you stand for what is right people are so hungry for truth today because there's so much stuff that isn't true or fear let's fear in confusion in or just outright sin all kinds of things are going on around us right now but we are not to fear he didn't give us a spirit fear but of power love and guess what a sound mind you got to keep your mind sound and you need to still be filled with celebration almost everybody said we celebrate and eat cake which is awesome you know that's amazing how many so you so the in in short and part of the one conclusion i'm drawing with that because i was not there but i i'm stunned that so many people because this is a prophetic side of things and we don't have the numbers even though our numbers are really big we don't have the numbers that other non-prophetic sites do but i don't want to mistake that because our numbers are really growing i mean we have phenomenal numbers better than we've ever had but compared to the whole of christianity not everybody's prophetic but you're saying everywhere you went you were recognized everywhere i went and this place has got like something like a million square feet the event center at the gaylord palms hotel which itself is a massive place a beautiful place actually and uh that's where we were staying but that's also where the events were held and you could hear morning speakers um it wasn't like a church service like they didn't have just a big room with a lot of chairs in it it wasn't set up like that at all most places had tables and chairs and you were going to take notes about things you got to meet people running for congress who were or congressmen running for senate or who were senators lieutenant governors even governors i think the governor of north carolina showed up of course the best thing of all was governor desantis sharing about his plans for florida how he pushed and crushed back the darkness and the left not tolerating anything they said and i've learned more and more i guess we'll start with this part how much power the governors have and what we've seen or heard was the side that wants to bash and crush the people down not open up their states those were the governors that made those decisions um that comes from them so our governor the reason why we're so free and open is he made the decision he would follow every legal um place he could come to to fight against what the left was saying and he was very successful and then he is now teaching the other republican governors how to make a stand because there are some things that are not in the lab of the president at this time in our lives that's a good thing since we have a fake one there right now and he didn't even mind saying that himself he did talk about how the 2020 election was stolen and that trump did win he actually said that yeah so he is very very close to trump and his uh the people that he worked with but what he said himself was our rights he talks a lot about the rights of american citizens that our country is free always will be free you can't come in and steal a free country and so the words is that we're so empowering and people got so excited about what he said and how he was helping the other other governors and that he knew himself that a great shift was coming so it was exciting to hear him uh speak at this event i think vice president pence spoke at another time i did not get to hear him so i can't say really anything about what he said except as far as i know he spoke also uh he spell spoke well of trump he didn't say anything against him there's a lot of um probably concern and maybe even some confusion going on about that whole thing that happened um during the elections with vice president pence and we'll have to see how that all plays out and that's what god says to me but i can tell you that people are so hungry for truth and revelation god opened doors for me to be interviewed that was like a random things that happened as we just went wherever he told us to go within this place i do know that one of the places that we were asked um this this man came up and said i'd like to interview you i want the conservative view on what's going on right now in america and uh he was from the guardian that's the uk one of the liberal newspapers in the uk actually i found out and yet i spoke plainly to him and said i can't give you a conservative view i'll give you heaven's view and he was quite shocked at some of the things i said about what god had said but he was writing everything down he's already made his report on the guardian so i haven't had a chance to look at it but people have already called us and said it actually was a great uh report that he gave and so that was quite exciting to have that happen that's that's now open to 23 million readers in the uk about what god had to say about what's going on and so he opened huge doors in different places never opened before because he wants the truth to be told that's our god he wants people to know what he's doing what he's saying and now this has gone up to so many others who didn't have an opportunity to hear and so it was definitely from our point of view from a prophet's point of view and god's point of view it was a powerful event many people were encouraged inspired and the politicians were chasing me down on purpose their cards so i could declare over them so i could be praying for them wow yeah it was amazing and i'd go here at one room one of the rooms that had available of which was a lot of them and i thought wow those people are so powerful in god they were strong believers who were running for congress or who in congress and i thought those are really nice people i need to go thank them and when they got off the platform they came straight to me and said could you and your husband let us take our picture with you wow it was like the first time i experienced anything even close to paparazzi which i was always the person who wanted to run away from that and god said i'm not letting you run away anymore and so it was like crazyville i never expected that to happen and it didn't matter where it went god said it would be like this in the world one day because of the uh of what you'll operate in that i allow you to operate in because of your obedience and your surrender and that goes for anyone else who's been operating in obedience surrender to god saying what he wants said you're about to be accelerated so this is actually powerful news from anyone who's in that place right now and i'm excited for the body of christ for what god is going to do and the future that was given by many of these people was so great and so amazing knowing and these people knew that justice was coming so all of you standing with that standing for that you're going to get justice america is going to get justice and a lot of the world that even the people from the world like i've met people i guess said puerto rico from some of the islands from mexico uh from the uk these people were coming to hear what was being said by americans by the people who were in uh politics already some of them many pastors were there wanting to know also they made specific events possible for us to meet one another which was great so it was a very big success for everybody who went and people left excited and inspired that's so good that is so good i got several pictures i think sandy mcguire sent me some i think she was in a picture with you she gets everyone's picture um but you know she said she wrote to me and said she said steve it's like a big elijah list reunion out there or elijah's streams were getting out there so a lot of the people in that big group picture she had i didn't recognize but a lot of them i did so yes and i have to tell you steve that probably at least 50 percent of all these hundreds of people said to me i found you on elijah's dreams wow that's just amazing cat it's humbling that's amazing you know but it's you know we've hung in there doreen and i were talking about this whole thing the other day and i said we're just talking about the whole broad picture and i said you know honey what we did was what we've done it was hard but we've done a lot harder things than this yeah in other words there was so much grace that's been given to us that's right that we we could have should have long ago been cut off of several sources and yet we've just remained he reminds you that scripture that says uh when a man's ways are pleasing to the lord he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him that's right we have remained at peace with some of these big platforms and they did not de-platform us so that's only god that's all he is he is going to god well let me ask you have wanted to talk about prophets and backsliding and what's on your heart about that i have to and actually the father is making me people go why would you say that because he doesn't ask me you've heard me talk before when you get to a place where where you have given yourself to god given him permission you say whatever you want to say you tell me whatever you want to tell me and i'm going to do it he totally will take those words he said i need you to share about why prophets are stepping aside or even falling from where he called them to be why does that happen so i'm going to take only five minutes i mean later on do a different broadcast entirely do more detail about so you understand um we start we still are humans we may be supernatural humans empowered by god assigned to position and chosen by god but we still get to make choices with our life and i want to start with the scripture that says um you know our gifts and our callings that would be the office of a prophet you know the five folk ministry it could even be the office of like the president of something anything like that god positions people on the earth to do certain things for him he calls and appoints them and chooses them and even though that is true you are responsible yourself for guarding what goes in your soul so what comes out is going to be god it's not going to be your flesh or your choices or your rights and when you begin to get to a place where you feel like you're being controlled or you don't like what's happening so you're going to change it all even though god put you within a boundary and set you in an estate that estate is your call and what he want ask you to do you know everybody knows even the angels fell so if even those who were with god could fall because they made a decision to go into the darkness that means anyone in the five-fold ministry if they're not staying close to god if they're not keeping their soul pure that could happen to them that's why it's so important for everyone who loves or serves or works for god you keep yourself before the face of god you make sure that there's no darkness in your soul you have nothing to do that you're not tolerating what's being said you're not believing or receiving any of the lies the illegal regulations you have to stay in the heart of god right where he wants you to be because if you don't things start getting in from different sources you get or someone gets angry upset they get offended themselves when you do that you hear god less and less i'm just letting you know this is how this all happens how does somebody fall from a high position it starts as little things and then you don't go seek god about it you may begin to make your own decisions in the flesh of what you think should happen that's not a good choice so people start making wrong choices they stop hearing god less they start listening more to man maybe they're being controlled by fear or maybe just wanting to give up on what god said because it didn't happen when they thought it was there's many different reasons why but for some reason some of them start slipping down from the place god had them positioned and then it just gets darker and darker and worse and worse and when they get to a place where they're doing things that are really wrong and they refuse to repent they refuse to step down because there is a protocol in the bible for anyone in the fifo ministry if you do something wrong and you're caught in it and you're asked to repent according to the word you have to step down from that position you come under people who are hearing god who helped guide your life for a season whether it's one year two years three years until they feel like you've been restored back where god wants you and then you get to go minister again or step back into where he had you but if you totally refuse because you think you have a right that you are so powerful and your gift is operating so accurately that god thinks it's okay that you're sinning you are very much mistaken that is not a good place to be in make sure you remain humble especially when you're given great authority and dominion and you're reaching so many people for god if you start to slip you could cause other people to slip there'll be serious consequences for not being willing and humbling yourself to do what god asks for that to happen the way it happened in the bible and i made a decision a long time ago i'm staying as close to god as i can get i want his voice all the time i know there are many other people just to encourage you there's more prophets that are still staying with god listening to god obeying god then there are the ones who are going like crazy i don't know what else to call it it's almost like they decided their self to decide who they are and they don't let anything or anyone judge them not even god and they decide to go their own way because they don't like what's happening here i'm going to abandon dump it all i'm going to start something new over here but when you do that and you carry all that stuff with you that you didn't get out of you or you didn't release or get restored from then you're carrying all the same things that you were doing over here you're carrying right into the next thing wow god's doing this to give you an understanding of why this happens and i'll take you to the word again you know that there were prophets who were into the darkness way back in the day when there was elijah who was a true prophet of god and there were other prophets even on the earth at that time that god still used that didn't slip away but there were the prophets of baal and why why are they called prophets of baal that's who they worship that's who they talked about that was their platform they they operated from in the darkness because you know the darkness has power and sometimes it's actually a prophet who decided to leave what god had given him and go totally into the darkness to do things for satan so there were prophets that turned evil even back in the day even way back in that day and there were other prophets who spoke incorrectly and god some of them got ahold of and he got them restored some did not get restored but in these days of the power and the glory god is looking at every single one of the prophets who speak for him and he will not allow them to get away with things because they will lose their place of stepping into this time of acceleration to become a manifested son or daughter of god that they actually do some of the greatest signs and wonders along with members of the body of christ who have been faithful to god but he holds his leaders they have double accountability whether it's a pastor teacher a prophet evangelist an apostle we have double accountability with our lives because we impact so many people so when you start hearing and you will be hearing there are some who are falling they're in a place right now of stepping back and i'm sure it will eventually hit the mainstream news and they won't have any problem blasting that stuff around sometimes they exaggerate sometimes they outright lie about what's going on but sometimes there is some truth in it please pray for god's prophets if you hear one of them starting to slip please pray for them to hear god to be willing to surrender to step back be held accountable for what they've done so god can still keep them on the path even if it's a couple years down the road and i'm just letting you know there are some out there i'm not naming names today but even in the past we do know i will mention one his name is paul kane one of the greatest prophets of our day his gift was so powerful and this is what exactly what happened to him his gift became so powerful and he was so accurate what he said that he began to get into sin which eventually was made public and known by many people some of you may be too young but let me tell you this is what he said when they said you need to step down and admit what you've done is wrong he said no my gift is so powerful i'm so accurate if god didn't like the sin i'm in he would tell me i'm sorry people but you know what he never said anything to lucifer and all the sinning he did in heaven deceiving all the angels pulling them into the darkness but there came a time where he had severe consequences he lost his place in heaven his right to speak in heaven he lost his relationship with god and by the way that's never going to get restored his place will be in the lake of fire one day for for satan for lucifer because he decided to sin and then he spread all around heaven and you got mother angels to believe his lies and deception that's why it's so important to make sure that you're staying in the place god has you in so paul kane's answer to this counsel came to him and said you need to do it the bible said step down admit what you're doing is wrong he refused to do it for several years and he said no i am so great and so wise and so accurate god is okay with what i'm doing that's called pride and we all know that satan he fell loose or fell because of his pride and so please don't let your flesh get involved in your life to pull you away from everything your family if you're doing something for god don't get to that place where god has to maybe let you have some real hard consequences for you to realize that paul kane eventually years later finally did admit it he finally came under a council and the last years of his life he was able to minister but it was nothing like the millions he was impacting and actually because of him being exposed thinking he could still operate in his gift and they go well my gift is still great but you have to remember god said he wouldn't take it away he said you will know them not by their gift everybody remember you will know them by their fruit that's right you can't tell them about how great their gift is you have to look at their personal life their own life are they living a life that's after god that is lined up with the word of god that lives on purpose in a holy place because we speak for him and when they begin to let that slide and say it doesn't matter then they have some issues in their life they need to deal with but paul came finally did die he was really sick at the end but i did see him in heaven because he did actually repent but he impacted millions of people not in a good way and just so you know what his gift was god actually assigned two angels to to paul kane paul kane never married he gave himself to god even at a young age and what what happened was he'd go into a place and angels would stand behind somebody and they would say to paul cain their name their addresses their phone number only information that god would know and then he would prophesy that and people would be floored at how accurate he was and in his day he did help people but when he began to get into homosexuality which by the way yes god does call that a sin and uh and that's what it was i'm just going to tell you now because this is known that it took him some time before he would repent of that and step down but you can see this is what happens not you're not it's not just about you as a person in the five whole ministry it's about you and god and helping and loving and empowering people to be great for god it's our job to train you to do the work of the ministry it isn't our right or privilege to sin the way we want you to do what we think is right and then get upset or offended because people say you need to maybe say something to god or let god say something to you he wants you to have understanding of how that happens and why it happens it's all about our choices so remember when you hear things coming in the day and you hear that they people have fallen please pray for them pray for their families especially but don't ever give up thinking they're all that all the prophets are rotten that's not true there are many great millions of people who are in the bible ministry that love people that care that hear god and live their life on purpose to make a difference in everyone's life yeah you know and i spent a lot of years through the 80s 90s you know there are so many times every time i thought i'd learn the lesson of i would put a put a particular prophet usually a prophet because that was what i was drawn to and i'd put them on a pedestal and i'd say they're up there i remember this guy i won't say his name he probably wouldn't have a recognizable name anymore but back then he was very famous in the 80s and people probably wouldn't know him and i just thought i remember telling my wife i would stand and watch him from afar i remember watching him at a big old conference in seattle in the 80s and i sat there and watched him talk to some people that walked up to him and i thought if jesus was on the earth that's what he would look like that's what he would dress like that's what he would talk like he was so kind to everyone he and then told amazing stories about laying hands on cars that would start that and had words of knowledge and all this and i thought that's what i want to be like that's well then that particular guy suddenly we had a big conference he was supposed to come to and i'm not laughing with humor i'm laughing at the the lesson learned yes and a man like that that i'm sitting there really in my heart honoring him was in the middle of multiple affairs with multiple women in the church and it was just ongoing and somehow or other he was able to pull that off and and since then there's been so many others and you kind of go you know what i don't trust them i don't trust me i don't you know and i think it's a little bit better to say i don't even trust me i don't trust and i don't want don't get i don't want people to get jaded cat i don't want people to get jealous but you know rick joyner used to teach you can fall from any height and then he would say lucifer fell for a look at the height he fell from so it's better to stay humble to stay accountable you know we could talk for a long time about that but yeah there are people god has of course we know god knows everything he knows what they're going to choose what they're going to do but if they were called and chosen and appointed by god he wants them to carry out that call it is up to the people to hold themselves accountable to make sure that they they don't let stuff in their soul that's how it begins to pull them to the side make sure you have somebody that can talk to you or you can talk to if you need prayer no matter who you are find someone that is accountable uh if you need counseling for help seek out a pastor or somebody who does that that you know is really hearing god but but god set a system in place where his voice would be heard throughout the earth and he's not going to take that away i am a very honorable myself greatly honored by god to be trusted by him i didn't ask for all any of this but i said yes when he asked me and i tell people if you said yes you made yourself accountable right then because god needs the truth to be spoken in the earth the truth will make you free when you start hiding things and covering them up then you're in trouble so god we thank you for all those out there god who are right now in the midst of something trying to make decisions i pray they choose the truth i pray that they choose to do what is right before you and even for those that they speak for you on behalf of god that you have your will your way in this day and people will be great on the earth for you with you and because of you in jesus name amen very good amen uh anything else you want to cover before we go get into questions about heaven and other things i just know that people are very excited everyone especially those who came to the event were very encouraged and excited knowing god is doing something in the earth right now even if you can't see it he's still not changed his mind about the exposure he's not changed his mind about the celebration i think everybody there really wanted to celebrate because the presence of god was very strong which said a lot to me that god i don't know about the other event that took place i have some friends that went there to check that out the one that was at ronnie howard brown's place in tampa but i can tell you god was moving in mighty ways in orlando and there was such a download of heaven in the whole central part of florida the hosts were everywhere they were in the meetings they were outside the building they were going into many places in orlando to hold on strongholds of the enemy and so these are powerful days please stay excited for what god's gonna do an expectancy i think i was watching you on a video from there because johnny and elizabeth put you on a video and on that video you said and i was dreaming and i were watching a little bit but we didn't watch a lot of it because of all the stuff that we have going yeah you had said just it was just extemporaneously you said god wants you to pray pray for things that you don't have like he wants you to pray for expectancy he wants you to pray for and i thought you know i never i prayed for things i prayed for giftings i prayed for intimacy but i never thought so much about praying for those heart attitudes that make me it you know talk about that for a couple minutes oh he actually yeah he actually was going on saying that to individual people especially if they were in politics if they were in ministry and went and i actually at the very end when i was saying something to this group that was there to pray for um abraham enrique and please keep him in your prayers he's going to be somebody god's going to use powerfully uh he is the president of ben benito's um that's his company and he's young but boy god's going to do powerful things with him one of the last things he had me say to the group that was there to pray pray for him he said god said no matter what you're doing in these days because of what's going on you better make sure you're stopping to have fun and if you don't think of fun then you need to say whatever you know you need to remember god said you have not because you asked now he said ask for expectancy you will literally say i ask for and receive expectancy in my heart i ask for celebration in my heart and then you'll be flooded with it i mean if you ask he's going to give it to you and so people began to do that and the air got so filled with expectancy so please make sure you're doing that whatever you ask for and receive he will give it to you it doesn't have to be a need even i know we all have needs and we all have desires but don't forget the condition of your soul if you want to be in power then make sure you're asking for acceleration in god more of his presence his ex his expectancy his celebration and his plans because then you're filled with all of that regardless of what's being said around you so it's important to make sure you say those things very very very good very good all right let me start with you know for anyone that's new cat's been to heaven literally thousands of times for the last couple of decades two or three decades whatever it's been and so a lot of questions about him we've covered lots and lots of them so you go to our clip channel elijah clips or you go to uh this one elijah streams you can see all of our recordings with cats so we try not to repeat too much so then they get we get off into other areas that are also important um you talk a lot about the hosts of heaven which is god's army that we are in charge of god will give each of us our own contingent i'll put it that way a host of fighting beings yeah then there's the angels there's guardian angels and i suppose all kinds of other angels yes this keeps being asked of me so many times so you have a couple of them like that so what is your favorite thing that you've seen now we're not talking about the host but just angels what's your favorite thing that you've seen them do or act like that maybe people aren't that are not that aware of what they would be like i like to see them and see their real personalities because people have this mistaken idea that angels are sort of like robots they can only carry out a command from god and they have no other life for existence right to do with commands and that's just not real that's not even real he made tribes of angels before he even made us uh he had relationships they all have friends they each have friends themselves and i like to see them interact like when i go somewhere to speak i see everybody's angels but i see them talking to each other like maybe someone's come from montana and someone's come from south america and they get very excited they they greet each other they exchange feathers from their wings that's a sign of friendship i love to see things like that i love to see it when they know that they've been very successful and what god sent them for to influence somebody to deliver something or write down things that god wanted them to um maybe their careers or scribes scribes are always writing things down careers deliver things from heaven it could be a mantle it could be a body part it could be a just a blessing for you i love to see them in the activities that they were created to perform but they even themselves have places to do fun things in heaven why wouldn't they okay they they they have needs they like to be in the presence of god even though they live in heaven there's events held just for the angels to enjoy and so i like to see that kind of interaction from people's different guardian angels and things they have to say or maybe your own family members like when i'm with my grandchildren i see each other angels talking to each other of course they even talk to me because i see them i see them around the grandchildren how they're keeping them watching over them maybe even saying things from god and their ears i love to see the interaction of heaven here with the people on the earth which is god's purposes for making the angels the army of course only does one thing they fight they war they fight on our behalf against the darkness against the demonic army they pulled on platforms and shred uh things that have been built around us strongholds and so seeing all this activity there's so much activity of heaven around you in your home on your property in cities there's even angels stationed at certain cities at certain gates they love to stand by bridges i've seen natural bridges then i've seen heavenly bridges that come down from heaven to earth um and so i see all this activity in the unseen realm i think it would help people so much to know you're not alone god hasn't forgotten you but how much time are you maybe given to him and i tell people all the time it's certainly okay to turn around because use your angels right behind you it's okay to turn on and say thanks for a job well done thanks for watching over me i even say to god would you please bless my angel and give him some some kind of gift that he would really love to have uh i told you the past because i can't you may know the names of your angels but i don't know them so i just finally told them all right if you're not going to tell me your name i'm going to call you stan so stan is my particular guardian angel whether he likes it or not his name is stan until he tells me what his real name is but he probably laughs about that but he probably loves the fact that you gave him a nickname at least at least there's something and i'd say hey stan how you doing what's up okay so this is like a cousin to that question it has to do with um this someone wants to know about the angels and the demonic and you're a seer so you see a lot and you said people have um most people have even two guardian angels this doesn't even include their own own army so i don't just for the kicks of it i thought well if a 747 jumbo jet can take 467 passengers and it's full and they each have two guardian angels that means on that jet are at least 934 other angels or guardians and then there's the demonic interruptions do you how much of that do you see do you have if you do have to adjust your eyes to see that or do you just see that no i see most all the time so the and i never it's not like something you get really accustomed to because there's so many things going on for example when i'm before i ever leave to fly i will send the army of heaven to put on strongholds it would interfere with me at security at check-in at boarding i'm not tolerating any interference of the enemy because that happens a lot to people who are believers and then on the plane i come against every listen to this they show videos and movies on these planes i'm not tolerating portals being open for garbage to come in so i literally will take authority over every word sound image thought frequency action that's being done on all of these they're like portals on all these things i see things coming in because people are watching things that aren't good uh maybe they're extreme violence and they just let them watch them on the plane which i don't really think is a good idea and therefore i do see demonic activity come in well if they try to come in my own are going to shred them i mean they'll shred them and throw them out because i'm not tolerating their presence but i can't stop people themselves from making choices of what is not good okay and they have witchcraft in a lot of the movies so they're always up if anything tries to come into the plane from these videos this may be hard for people to believe sorry people that's the way it is your tv is a portal your phone you know your reviewer thing anything that you see things on are like portals and spirits come in and out you're letting things in your home at night maybe maybe you shouldn't be watching certain things anyway on the plane i am bombarded with all the stuff coming in this is other thing i do when i get on the plane i say i lift up my shield of faith that will crunch every fiery dart of the enemy so i don't allow any of that stuff to enter into me and then my angels on the outside of the plane and the inside get very busy uh pulling down these strongholds of darkness and throwing them out of the plane because i'm not tiring if you think about those hundreds of people on the plane watching all kinds of stuff what is that doing and giving permission to the darkness in their own lives if they're viewing these things so my life is not normal in any sense of the word i have to make sure i'm taking dominion i have to be aware of stuff going on i create a habitation for heaven right here where i live and that's because i don't allow any of the darkness in here and if something comes in with somebody it gets booted out by my my angels are going to pull them out so i do see this i do pray for all the people on the plane while i'm there before they get on god open their eyes to understand what they're doing uh i pray that they will know you and seek you and their you know in their own lives to belong to you to be a believer so it's like a mission field if you think you have no mission field yeah wow you have a mission field how much of that how much of that warfare for the plane ride did you take did you take authority over and get accomplished before you ever got on the plane while you're still at home versus how much do you under your breath pray while you're there to to do more warfare whether you're going to say i'm sending you i'm sending you this how much of that goes on under your breath if any number one nothing goes under my breath okay that was okay so okay so what do you do i'm not yelling but they totally hear me spraying on back i'm not tolerating that and that wickedness and i mean i want it severed right now i want that portal shut right now well number one the plane is never gonna crash because the first thing i tell my army is you're gonna carry that plane from the time it starts to take off you'll you'll hold it and carry it all the way to the airport that we're going to there'll be no hold ups delays breakdowns or accidents of any kind in any of the systems on the plane the plane itself the people the property i i cover it i cover it that's why i'm alive okay the army of heaven was sent to keep us it says in all our ways and if you're not employing them if you're not commanding them and you send them before you go to any business deal to make sure that deal turns out the way god wants it to that they open favor for you we need so much strategic um planning and training about the army of heaven is so important in these days for any believer who's born again has the right to command the army of heaven christ did we are joint heirs the army was not made to protect heaven okay the father's on the throne he doesn't need any help from anybody and so understanding this stuff and these days will help you live be successful keep darkness from you from your family from your property that's why they're there and god said it will be one of the most important weapons because they are mighty our weapons they are mighty to the pulling down the strongholds that is the army of heaven so everywhere i go i'm engaged in everything all the time especially if i see activity or i hear the activities happening i'm sending that army over there to deal with it okay then or about the armies of heaven once these things are wrapped up or wrapping up and the earth is uh you know the new jerusalem whatever the heavens come down everybody's combined okay there's no need to protect heaven anymore and there's no sin at that point what happens i've i've been asked this many times what happens to the armies of heaven these are fighting creatures who were created for the purpose of fighting i think a lot of them um will be like tour guides to other planets and worlds um that we will probably create things i think we'll get to create not people or things like that i think i will on purpose make sure that they're an empty canvas that we actually get to speak and make different types of flowers and land and just things for people to enjoy and stuff i'm pretty sure the army will go with us just to be there with us so we're not there by ourselves i think a lot of them may get breaks and actually get to do a lot of fun stuff theirself because of all the eons and ages they've been warring at one point they won't have to warn you more i'm sure god has a plan for all of them when that happens and it's probably going to be like the biggest vacation they've ever had i think that they'll also get to do things even with god probably but i do know that many of them will be like tour guides if we say well i want to go to the end of this galaxy they'll go with us all the way there and be with us while we're there not that we need protection or help it's just because the friendship and the in the um the just the relationships that we can have it'll be totally different no one's going to be worshipping angels even at that time and having conversations with them is not worshipping them okay spoke to them i can't tell you how many ezekiel isaiah abraham they spoke to the angels who god sent to them and the whole thing about not worshipping angels only started when the watcher angels fell and created offspring in the land and and those who were wicked and evil that fell and became gods to actually people on the earth that's when the whole thing started saying that you cannot worship don't worship angels but god didn't say never talk to them yeah i'm not saying seek them out and start sitting down having tea with them and asking them questions and telling them to go show you things you never saw before you always go to the father-son holy spirit for things that you don't know or understand the word of god uh that is your that is your um the thing that we live by that's your guideline that's your safety measure until all of this is over and only the father knows when time will end and we step into a whole new eternity that he has planned for us that we won't have clocks or calendars that everything will be done by events which is how god counts time it gets greater and greater but make sure that you belong to him make sure you receive jesus christ because there is no other way to heaven no other way your sins can be forgiven except through jesus christ that is your number one step you have to make that's good i've been asked this a lot of times now but in different um categories of occupation because you said what you what your anointing was down here okay robin williams wasn't a comedian he's probably going to be a comedian in him and that was kind of easy um easier because they're going to be a lot of laughter in heaven yeah i would be written by i can't remember he was just a certain kind of surgeon or was a surgeon he said what about somebody either asked it for her husband he's a surgeon that's what he loved to do that's what he did that's what he did with his aunts he fixed people and she wanted to know or he wanted to know because i don't remember exactly what do i do what does he do in heaven that will use his absolute anointing that he enjoyed so much on the earth by the way he never said i'll use your anointing in heaven okay so he chose the wrong words here the natural gift not even a spiritual gift is what you use in heaven nobody has to have prayer groups you don't have to go win the lost you don't have to labor for people's healing so what do you do you have a gift in you every good and perfect gift those gifts he's talking about are your natural gifts like bakers or golfers or or airline pilots or things like that that you be tour guide you take people from heaven from earth to heaven if you were airline pilot or something like that that's what you will be doing using that gift if you're a designer you'll design things in heaven so even little babies when they pass won't miss their ultimate destiny they also have a gift in them whether it's music or art or sports or whatever it is those gifts and usually what you do in heaven is not what you did for a living it's usually your hobby a lot of lawyers or government lawyers in heaven are going to have yes lawyers will go to heaven they'll probably run the most supernatural really cool golf courses i happen to know i work for attorneys 80 of them and they love the golf course yeah they do so you don't need to have law cases in heaven so what do you mean let's just say i had a surgeon because i had sinus issues over the years so i've had five surgeries and i asked the surgeon a number of years ago i said how did you ever get into operating on sinuses first of all yuck okay second of all you know where would you get that desire and he says i've always liked working with my hands in little tiny spaces it reminds me like of a watchmaker or something they just love these little so maybe a surgeon would be inclined to do something that where he makes things or fixes them with it i don't know what any other thoughts probably they probably most likely will have something that maybe some kind of a design stuff or creative stuff that have a lot of intricate detail to it that would probably make them very excited there's all kinds of those types of things that go on in heaven but but those things that we normally think of we need here okay and having you don't need the police the surgeons you don't need the doctors you don't need even like a school teacher okay the school teachers won't be teaching school they have word university and the and the courses are taught by the one who wrote that book in the bible so it's a whole different lifestyle in heaven trust me everyone has a hobby or if they could do something for a living because it's their passion uh then that's usually what it is that they do in heaven something that's fun and exciting for them something that can bless everyone else in heaven is what you get to do that's why there's so many places to go in heaven so many things to do everybody has that gift i'm a photographer and heaven guess what i'm going to be a photographer that's what i'll be wow nice now okay let's change the pace here i keep being asked this multiple times and there's this thing coming down right here uh many many times i've been asked this if cat knows what has ever happened to joseph the father of jesus he was not heard from after jesus was 12 we never hear from him again do you ever know what happened when it happened and have you seen him in heaven i have seen joseph in heaven i've also seen his mother mary in heaven um joseph because of god's uh trust of joseph because of the importance of christ being a highlighter i guess we could say or the should be the um the one that would be looked up to like he was the at one time the covering for mary he was like the head of the household because joseph joseph just passed away he passed away of normal causes he didn't like he wasn't killed he didn't get he didn't get god really took good care of joseph joseph was so well known joseph was paving the way and mentoring jesus in his gift that was a carpenter in heaven still now jesus does things and makes things with his hands he makes things out of wood he still didn't he didn't lose that carpenter gift even though he's the king of glory and the savior of us all he's the bridegroom he still uses that natural gift carpentry and one of the reasons why he's so good is because he had a master carpenter teach him when jesus had learned all he needed that he needed to know about carpentry and that type of thing then joseph passed away he was in abraham's bosom until the day christ showed up and preached the gospel to everybody there and he said he led captivity captive and then all of them at one time and one point um they all went up into heaven so and he got to see joseph when jesus died on the cross he descended into abraham's bosom that was also caught paradise and he told the thief today you know he would be with him in paradise so the day christ died is the day he descended into that place it's in the in the middle of the earth it's above hell it's far above hell but from paradise in there you could actually see down into hell you could actually see the court courtyard of hell in the gates of hell from abraham's bosom or from paradise and so jesus got to see joseph he was so excited he got to see joseph you got to see abraham isaac jacob jacob david all those who were kind of faithful because they believed in god himself that was one of the first places jesus went he didn't immediately go up to heaven he had to do that he had to fulfill what he said to the thief and so then he was there for a while then from there he crossed over himself as we know to hell was in the into the the into hell for those three days until god god moved and christ knew on the third day he would stand up and wipe out the hierarchy of hell stripped everything off of satan including the keys of how deathly god descend in glory into his body that then was glorified and so that's how that happened i've had people say when jesus died and the spiritual body left it went to heaven that's not even scriptural that's not scriptural so he had to descend first so joseph uh did everything god asked him to do he was a covering he was a natural father to jesus and god picked well when he picked joseph and so jesus god had to make sure joseph wasn't on the scene when jesus stepped into his ministry because everybody would still have attention on joseph who was the head of that house because mary mary and all his siblings were there so he just died of natural causes wow he was in abraham's bosom mary of course outlived jesus and then jesus ascended so at one point now mary's wouldn't go to abraham's bosom she would go to be with the lord has you have you ever seen the homecoming of mary seeing her son in heaven or anything like that um i i have just seen her in heaven i've seen her walking with him i wasn't taken back to show that homecoming i have seen many other people's hearts to heaven but but i haven't seen that specifically i do know uh she it sounded funny when you said she outlived jesus because we know yeah right that sounds funny because he died but then he was alive again right that's right while she was alive he was actually alive yeah so wrong choice of words but yeah so i don't think that's probably the right thing to say while she was living he died but while she was living he came back from the dead my body he did actually go and see her on the on the earth i mean i know he ascended to heaven but he did come back and forth for different reasons and appeared to other people you all know it says that he appeared to many people from the dead remember it says that for however many days it was he was still on the earth back and forth the scene met by many people in those days and mary of course mary i'm sure he saw his siblings i'm sure he saw all of them from when he was glorified but when he had his glorified body when he came up back up to the grave and then they came looking for him remember that the angels had rolled the stone away and they were there he was not there he had to take his blood that was collected at the cross he had to go back up to heaven pour it on the mercy seat which he did do and i was taken to see all that happen that was that was one of the most powerful things i got to see and when he was pouring out his blood on the mercy seat i saw a word appear like murder like um pornography whatever it was and one drop of blood would hit those words wow death disease death was the last one and it would go s and it would disappear it's not just really covered up it just it dissolved all those sins all the sicknesses and diseases and when he was done with the last one and the last drop poured out and hit that and death was wiped out the father stands up and yells yes and when he did that the three room opened and everyone in the throne room which would have been angels and jesus and the father i'm sure elijah and enoch got to see that they were already there they could look all the way into hell i saw all the way into hell and i saw satan in the dirt and dust of hell with his feathers ripped because he does have wings his clothing was ripped uh you could see where every gemstone was taken off of him by jesus christ and he was left in the dust of hell and he screams no and when he did that i could hear from heaven which is where god had me i heard the sound like clamp clamp like metal and when i moved over i saw these big thick like metal bracelets with a ring on it and god said that is where the chain will go when he's sewn into the bottomless pit and then he was really screaming because he knew that was going to be his future and christ totally had a great victory in hell to take back our authority and dominion he took back our right to be with god he carried his uh the sins to the cross for our salvation but and he was done with the cross that was for salvation but he had to enter into hell to take back our dominion and our rights that we had as um righteous people um now you talked about we have a few more get a few more questions in here um mary and uh you didn't you haven't seen the homecoming with her son but our catholic brothers and sisters many of whom watch this program and let us know that they do um what would you tell them or can you tell them about mary in heaven that that would either delight them surprise them amaze them they would like to hear it or they would this was odd to hear that mary is like this versus like anything anything at all that you could throw in there i know what the word says about mary that she would be honored among women almost every believer uh whether whether you're a catholic there are catholic believers people find it hard to believe i saw many countries in heaven who would receive jesus christ right i saw almost every kind of denomination there were true denominations not like false religions right and i saw them in heaven and everyone still honors mary is honored in heaven for what she gave herself to god to carry the son of god and to birth him so he could become our savior but i will say this at the cross when jesus is hanging on the cross and he looks at his mother and he said woman behold your son that was john that was john the beloved and he said to john behold your mother so from that point on and the reason why christ did that before he even died he himself had to die as mary's savior okay he wasn't fun up until the point where it was time for him to die he had to die as mary's savior it wasn't that she he was only dying as like yeah i was your son my son's dying on the cross to her of course she already knew that was going to happen she was told that would happen so in heaven of course he remembers that mary birthed him everyone in heaven honors and loves mary for the sacrifice she made but mary is never worshiped in heaven and she makes a point of saying that herself i am not worship i do not want worship i myself worship the one true jesus christ who is the son of the living god i was honored to birth him to raise him it was one of my greatest pleasures but he is my savior he is my king and he of course is our bridegroom he is the bridegroom so people do love to visit mary they love to hear stories especially about jesus growing up because people don't know a lot about that so usually mary is telling funny stories about what it was like praising jesus that's usually what she talks about but she's not worshiped there's only jesus christ who is the son of god holy spirit of god and the father himself are the only triune god they are the only ones who are worshipped in heaven and that's the way the bible says and that's the way it is and when catholics get there they adapt very quickly that they are not going to be worshiping mary it's okay to honor her and love her for what she did but but she's not a deity even though she birthed one i remember growing up and finding that coming to me or through the lord giving it to me is that the one thing that the catholics really did get right is they took it to the bank where it says all all will rise up and call me blessed i can't remember the exact quote it's not us all women are all all people i don't know but we'll rise up and call me blessed and so um to not do that is to really not fulfill the word she said you'll be called you'll call me blessed or blessed you know so there's and i think jesus loves his mother and will always see her as his earthly mother and certainly wants her to be honored with all right and it also does say in the bible you will be known on earth you know be known in heaven as you are known on earth of course god's not going to take those memories away from him that he had with mary uh he did love her very much and of course he loved joseph even though he knew he wasn't his real actual father he honored him for what he gave him he also according to the life of christ and and christ growing up had to learn things about obedience uh how to speak properly how to deal with people how to handle them he learned that from joseph and mary and so he's very grateful to them they do things together a lot in heaven so that relationship is not like wiped out forever but when he died on the cross it was for all of us it was for everyone he died as our savior and so uh everybody adapts quickly in heaven when they have this understanding of how life is there i've never heard anyone complain about what it's like to live there to be loved there to to be to do good to do great things and have so many wonderful relationships with people uh there's not there's more than peace peace is great but the excitement the adventure the wonder and splendor of being in the presence of the living god and the triune god is there's nothing that can compare to any of it oh amazing all right well last question here and this i actually has similar questions before are there play any places in heaven that cat has asked to see what she hasn't seen yet i don't even think about asking you don't and you go there like an eight-year-old eight-year-old girl right that's how you show up you know you want to go anywhere and i'm always taking places i just they don't turn me loose in heaven somewhere to go find my way i'm sure that you know my my angel who's with me on the earth almost always go i don't think i've ever mentioned that my one angel is on earth with me all the time is also in heaven with me too he probably they're probably saying make sure you stay with us so she doesn't get lost somewhere maybe nothing almost but totally distracted and undone so we need you to take care of her you gotta take care of them you uh you strike me as well because you often said i don't ask to go i never asked to go to heaven now you're saying i don't ask to go places in heaven i'm guessing there are personalities that maybe do they get there and jesus would say where do you want to go and they say well i want to go to the mountainous spices that cat always talks about oh i'm sure people who know the places that are already there they're already making plans they're already making money make sure we're asked to go here and there here and there i do have favorite places i'm i'm taken to in heaven i've seen several times but um what's your favorite place or two i i still have to say that my very favorite place was when i was alone with the father in his chambers he has his own chambers and um it's where wisdom comes from i wisdom is we all know ism is a spirit it's a spiritual being we already know that and so are other things or spiritual beings in heaven but being with the one who who made this and who has been over this and guarding us and guarding life itself inside of himself it's it's like you being with your dad best dad ever in in your existence i look at him that way i have no problem looking him i love my own earthly dad but being with the father who is the father of all of us i i love i understand why jesus said he loved being with the father he couldn't wait for us to find out about the father he said if you've seen me you've seen the father i mean he talked about his father all the time i understand why he's so captivating and and like jesus said there's none good but god and even that in itself is a mystery but the love he carries cannot be denied and you will not have a lot of questions in your head when you stand before the father they'll melt like it doesn't matter being so consumed with him you're happy wherever you're taken i do love to go to the mountain of spices and at the top of those mountains they see the valley of the falls with these 200 foot waterfalls cascading you can jump off and go all the way down and then and there's these massive flowers that are like 50 foot high or 60 foot high and you dive into the flower and off the pedal with the water you go back into the in the and of course all the water and having this river of life i love to be along the crystal sea where rainbows shoot out of it and you shout glory to god and out of your mouth comes a rainbow bridge you can walk across the crystal seed that way i love the ocean i love the beaches here i'm glad that i live near that i look at that water when i'm standing on the beach i went and my father my god poured that out of his hand down this earth and that water is still here it never left i feel very close even in the natural when i'm near the ocean there's a lot of peace there so i'm praying for people out there that you have a great place you can call your home here on the earth uh ask for expectancy and excitement it's okay to ask for things from god he doesn't mind that other seasons we go through in our life we're running into one of the most powerful amazing seasons that will last for generations and don't be afraid to say god i would love to have a place on the ocean i would really love to have a place in the mountains nothing is impossible to those that believe don't forget that he loves you so so good kat we've got your website at the bottom of the screen says says revealingheaven.com tell people what they can get there and then there's catkergo.com talk about those two real quick because wheelinghaven.com is my store it's where you can find all kinds of products that have revelation on them we're going to be releasing so many more messages that he has given me probably over this last year especially haven't even had time to make any of them into things that people could actually hold or have or or share we're going to be doing a lot a lot more on tech technology things we'll have more mp3 things we'll be doing of course like webinars of course the whole mentoring thing we're going to be putting a lot more products out there's also products like this and i love to share it because this is the quote the holy spirit gave me he says you know we're not into bashing people but we're into bashing hell and the demonic because they don't like them he says so you take this and put it on everything and it says of course i don't do demons right there and that lightning bolt in the middle represents when lucifer was kicked out of heaven on the lightning bolt god said we're going to remind him every time he sees this on a cup a shirt a hat um all kinds of things and so we put products out that represent bringing heaven to earth and that's and also you find out about events and that's about to have a lot of stuff added i probably got like 40 or 50 invitations just being there in orlando i got a lot of invitations and these people were face to face with the heads of these groups or companies or churches or ministries and then we then of course that's revealing revealingheaven.com where you can go to find the products or the revelations the uh things that have them on it then there's catker.com that is the father's spiritual platform to say whatever he wants to whenever he wants to we're going to be upgrading that and updating a lot of stuff on that we have so many things to add to that you can see images of heaven you can see images of things like out in the spirit realm uh on there we have like a gallery to look at some things you can actually download we have got many um interviews i've done with people like patricia king and other people and there's also training on there how to ask for grace every day for abundant life how to pray for your family members to know jesus christ i think how to lose stuff from your soul and bind the things of god to your soul so there's a lot on catco.com and most of it's dedicated to that site so you know nobody can take it or steal it from us it took a lot of time and effort but we're still gonna up be upgrading both of those websites and i look forward to meeting more of you and to all those of who i met in orlando how are you doing don't forget to celebrate and eat cake there you go that's really good they're really good kat thanks so much i appreciate it so much so one last reminder folks you see the clock behind me it's right now tuesday afternoon 3 25 pm you will be watching this on the 23rd tomorrow on wednesday so when you see there's a disconnect we want you to know what time we said what in real time and what time we broadcast this so we're giving you both dates all right thanks a lot cat god bless you good as always always always thanks a lot and we'll see you all again tomorrow [Music] [Applause] you

good morning everyone from the great state of oregon it's wednesday morning here june 30 2021 it's 1103 a.m and we were in record i mean world record temperatures just about two days ago and today it's at 66 degrees and overcast and kind of cold outside so what a difference anyway what a difference a couple days make so i'm trying to orient myself these angles that i sit myself at kind of keeps it hard to make everything square up because they don't square up anyway welcome to the elijah list we are the sponsors of our our ministry called elijah streams which is the video portion of all that we do we'll bring kat on here in just a minute be sure you subscribe to elijahs.com if you haven't that way we can stay in touch with you when we're offline if we if we come into a time when we're sincerely offline uh either because we get kicked off or something goes out we may be able to email you we're not certain about how that would work if we all came off the air or forced off anything like that so i'm gonna paul get ready to talk about the clip channel for a moment if you will but first we do want to encourage you to subscribe to the youtube channel go to youtube.com in the search box you type in elijah streams one or two words and when we come up down at the bottom you click the thumbs up the red subscribe and the bell so i'll do that one more time it won't scroll like that but click the thumbs up the red subscribe and the bell don't click it when it's gray because you'll unsubscribe yourself so if you if you get subscribed yourself click the red again and you will be re-subscribed um all right listen paul why don't you come on and remind people of our clip channel tell them what it is yep so we have elijah streams which is what you're watching right now which is the full interview portion but we have introduced elijah clips about about a month ago and we are already past 23 000 subscribers on that so you guys have really done tremendous and supporting us we're over a million views it's fantastic and what it essentially is is the highlight reel picking out the best moments of each of these interviews that steve does with all of these wonderful profits and we love cat and steve on wednesdays all of cat's questions are now in single clips so you can go to that channel and search it if you want to know if cat's answered it chances are she probably has already and you can find it there so it's a great resource for when you're on the go when you don't have a lot of time or if you just want a refresher on some of the great points our prophets and steve make that's good thank you paul i appreciate it very much yeah we get a lot of the same question over and over and over probably probably the most common one we get asked is is can my pets go to have will pets could be inhabited or will might see my pet again and and that's been answered i would i'm exaggerating when i say hundreds of times but over and over and over and finally we have to say okay asked and answered now we gotta get some other questions yes your pets will be in heaven that's the short version of it yes they will talk that's a little bit longer version what language they speak and kat every time we answer that cat's answer ask that question cat's answer is everybody will understand each other so it almost doesn't matter which language we speak but we ask her that from time to time too so all right hey without further ado let's bring kat karan there she is how are you hi i'm excited haven't changed at all since november the 4th yeah they remained excited i remained excited and we you know i would never and i did i doubt you even would have thought back then that we would be in june uh before this thing popped but um i probably would think so having been waiting for god sometimes 40 years or so so i know him i know that he does his own time not man so i never expected it to happen when men thought one yeah i remember way early on you said because i said are you serious and you said this is before um it was all sealed in january 6 or 20 came and went and i said are you certain that donald trump you know is going to be re-elected or whatever and when and you said even if biden raises his hand and takes the oath donald trump is going to come back is going to be there and i remember thinking are you warning me about something you know so i made a little you know a notch on that one i thought okay don't get too excited too fast because there's a little hint that it's not going to go as quickly as the timing thing is the most difficult thing for prophets to get right and even you who've gone to be with the gun and visit the lord thousands of times even when he shows you what something's going to look like in the future and takes you there you don't know when it's going to happen right now unless not unless he's told me specifically there's a couple times he's telling me specifically and it happened exactly when he said but with me it doesn't matter i know if he says that he's going to do it and i've learned that well in my life of 65 years with him i understand he does what he wants to when he wants to but there's always a purpose for it he doesn't do anything randomly he doesn't do anything well he does do a lot of spontaneous stuff wild stuff and that's awesome and we'll probably see more spontaneous stuff coming when this whole thing clears and we're running full steam into uh this kingdom age and ruling with him and speaking to the laying the sea in the air already doing a good job speaking to the air but but he does have it already a timeline there is a timeline in heaven god goes by his own he knows when man thinks things should happen when they beg for things to happen but i know him well enough to know there's reasons he has himself that it has to happen at a specific time frame uh he needs this stuff exposed and he's still exposing and we're still finding out things as he said he had uh trump won just on that day all this evil and wickedness that we're seeing so much come out people are in shock how much there is out there and how many uh people are so wicked but it was necessary for us to understand that so when god moves it'll be not just the greatest celebration ever it's going to set our faith to such a high level and let me tell you you need faith to do things for god even in heaven you use faith not to not to meet your needs or be healed or stuff like that but to enter into different realms to be creative um you're never going to not get to a place where you don't need faith and this whole thing is going to build our faith i did not know and maybe you've got more things to say about current events but i did not know we were going to use faith in heaven yes because we'll know as we're known and we know him because he'll be like him so you don't think of having to have faith but you're saying if you create in heaven even if it's rocks or houses or whatever a person creates it requires some faith it does because that creativity is going to come from you it's going to come from you this this is i'm not talking about god making something if we're made in his image and we operate like he operates that doesn't make us god that gives us the ability to to create like he did where we rule like christ did on the earth right and i just want to take a moment to go back because i don't want to miss saying what god wants me to say okay he does not want anyone to lose that spirit of celebration the thing about celebration is you put it in yourself in layers and the way you do that is the way everybody puts fear in their layers you repeat what's in your head you repeat what's being said to you never repeat what is bad wicked doom and gloom death dying disease uh destruction that isn't even in god right now that's not what he's about right now he's about setting things up for the next 100 years of greatness in this earth and you're starting now by building the layers in your soul filled with him and his ways his thoughts and what he has said to us and he clearly never said this is the end no matter who's speaking he never said this was the perilous times he never said this was the tribulation because we're so far away from that we have to demonstrate and manifest the power of jesus christ in this earth to degrees people never dreamed would happen it isn't going to all be about let me tell you in heaven they're not going to sing about the evil and the wickedness we're seeing right now they're not going to sing or even mention the evil people who are on the earth doing those things they're going to sing about the glory of god covering this earth us as men christian sons and daughters literally speaking to the land the sea in the air and shifting things for him with him they're going to talk about the impossible years of glory that are possible uh people go that's impossible not with god and you know his word says that get your head in his word and in his promises and repeat that because that will fill the layers of your soul it will kick out fear it will kick out deception it will kick out a confusion you don't want to walk around in these days building into the glory and stepping into that threshold still filled with the horrible stuff that people experienced and talked about and discussed why don't you start a conversation that says i know god has plans of greatness such power of got power of god's coming on this earth will never be the same all these days where experience will be like dust because god has this plan he always had this plan before this happened he knew what was going to happen he had to have a time that he could expose evil and everybody's attention would be there paying attention this is what you get when you ask for evil this is the way your life looks like if this is what you think you want socialism or communism it's the worst thing on the earth right now it represents hell so you what do you want to live with and how do you want to live it depends on what you're putting in your soul i have every single day ask for and receive celebration and excitement and expectancy god is going to do it will change you well you know i had to ask last time you said god can give you a sense of expectancy you can pray for a sense of expectancy and i had forgotten or maybe never knew that you could ask for that sense of like i can't wait something big is that by the way what does your shirt say with trump we can't see the what does the title say do you know it says two thumbs up for two terms right because that is exactly what he won people he won one one and i can say this i can say i had some information from a very extremely high level person that uh when i say president i'm talking about trump and by the way hello people he's at the border handling the crisis like any president should he's being very presidential right now uh the left abandoned and dumped all this stuff they want destruction for our country well he is not going to allow or tolerate it yay yay so guess what he won the 2020 election he is right now in this moment our president that's why god actually said put your trump shirt on because he's one and people about to find out even the left will have to admit he won that's so good and cat i want to observe something we you know we know that we have to be we don't look to trump as our savior the lord is our savior but you've been to heaven you've been with the father and maybe jesus and holy spirit each individual times and yet here you're wearing a shirt with trump on and how how would you convince someone to say well you're just almost worshiping trump what would be your response to that i would say i'm saying the same thing god is saying that is what god said even before he won the first time god was saying i've chosen him for two terms he will win two terms he will be president for all that time and guess what he did win when you steal you lose people there is no winner right now in the white house that is the fake and let me tell you even the guardian from the uk had interviewed me by the way newsweek has done an article on me and even global watch and they're repeating this is the funniest thing they're very liberal word for word what i said god said they have printed it whoa wow so i'm wearing this because this is our president he's doing something presidential he's dealing with the border the the southern border that was left wide open and opened by the left and they're still saying it's closed and yet there's so much evidence everybody laughs every time they say they did something when the the actual visible evidence is there could not do that yeah yeah it's a crisis it's totally so god is backing trump because he knew that before he before he announced that he was a running guy said i'm choosing trump and some people won't like it but i need him there he's a great businessman he can't be bought he can't be bullied and he can't be he can't be he cannot be used by the left he will not tolerate it because he's an all-american boy that is all for america and you know why i'm wearing it because trump never changed and god never changed who he picked is no different than him picking abraham or moses or someone else to be great for him in that time he chose him and you will find out he really did do that i'm advertising what god is saying that's what i'm all about so so so good very encouraging things are happening folks now anything else that we got have we covered at all before we get into this question i want to make sure i think so other than the last couple times that um trump got and was interviewed he keeps saying the same thing i did not concede [Laughter] um well one i'm gonna throw i'm gonna throw a little monkey wrench into this um as your as your first question a woman wrote and she was kind of a little twitter painted but she said she didn't think you should have said and she i don't remember if you said this or not but she says that you said one time that the military that trump is currently in control of the military i happen to believe he's in control of the military but what do you say about that right now what is your response if you know that or don't my response is this see how many shows up with him so what do you mean how many shows up with him when he goes places now including to the southern border who has he taken with him i can tell you right now this is why the military no and every general knows trump won why would they listen to those who have no power no authority to tell them anything right right yeah i i mean i don't believe i personally don't believe uh biden has the milit the the nuclear codes or anything i don't think they've given it to him so uh anything else he would say on that and before the next question you look like you're about to say something to me i just know this that trump is super smart people he's not been sitting around on the beach getting a suntan i'll just say that too he knows exactly what's going on and he does have a plan and so do other people around him he has so many people around him but he can't say that himself uh there are other people that already know that and i'm telling you it's all going to come out nothing will be hidden that's what god keeps saying and he is right when he said he didn't concede he never said those words you know why because the same words he says i want he says it all the time and according to god and according to 80 million people who know this we're not tolerating evil you cannot you cannot participate with the evil people every time some new announcement is made by the left you would your mouth need to say i don't accept it and i'm not tolerating it you may not have a you know you may not have a stand or microphone somewhere but what you release in the atmosphere around you does make a difference in the area that you live in and especially in your own home if all you're playing is what the left is saying you filled your home with it and your family with it you don't want to do that because that is not going to remain and yes i'm adamant because god is adamant father is adamant holy spirit jesus christ who is the king of glory who is a ruling king he's also not sitting up there doing nothing okay you're about to see the display they're going to put on and let me tell you celebrate this fourth of july if you have to get a little sparkling light and whirl around and go that's good that's good very very good so all right well here we go okay so let's jump into some questions um some people say that the dinosaurs were alive uh at the same time was adam and eve is this true can you tell us about dinosaurs are there dinosaurs in heaven and this may or may not be a child's question i don't know but were they alive at the same time as adam and eve i was always curious about that it doesn't mention the dinosaurs but that was a new time on the earth you have to understand people there was a whole different time um the dinosaurs were here before the ice age came okay and when you go to heaven one day you'll get to be taken into this place i was taken into i actually got to watch god with jesus christ his name was the word back then god would speak something the word stepped out and made it uh go read the book of john you'll find out what i'm talking about i want people to read the word the dinosaurs existed when he made the earth the first time there's in the beginning in the beginning okay god created the heavens and the earth that was the beginning of time there was a time on the earth where there wasn't time being kept track of when god made the earth the first time he didn't have the sun or the moon and you need to understand in verse 1 verse 2 there's so much time in between that the dinosaurs were some of the first things he put here he had 200 foot um flowers and uh trees that were a thousand feet high when he made the earth the first time and you put a water vapor shield around it because i happen now reptiles cannot live outside the water okay they couldn't live in the desert right now they wouldn't survive i know they find their bones there but that was from a whole different time on the earth god put water angels with the dinosaurs to care for them that's why they find footprints in the in the earth those are not cro-magnon men there were no cavemen people so when god made it the first time he made it and lit it with his own glory as he will the new earth will be lit with his glory so the glory came from inside out it lit the earth there was no rain at that time so god created the water vapor shield to come put a mist all the time the sky was almost like a rosy pinky peach color because of the because of the water vapor shield being above it and the light coming from um on the earth itself and when you're in heaven you realize there's no sun or moon in heaven there's his glory the light goes everywhere it's in everything and so the dinosaurs run freely they didn't hurt each other or kill each other they were very friendly all those creatures that were here at that time and then of course satan was kicked out of heaven down to the earth and it says i believe in the book of jeremiah that he began to make the earth a wilderness and god turned the light out what light did he turn out his glory and then he flooded the earth with water then you froze it okay in verse two what is wrong what is wrong with the earth okay it's hidden under water the spirit of god was hovering over the face of the deep it began to separate the water off of the earth and then the sky off of the earth he had to put it all back in order if you go back and read uh those those verses in genesis and then he began to see that he restored things he replenished things he asked said the to the animals to replenish the earth when he made all the animals so the dinosaurs only ones i've seen are in heaven the whole place where they roam they're friendly in heaven but we're talking about many different changes on the earth that has happened the land masses were split back at that time the earth used to have one big land mass and so um anyway that explains about the dinosaur yeah i know there's an eight-year-old boy and i don't remember why i haven't been i'm just gonna do it from memory he wants to know why did god put us here on the earth he's asking when did satan is here and he said can't he just have separated it why did he put us right in the middle of where satan was well he didn't actually put us in the middle of we're saying was satan was condemned to hell to hades and this is the thing and all the time when god was making this the glorious earth we're talking about the first time he made it even while satan was in heaven tempting the angels god was creating hell hell is in the center of this earth it is a spiritual abode it's not a natural abode you can't dig to the middle of the earth and find it it's a spiritual place where god sent that's where they were sent that was supposed to be their domain and the reason why they came from there was because man himself when he made adam and eve and they had this amazing relationship god walked with them himself when they decided to sin and gave up their rights over to the enemy that gave him the right to begin to rule in different places in the earth and the more wicked people became the more areas satan got control of when people are evil and wicked and areas it gives satan more control because the people want it so god didn't make the earth so we would have to put up with satan he sent him to his place people on the earth and the way they lived their lives gave him access okay they gave him access to come because they were rightfully sinning they wanted to sin they liked the sin and of course that's why at one time it was so bad god flooded the earth the second time because they were so wicked and evil and satan was everywhere having such horrible control god stopped that by flooding the earth so you've seen this example god didn't make people wicked he gave them the right to have their own choices and i have to tell you this if in heaven satan with his own decision to take over went to the angel and tempted them and gave them offered to them follow me i'll set you free i'll give you wealth and position if he was able to do that in heaven god knew everything that was happening but god wanted the angels to make a choice their self just like us we choose if we want it or not want it on the new earth satan will not be on the new earth he won't even be anywhere where we are but he will be in a forever place never being able to get out of the lake of fire will not be on the earth or even in the earth and that will be the abode of all the wicked and the evil will have to be all together they won't be on there there'll be no evil or wickedness anymore but if the angels in heaven had to make a choice to choose if they were going to choose god the father and jesus and the holy spirit or if they were going to choose the evil and the wickedness the same thing was going to happen on this earth people had to make a choice they had to choose for their self if they wanted good or evil and many at one time if that was the only people on the earth were saving how bad was that earth at that time yeah we're not anywhere even though it's bad now it is not as bad as it was back then god will never flood the earth again he gave a promise and by the way because this is what he said to me today make sure you point out that the rainbow belongs to me no other group no other entity it's my sign my image and it says i placed my bow and the sky is a promise that i would never flow the earth again so people if you want to know where the rainbow comes from look up the next time there's a rainstorm it comes from god himself that is his image you know that was one of the questions today uh once a woman wrote and said ask please ask cat about that um and of course you know the rainbow he if people wear rainbows now they're criticized that you must be supporting lgbt q and you're saying that's god's wanted you to say today the rainbow is mine but you know what he and he also and this is maybe a less holy thing he um uh encouraged he he he put into the mind of man to invent the lego blocks and now you can't play with legos or have it on your time like i had a few weeks ago without getting a few emails i said that's an lgbtq say well pretty soon we're out of we're out of symbols because lgbtq has embraced them all yeah so so i mean to follow that through its nth degree if i walk outside and there's a rainbow i should be saying god why are you putting that rainbow there don't you know that's an lgbt well you know they did in their own image to be different they did pick one band of color that was different i don't know if they left one of them out or picked a different one they they made it just enough different but this is what kids are being taught and everything but again i will tell you things will change so drastically from what's going on today that satan will not be having his images put everywhere the mass revivals that are coming even in the homosexuals mass revival even in mass revival uh all of those groups that are so infiltrated by hell and let me tell you how wants to steal their identity it's not that god doesn't love them they have an identity with god they have a purpose from god but satan loves to defile everything and that's what he's doing the other thing i happen to know i actually have a dvd or cd i made called copycat that explains everything you're saying to me it talks about and this was given directly by the holy spirit is a very anointed it talks about every image satan has stolen that is god's images god's plans are god's ways he on purpose takes what is god's he wants to have it for himself and then he twists it and defiles it and says it's his the lightning bolt does not belong to satan fire does not belong to satan but satan uses those images all the time um even the pentagram is a mockery of what god designed as his own personal sign and image and we know that the star of david is actually god's personal sign and image so satan takes the star of david and cuts out the top star the stop point and it makes it look like a pentagram yeah it's just like unbelievable wow i would encourage them to get that they don't cost very much but if you want to get one it was even it talks about the tattoos it talks about all kinds of things in there that actually were god god was the first one to mark people he puts marks on people he's going to put some on you when you get to heaven uh you know even the the 150 000 that will be here to stand for god he'll put his image on them um so it says how satan takes whatever is god's and let me tell you even in the tribulation this is a crazy thing even in the tribulation one that is so far away you won't be alive anyone alive now unless he keeps you here you won't be here when that happens we have generations of the glory and the power of god uh going everywhere around this world but satan knows god's plans he lived with him he god talked about things all the time in heaven and so the thing about the palm of the hand and the forehead when you go home to heaven you get the name of the city of your god in your forehead in the name of your god in your hand where the palm of the hand and the forehead and if you read revelation you'll find out that satan is chosen for the tribulation to have his mark put in the forehead and the palm of the hand he could pick anywhere else but that's where god marks us so a lot of these things satan has taken other than sin and iniquity that's his almost everything else he takes something that's good and twists it that's good by the way i got next question but um one quick correction you accidentally said the 150 000 you meant 144 000. yeah okay we actually know our bible we need 144 000. specifically however there are others that will be a part of that there you go all right here's here's that not me i know i know the bible says 144 000 jews there's 150 000 who will come together so there's 144 000 and then there'll be six others added there will be there will be people who will be like covert people now you're even getting uh i don't even share that revelation to anybody so now you just got out of the mouth that god said wow okay all right well okay here's a woman named sandy she says i'm wondering if you could ask cat or tell me when praying should i pray to jesus god the father or the holy spirit i know they're all in one and i usually pray to jesus i wonder if there's certain times i should direct prayer to the father or to the holy spirit you know what you can you can pray to any of them trust me you can't pray to any of them i normally pray separately um the father really is all about being a father the things of a father and so jesus actually said you will pray to the father but you said you could pray the father my name at a point he said you pray the father but you don't have to use his name so he even changes some things himself he himself prays to the father that doesn't mean you shouldn't pray to jesus he is our king he is our lord he is our savior and i really believe when it's about about salvation if it's about the greater works or the works that christ did i would say direct your prayers to him about that holy spirit is about your everyday walk it says that he revealed things to come to you that he'll reveal mysteries to you uh of course he's with you all the time to help guide you so i can say if you want to be more specific you can pray to the holy spirit to help you in guidance or having a greater understanding of something he also will reveal the word to you so there's things if you deepen up in the word it shows you specific prayers that are prayed but you don't have to do that you can just look up and say god yeah and i i when she actually wrote that to me she actually texted me by facebook and i said you know you're the only other person i've heard asked this question because i said it's my question use and what i do is i end up saying i'll start the day and say good morning father good morning jesus good morning holy spirit and then i will tend to go back to the father yeah maybe because jesus says pray like this our father which are in heaven i don't know but i will tend to do more my father and then i will think well you know i'm not giving jesus any attention not that i'm worried about him being offended i'm not but then then i think okay he's perfectly okay with you praying to the father he wants so much for us to know the father so we'll understand the love that he he gets that he feels that he longs for himself to be with the father it was very hard for him those three days in hell when he didn't even hear the father he couldn't hear him say anything he couldn't feel his presence that was just something that was required of christ so he knows what that feels like to not hear him or to be in a situation where maybe you need to hear him none of them really are going to be hurt or offended if you pray more to the father sometimes i just say god god to me is all three of them right right and god and uh but more than likely or not i talk a lot to the father since jesus said would you please introduce the father and talk about the father and the earth so they realize how real he is how much he loves them that they lived in him that's who they came from you are his offspring so he really put that in me because up until i was introduced to the father i almost always just only said jesus when i prayed i i've been received him feeling the holy spirit was speaking in tongues i probably have like 10 different like tongue languages now when i speak wow and let me tell you that you should pray in tongues it's power it's power the enemy can't understand you you totally pierce the mind to the enemy when you're praying in tongues it's really something you should go ahead and pursue you know i'm glad you brought that up because that's been one that's been asked me several times and the question is that keeps being asked is when people pray in tongues do you have you seen things happen while someone prays in tongues have you seen what happens or anything specific happen when someone prayed in tongues well i know that when i pray myself fire like words and fire uh and i don't necessarily i get a lot of interpretations he just has done that with me for a long time but sometimes i don't it was a very powerful he'll just say releases in tongues and i'll just start declaring in tongues i see like words almost like images not so much words or letters made out of fire shooting out of my mouth going up straight up to heaven like it there's it's like a it's like a streak going up there it's not like some people when they pray it goes it's very melodic and sometimes it creates a cloud and it goes up in a cloud there's many ways your prayers are captured by angels sometimes collected by angels but in times it isn't that way it is like this streak like a missile going straight up to heaven and the response is so tremendous when it comes back down it goes up like this when it comes out it goes so this is your prayer up in tongues this is the answer coming down wow wow okay here's a question candice said children never go to hell at what age then does god consider someone not to be a child 10 18 21 my my friend died in a car accident shortly after high school graduation and i don't know if she will be in heaven so i mean they're asking obviously if this high school kid girl died was she considered a child and therefore maybe a better chance of going to heaven what could you say well god had told me that there was not and it's not a specific age it's what's in the heart of the person it's what their understanding is in their heart and everybody understands things or receives things um at different ages or stages in their life the other thing is this you have to consider about a person and you may not have known even if it was in a car accident even at that very moment or time before they actually took place christ can present themselves to them in in in the spirit realm there is no time is what i'm trying to say and many people even that moment especially if they had somebody praying for them if somebody close to them was praying for that person it gave christ the right at that moment of death because he has the keys of hell death and the grave to present himself to that person if they want him or not so you can't in your mind you can't put god in this box except for one thing you're not going to heaven without jesus christ so that's why god when we declare things and stand in the gap for people it gives christ the right to present himself to them even if they're in a coma even at that moment of of death coming itself remember he has the keys to death there's a reason why he has those keys so i'm i'm telling people i'm not giving people the right to just sin wantonly thinking it's not matter that they'll they'll get a chance to know him but there are people standing in the gap for people and god wants them to know you didn't waste your words and this also makes a difference maybe you didn't know your grandparents maybe you didn't know your great-grandparents what if they stood in the gap christ will take the words of these people who gave their self to him and they stand there and declare i stand in the gap for the next 25 generations whoa i have been surrendered to you because i have given my whole self to you and i have not held back i declare that you will use the keys and you will be able to present yourself to all of my family members coming on the earth that they'll know you they'll be in heaven they'll be in eternity and we will have a time to rejoice if that happened and you may not have ever met them god takes those words they're alive they're just like they just spoke them even though they're in heaven they're still here he left them on they left them in the atmosphere of the earth jesus will take those words and pursue that person so good wow so you someone could stand in the gap or another word would be intercede same means the same thing right interesting person but he if they intercede for their whole 25 did you say 25 generations what did you say yes but i actually i actually have stood for a thousand generations uh because of what is being required of me god said what will you have of me and he actually kind of says it in the word this day i offer you life and death which will you choose you're always choosing life if you're standing for someone to know christ because you don't want them to have death that is not just like your physical dying okay it doesn't mean just that but if you choose life yourself and you pursue christ and you give yourself to him to do whatever he needs i'm not saying you're perfect i'm saying you're always pursuing him i'm not telling you to be mr mr perfect people but you need to let christ have a very high place in your life that you consider what would christ want i remember back in the day when you'd wear a bracelet that said what would jesus do right right right that is something good to live by did you even ask him when you had to make a decision a hard decision did you say what would you want i know people who their spouse had been unfaithful and they were they had every right to get rid of them and not want them or whatever and they decided to go before god they said this is what i have a right to and i know even according to your word i have the right to not live underneath that abuse what would you want and god has said to them i desire for you to keep them they'll give this up to me they'll be powerful people on the earth and that is what my desire is and but how many people ask him that question but even important questions in your life that's what the word says acknowledge him in all your ways and he will direct your path so if these people are living this way and they say i'm standing in the gap and i said to him i'm standing in the gap for the next 1 000 generations of my family line that come upon this earth if we're all still here if we're still here and earth is still here i stand in the gap that they will know you they will love you they will give you their sounds to you however you do that that they will be in eternity with me and all of my family we will rejoice and they'll be great in the earth for you and god said i will give you that wow and then he said this and anyone who's willing to make a stand like that for their family line and those around them and their loved ones i will do everything within my power and my son's power to make a chan give them a chance even at death to receive him it will be so really really really good very encouraging uh okay this one says there were these people that wrote books of colton burpo which is having us for real and don piper i think had 90 minutes in heaven they've had these near-death experiences and come back and said there's colors we don't have here on earth have you seen colors in heaven that are not on earth how could you even describe it what would you even are they cooler colors like the blues are they warmer colors like the reds what would you say all different types colors blend uh they blend that's all i can say they blend and make a whole new color it could be like two or three colors blending together right in front of you and you see a whole new color you never saw before god is the creator he carries the colors within himself they live within him they flow out of him that's the first place they come to and and that's the first bow you'll see the first rainbow you ever see if somebody just is in heaven will be the one that comes from him it's not stagnant and i used to wonder is that rainbow this way around him or is it this way i can tell you it is this way really but it doesn't just sit there in the area it flows from him in waves there's literally waves of the different colors and those waves go up they begin to blend together and there's new colors you just go somewhere in heaven there's whole new colors that have blended together and god will make things out of those colors sometimes you have clothing that changes colors and sometimes because they blend themselves because those bands of his rainbow are alive wow living really really not alive in the sense if it's a person it has life in it because it comes from life itself god is life and life comes from him we all come from him so whatever he has it his it has life in it okay so like a tree has life in it it's the easiest way to say it because it's alive if you cut it it dies so you're saying the rainbow's the same way it has life in it yes the difference whatever it goes in heaven whatever it touches it fills things with his life well wow yeah good reason not to have not to stop using the rainbow because it's such a brilliant thing all right uh has cat ever i keep getting asked this question has cat ever seen dragons in heaven sometimes the bible talks about dragons as evil uh would there have been actual good dragons that were created by god anything like that well i wanna i always comment on the scripture because you know from the time i was little my dad would make us we had family altar didn't mean we had to get saved every night i think my brothers had to but besides [Laughter] i got born again age four and it just stuck with me and i just grew with all of that even in the midst of growing up in a in a very uh visible very uh uh nobody had problems speaking or sharing their own ways in my family we had a tribe that was very out there they all knew who god was jesus holy spirit they knew because my dad had personal relationship with him but um i just knew him i knew he was real i didn't grow up and all of a sudden at a teen go wow i wonder if he's real i was part of the movement that was the the hippie movement but i was the jesus people rescuing the hippies you know i was on the side with what god wanted but i would just say this god does have creatures that you would call a dragon they're called aragons in heaven and i want to bring a little correction it says satan the old dragon it doesn't say satan is a dragon it isn't about being that images what use is an old dragon people they have no fire they have no power they have no strength that was the part of that image god was trying to show people satan has no real power no strength he has no no um that's interesting the ability to just go by himself and take over well that's interesting so he's calling satan an old dragon almost like a slave dragon a toothless fireless power no teeth no real teeth it even says about the lion he goes about like one he can devour but he's toothless because he has no real power god stripped away his power ability to actually create he's anointed to create music that was his anointing but as far as satan himself just taking over with his own ability himself is impossible for satan that's why he's got demons that's why he finds people that would be wicked or evil for him this whole thing he's doing on the earth right now would not be possible if it was only satan standing on a platform trying to take over uh because he has not got that power anymore to do stuff like that he had the ability to call the angels to worship to empower and increase them to worship that's what he was made for that was taken away that's why he says god calls him the old dragon who has no teeth no biting ability no fire power at all which was the greatest thing one of the aragons all shoot fire are the nostrils they fly the host of heaven into battle i have pictures of them wow wow i i didn't even know you had the name of a kind of a dragon like thing that's very that's very cool okay i'm jumping around here because i don't know who to uh can cat talk about how jesus is the way to heaven there's so many different denominations no one agrees on every aspect of the faith and i'm going to jump here it says um uh this has me anxious that i'm not saved if i disagree with someone on an aspect of teaching and paul that worked for us put in a note here he says a good example would be stephen his mother cat has said they will both be in heaven how do their differences in faith opinions regarding scripture and prophecies affect their entrance to heaven so the idea is all these denominations and all of these truths and jesus is the way how they're going how does that work if they all have a sort of a i think they're saying they all seem like they're serving different jesus or something there's only one jesus christ in most of the normal normal denominations all taught or the core of their teaching is you must receive jesus christ because the reason why he's the only way is he is the only one who put in his entire being every wicked evil sin that could be committed every sickness every every hurt every wicked evil thing he had to drink that and the cup in the garden that that was christ given himself he carried the evil and wickedness to the cross it was nailed to the cross because of his blood his blood is the only one that can make you pure when you receive him that blood is sent and washes all the evil and weakness out of you like it was never there that is what gives you entrance to heaven that's why jesus christ the son of the living god who is born to the womb of the virgin mary that jesus christ is your only way to heaven no one else or nothing else can give you entrance into heaven it has to be him so different denominations who are arguing in my case my mom decided i don't i'm lost because i don't keep her sabbath and that's it that's her theology now i've seen her pray i was raised with her she we all believed in the same jesus he died on the cross you're saying you can have this really faulty theology but you're talking about the same jesus who died on the cross for our sins well i will tell you this people mankind themselves um i'm not saying they added to their bible to the bible the holy bible at one time you knew every holy bible is holy today that's probably not true there are new versions of the bible that they literally took whole chapters out but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about there are some there's some religions or i guess say denominations of christianity now we're not talking about false religions we're not talking about buddha or mohammed we're not talking about any of those other false religions the christian religions today and i could name probably 50 different denominations inner denominations non-denominational uh almost all of them have at the core you have to receive jesus christ at least the baptists are really good about that but then other ones say things if you don't get baptized in water there's some that say get saved but if you don't get baptized in water you're not going to heaven if you don't speak in tongues you're not going into heaven um if you cut your hair you're not going to heaven if you wear blue jeans you're not going it's just insane the things that are attached to the requirements right right although john 3 16. yeah it all stands it still stands if we receive christ as our savior repent of our sins and receive him it can be such a simple prayer i repent of every evil wicked sin i've ever committed i don't want that relationship anymore i want to serve you jesus christ i receive the the blood of your crucifixion i i'm asking for my sins if you don't have to make it that detail i'm just telling you what happens when you receive christ and receive the price he paid for you repented of your sins it says jesus is not unjust but he will cleanse you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness that means you will be righteous and all these other things man has added that they needs to be put in their in even in their regulations that says no guess what i always point to the thief on the cross people right on the cross there was two thieves one said when you come into your kingdom remember me you know i am wicked i am evil remember me because i'm receiving i recognize who you are the christ right the other thief didn't want nothing to do with him that thief never got water baptized he never got filled with the holy spirit he never was tied to any religious laws of what he should wear what he should not wear what did she eat what she did not eat christ received him because he recognized him he believed in him repented of his sins that thief on the cross is in heaven with jesus christ if christ received the thief and never got to live any other thing out other than receiving and have the faith to believe in him and he made it to heaven that is what is required exactly exactly that is what is required this what the bible says the father says he sent his son to die for our sins to make a way back to him that is in heaven and i think it's romans 10 9 um i i think that's it um i forgot to have my bible right here but um the the one that says if you believe in your heart and you confess with your mouth that jesus is lord you will be saved and my mom and i she's about 87 now a couple years ago she and i kind of got into it because she was on my case about being lost going to hell and this is like two years ago and i said mom and i kept reading romans 10 9. confess with your believe in your heart confess with your mouth that jesus is lord and she's and she would come back with a a proof text to prove that i was lost and finally i did that about three times and i finally left the room and she walks up to my wife who was still in the room was there the whole time she says where's that scripture again she [Laughter] it was an intense time but i was stunned to learn that after i left the room she wanted to know about that she didn't want to ask me right and one day when she's in heaven looking down see if she'll be yelling you were right right keep going i'm gonna say laura would you show me that moment in time when she that's great let's look at our time here a couple more questions okay i'm gonna finally brave this question i've been asked this many times to ask you ask cat if climate change is real or is it just a tool of the left to gain control it is a tool of the left to gain control because god set in time on his own timeline when things will begin to change seasons change and they have said for years that the whole arctic cap would melt and flood the whole earth and yet it freezes people go visit it's frozen frozen frozen it's like a seasonal thing here the seasons carry around the whole earth maybe not as such significance as other places but god set the earth to do it this way the ice caps melt for a reason a part of it for a reason for the area that they're in he needs that to happen but he's the one who blows his breath on the earth to bring the freeze and then they will refreeze because he needs them to be that way right until time is no more this earth is going to be here and the seasons will be just like they always were the bible actually says that the seasons will keep going the days and nights will keep going until time is no more and he doesn't need the earth so your climate control that was just an agenda they want to use they'll they'll use anything they can right now they're throwing everything everything awful in the soup they're just throwing it in there at us but so here's the um here's another one this woman is 70 years old i think it's a woman i can't actually i can't tell if it is i'm 70 years old are there airplanes in heaven can i fly one i'm 70 years old now and won't be able to do it in this life so i don't know if this person means i can't pilot it or it's never ridden in a plane it may it almost sounds like they haven't ridden in a plane um let me just add my piece to this that was someone else's question but i i'm taking flight training on helicopter just for the fun of it if you go to my facebook it's that big picture but we were talking about this last night with my wife and i said yeah i'd like to fly a helicopter in heaven and give people rides but if everybody can just fly themselves that will it wouldn't be much of a fun thing to do they'd say why should i get in your helicopter and ride when i could just fly because people love it [Laughter] there's something about enjoying something like that and and people can fly in heaven some do some don't choose not to but everybody loves the different things that people come when you come home that you get to do things like that like king david takes everybody for rides in this chariot why why do they do that if people can fly why not why not ride with king david and it doesn't matter that it's king david people like to do that there are jets there are planes there's little things i've seen people have their own personal little um like a jet but it runs on light the only fuel is light uh they don't need gasoline petroleum they don't use gas to do anything like that light is like a propulsion is something that even you can write on light just step in beams of light and go somewhere but people love to fly they love i'm sure they've got helicopters there too they have all kinds of things we haven't even seen that people get to enjoy up there yeah you know today i just thought i was looking at online and there's a car that they've made that flies i thought really it looked like a car it was literally a car with the wings and when it landed it's things go back in like this and back like that but they show this thing take off it's running down the runway with its wings out and it takes off then it lands on four wheels and and it pulls it in i mean they you have talked about that we're coming into incredible times yeah people have used the word like a new renaissance we've talked about creations things that are being created has the lord showing you any type of invention or technology or reality that we will yet experience on this earth before heaven that he's shown you yeah there's quite a bit of them one is how to generate power to things and that will be a fuel that will be captured out in space and it will be captured not like you'd have to put gas in a pipeline or even something to bring the sun down i'm not talking about solar energy this is literally an energy that god created up in space not way out in deep space but can be brought down to the earth and then with this little disc i saw a disc and this was when he took me forward in time and people some people were still walking they still had houses a real supernatural design some of them but this disc is all it takes to pull the energy down and then other similar ones not lots of them you could go in the most remote place in the earth and have power to power a home or offices or a facility it is coming he only shows me what really is coming i think one of the most fantastic things i was shown was a train that doesn't run on rails like metal rails it will run on beams of light it literally will be on these beams of light wow two different ways it could take passengers and go or people could actually drive their vehicles up in parts of it and they close them in if you want to take your vehicle with you you go to another part of this train but it runs on these beams of light everywhere wow so it's like a it's like it sounds like almost anti-gravity in other words it doesn't it doesn't drop to the ground based on gravity it's up in the air at all and there's there's it never sets on the ground what kind of changes did you see a hundred years in the future however far you went to the future as far as the house who our houses look like this house today do they kind of look the same there are some people that will always love a certain architecture we're never going to get to a place where we look like cookie cutter anything there's always going to be different areas that probably have a different style for homes and you just live in a whole different area they try to do that now sometimes like a certain development housing development can all be like european mediterranean design one they still have some like in virginia and pennsylvania they may have some with colonial design that's more prevalent over there but there's going to be new design and i will say this because i do know the father told me that he showed me a lot of houses will no longer be square they'll be right really it'll be round the rooms will be round the center room will be round your whole home outside will be round uh it's going to be some of the most fun times to be here with all because god is so crushing down evil i'm not saying he's taking off but all the stuff you're seeing now god on purpose has a plan then he will crush it and push it way back satan will have his time to be really all out evil and wicked in the perilous times in the tribulation but up until that time the glory the glory in us because you don't see yourself as being powerful you are powerful through the blood of christ it says the greater the things i did you will do greater works you will do so with us taking authority in love okay out of love our under the power of christ gave us operating with him the earth will be so magnificently changed in many many areas and a lot of these major cities won't be a hot won't be a place for crime to grow it'll be for the glory to grow creativity to grow and there will be a point before that maybe i don't know how many years 50 60 70 years i don't know from here things will have sort of another shift where there'll be more moderate people in charge and i think there'll be some changes in the in the areas but there'll never be a time the evil takes completely over until way well over 100 years from now before all the evil really starts happening because this is god's time to take us for generations to build and know him more to do more to be more for him it'll be about him and people will want to be with you because you are a christian but let me tell you creativity we haven't begun to tap the creativity that god is sending to this earth so i saw uh sources of fuel uh now there is a source for power that would be to generate power or you're already bringing power down basically he just said holy spirit tell them to bring power down it brings the power down you don't have to create something with it it will be it's how it's captured and how it's dispersed so there'll be no remote areas in the earth that don't have a way to help people or to build things to to go and visit and stuff like that transportation totally changing i did see a time when i saw no cars driving on the earth unless it was an exhibition an exhibition of old type cars that had wheels on them the cars will be flying yeah that always makes a lot more sense because there's a whole lot left especially if they're computerized flying there's no traffic jams because you go above below around and and everyone's watching out for each other because programs keep everybody from bumping into each other it's like flying bumpers there were no driveways there were landing pads yeah and so you so you get out and you drive whatever your car is your vehicle and then it floats it goes right awesome what about cures let's end with that have you see any cures and that are pretty soon in the future or or how far in the future because you know the big ones are alzheimer's heart disease diabetes obesity the first ones released and i really believe right now as i speak there's already a cure that's being held back there is already a cure for cancer in the earth and the pharmaceuticals don't want people to have it and i don't like to say that but where truth is truth needs to be told uh cancer will be a thing of the past god said like it never existed not any form of cancer will be on the earth at one time like remember you you probably didn't live in the days when polio was here and even kids had to work i was born in the 50s i saw a little bit of that stuff and i remember oral roberts getting everything was amazing healing ministry but there will be things that will never be seen on the earth again cancer is one of them there are several other uh if i sit down and go look at my notes where he gave me a list of them uh but i can tell you cancer will be the big one the big one that that no one will have it there there'll be a way to even prevent a lot of it from happening i really believe some of it's caused by things that we're actually wearing and eating i do probably yeah i totally believe that is has the lord shown you anything about the discoveries of the poisons we're inadvertently eating when we don't even realize we're eating poison will he yes because science will be used not as well some sciences are not good i can't say all science is bad we could create or we have to know things right i mean there are people who do care and even all the stuff we're seeing now there are people who care in the medical arena and even in some of the pharmaceutical stuff is for good to help you but i think more and more they're going to discover the natural things god put on the earth to heal and to keep people whole not just make them whole but keep you whole i think there's going to be so much of that that's released and i also know the pharmaceuticals are trying to keep it off the shelves because it works and i think there's going to be whole new ways to create and make things that don't have to have chemicals or poisons in it and i would encourage everybody make sure you know where your stuff is coming from if at all possible and we already know one country that doesn't like us and they don't even like their own people that would be china and i don't mind saying that they don't even treat their own people well why would they want to treat us well maybe to get money from us i don't know and by the way i know there's millions of underground people underground christians in china i already know about them i do pray for people like that that are being held back and crushed back i know what people go through some of them to just try to exist to not really live but we're entering into time that'll be the greatest times to be alive and god keeps saying that even though this other stuff's going on you have to understand he knows what it is and yes something's going to be done about it so your lives especially if you're young i tell them all the time you've got the greatest life to live on this earth make sure you're living it for christ and with christ know him don't go to the darkness the darkness destroys and we're seeing darkness more now than we ever have before but it will never be greater than the light or the glory of god that is in us we carry him we manifest for him we speak for him in the earth and if somebody had been to heaven over a thousand times you would know how to speak like god speaks and i speak life to everyone listening i never go for death i never agree with darkness don't participate and don't tolerate the darkness and even right now you get to make a choice if you're going to so i talk about the things of god to perfect strangers all the time to bring them life and they begin to see things they never even dreamed that they could think about in this day but a hundred years from now people were celebrating they were still celebrating holidays they were celebrating christmas really really celebrating thanksgiving i saw many family groups coming together on a regular basis i even saw things called like generational homes like people would build on property but they weren't building to isolate themselves from people now a lot of people go let's go build a house way up in the mountain away from everybody life wasn't like that 100 years from now because there was so much of god everywhere and people were more open to being friends and to being social with people sharing with people but i did see family the family life changing to not just include while the parents are christians but the kids got away with to the enemy than the grandkids did i saw that changing because of the power and the presence of god and the glory of god being displayed so much in the earth the people one day are going to not be able to say there is no god god's erasing the gray area that says there is no god and that's why you see so much darkness you see darkness but you're about to see the power of his light and so if the light and darkness come the gray that where people are hiding in sin and evil is hiding in it will be erased and then the light will be even greater so so so good ken thank you so much hey so uh at the bottom of your screen it has revealingheaven.com you've got two sites tell us the difference between the two sites rebuildinghammer.com what's there revealingheaven.com is where you can find out my events you can see all the products lots of revelation and we're about to release some brand new revelations uh uh you know through ways to listen to it or ways to watch it we're also going to be putting flooding the market with more products that represent heaven or say things that haven't say if you're going to wear something we're something that heaven says you know don't don't advertise the darkness i know there's a lot of that stuff out there another thing that will change also i saw was the marketplace and what's going to be flooding the marketplace will be things that will bring life and hope and joy and celebration and fun to people uh so there's going to be even a turning away i know satan's been trying really hard to gather in new people but it's there's going to be a point where there's actually a turning away and resisting even in the sectional arena for wickedness wow because of the presence of god so catker.com is where it's a spiritual platform it costs nothing to go there to look at anything there's images you can see there's all kinds of videos that train you to understand things and no revelation and it is the only place on the face of the earth if you want to give to me online you have to go to catcare.com click on the treasury click on the guardian zone if you want to be a monthly supporter we did that to protect people because people everywhere are saying this is me you know they're saying they're me please give to this send me money for this i'm not going to do that okay i didn't even think about asking for money god said you have to give away for people to give my heart my generational heart that goes way back seven generations we had people that love people i even love the people who are wicked okay that's why i talk so much about jesus jesus desires that none not even a vile sinner should perish but you know what it's gonna happen if people choose wickedness and evil and they don't repent so we when we speak to people you better bring life when you speak to someone new don't share everything wrong in your life don't make everything be negative tell the truth about who god is how you can live for him the things he will do for you make sure you talk about the victories you've had in your life because we overcome by the blood of the lamb and satan hates the blood of jesus isn't that just too bad for him the blood of lamb and the word of your testimony your testimony is a testimony of greatness and god's goodness it's not a story about every sad poor day you had in your life that's not a testimony that's a story so make sure you put god in there you know if you need more of him tell him you want more of him i tell people talk to him like i'm talking to you god i need more of you are you hungry for you give me hunger give me a desire to know you really know you i want to see you i want to hear you clearly i'm so fed up with the darkness in my life i resist the darkness i crush you out of my life and i give myself a new to jesus christ i surrender my life to you to do what you want to your will your way this day i give you praise honor and glory to the father the son the holy spirit and i thank the host of heaven go host make awesome cat thank you so much on behalf of all the viewers we appreciate it very much you're certainly a very strong favorite among people so god bless you for that and let's see tomorrow let's just tomorrow thursday oh we got this thing she got ahead of ourselves it's nathan french tomorrow and johnny and low on friday okay everybody thanks again god bless you have a great night we'll see you tomorrow bye [Music] [Music]

the extension because i don't want to give it away but anyway how are you how was your fourth it was great we had an awesome time um some of my family were there some of our staff got to come and i'm really glad that they were there because we had a powerful manifestation of god himself and everybody needs to go back and listen to the second meeting last sunday that would be fourth of july the second meeting in the lord of hosts um oh that's right at hank cunaman's church hank kuniman's church and hank was prophesying and he said watch for the hand of god to show up that he said watch for the pointing of the finger evidence is coming and you need to watch especially for those two things you know how he talks about watch for the different weather and everything right he was talking about some very different things this time it was real exciting i didn't know i was going to get to experience it though and so we went on to our fourth of july celebration and we set up and everything we always know the best places to go it's not always where everyone else is and so we go behind the buildings uh in the direction the fireworks are shooting so we were like kind of like uh in town center jacksonville and we're right near the big dillards building and the fireworks break right over top of that building by the way if you hear an alarm going off um we're going to bring the video next week and let everybody actually see this video the hand of god appeared at the end of the fireworks you clearly see a finger pointing and his hand is like this and you see it pointing up wow god said there's my finger pointing there's my hand and my finger is pointing and so that was so significant so i took photos but i did a little mini video about it too saying does everybody see can you see the hand of god can you see the finger pointing and hank wasn't uh at that moment he wasn't in omaha he was at his um he was at the special thing they had for the for the fourth of july can you remember where he was yeah christmas over there in nashville at the scandal right yes and so um i sent the pictures to hank and brenda and i even sent the mini video and when their plane landed i think back in omaha it was already night and fireworks were actually probably going off uh where he was at and they could see him from the plane but when they landed they saw my my uh my text message to them he was undone he clearly knew that morning was when that prophecy was given and that evening god showed up at the end of the fireworks with his finger pointing with his hand showing about this much is showing you clearly can see it you can't deny but in the background you see the faces of the host all around it so it's quite spectacular wow to start this broadcast with a very positive for sure message and letting you know god is confirming his word the prophets speak on his behalf and boy was that ever fast okay that morning that night it happens right now was that in florida where was that that you saw that that was in florida that was in jacksonville florida where that happened and you know now is it a stretch to to say if god was going to show it to anyone he'd probably show it to someone who's watching images in the clouds like you do you pay attention to images in the air don't you i always watch the sky whether it's night time or daytime but i was especially watching because as the fireworks went off the smoke they create in the sky the host literally will get in that smoke just like they do in the clouds so i already was taking pictures literally of all of that going on and that's why you see some of the faces of of the host behind the hand of god uh in the sky it was really amazing we were all really excited about it that's awesome now i had someone write to me and she she or he i can't remember who which is he or she and they were pretty upset because they said hank or someone said there would be a shift and we would see it uh on the fourth and nobody's saying anything and nobody saw anything and you're really basically saying uh contradicting that shift is exactly what that was yeah and i'll have to tell you too on that day well actually trump did his major speech the day before yeah and in god timing that was the fourth i mean if someone says it's on the fourth and he does it a few hours before because his main thing was on the was on the third that's the fourth that's when god's talking about the weekend of the fourth uh but then on trump's gloves came off if you were listening to trump speak on the third you heard all kinds of secret code that he was giving his followers a message about things are going to get fixed sooner than you know sooner than you expect i don't know if you've got a chance to hear us july third one or not did you i didn't have to hear it because i heard from some of his own camp um personally and not only that my one brother rj he gets messages all the time sent to him from the homeland security people really that kind of confirm what trump is saying now they don't send them to anybody they send people who send them to people who are a part of that you can't just ask to be a part of it they choose to trust you as a patriot or not but he actually did also get something sent to him saying that it was not going to be long i can't tell you everything that was said to him he wouldn't tell me everything but very confirming to the the tips that trump is giving it's not the first time he's given tips but i can tell you we're uh we're much closer but the shifting happened on the fourth it was a spiritual shift thing but it was visible awesome you will see that hand and this god's hand in the finger pointing it was prophesied that morning that would be the beginning of something and he said watch for the hand of god watch for the finger pointing how much clearer can you be there's nothing around it that is what appeared on the 4th of july in the heavens it was sent by god so people said we would see it we saw it everyone's going to see that image and you're going to know god literally did bring a shift and part of that shift was the fear that's going to be beginning to fall on the left more fear than they've ever felt in their life because it's coming from god that judgment and justice is coming and the the main thing about the shift was that's it god has reached his limit and you're going to start seeing major things happening in the media and i really think um more and more lawsuits because people will be bold enough to finally bring lawsuits against the social media platforms from their business being stopped or hurt or even ended and other issues will come up in the courts watch again in the courts what will happen people it's another sign you will see and hear about things happening then they will begin to side with justice they're going to side with justice people you never dreamed that would side with the right who are actually part of the left because they have realized themselves how wicked and evil the left is in their whole agenda god is ripping away the veil that they've been hiding them in insane different laws and regulations but the whole real purpose will be seen openly and heard openly it's part of this whole shifting it happened and it was visibly seen happening but what i felt from that day i've had more excitement building me than ever ever before me too and you know it and for those of you who did or did not see the one on the fourth with the with ken christmas talk about christmas in july fourth of july kent christmas is spearheading this he brings in i won't remember them all dutch sheets robin bullock hank kuniman timothy dixon i felt like it was an elijah streams reunion almost watching this thing and there was a few others i mean i seem like they're forgetting one um i said dash i was glad to see dutch there because he had kind of like pulled back a little bit but not on the fourth he came right back in and he he at the top of his lungs he was declaring the same thing so i it was the gloves were off is the only way i know to do it and the bolder and bolder we now are becoming more than that that opens the door for more more boldness which opens the door for more more boldness so it's hard to say that three times uh so people are are getting encouraged and emboldened that now it's okay to speak up and yeah people steve even the everyday people i won't say ordinary because no one's actually ordinary but even the normal moral majority who've been waiting to see what would happen they are starting to speak up when they haven't spoken up before and i think one of the things that was released spiritually was a spirit of boldness and if anything is in the father it is a boldness he has boldness in him as part of his character and i know when he released his finger in the sky it made like a shock wave to go across this country and eventually the world but especially in this country since this is where the hotbed of everything is happening let me tell you what it's going to get a lot harder for the left and a lot more freer for the right for those esteemed i love that it's a right it seems righteousness right now but but the father really is started something in motion that will not stop until all justice is completed so good and trump was in rare form today back on he was the one that's he's starting the class action lawsuit i'm going to join his class action lawsuit because you know they've been we've had to watch every word and they've censored things that we've said you know basically we've gotten off easy compared to some who lost their whole channel but uh yeah and and and when that thing takes off it's going to be curious because uh i'm curious to see if facebook and youtube suddenly gets frightened and starts allowing everything just so that they don't lose the lawsuit because either way it's a win-win if they do that we can say all the more what we want to say that's right well anything else you want to say before we do some questions heaven questions i i think uh i'm just about ready for whatever you have to add well i'm going to start with a uh risky question which is what would you like to say people have been writing by the hundreds and hundreds over the last few months we just kind of let them write because we don't have some perfect answer for them they wanted they're hearing all these rumors about vice president mike pence and these people are claiming he did this said that the guilty of this and so a lot of people are watching that and they're saying now what do you say cat now what do you say uh elijah james i can't say anything different than what god said from the beginning he has never told me to change what he had me say when god picks people he picks them nobody can remove what he said that person must choose to go forwards with what god's desires are god chose mike pence to be vice president for those years and yes he did pick him to be president but mike's own choices and actions well we'll see what happens with that and that's actually what the father says to me he said i still chose him but he does get he does have to make choices of his own life and the father's never commented on what everyone else is saying out there he'll just say i did choose him he'll have the right to choose what he is going to do with his own life whether it's something we like or not but this is the other point i want to make anytime something this volatile is happening in our country there's always going to be people who act in suspicion and they may hear one or two things and then that's all they're going to report on is what they're suspect what they suspect or what they think i will say this i'm just going to say what is true what is true is mike pence is campaigning for the republican party he is campaigning on behalf of trump he is supporting him and what he he decides he's supporting him and all the changes that he made he he has verbally said these things recently he has said these things i also know this the republican party because of everything going on is checking out everything every accusation against somebody who would be running for office or campaigning for the republican party so they are totally checking him out we may hear something from them i've heard nothing from them against what he's doing or what pence is saying now what happened in the past i can't even comment on that i'm allowed to say what god says himself god didn't refuses he didn't change his mind about trump he didn't change his mind about pence but trust me god is watching his actions and he sees what's going on in his life god even knows the outcome of everything that doesn't mean that he didn't still choose him right i know you may not understand that but god knows everything he knows the beginning from the end he knows he's telling the truth he's not telling the truth and god will judge him according to his actions in his life even though he was chosen even in the bible when people were chosen sometimes they were good then they turned not good and god would end what was happening i would say why not wait and see how this comes out i do know this trump is right now our president whether you like it or not right now mike pence is still our vice president because the election was won it was stolen it was not lost yeah and it was criminally stolen which makes it personally stolen there is no win for the left in any measure there's no authority and no power actually for them to operate according to god they have no power in what they're saying because they're they're ill they're illegitimate and they have stolen and it will have justice brought to that again anyone who is involved in other things which would include pence if he's one of those people that's going to come out and all the stuff that's happening god said nobody would be able to hide or get away with anything that was she you know killing stealing uh or taking away what was what was rightfully ours and i'm telling you the election was won by trump and by pence the whole thing that happened at capitol hill the truth will come on about that why did pence make that decision i cannot answer that i won't let people put words in my mouth and god won't let people he won't let me change what he said he chose him from the beginning he had a reason why he chose him he chose trump and in this moment in time as i'm speaking trump is our president pence is our vice president how that all comes out will be exposed or else brought forth the truth will be brought forth by god himself in the meantime stop listening to all the conspiracies it's going to fill your soul and you don't want your soul right now to get cluttered with stuff that you don't have evidence brought no matter what people are saying out there doing i don't like gossip i might don't like gossip i'm going to see when justice is done what happens in the time of justice and we will all know and we will know the truth and we will within therefore we don't have to try to go by suspicion or conspiracies yeah yeah and you know what when this whole thing not only did trump win but a lot of states went to trump that they're not reporting i'm i know that i know that california went to trump you watch this before it's all over they're going to report that california went for trump on the election but there's going to be a lot actually that did go for trump they are few literally very few people voted for the left very few people uh all that was a facade it was a lie it was well planned out to steal it and just because they think they've won they're delusional right now they're the ones who received right now we are coming into this with our eyes wide open almost 100 million people know that they know they know that trump won that election and nothing will ever change that but as god said every lie will be exposed when that landslide of exposure starts from the smallest person involved to the highest person involved he's going to make sure it's all known and because his hand appeared with the finger pointing which is what hank said that was a clear sign a visible sign that that shift has already taken place so good so so good now you don't know this because i didn't i purposely shielded you from it because you don't like to have be influenced by other prophets before you give your word so i'm just going to tell people tomorrow manuel johnson's on and he's told me god gave me a word about pence and by the way yeah by the tone of his voice i will say it this way uh and a couple of things he said but i want you to get to tune in tomorrow i don't think he's going to disagree with you at all by some things he said so i didn't want to tell you that beforehand so that it would be a clean word so the and people know that we try to keep it clean so we don't try and compare notes and then prophesy you know but i think it sounds like god's god's not done with our vice president so interesting he's actually not done with anybody right now yeah well that's true too none on the left or right he is not done until all this is over and justice is served in america he said you need to say america is free and never was not free from the time it was established and we want our right to be a country america is a free country they can't steal a free country and that was those are god's words you may quote that there he goes that's good um okay couple things now this one has been asked before but i think we didn't get the rest of the question i asked you before did have you ever seen joseph in heaven and uh because that keeps being asked and then people are keep asking is there anything you know that's not written in the word about what happened with joseph how long was he around how much did he see jesus grow up how much did he know do you know anything about his earthly life that we don't see recorded i know for certain that joseph was around as long as the father god needed him to be there with jesus he was his mentor he was his trainer and his gift which jesus would do use not just on the earth by the way jesus still does carpentry in heaven as the king of kings he's never lost that gift he took it to heaven with him joseph is absolutely in heaven i have seen jesus and joseph working on projects in reality really carpentry carpentry projects i don't know what it is they're working on so his earthly father also his earthly father is building oh i never thought of that before well you know that was joseph's gift joseph had a gift his gift was carpentry he was a master carpenter he was known all over the city by the city elders by all the wealthy people whose wonderful furniture he made and actually that was one of the reasons why he and mary weren't stoned they weren't stoned because they weren't willing i do know that from the spirit of god they were not willing to lose the best carpenter they had and therefore they didn't stone them which was not even normal for that day that would have happened but of course of course god protected joseph had to be there he had to train jesus in that natural gift that god made him as a businessman he was sent as a businessman from heaven joseph was a businessman and he got to train jesus most of his life until he was well into the master carpentry once jesus got into the master carpentry there was one point where god did take joseph home so the spotlight would be on jesus as the head of that household and he was and did become the head of that household watching over his his mother mary and his siblings and he was known he was invited to all these weddings and everything you didn't just get invited to weddings especially if it was a wealthy person's wedding uh jesus probably made the furniture in that home of that person the uh probably the father of the house that his daughter was getting married and jesus was invited and then of course what did he do he turned the water into wine his first miracle that was heaven's wine and so there was a whenever god needed joseph there he would remain and to the point where joseph had completed what god sent him for and then he he was in abraham's bosom first okay when jesus went to go see the thief he actually saw joseph there he saw joseph there uh he saw all of the past uh prophets except elijah of course elijah and enoch they were in heaven but until jesus poured out his blood on the mercy seat people who who died faithful on the earth righteous they were taken to abraham's bosom but jesus led captivity captive he preached the gospel to them and at one point led them all into heaven before that nobody went to heaven they were kept there and so he did see joseph that's where joseph would have gone when he died he would have been in abraham's bosom with moses and abraham everyone else so he was there when jesus went down into abraham's bosom and then of course of course he's in heaven but they still do carpentry they did it together on the earth they still do it in heaven never occurred to me to do that which which adds a question from me is if you've seen them working have you by any chance seen since they love to work with wood and work wood would they have what we consider power tools to sell what what have you seen maybe you've not seen the tools maybe they don't need tools i don't think they need tools i i think they do a lot of speaking to the wood to be in certain shapes since they rule in heaven um and they also learn how to create things in heaven but they love to use their hands so i actually have seen them using sometimes a chisel to shape some things and things like that especially when jesus puts his own carpenter's mark he actually uses his little hammer this little chisel then he chisels in a little cross if you get to heaven and you see this beautiful thing made out of wood it could be something you would use some beautiful thing on the wall if you look up in the right bottom corner you will see jesus's mark you'll see a cross he made that for you himself now that's very cool very cool um okay so here's a lady eileen she wants to know she says um i love the nighttime the moon the stars the peacefulness and yet there's no night in heaven is there a place in heaven we can go to experience tonight i think we've explored this a little bit but there are a lot of people that love aspects of the night and i i guess i like a little bit of that myself but what can you tell them i know that a place in heaven called the observatory that when you look out into the observatory you actually see the cosmos the cosmos is that close you can step through it and you're actually in the cosmos people call it the universe god calls it the cosmos the cosmos means it was made by divine design the word universe means it was made by the big bang there's a difference in what we call that that's why in no nowhere in any of the school books will you see the word cosmos but in the ancient hebrew writings it's mentioned 150 times the word cosmos really yes it is it is and so that's what god named it he made it he named it there are places in heaven that you actually can be out in it if you want to see it you step in through this big archway uh it's up these beautiful stairs and there's a platform and you see the archway when you're looking right from inside the heaven you see out into the cosmos you step out there you're out in it now didn't you describe one time that the cosmos when you're in it isn't the black that we know isn't that a pink or something i'm trying to remember what you said well i know all over heaven there are there's colors waves of colors that go around heaven some of them are the dark glory and you know the bible talks about that which is a mystery to some people it's not a mystery to me it says god hides himself in his dark clouds of glory and people go what could that be i thought there wasn't any darkness well it's darker than what you would normally see in bright light and what those clouds of glory are made of are like millions it looks like to me when i saw it and even photographs i have of it i actually have some photographs of the angel angel going back up into the dark clothes and glory it looks like a million peacock feathers almost like camouflage they're darker but you see the brilliancy of the emerald of the deep blues and those are the colors of this dark cloud of glory that surround him sometimes and sometimes i see that out in the cosmos i see that out in the skies of heaven and different places uh where they're gonna put on light shows they don't need fireworks they put on light shows all over heaven they have spectacular light shows in heaven and they make like a canvas of this dark cloud of glory that belongs to god and upon that they have these fantastic light shows that god speaks and they just happen well it seems like it's kind of logical if the lord wanted to put on a light show he could turn the lights down right behind it i mean he could just say okay we're going to have a live show i mean to me that's logical if you can speak this and that but you had also one he waves his hand like this and the entire area he's going to do the light showing he takes the dark glory that he keeps hidden most of the time he's hidden and wave his hand off of his hand comes these dark clouds of glory that fill an area of the sky in heaven and in that area he shoots these lights off the most spectacular colors and bursts and swirls um he does put light shows on heaven wow and then you one time uh you know a few months ago we talked about christmas town that is there one of god's favorite things yeah i believe you said and so you would have to have some dark places where the christmas lights could be seen i would think at least the lights are the lights are so brilliant that even in the sky we call sky yeah you could see those lights blazing really and oh yeah they don't just they're not stagnant almost nothing in heaven is like nothing is still it always has a life and it would like move like this like a twinkling or something yeah like twinkling but it's a bright bright twinkling on all these trees in christmas town it's uh it's where my brother works right now who recently yeah he said he loved christmas and he went home just what a couple months ago or something yeah something like that i forgot i just know i'm happy for him that he's up there and he knows saint nick very well very very cool very cool all right change of pace here's a question you'll love this your husband's a fisherman and that kind of okay mary says i see my friends and i were wondering if you could ask cat something if christians can eat pork and shellfish some people are saying because jesus was a perfect jew he didn't eat them so sh so we shouldn't either then paul had that vision of the unclean animals and god telling him to kill and eat just curious if god has given cat any revelation on that the number one thing about heaven is the food is not living and killed and then you eat it all the food you eat in heaven is made out of light but it tastes like it feels like it and smells like it no life is taken in heaven that wouldn't even be possible okay nothing dies in heaven um there are fish made out of light and then there are real fish if you go fishing without understanding that and you try to catch an actual fish they'll probably pull you in they'll laugh at you as you're pulling them in you'll have the the best battle of your life trying to catch one of those big sailfish this is actually a real sailfish there are other areas where all these are real not they're not like living living but they're made out of light and people do eat those but if you sat if you went to a restaurant in heaven which you're all over heaven and you ordered steak what you got would not be from some cow being killed some cattle being killed i'll get that correct the cows don't get killed they get milk they know but nothing that you eat in heaven was a life god doesn't bring death into heaven the most amazing food of course i'm not the least interested in the seafood i have seen people eating salmon and stuff like that in heaven but it didn't come off of a real fish it's all made out of light you can actually cook with this substance that looks like the real fish in heaven so nobody cares okay but but nothing's gonna die to feed you in heaven and now i i'm just gonna i can't know for absolutely sure but i think she's also asking about is it okay to eat shellfish now is it okay to eat pork on the earth now i have news for you about the bible it said don't tell anyone they can't eat anything it's true and by the way if you're a jew and that's how you live your life i'm happy for you it's clearly said in the gentiles and the jews were like one people because you know why we all believe in god himself i understand there comes a point in the life of the jew where they will receive jesus christ as a savior but right now on this earth and god said also in the bible don't make fun of people that think it's not right to eat something don't make fun of people who said it's okay to eat something it gives them a choice you have a choice okay i love bacon i do too said you can't eat bacon uh you cannot eat bacon i asked god to bless the pig that gave his life that i could eat the beat to eat the bacon um i'm just being nice to everything right yeah it says in the bible literally that it's okay to eat the things that he told the jews to remain before christ died uh people before he died it was all they tried themselves physically to remain as clean as they possibly could but everything changed when jesus died on the cross well not only that but it's like god used that as an object lesson no matter how clean they ate no matter how sinless things they didn't commit yeah they were still lost lost lost lost it did them no good as it checked it did no good in checking um the things of the spirit and jesus jesus said meat goes in you and goes back out of you it doesn't do anything regarding your spirit right so yes so one man can eat only vegetables another man can eat anything you want let everyone be convinced in her own mind that's an amazingly free united states of america kind of a thinking you know freedom freedom is a big thing but the most free you'll ever be is when you have jesus christ in your life and you have received him as your savior because it does more than give you hell insurance and that's how the holy spirit the drama king holy spirit has me say it salvation gives you more than hell insurance which means you're not going there it empowers you to be like christ not christ but like him to operate and do great works and greater works do signs and wonders do the spectacular uh for god in this earth it opens up realms never opened up to you before because we have authority and because of the blood of christ and us receiving him we're joint heirs with christ and you don't get that if you're not a believer okay you can't chase a demon off if you're if you're a sinner and you're sinning and one shows up you're not going to be able to chase that thing off okay you have to have the authority christ gave us it says we have the power to cast out devils and demons that's for the those who believe in jesus christ so there's so many things that are wonderful maybe one day we'll just do a q a on just what you get when you're a christian because your mind will probably go wow okay i just want to encourage you to consider receiving christ especially in these days you don't want to miss eternity with him because this this is a vapor this is a shadow of what we're going to have and the next 100 years on this earth will be so powerful and so amazing with the light blinding so much of the darkness in this world until the end gets closer and closer and then things at that time will change i'm sure nobody will be here that is alive right now unless god needs you there so you need to look forward to doing something for christ making your life count always love people even if they're not nice to you you're piercing the soul of the enemy every time you're kind when you get to choose to be kind or not when you choose kindness you give hell a really bad day that's so good you said a minute ago and when you were just talking you talked about and some people may have missed it if they weren't listening closely you called the holy spirit the drama king you said that before that they call him the drama king yesterday by coincidence that there's any coincidence i decided that the holy spirit who i have an entire lair within me of the holy spirit you said you taught us and i said you know drama king i want to see drama today i've never asked you for drama i want i don't want bad drama i just said i want drama show me some drama and i really prayed into that i mean i really was serious i said i really want to see good drama and people that saw that show with donna rigney uh was it yesterday and and and she was going on about how the lord took her to heaven and the father was sitting on the swing and jesus was there and this big old gorilla was pushing them in the swing and it was hilarious and i just kind of lost it to him now that's kind of dramatic good like crazy who would think to have a gorilla the most funny-looking funny you know almost human creature that god made push you in the swing while you're visible how would we see that happening in heaven a lot of what's happening you know i want to just encourage people to experiment with that ask the holy spirit for good drama i don't know what else do you have to say about that have you ever asked for drama i don't have to ask for drama i love drama all the time on both sides i see the darkness trying to cause drama but they're not very good at it they're just not really good at it okay when they fell i'm talking about the demonic army when they were all kicked out of heaven i know i'm probably gonna hear people say well there's disembodied spirits and there's demons whatever the evil wicked spirits uh lost something in their brain it doesn't compute like it did when they were at one time glorious beings in heaven or or even connected to god at one point when they were good their creativity was amazing but they're not really good right now just look at the bee person and that's probably some evidence for you right there but uh they don't plan things well they don't cover their traps well yeah like god who imparts creativity and that kind of things you know you have supernatural understanding you have sound wisdom when you're a believer so the light is always going to be greater not just in the spirit realm but even shining in this physical realm the feats and the things that happen through believers are going to be very spectacular awesome and this is everyone ask for drama from god say i want some great good drama that's what i want i want that just astounds me you know you could ask for that i want some sounding drama yeah i mean you know what what have you got to lose you know the holy spirit is like it's like i can almost hear him say finally someone's asking me for some great drama i love this stuff you know he would totally say finally obviously finally okay so the the teaching and understanding that you've given as far as the holy spirit puts an entire layer of himself in you yeah once i understood that i'm thinking you know i don't have to ask for the holy spirit to come down he's all of him is here all of him he's already in there so it's an entirely different prayer decree when you know he lives in you so okay this person wants to know about famous sins when we go to heaven there are people that committed famous sins david bathsheba moses all the famous sins and they're trying to figure out do we process do we get to talk to them about their life whereas since all the former things are done away we don't really have because that sounds like a bit of a testimony someone could give a testimony in heaven so what about those who who have committed famous sins that the bible is full of the words never going to pass away so will we know and talk about those things that was a good question actually that was something that god did share with me he said he remembers your sins no more and there will come a time in your life when it says the former things will be remembered no more remember when that says that at the end of the bible it actually says that right there'll be things that are just taken totally from our memory bank they don't need to be there for any reason people have some of the biggest meetings they have in heaven are testimony meetings and people want to know um what were you thinking when this happened you know uh it it's the only thing they can't really share is how devastating that was to him there's no devastation there's no shame in heaven there's no regrets in heaven so when they give a testimony it would be something that would be like heartbreaking for them to share and also they give more of the glory and the testimony a testimony is a story of god's forgiveness of god's power of his ability to still take you places and do things with you once you've repented uh there's also things they went through besides the famous sins are the famous encounters they had like what about the ark i would think a lot of people would want to talk to noah what was it like being on the ark for all those days and and how did you have food and how did you feel yourself and did you ever feel threatened that would be a powerful powerful thing to ask like noah asked that question or i think moses standing in the red sea he gets that question asked all the time really this is this is going to be moses's answer and heaven say higher that feel you're sitting at the red sea and here comes the army after you there's a sea what are you going to do you're going to drown you're going to be killed with army and moses would say there was only one choice there was always only one choice i had to obey god and there was no way he was not going to cross that red sea there was no way that he was he had no other choice but what god said and what was given him to do and that's that's already the answer he gives for that he had no fear of the army coming he had seen god face to face okay he heard him face to face he knew what he wanted he knew what he had to do and no matter what that meant to him physically or personally he had already decided i'm doing what god wants so testimony times they have them all over heaven people want to hear from certain people sometimes you get a one-on-one conversation like maybe with elijah the prophet's available yeah yeah that would be interesting knowing elijah a little bit i think elijah probably would say i enjoy watching them frying to nothing [Laughter] because elijah was so out there and so bold and so fed up with the evil he let god have his total way that never would have happened i actually have stood on monk carmel i still see the fire of god that fell in the spirit it's like the top of the el mountain is on fire uh the spiritual fire that came when elijah as in all his obedience of the crazy stuff about pouring the water on fire i'm sure the inside he was so rejoicing when they fried you a crisp now i'm not saying we should all feel that way when people die but let me tell you he had put up with so much from all them and they were bragging the other time putting in his faces god was weakest god couldn't do anything so when god the father sent the fire down and burned them all up i'm sure it was a happy day for a lot of uh well it's saying that the the the the sikh covering the the wicked uh pharaoh's army or this you know there had to be some rejoicing over there okay um let's see i'm looking at my time here uh okay i'm gonna combine a couple questions here about angels so a third of the angels fell did the question is did god then replace us he could have said let there be a new replacement they could have had it and then when angels were created did they need to learn or be trained or did they always know what they were created for and how to do their job angels were created in tribes they were the first tribes we we weren't tribes the jewish tribes and native american tribes were not the first tribes ever made the angels were created in tribes and each tribe was created for a specific purpose and that's what they did like the couriers aren't going to be worship angels okay the scribes aren't going to be courier angels whatever he made those crimes for was what every one of them did let's say there were a million in each one of these tribes and so he would have like a million scribe angels i mean i'm sure there's a lot more than that i'm just giving an example uh so what you were made when he made an angel he spoke and christ the word made the tribes himself they were made a design to specific appearance uh specific gifts within them or skills within them the army doesn't try to be ascribed the scribes are never going to try to be a member of the army and actually when scribes are sent to the earth to deliver messages or couriers or messengers part of the army comes with them down to earth with them to deliver that because they're not warring they're not warring angels and so nobody takes someone else's place in the angelic tribes uh and the host is a whole separate group by themselves um so that's how that operates and so they uh the ones that fell the one third we're talking about the worship angels luther was over the worship angels he wasn't over the army he wasn't over any of gabriel's okay and gabriel didn't lose any of his any of his they didn't they kept their own that god put them over and i remember standing on a platform somewhere in tampa florida and i was talking again about lucifer's fall and what went on would that look like so i was actually taking i was taken back in time and was in heaven watching him deceiving that wow and um and let me tell you he's a good deceiver he's been doing this forever and ever he's been doing this a long time that's why still deception is very powerful uh he has the ability he does it that's what he did in heaven and so he tried to deceive every angel they laughed at him when he came to michael's headquarters trying to bring that message i'm taking over i'm more powerful i know more i'll give you lands properties i'll give you powers to be like god is i mean he did every lie in the book and he's still using those lies he used it with the left i'm just going to add that just so you know that and so they didn't believe him none of them believed in him but he got his own and that's how god said it on the platform he whispered in my ear when i said i'm not sure what one third he got and at that moment uh he whispered in my ear and he said he got his own he got the one-third of the worship angels he said and you all replaced them oh interesting well this is still god speaking to me on the platform that's why it's so important to worship we replace those worship angels we take their place our words create a um an aroma literally that you can see and smell in the throne room we fill the bowls before the altar of god with all of our worship it does so many things and the worship angels used to do that when they did worship in the throne room the seraphim who aren't actually part of the worship angels they do worship him but they live in the glory cloud over the throne and their song is one of the most i guess amazing captivating songs they'll come down out of the glory cloud and they're on fire with blue fire their hair looks like blue fire and the song they sing in the throne was amazing but that one third of the angels that were were made and created in tribes to worship were all kept out with lucifer down to earth and we take their place and that's why satan hates us to worship he doesn't want us to worship he still wants all the worship yeah now did that did any of any of god's created angels or created beings um and create i guess because you've got the hosts are different species so to speak but do any of these angelic species or whatever do they need to be trained did they go to did they get created and then someone started to train them or did they were they burst on the scene having all their skills ready to go the only thing they were trained in uh because they have the skills i think i said that they're created each tribe whether messenger scribes the host a host already are created with weapons some are a weapon themselves some have weapons coming out they know how to use those weapons but they did maneuvers before there was a reason for the army i'll just choose the army to demonstrate they went on maneuvers to learn how to work together uh on their own they could have fought anything anywhere when there wasn't even an enemy they they didn't they weren't able to do that so they did maneuvers probably for centuries learning how to be precise on how they wore doing it together in groups learning to take orders from michael and then the captains under michael and then the leaders under michael they had to learn how to be organized they had to learn how to work in different groups and be strategic so that kind of training the army had not necessarily how to be the like a weapon thing and so also i do know that and michael i mean yeah michael's grouped the army but gabriel's group they already had them in them it was designed when he made them you are ascribed and knew everything about being ascribed how to do that when to do it messengers couriers helpers is there's a whole list that gabriel has they had to learn to work together so the most training was doing this stuff together and the way god does describe angels or the courier angels or whatever it is that are sent from from gabriel they are sent with opposite personalities now the one thing that was different in the tribes these tribes as far as their skills and their their ability to to perform was perfect it was learning to do in a group the other thing they had to learn was to get along with somebody who had a different personality really we don't think of them okay yes they're not robots you're saying so in other words they had to be trained when you want to do this and he wants to do that well some some angels are very serious they're very serious and some are comedians some are very happy their personalities are different their skill set may be the same okay because whatever god made them scribes or messengers or couriers that skill is very much alive in them and can operate but working with other ones who have the same skill but a different personality made it challenging it sharpened those angels like we get sharpened see they're not married in heaven so they don't have to get married to be sharpened that's what happens you're in a lifetime of being sharpened sharpened and god does that many times in marriage is by you having different personalities different likes or dislikes my husband is a totally different personality than me and we sharpen each other a whole lot god said i had to find a way to do that with the angel so i sent them a different personality that here's a this one's all about holiness and fire and brimstone and let's just get him and get done with it and here's this comedian over here angel making jokes the whole time and this one has got to learn to work with this one without i could just see the comedian angel trying to get the serious one to laugh come on you know i would love to do a sitcom one day like for television it would probably be called the the scribe or something like that it would be about angels from gabriel being sent on assignment to the earth it would be hilarious i love it talking about drama talk about drama okay so here's a question along those lines um this is a four-year-old while the mom's asking for the four-year-old can you please ask kat if the host of heaven looked like transformers my my four-year-old son loves transformers so i think he's wanting to know if any of the hosts that she said they can be fierce looking they're in all kinds of different sizes and shapes i guess he's wanting to know if anyone looks like transformers i was actually caught up to michael's headquarters one time to be shown the transforming angels the transforming host okay i gotta remember it always called the army is the host and they even say i am of the host they clearly want you know i am a warrior angel i am not a scribe even though the way they look is so totally different and i was taken to this hill in michael's headquarters i was shown the barracks that were like 200 300 sometimes a thousand feet high they actually have barracks that this is the place that belongs to everybody has their space even the angels have a space it's their own and then they would call them they were going to go to battle but they were going to do some training first for the next mission i got to watch it so these angels were like anywhere from 50 to 100 feet high they all came up to this hill and michael gave a command i couldn't understand the language he was speaking but when he spoke that language every one of them shape-shifted transformed would be another thing they transformed into a missile wow really before they had bodies they were walking in they were they look like they're made out of everything you can't say flesh i don't even caught flash uh they're made out of something that looks like some form of metal that moves it's alive or some kind of solid light or all kinds of things that the hosts are made out of but when he shouted this one command every one of them no matter what they look like before became a missile with the fire of god coming out of the bottom of it and when he shouted again they all left like a missile and when i got to follow them it i'm sorry if this bothers your head get over it it's god okay god everything does everything i followed them into the second heaven where they were going to do their battle i didn't get to see the war but when they landed in this place you have to understand spiritual places with spiritual beings would be solid like our ground would be when they appeared somewhere in the in the in the second heaven where they were going to have a at this epic battle he shouted again they didn't turn back into their south they turned into a living weapon really okay then as weapons they left for the battle i didn't get to see the battle um and i did get to see when the battle was over he took me back and here they come back to this place still as a weapon and then you don't even know what a weapon is unless god designs it they always shred and trash the sp the army of darkness that they can't get healed by the way they have parts missing and they try to put parts or make parts for them whatever um but i can just say here come the army back from the successful uh thing that they battle they did in the spirit realm a lot of people were praying somewhere for this battle have been praying for days so that empowers them and it gets them excited because they can hear our prayers on the earth michael's headquarters can hear the prayers that were praying for god to come and deal with the darkness and so over here are all these weapons standing again michael shouts they turn into the missiles they take off they go back up through the spirit realm to heaven itself to michael's headquarters on the same hill that they started on and then when they land as their missiles he shouts again and there they are themselves again wow so they are transformers some at least some of them are wow yes they are well and then one of the questions that was on this one page over whatever they wanted that was one of the questions is when they when the hosts fight the enemy you and i know they don't kill they can't kill them they're eternal beings so they want to know so the question was what happened to them you kind of just said something they they lost some parts or they got you know so what kind of damage or do they do they banish any of them to hell do they banish any of them in the head do they or is it always just get out of here for another day what i don't think it's ever get out of here i saw myself once god taught me how to command part of the army i don't come in the whole army i was given something to command over we are commanders because christ was a commander of the host that's why we get to do that but if you're sinning by the way i always add this if you sin you're not commanding anybody you're sending you have no power as a christian you don't have power uh you may still be safe but with some unrighteousness but you better get that straightened out the angels of the army will not listen to you if you're living a life of sin even if you believe they're just they don't have to but i can tell you this that when i begin to do this i have pictures i may send some of the pictures to me i would that would be putting them in the mail but my staff i'm sure would email them to you steve and put them up i literally have photographs that when i began to command them in 2017 they literally after a battle would bring them by in chains by over my home here's the royal guard that look like lions there's this long chain and on this chains are all of the enemy that they captured after the battle and some of them looked like their eyes were not just black they were like swollen uh some had little parts missing on them i had another one that came by one time that was a host he looked like what you would call um uh you know i guess i don't know uh supernatural wild looking yeti he wasn't the yeti but i don't know how else to explain he was a creature and he had this massive staff and on this staff were more of the enemy that was captured and they all left to take him up to heaven i think some of them are sentenced there is a courtroom in heaven you've been hearing about it for years it is real there's one inside heaven itself a quorum in heaven there's one out in the cosmos outside of heaven itself and i don't know where they were taken but they were sentenced and some sentencing is to be put in a pit or to put to be put in a dry place i don't know what it is they hate the dry places they'd rather have like swamps and gang green and uh i know in the second heaven a lot of that looks like that they're swampy yucky i've been to the second heaven where satan has built his mock kingdom there's just too much to tell but i can tell you this our the army of heaven is very strategic when you're praying for something don't stop praying you can make a declaration like i would say for instance i take power over all the power of the enemy please start with that if you're going to send the army somewhere i take power over all the power of the enemy that's bringing in wickedness and evil across the southern border they're coming in to do drugs or coming into human trafficking i command the host of heaven the army of heaven one million of you go now to the southern border you will expose every person as they come across they actually will tell on themselves a great fear will fall on them and they will go back across they won't be allowed to enter into the border of the united states of america and i will tell the host go host make toast to the spiritual enemy put on a stronghold of satan empowering those people to be evil shred platforms the demonic who've been ruling over them for years shred those platforms so they can't hear the enemy i'm speaking to the spiritual enemy trying to empower the physical enemy and that's how we need to deal with it first i do know that our physical army has their place and the first responders have their place but we as believers better be taking authority over the darkness first and that army will go in a split second they look like beams of light shooting out there all the way to the southern border and they deal with the demonic it takes minutes to deal with the demonic but because there's more and more coming sometimes i'll send them on the sweep and almost say for the next 30 days you will go 24 hours a day and you will do this assignment which is why it's important to understand again when we start teaching on spirit force it's guess what you're the spiritual force filled with the holy spirit with jesus in you you are deadly against the enemy's plans and then the day we're living in is the best opportunity you'll ever have to come against the darkness yourself being a born-again believer and so i have seen the results of sometimes i'll just see a whole group of the demonic coming by not over my house but i've seen them passing by outside our uh our whole development and they're clinging on each other filled with terror they're hanging on to each other because they don't care about each other no one's trying to help the others uh the army of god is so caring about the other ones when they're done in the battle they get weary they have to go back to get refreshment but um if there's minor wounds god heals those ones immediately satan doesn't have the ability to do that his army is so put together poorly and they're they're filled with fear right now anyway so i have seen the battles i've seen some of the battles i've seen the results of the battles when people are praying and declaring on behalf standing in the gap for righteousness and justice and freedom you're doing damage you're doing damage you can't see but the more that spiritual force that evil gets weakened and weakened the more fear and confusion will fall upon the natural mind of those who are promoting it on the earth that's so good so so yeah wow that's really good well kat that's our time boy that's really good i mean we it's like i like getting a little bit of the heavenly horse almost every time because there's so much to it it's so simple on one hand and yet there's so many facets so it's amazing there's a lot of facets i would tell you this though they're getting their celebration on already they're celebrating in heaven because of the liberty and freedom that is coming regardless of what any human on the earth says to you trust god believe what god has said he never changed what he said justice is coming everything is going to be exposed he's going to clear the platform of wickedness and evil and in injustice and immorality i'm telling he's going to clear it and he's going to put in place who he needs here now because we're setting up for the next 100 years to be great for god with with the glory of god being released in the earth literally in shock waves the light of god being seen on people themselves your homes will be lit up for the glory of god the inventions and creations he on is saving until this mess and this wrong is righted and then so much will accelerate rapidly into a bringing america back beyond what it was
