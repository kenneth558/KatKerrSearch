05:08

05:10
excited to have Kat Kerr how you
05:12
doing good to see you great about it's
05:14
been a few went since I've been together
05:16
yes yeah it's about time
05:18
Kat has had been taken to having many
05:21
many times over the course ago at 20
05:23
years or more
05:24
20 years yes almost every day mazie is
05:27
it every day almost every day almost
05:29
every day but he just catches me up so
05:32
usually he doesn't give any animals for
05:34
anything he just takes me up if he wants
05:36
to show me something or say something
05:38
important for the body of Christ to know
05:41
or if the world's interested speak let
05:44
me just jump to bed last year for a
05:45
minute and then we'll jump into 2018 you
05:48
were one of only three or four people
05:49
that I could just put my finger on say
05:51
these people do long ahead of time
05:54
exactly who would the elected president
05:56
tell me a couple just a couple of things
05:59
about what God had told you months and
06:00
months ahead of time for Trump even
06:03
before Trump ran even before that
06:05
election was planned got him and telling
06:08
me that I'm going to make America great
06:12
er than ever it's about to step into his
06:14
destiny but I can't start this until I
06:17
shift the government and there will be a
06:20
president in the White House one day
06:22
they will extend their hand to the
06:24
believers so I knew that was coming and
06:26
when he told me that he caught me up to
06:29
heaven literally months and months and
06:31
months before he said I've chosen Trump
06:33
and people won't like it and they won't
06:36
understand it but that doesn't matter
06:38
right now because I'm going to change
06:40
America and I need him he's an
06:43
all-american boy that is all for America
06:45
and he is smart he can't be bought he
06:48
can't be moved and he cannot be
06:50
controlled and he said he will know me
06:52
and he will hear my voice and he said
06:54
from the time he sits in the White House
06:56
a miracle we might have a boring day I
06:58
remember you saying that and I think
07:01
about that Oliver Lilia what before I
07:03
jump in this then we asked this thing
07:04
about Trump okay I've had people good
07:06
godly believers and they're all upset
07:08
and the way I would be flying is a very
07:10
kind of upset because he's not acting
07:13
like pastor in chief and I said to these
07:15
Francis but he we didn't elect the
07:17
pastor and she arrived at a commander
07:19
chief so from God's viewpoint does he
07:21
ever talk with you about that a lot he
07:23
talks to me about many things about Tom
07:26
number one the people he's positioning
07:28
now on the earth to be leaders yeah it's
07:31
because of their generational line he's
07:34
part of them an amazing generational
07:35
line that paid a price with their life
07:38
for the gospel Trump I'm talking about
07:39
trying on his family lineage has got
07:42
powerful believers men and women of God
07:44
even passional in his line and in this
07:47
time on the earth much fruit will take
07:49
place many things will happen that have
07:52
never happened before and he is
07:53
positioning people to be leaders in the
07:55
government in business and in to church
07:58
and one of the things if all the said
08:00
was I've chosen him but the people need
08:01
to know you don't need a pastor in the
08:03
White House right now you don't need a
08:05
pastor you don't need the five hold
08:07
ministry in the White House we need a
08:08
businessman who sharp who knows how to
08:10
make money who's not afraid of people
08:12
who can deal with international matters
08:14
this is from the highest in the land who
08:17
made all of us and he knows what's best
08:19
for our country
08:20
that's amazing of ana technics area for
08:24
those that may have not seen some of the
08:25
previous things that we've talked about
08:27
Kat I mean I got to know Kat started
08:29
three or four to three years ago three
08:31
or four years ago and we went on a
08:33
cruise I actually I went on a Kevin Lee
08:35
cruises cruise with Kat was the featured
08:38
speaker and I was fine you actually came
08:40
to our room to visit with my wife I was
08:42
exciting the poor sister was looking for
08:44
you all over the ship we didn't know
08:45
what time that was
08:45
I'm so exciting to meet you and talk
08:47
with you about your life and the things
08:50
that Lodge Alyssa's done too so always
08:51
just as captivated we were totally
08:53
unaware at the time yes
08:54
let's jump to 2018 at the time of this
08:58
recording we're a few days into its 11th
09:00
of January we won't always date these
09:02
recording but this one is important
09:04
because I'm gonna say some things about
09:05
what's going to happen so it's important
09:07
for the people know this is January 11
09:09
2018 that's awesome because he actually
09:11
told me from now on when I speak I will
09:13
say the date so let's jump to 2018 when
09:15
the guys start talking to you about this
09:17
year last year well some of the things
09:21
like I said he's been saying things to
09:22
me probably over the last 40 50 years
09:25
that far back hello this time we're in
09:28
right now well about things that would
09:30
happen on the earth that the manifested
09:32
sons and daughters the greater works the
09:34
which we are so are going to be blasted
09:37
when we see what God's going to do with
09:39
us the things Christ's position force
09:41
ruling and reigning with Christ what
09:43
does all this mean then he would show me
09:45
things in the word so I've been prepared
09:47
literally literally that long by him but
09:49
steps into the season right before the
09:52
elections he really started focusing he
09:54
said I'm gonna make you very political
09:56
because I'm going to throw you out there
09:59
in this election you won't be able to go
10:00
back so I'm you were going to tell them
10:02
Trump's going to win and I need him
10:04
there and this is what will happen this
10:06
will happen people try the lines you
10:08
know cheat and lie about him and I can
10:10
tell all those people if they ever hear
10:12
this you better step back because this
10:14
is God's son he chose who he wanted he's
10:17
not gonna he's not forgotten him he's
10:18
not going to let up on what he's doing
10:20
with him and no one will win in the next
10:22
election they won't win that either he
10:24
will that's all just give you that for
10:26
free
10:26
so you're saying trips back for a second
10:28
I'm gonna be here for eight years pence
10:30
for eight years and then the one pen
10:32
sticks I'm just gonna throw it up there
10:33
cuz the father is saying this for 24
10:35
years we will have God in that White
10:37
House what see this is a generational
10:40
thing he's doing this is not just
10:41
something for a few weeks again once it
10:43
even a couple years that he's setting up
10:44
for when you told me the Trump is going
10:47
to win I was I was intrigued not upset
10:50
cuz I kind of liked the guy from the
10:52
very beginning but then these horrible
10:53
things would be said and then he would
10:55
step in the mud and say things and then
10:57
I would write back to cabinet there are
10:58
you still saying it was just now I
11:00
learned I don't go back to Kat and say
11:02
are you still saying because of course
11:05
now that I know her of course she say
11:07
poor my God positions a time when the
11:10
fullness of time has come yeah this is
11:13
God's time to do something he's
11:14
strategic that's why we're being
11:16
strategic right now that's why he's
11:17
giving times and stuff
11:19
he's very strategic right now because
11:20
he's setting up literally for us to have
11:22
the wealth of the wicked to push back
11:24
darkness to find out really who we are
11:27
be a joint heir with Christ and so he's
11:31
not and this is what he said Trump is
11:32
raw he had a good work corner he said
11:35
he's really wrong but I will temper him
11:36
pence will temper him and he will be a
11:39
great leader for this country but I'm
11:41
saying all that because we had to have
11:43
that that was the foundation for this
11:45
time you did because it was all a
11:47
foundation to prepare for what we will
11:49
be it allowed to do in this country and
11:51
I can tell you 2018 he's calling me
11:54
season of destiny and that is a powerful
11:57
word to say that that means many people
11:59
many companies many churches ministries
12:03
will be finally stepping into the true
12:06
destiny opportunity now it's up in
12:08
preparation we ask you about the wealthy
12:10
because I know it's been like has
12:11
actually have a date of like 23 years of
12:14
when I first started hearing that
12:16
prophecies about the wealth of wicked
12:18
and I thought was gonna happen that year
12:19
if I got the right date it was that was
12:21
1994 when I started hearing that but
12:24
then it has happened to a degree over
12:26
these 23 years but you're seeing this is
12:28
different this is different how destiny
12:31
and and I've people supposed to do
12:33
something to cooperate with that I would
12:36
tell people the first thing you need to
12:37
do he even gave me a little tweaking
12:39
list which I will share in the meeting
12:40
because when he has me share something
12:42
is to train people right maybe train for
12:45
what God needs and how you do this
12:46
because this is this this is a very
12:48
focused time be focused in your
12:50
priorities make sure you can go back as
12:53
much as possible have restorations with
12:55
people who who were not happy with you
12:57
no matter whose fault it was
12:58
it's going to be your job to make that
13:00
restoration hear them that doesn't mean
13:02
you want them to repent to you that
13:03
means you're going to go to them and say
13:04
you're sorry that they were upset about
13:06
something but you're praying for them
13:08
you care about them if you're going to
13:09
be able to doing something big for God
13:11
then you have to make sure that what's
13:13
behind you
13:14
is not left you can't hide things don't
13:17
have hidden ones and you get rid of all
13:19
the wounds because he's giving you
13:21
seeing brand-new to do in this time and
13:23
our brand new or new ways to do it that
13:26
will be powerfully seen will be very
13:28
visible the things he'll do with us now
13:30
won't be behind doors anymore you'll be
13:33
out there for the world to see the
13:34
internet will go viral with many of
13:36
these things that will happen and there
13:38
will be many extremely wealthy people
13:40
that will get born again that will want
13:41
to put their money into the kingdom like
13:43
immediately I'm talking about
13:44
celebrities Oh
13:45
the third thing on the list he is taking
13:48
Hollywood nice I'm saying everything
13:51
you've seen before now which is
13:52
something a lot of things have been
13:53
happening behind the scenes a lot of
13:54
main actors actresses of getting born
13:57
again but what will be coming out of
13:59
Hollywood at the end of two years but
14:02
it's going to start this year will be
14:04
powerful does it mean it'd all be Bible
14:05
stories but he's going to change the
14:07
content in a lot of these movies and the
14:10
ones you don't want to do it won't
14:11
remain yeah I mean that's cleaning up
14:14
and we didn't know how messy was we kind
14:16
of had some ideas yes I you know what
14:19
the time left how much time we have left
14:20
guys give me an idea okay so give you
14:22
more to share more on that list did you
14:24
have some other things on that list that
14:25
there's those three main things that
14:27
people will begin to see immediately in
14:30
the news and will be heard will be about
14:32
Israel England or Hollywood and we need
14:35
all that he needs those things to happen
14:38
and if you wouldn't be doing it if it
14:40
wasn't important that's what we have to
14:41
look at there's other countries involved
14:43
and I will mention that in the meetings
14:46
but he is focusing on different
14:48
countries right now selected countries
14:50
and especially for us destiny that means
14:53
if you're a little grandma somewhere and
14:56
he said that he would do something with
14:58
you and it's been 40 50 years and it
14:59
hasn't happened this is the time with
15:02
that soon not too late at the best days
15:04
or are you late the best days are way
15:06
ahead of an odd wait now and in the
15:08
future not talk to you at all about the
15:10
North Korea situation oh yes great
15:12
family right that that was going to be
15:14
something I will talk more detail about
15:15
it he said North and South Korea will
15:17
become one this year or just going to
15:20
begin this year when you step into
15:23
destiny you're stepping in a new door
15:25
there's much that will will take place
15:27
but he leads us up into our life we step
15:30
on a threshold of time and everything
15:32
behind use them preparation
15:34
a transition is a good word for that
15:36
we're at a time of positioning right now
15:38
and you will step through that door it
15:40
will be like you're dreaming because
15:42
when you step through that door it's so
15:45
easy it's almost like you're just you're
15:47
moving and you can't believe that you're
15:48
doing this because this is when it's
15:50
God's time for it to happen and when you
15:52
step something to you as you know I mean
15:55
I would say things years and years ago
15:56
he said it doesn't matter it will happen
15:58
yeah what happened because God has said
16:00
it will happen so the Korean thing got
16:01
back to Vallon North and South are going
16:04
to be reunited is it good I can't even
16:06
say it's gonna be the leaders of there
16:08
right now yeah I mean but what you have
16:09
one or two that may not even be on the
16:11
earth yet is that what you're saying is
16:14
it what your you'll be left with this
16:15
I'm saying what maybe move okay I see
16:18
what you say this typically the North
16:20
Korea yeah I hear you okay and then so
16:23
people that let's let's do this for the
16:25
benefit of those viewers they're looking
16:27
at the news you're afraid of the nuclear
16:29
thing and some people get afraid the
16:30
shrimp's gonna push a button or
16:31
something least not gonna push the
16:32
button
16:33
but what out of how can people's
16:36
attitudes dump fear for lack of a better
16:39
term how do we get rid of the fear that
16:40
everything you need to do is loose what
16:43
you have there right now because fear is
16:45
almost like a disease if you have some
16:47
in you and you never get rid of it the
16:49
devil's always going to bring it back
16:50
he'll make it greater he'll make sure
16:52
you hear things more things that make
16:54
you more fearful fear doesn't belong to
16:56
God and if you're a believer it should
16:58
never be in you it's one of the enemy's
17:00
weapons it's his greatest thing is one
17:02
of his fear when it's the substitute so
17:04
get rid of all that fear and when you
17:06
get up in the morning recognize who you
17:08
serve father I love you I thank you to
17:11
stay for your son I declared that I will
17:13
be powerful in you they don't have sound
17:15
wisdom with supernatural discernment I
17:17
won't receive any fear from the enemy
17:19
this day because I'm on your path now
17:21
and you hold me in your hand so fear is
17:24
a great weapon that's what enemy and
17:26
this is what you do by the news maybe
17:28
not watch so much yeah I was talking to
17:31
me
17:31
I literally if I watch the news I loose
17:33
it all out of my soul because I'm gonna
17:35
go by what God says not like your you're
17:37
not ignorant of what's going on you're
17:40
innocent of it okay you didn't cause it
17:42
to happen God has great plans America's
17:44
not going to be blown up and
17:46
Tom's not leaving the White House and he
17:48
will not do something that God literally
17:49
does not want and if you start to see
17:51
something God will correct him oh we got
17:53
just a few minutes left so don't worry
17:55
about anything else is going on around
17:57
you okay this country here is going to
17:59
be safer stronger a better off in every
18:03
way and so I'm letting you know you
18:05
either have to ignore some of it pray
18:07
for the people saying it but even some
18:09
of the media may lose their network or
18:11
their speech that they're sitting in
18:14
that's that's amazing by the way I
18:16
understood this out well the tape is
18:18
rolling and I'm gonna risk something 25
18:21
26 years ago a young prophetess she's
18:24
still around but she's not known she's a
18:26
personal friend but she's not a public
18:27
and we were in our living room when she
18:29
began to prime say this was in the time
18:31
there were still Fox News back there
18:32
this tweet this is like way back and the
18:35
most prosperous network on that I am the
18:37
television was CNN everywhere why she
18:40
didn't she she's prophesying in our
18:42
living room just to my wife but she goes
18:44
that's just since CNN's coming down and
18:46
I thought seeing the ends coming down Oh
18:48
23 25 days or something like 26 years
18:51
ago and I think God is giving this
18:53
specific revelation now we don't we
18:55
don't pray for the demise of networks
18:58
but we listen to what's being prophecy
19:00
right it's the difference between
19:01
hearing the word and it's what they're
19:03
being used for if your whole agenda has
19:05
changed now the enemy is in that agenda
19:08
then it will be in confusion in fear
19:11
like it's doing and a lot of the stuff
19:13
is saying is actually made of outright
19:15
lies yeah he said they're actually lying
19:17
and deceiving and if he will not let
19:19
them remain in that place because this
19:22
is his time on earth for us to be great
19:24
and to know him that's wonderful I'm
19:26
going to ask you one more question and
19:27
then we're out of time but I want to ask
19:29
you about I've heard words about they
19:31
were coming into time of a renaissance
19:33
like the like there was where inventions
19:36
and different things though the main
19:39
thing is inventions I suppose different
19:41
ways of thinking but let's not talk to
19:43
you about inventions that are coming up
19:44
a lot that's part of the destiny the
19:48
whole destiny thing it can be for things
19:50
not just people not even just believers
19:53
giving for the secular world it could be
19:54
for many things but this this season
19:57
when turning to there'll be freedom and
19:59

21:40
out very good thank you so much I
21:42
appreciate I've read the books that
21:43
they're amazing huh when I first read
21:45
those it gave me like my wife and I were
21:47
just sitting there with tears streaming
21:48
literally not no exaggeration you talked
21:52
about those babies that were either
21:54
aborted or their even miscarriages and
21:56
you talked about that and how these
21:58
babies went to heaven and we're taking
22:00
being taken care of by Jesus and the
22:02
angels and how we needed to name the
22:05
baby
22:06
babies and you get your babies when you
22:07
go to heaven they've given back to your
22:09
very baby that you carry and if you had
22:11
one aborted and you repented of that you
22:14
go to heaven you get those babies given
22:16
back to you get to raise him in heaven
22:17
they'll still have the gifts God put in
22:19
them so they really haven't missed
22:21
anything demon living the most amazing
22:23
beautiful place that's it means a lot of
22:24
healing to keep that's amazing my wife
22:26
and I we had I would say the name but we
22:28
had she had a miscarriage we were young
22:31
marrieds and it was hard we had two
22:33
children and this while we were waiting
22:35
for the third one to arrive she
22:36
miscarried and it was a very traumatic
22:39
thing so for us to read this book and
22:41
and realize that we ended up even
22:43
literally on the cruise picking a name
22:45
and because we didn't know whether it
22:46
was a boy or girl we picked the name
22:48
that worked either way yes yeah and that
22:50
was what we did so we picked that name
22:52
and now once in a while when we think
22:54
about it was the Oh Lord say say hello
22:56
to you know you know because we are
22:59
plans to give them a gift and you will

23:39
we'll see you again next time bye bye hi
23:42
welcome to prophecy decoders I just know
23:44
Isaac you will get a prophetic
23:46
perspective
23:48
I'm watching the Winter Olympics and lo
23:51
and behold headlines go all around the
23:54
earth regarding what took place at the
23:56
opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics
23:58
in South Korea the sister of Kim jong-un
24:03
shakes the hand of the president of
24:05
South Korea now that was hard to believe
24:10
unfathomable just a few days ago a few
24:14
weeks ago and definitely over the last
24:15
several decades what is happening in
24:18
Korea something unusual is taking place
24:22
as North Korea in South Korea decide
24:26
more importantly in North Korea and that
24:29
ruler tyrannical ruler decides to join
24:32
hands and show unity in the Olympics now
24:35
I know it's just a look at games there's
24:38
so much bigger things at stake like a
24:40
missile program a nuclear missile
24:42
program in North Korea and the dangers
24:45
inherent in a dictator having those
24:49
kinds of weapons but I want to talk
24:51
about something could it be that what
24:54
took place in the Winter Olympics in the
24:55
opening ceremony opening ceremony a sign
24:58
of coming attraction that's what I love
25:01
about prophecy it's a sign of coming
25:03
attractions now what's been prophesied
25:07
in advance maybe that gives us a glimpse
25:09
of the coming attractions Jeff Jensen
25:11
had this to say on April 24th 2017 there
25:15
is a common cry that echoes from that
25:18
nation that God remember would removed
25:21
the dividing line and make a unified
25:23
Korea
25:24
again it is the heart of God to bring
25:26
healing to that divided nation and to
25:28
make one unified Korea again I will
25:32
remove the dividing line in the nation
25:34
of Korea that is divided my people for
25:36
70 years and just as I brought a swift
25:38
justice to my people who are in
25:40
Babylonian captivity after 70 years they
25:42
will be released to their land to
25:44
rebuilds so many biblical references in
25:48
that prophecy about Babylonian cavity 70
25:50
years now we know what took place in
25:52
Israel's history about being captive for
25:54
70 years in Babylon but when they were
25:57
free we hear about how to joyous the
26:00
occasion was how the hearts began to
26:02
sing again and I am looking forward to
26:05
when Korea is unified again when North
26:09
and South Korea families are not ripped
26:12
apart like they were decades ago and
26:14
they remain apart where there's so many
26:16
tears shed over here of a united Korea
26:19
coming guess what I know that joy will
26:23
be all over that land I've been to Korea
26:26
I've been actually to the border of
26:27
North and South Korea I've seen the
26:30
sorrow and the heartache of families
26:32
ripped apart and I look forward to that
26:34
day and guess what God is going to come
26:38
through loud and clear Jesus in North
26:41
Korea North Korea is the number one
26:44
country for the most persecution of
26:46
Christians so can you imagine where the
26:47
dividing line is removed North to South
26:50
Korea oh one and the gospel of Christ is
26:52
going into North Korea
26:54
have billions I am rejoicing over what I
26:57
saw on the opening ceremony in the
26:59
Winter Olympics a united Korea is coming
27:02
thank you for watching

00:07
also known as the left coast and we got
00:10
Kat on the right coast also known as the
00:13
East Coast and this is Kat Kerr and we're
00:16
welcoming you now some of you will be
00:18
getting on right now as we talk and and
00:20
really want to remind those who are
00:23
watching that at any point if you missed
00:26
the first part you will be able to
00:27
replay this right away if I understand
00:30
it correctly so we won't waste a lot of
00:34
time waiting for you to come on because
00:35
you can replay it so I'm going to
00:37
encourage you to do that be sure and
00:38
also encourage you to tell your friends
00:41
and text them that the Kat Kerrs aren't
00:43
so Kat Kerr  with a pink hair how are you
00:45
Kat I'm doing great how about you I'm
00:48
doing really good how is the whatever
00:51
what has what does this pandemic or this
00:54
the claim of a pandemic however we said
00:57
how has that changed your life in the
00:59
last few months what you've been doing
01:01
not a lot of hanging out almost nothing
01:07
the enemy does or was a part of affect
01:10
me so I've actually stayed pretty busy
01:12
and I've been going in and out of here
01:14
not flying but in and out a lot so I've
01:16
not really been here in my in my in my
01:19
office I haven't had my office isn't my
01:21
home if you all don't know that actually
01:23
live in my office or my office lives in
01:25
my home however you want to look at it
01:26
that means is gonna be activity here all
01:28
the time and because we do we ship stuff
01:32
out we haven't ever really been kind of
01:34
shut down not here and so our staffs
01:37
been coming in and out and doing stuff
01:39
excuse me stuff for us but nobody I know
01:43
personally no one has had the virus and
01:47
if the new virus and that's all guys
01:49
ever said to me is never was it's not a
01:51
plague it's not a disease it passes and
01:54
that's what God is said to me from the
01:56
beginning it will pass and it's not pass
01:59
you know and so um
02:01
much quicker than what people probably
02:03
thought our plan from the people I've
02:05
talked to out in the public about things
02:06
I know people have all kinds of mindsets
02:11
or what
02:12
been listening to the wrong source
02:13
especially this isn't something that's
02:16
deadly to everybody and I know there has
02:20
been a lot of stuff going on I'm not
02:22
gonna jump to question number two right
02:24
now although I'd like to so really not
02:26
affected me not one member of my family
02:29
of 100 family members no one has gotten
02:31
it no one has gotten and no one knows
02:33
anybody who's gotten it and I think most
02:35
of the 50,000 people who follow me have
02:37
not had it either
02:40
protected a lot of people if that's what
02:42
they're declaring this what they're
02:43
believing for we will have us whether we
02:46
say and no one should tolerate it anyway
02:49
you know I've been telling people from
02:50
the beginning you tell the BIOS you're
02:51
not tolerating it evict it out of your
02:53
presence out of your city we have
02:55
authority over any sickness and just any
02:57
sickness or disease actually because
02:59
Jesus did you know it's interesting that
03:02
you said nobody you know has been sick
03:05
is this last weekend we went to see our
03:07
daughter we've been we haven't seen her
03:09
during a lot of this time you know
03:11
trying to be somewhat conservative about
03:12
it but I was talking to Jerry and I said
03:15
do we know anybody anybody at all
03:19
relative family friends and we know
03:21
personally who has gotten sick and we
03:24
just racked our brains and if we don't
03:27
know anyway that's kind of sick we don't
03:28
even know anybody we don't know anybody
03:30
you Michael got something that he
03:32
thought could be that he never was acted
03:35
but it was it's weird for it overall the
03:38
fear that is out there they're having a
03:40
hard time tracking this you know let me
03:44
just let me just well you know what I
03:46
better be careful because if I don't go
03:47
in the order of our questions I'll be
03:49
jumping all around I know what works you
03:50
I'm excited I do want to say one more
03:52
thing about that I've never called it a
03:54
pandemic that's tags get put on things
03:57
and I know that word actually means it's
04:00
worldwide that's what that word means
04:02
that does it means it's not just done in
04:04
one city or one country that's what that
04:07
word means
04:07
I'm not saying there haven't been cases
04:10
out there I'm not going to be the
04:11
ignorant about it but I do know this for
04:14
a certain 90% of the people have never
04:17
been affected by it people who are
04:19
normally healthy okay
04:21
it's for those who may have already had
04:23
something or of course but my mom's
04:25
going
04:25
90 she's had nothing okay and so I think
04:28
it's also how you think about it
04:30
yourself and if you're taking a stand
04:32
against it I'm not saying it never
04:34
existed but I do know that 10% maybe 90%
04:38
no not at all
04:40
which is a good thing really it's a good
04:42
thing but and I think the more that's
04:45
the realization of that come I think
04:47
there's somebody who's getting extremely
04:48
upset and angry right now that would be
04:50
our president it does explain that what
04:54
do you mean a lot of lies have been told
04:56
to him and those lies I'm not going into
04:59
number two right now right they lies
05:01
from certain areas and professionals I'm
05:04
not talking about people on his actual
05:06
staff I'm talking on people he reached
05:08
out to find out information have
05:10
literally lied well about the impact of
05:13
it about what these are gonna call post
05:16
about what his and he needs to only
05:19
responded because he cares he really
05:22
cares but he's about to do he's not
05:24
really happy about what the findings are
05:26
he sent things out on his own to find
05:29
out the truth he actually began to talk
05:32
to people to find out what people were
05:35
experiencing saying I'm just gonna throw
05:37
that out there for free I know it's not
05:39
necessarily but since we're talking
05:40
about that virus I just need to know let
05:43
people know the truth that I do know not
05:46
maybe not assumed about really the truth
05:49
I care when this thing has gotten going
05:52
again there's a whole lot of like we've
05:55
talked like you just said lies I'm sure
05:57
those exaggerations really people have
05:59
that I want to throw this out before I
06:01
ask this follow-up question on number
06:03
one I had to do the research the other
06:05
day about the number of deaths in the
06:08
United States in a given day yes and in
06:14
the calculator this is 2017 it's
06:16
interesting here as it was almost all
06:18
seven so I happen to I thought why 17
06:21
that's that's far away from that so
06:24
nobody can say these numbers are
06:26
connected and you took out just the
06:28
deaths in the United States where any
06:30
cars whatsoever
06:31
it's like 7770 deaths every single day
06:38
so we're basically out of 365 days the
06:43
people that are freaking out who have
06:45
passed away I mean every death is a sad
06:48
thing so I don't want to say that
06:51
incorrectly but that's like 10 days 12
06:54
days worth of normal us a desk and and
06:58
around the entire United States for the
07:01
equivalent I mean we have as a you as a
07:03
nation we are used to 7770 deaths in a
07:09
given day and many of those are from
07:11
influenza so they have noted that all
07:16
the people that have died there isn't it
07:19
interesting that the that the influenza
07:22
though the common flea deaths have
07:25
dropped dramatically that's because
07:27
they're calling everything covered 19 so
07:31
that's a number to us number one that we
07:41
wanted to talk about is what is God
07:43
saying about the United States and China
07:45
and all of this as it relates to what
07:47
we're talking about
07:49
well to be very honest with you God has
07:53
never changed anything he said to me
07:55
about what he's got planned what's about
07:57
to happen what is happening now and I
08:00
think a lot of the focus and maybe even
08:02
attention has been drawn away from some
08:04
of the things the good things that are
08:05
starting to happen that God has planned
08:07
because of that of course we know the
08:10
fake news and I don't mind calling them
08:12
that exist what they are they want to
08:15
draw attention to what they want people
08:17
to see in here which is always going to
08:19
be doom and gloom fear you know anything
08:22
that's bad in any way and so I think a
08:26
lot of the focus has been on that on
08:28
purpose well number one we all really
08:30
know why they don't want Trump reelected
08:32
so anything that can make anything look
08:34
bad but maybe he was involved in they're
08:36
trying to blame him for everything now
08:37
but that would happen to you so God has
08:41
never stopped talking about the
08:43
greatness these great days of glory the
08:47
high call of God that is the season ring
08:50
now he's still planning these things
08:53
he's still setting things up in the
08:54
background and this is a time of
08:57
acceleration and all of this stuff going
08:59
on
09:00
he still is is preparing to accelerate
09:03
us into the next level of not just him
09:06
but even in society in business in every
09:09
arena that seems to be shrinking and
09:11
disappearing he's about to accelerate
09:13
and cause explosion every one of those
09:14
areas I think we will end up with more
09:17
jobs available than it was before this
09:19
virus came and I only won't call it
09:21
nothing but a virus before it came I
09:23
think there'll be more out there and
09:25
more things out there and even while
09:28
this is going on there are actually new
09:31
jobs and new ways to be employed
09:35
increasing even in the midst of this but
09:37
that's not being told out later in the
09:40
news that's that's messily let's go on
09:44
to number two thanks for that I want to
09:48
before he asked this question there was
09:50
a time not that long ago when people who
09:54
are in ministry Christian ministries we
09:57
had to be very very careful about
09:58
referring to left and right a Republican
10:02
and Democrat and he yet can't over time
10:06
it's become very very clear that that
10:09
believers tend to be on the right
10:12
they're not all on the right meaning
10:15
left versus right and and unbelievers
10:18
tend to be on the left
10:20
that's not exclusively true but it's a
10:23
lot true so but here I am going to
10:25
openly use the term left what does God
10:29
tell you about exposure let's start with
10:33
enough we go to the right if you want to
10:34
but what does going to tell you about
10:35
exposures that are coming he actually
10:39
told me this maybe I don't know before
10:42
the whole virus thing started I already
10:44
knew this was because of what the high
10:46
call of God because of the great things
10:48
are about to happen through the body of
10:50
Christ he had you he had you have this
10:54
plan so he knew everything that would
10:56
happen he knew all of it of course we
10:59
know because he's God he knows
11:00
everything about every individual no
11:02
matter where you
11:03
the world you can't hide anything from
11:04
him and a lot of hidden groups that have
11:08
been working with the left these are
11:12
wicked even people evil people will be
11:15
exposed I mean he said from the top to
11:17
the bottom in that whole group I know
11:19
that there's some nice people on both
11:22
sides there always will be some people
11:24
who don't understand what's going on
11:26
there on the left and they think for
11:28
whatever reason they want you that
11:30
that's decide to be with but I don't
11:31
vote and I don't agree with anyone who
11:34
wants to take the lives of babies and
11:36
neither does God by the way he doesn't
11:38
still doesn't like that
11:39
and so I tell people if your base base
11:41
your decision on how you're going to
11:44
live or choose those who out there and
11:46
that means anybody whether it's the
11:48
governors whether it's mayor's whether
11:50
it's anybody not just the president you
11:52
better choose so many stands for lives
11:54
because that's who God is going to be
11:56
using to impact things in this in this
11:59
country and even in the world and so
12:02
there's a lot of things that have been
12:03
going on that they think have been
12:05
hidden so this exposures like he's
12:08
pulling back this whole not a veil but
12:10
he's pulling back this whole thing where
12:13
people have been hidden kept hidden who
12:15
are promoting and paying for a lot of
12:18
the violence especially going on or
12:20
threats of violence which has never
12:23
stopped happening there's always threats
12:25
of violence that have no ground
12:27
whatsoever they've been saying along
12:30
since this whole that they're even using
12:32
the virus now you know we kind of went
12:34
past that to promote violence it could
12:38
possibly happen they that left they
12:40
really want us to fight not everybody
12:43
but I always have to say that nobody but
12:45
there's a great majority especially
12:47
leaders in that whole group that are
12:49
hoping that we will have civil war and
12:51
that we will lose everything we have and
12:54
they were really happy that we were
12:55
quarantined in our homes because we were
12:57
less of a threat and and they want to
13:00
hand-feed us so they can control us
13:01
that's just been their agenda now for
13:03
years and but I can tell you what this
13:06
is God's time and I don't care how much
13:08
they strive they fight they plan they
13:12
pay their money out it doesn't matter
13:14
how much they hate
13:15
or playing against God they are fighting
13:18
him they're fighting what he wants right
13:20
now and these are running into some of
13:23
the greatest days the earth has seen not
13:26
just for the next several years but for
13:28
several generations to come and he's
13:31
never stopped telling me that so people
13:33
better roll up your rapture ugh and I do
13:34
know that there's some people out there
13:36
that don't understand the timing of God
13:38
either so they think this is the end and
13:41
I can tell you it's going to be a lot
13:42
more than just a little virus that
13:44
happens in the end but all those who on
13:47
purpose and there are many that are
13:49
going to be exposed not just excuse me
13:55
not just in this country because this
13:58
thing is so far-reaching that are
14:00
plotting and planning against what God
14:02
wants he wants righteousness justice and
14:05
liberty in our country that there are
14:07
those outside this country that also
14:09
hate our country and they hate our
14:11
president and they have even dropped
14:15
their own barriers which probably wasn't
14:17
the smartest thing they ever did I will
14:20
tell you this not even in hell are their
14:23
partners not even in hell do they do
14:26
they come together to try to plan clean
14:28
evil there is no friendship or love
14:31
amongst any evil people not not in the
14:35
criminals not anybody not criminals not
14:38
people who want deaths not people who
14:40
want violence not people who hate
14:42
anybody who come against anybody those
14:45
who have no care or concern for life
14:47
itself no matter who it is or what age
14:49
they are there's no love for each other
14:51
and when those brutes begin to plug
14:53
together
14:54
it is the downfall and that's always
14:55
happen in history but God's not just
14:58
repeating what's happened he's going to
15:00
expose and levels we've never seen
15:01
before and I'm saying with the documents
15:04
to prove what's been going on he's been
15:07
showing me visions of these groups of
15:09
people meeting behind closed doors even
15:11
in other countries to play an imply our
15:13
downfall I'm talking about America's
15:16
downfall and that is what they want in
15:18
they're not going to get it and I think
15:21
when this is all over people will be
15:22
absolutely shocked see how many people
15:25
are involved in this great deception to
15:28
bring fear
15:29
control in this country and I will say
15:33
bottom line is as Satan wants this
15:35
country
15:36
this country he doesn't care what he has
15:38
to do to get it
15:39
he doesn't care who he gets to get get
15:41
come to his side to help promote or even
15:44
do those things or lie cheat and steal
15:46
about those things to try to make this
15:48
happen
15:49
no one can fight against God and win and
15:52
when he has people who have been praying
15:54
and declaring to him let me tell you by
15:56
the hundreds of thousands of body of
15:58
Christ really seriously especially like
16:01
the last four or five years having
16:04
coming together and numbers never seen
16:06
or heard of before even in groups even
16:08
online doing this declaring God's will
16:11
be done in this country there's no way
16:12
the enemy's going to get this country
16:14
and not just this country there's other
16:16
countries now and leaders of other
16:18
countries that are getting born-again
16:20
and whenever they had whatever you know
16:22
yourself whatever is on the head is what
16:24
will come down it will come down to the
16:26
rest of the people but great deceptions
16:28
been going on for some time and I think
16:31
people will be shocked at the degree the
16:34
level and how many the number of that's
16:36
going to happen so they can try to hide
16:38
all they want to they can't hide from
16:40
God okay thank you
16:42
when I've heard you say both in public
16:47
when we're doing conferences together or
16:49
in a trip to Israel that we did together
16:51
with us so much you've said almost every
16:55
time you speak these are quote these are
16:59
not the perilous times and now this
17:02
virus came along and you're still saying
17:04
these are not the perilous times is that
17:06
why Sarah would say well if I look at my
17:11
Bible these things are all plotted these
17:14
conspiracies this has to be this has to
17:18
be it's too wicked and and yet here's
17:21
what I'm going to say agree or disagree
17:23
the reason you know it's not the
17:26
perilous times is by revelation is that
17:30
true or not true is true but also the
17:33
fact that I have always been real
17:35
sensitive about a lot of stuff even as a
17:37
little child I have and my dad was like
17:40
that also
17:41
and if you if people could see a really
17:45
understand it's not just what I know
17:47
about the futures what I also know about
17:48
the past like in the days of Noah and
17:50
stuff like that and that also is by
17:52
revelation but if you just read the word
17:54
if the earth was so bad
17:57
Steve if it was so wicked I'm talking
18:01
about the whole world that God had to
18:02
destroy it except for a handful of
18:04
people how bad was that because he
18:07
searched for people that he knew he
18:09
could trust that knew him and if he only
18:11
found a handful how wicked was the rest
18:14
of the world at that time
18:15
but I myself know hundreds of thousands
18:18
of strong powerful believers who live
18:21
justly who love who help who serve God
18:24
who know who he is if he has that many
18:28
people on the earth why would he destroy
18:30
it because it says in the perilous times
18:33
it will be as it was in the days of Noah
18:35
wasn't anything like it was in the days
18:37
of Noah right now there's people who
18:39
care who help who bless you know who
18:42
want good even people who are secular
18:44
people when I say secular that means
18:46
non-believers there's even secular
18:48
people doing good who want good who
18:50
actually want a future and so this is
18:53
not my number one statement is this is
18:55
not as it was in the days of Noah I mean
18:58
they were eating each other they were
18:59
killing their own family members they
19:01
were so involved with defilement that
19:04
even hell was involved in their lives
19:06
like in person involved in their lives
19:08
and they were worshipping demons and an
19:10
outwardly has stuff happening that is
19:13
not the way it is right now no matter
19:15
how bad they think it is and if you've
19:17
been born and around probably maybe for
19:19
the last thirty years or so you haven't
19:23
really seen terrific evil on the earth I
19:25
mean I would have thought if anything
19:26
would have been in the days of Hitler
19:27
right when that pure evil that was hell
19:30
involved in the whole country not the
19:32
people by the way of my people in
19:33
Germany and I love people in Germany but
19:35
that was Satan's controlling a whole
19:37
country but at that time in the days of
19:40
Noah
19:41
Satan was controlling the whole world he
19:43
was involved in every evil act every
19:45
evil deed to the point where people were
19:48
so horrible that God had to wipe them
19:51
off the face of the earth so you know
19:53
one can say
19:55
that now is as it was in the days of
19:56
Noah and yet the Bible says those times
19:59
will be we haven't begun to tap into
20:02
creativity into inventions we have not
20:05
even completed the shortlist Jesus gave
20:08
us that he himself said we would do it
20:10
hasn't happened yet
20:11
and God is not willing to with all of us
20:15
off this earth and take us away because
20:17
if the body of Christ was raptured who
20:19
would fulfill we haven't even seen one
20:22
manifested son or daughter or stop an
20:24
earthquake and make it put it back the
20:25
way it was before let me tell you what
20:27
these things like that coming and so
20:30
therefore just reading the Bible and
20:33
understanding God actually means what he
20:35
says just as a normal believer which I
20:39
haven't met for a long time I would
20:41
understand in my head it can't happen
20:43
now I know people that have a 40 and 50
20:45
year you know Commission that they
20:48
haven't even started to operate in if
20:49
he's giving Commission's and mantels and
20:53
anointings for the greater works why
20:57
would he end it all because I happen to
20:59
know from the father the day of his
21:02
son's wrath and the day of his sons
21:04
power can't happen at the same time and
21:08
right now we're in the day of his power
21:10
so this is not the perilous times yeah
21:13
that's interesting can you talk about
21:14
the inventions because God revealed that
21:17
to me I remember the moment I was
21:19
reading a magazine three or four years
21:21
ago four five years ago about this
21:23
incredible inventions health-wise that
21:26
God had been anointing these people and
21:28
they were coming up with miraculous
21:31
discoveries and recoveries and I thought
21:34
all of a sudden it was as that went down
21:36
from heaven it's not in words but in and
21:39
all of a sudden I understood exactly
21:42
what you're saying why would God
21:44
suddenly why would he invest all these
21:47
time and energy to begin to bring these
21:50
inventions in these healings to the
21:52
service so they could begin to affect
21:54
the earth and say that's it I'm wiping
21:56
this place out it doesn't it's not
21:58
logical and you know what I know God
22:02
doesn't necessarily think logically and
22:05
he definitely is strange in this
22:08
Arius but I will say this he has his
22:12
plans and he has a time on yes I know
22:14
that by revelation I've seen it but I
22:16
can tell you just by reading the word
22:18
itself when pastors or people don't
22:21
understand what's going on they don't
22:23
they couldn't even think in their whole
22:25
soul that great and good and powerful
22:29
get happened
22:31
they're totally ignoring the fact about
22:33
the kingdom which is a spiritual King
22:35
that we rule in now in this lifetime and
22:38
just because Jesus talks so much about
22:41
the kingdom that's our authority our
22:42
Dominion and the things that will create
22:44
invent we will have authority over the
22:46
land the sea in the air there's a
22:47
manifested sons and daughters it's all
22:49
scriptural so just reading the word and
22:53
being open to the Holy Spirit without
22:55
even the revelation he has literally
22:57
shown me he's taking me into the future
22:59
and show me things happening and let me
23:02
tell you I've gone over a hundred years
23:03
into the future and I'm not I'm not I'm
23:05
not afraid to say that Wow
23:07
if you had stood before the man if I
23:11
said son of God face to face and he is
23:15
telling you things
23:16
there's no way anyone out there can stop
23:19
you from believing it Eitan and you
23:21
don't look at what's going on you don't
23:23
ignore what's going on you take
23:25
authority over and that's what I've been
23:27
telling people for the last few months
23:28
take authority over all of it you know
23:30
you don't have to be caught in any trap
23:32
the enemy's setting and then take his
23:34
oppression that he wants you to have and
23:36
fear he want you to have those things
23:38
don't come from God and yet he's
23:40
appointed us to greatness it says so he
23:43
has good plans for us he said so these
23:46
aren't things even man is saying so just
23:48
the understanding of what he's saying in
23:50
his word if you drew your own timeline
23:53
and I challenge anyone to do it by the
23:55
way the tribulation has not happened
23:57
there's people even saying that and it
23:59
hasn't happened I've seen parts of that
24:01
and even let me talk about it because he
24:03
wants people to focus on the days
24:05
they're here and what their purpose is
24:07
if he times your birth on the earth you
24:09
need to run after that and ignore
24:12
everything else the enemy is trying to
24:14
convince you of and you have to run your
24:16
race get rid of every weight that gets
24:18
in your way
24:19
that means things that might be going on
24:20
you take authority over it Jesus gave us
24:24
power and authority in this earth
24:26
I think one of the greatest issues is
24:27
the body of Christ do not realize who
24:29
they are and the son and daughter of God
24:32
they just don't realize the authority
24:34
they have over Satan they have over any
24:36
circumstances situations in their life
24:39
what we say with our mouths matters what
24:42
we let in our soul matters and I make
24:45
sure mine stays free of everything no
24:48
one has to walk around depressed or
24:50
fearful and call those things that be
24:53
not as though they were it doesn't say
24:54
talk about the things going on right so
24:58
you know one scripture of call those
24:59
things it be not as though they were you
25:01
live and act like they are happening
25:03
that they are coming if you have
25:05
expectancy in your heart but this is
25:08
changing and you're gonna have a part in
25:09
that that's that's like number three
25:12
what are you doing here
25:14
but but I can tell you what the the
25:17
exposure that is going to be falling and
25:20
it's already started it's already
25:22
started and I can't name names or same
25:24
thing but I do know some inside people
25:27
concerning Trump and stuff going on and
25:30
I got it already told me stuff anyway it
25:32
wasn't like they were telling me
25:33
anything new but I do know that great
25:36
exposure is about to take place and I
25:38
had someone tell me this didn't come
25:41
from me someone told me that they had
25:43
that God had said to them that if the
25:45
Democratic Party does not change that's
25:47
the left that they will be no more now I
25:50
didn't say that that was said to them
25:52
because of because of where they have
25:54
gone now what they started years ago
25:56
wasn't what they are now we give open
25:59
doors to the enemy and you choose the
26:01
darkness and you choose death and not
26:03
life then your own mind becomes seared
26:07
to things that wouldn't even be good in
26:09
the normal or in the natural and I can
26:12
just tell you there's gonna be great
26:13
things and actually some people will no
26:16
longer live yeah I mean even beyond the
26:21
earth anymore because they've been doing
26:23
and coming against God and hating and
26:25
eatin people and actually some of that
26:28
happened last before in 2016 some things
26:31
happens
26:32
people just God took him up the air
26:36
yesterday he I know that I know you and
26:39
I know your what God has showed you that
26:41
I know early on God showed me that
26:42
President Trump was his man he's not our
26:45
pastor and she is a commander-in-chief
26:47
but he's the person like the Cyrus on
26:51
the earth that's working with him also I
26:53
see him progressing in the things of the
26:55
Spirit from it is less of a baby
26:57
Christian than he was back when he first
26:59
started ready I can tell right what do
27:02
you say to people let me ask it this way
27:07
I've heard you prophesy or just declare
27:11
that Trump will be here for eight years
27:12
and I've heard other people with a
27:15
prophetic gifts a trip will be here for
27:17
eight years if my people pray and humble
27:21
themselves into battle or whatever how
27:25
would you describe the balance between
27:28
what God would like let's say another
27:32
four years for president Trump which I
27:34
believe he does versus us praying so
27:37
that it will happen I mean I can assure
27:41
you that all the prayers I would tell
27:45
people to keep praying
27:46
but the prayers have already going forth
27:47
for him to be here for another four
27:49
years
27:50
good okay really seriously about that
27:54
that the prayers needed to him there and
27:57
the people who people don't even know
28:00
about by the tens of thousands that is
28:03
what they've been doing every single day
28:05
since 2016 not getting off their face
28:08
not stop declaring so God doesn't need
28:10
like every single person in the world to
28:13
do something in the earth he needs a
28:16
people he needs a remnant that that is
28:18
their passion what his passion is is
28:20
their passion and right now this is
28:22
God's passion is for him to remain here
28:24
he is going to win in 2020 and God does
28:27
not stop saying that to me he says it to
28:30
me almost every day he will win and he
28:33
will do even greater things in the next
28:35
four years than he did in the first four
28:37
years and I know people are saying
28:39
things well everything's been wiped out
28:40
he already did it hasn't all been wiped
28:42
out it's what's in the hearts of the
28:44
people that he
28:46
with hope for a future you know with
28:49
goodness with caring and just totally
28:52
not listening to any of the left who are
28:55
saying the opposite
28:57
you can't hold people I'm not saying he
28:59
was always perfect obviously he went
29:02
through a time in his life when he
29:03
wasn't but he has more and more going
29:05
into the light of what God wants and I
29:08
do personally know that he seeks out his
29:11
first counsel is with the strong
29:14
believers and leaders of believers is
29:16
his first counsel and he has not stopped
29:19
now it's not doing that so he doesn't
29:22
stand scripturally he doesn't stain in
29:25
the counsel of the ungodly in this virus
29:28
he probably had some of that but he
29:30
didn't know that they would be lying and
29:32
giving him false information he
29:34
seriously seek to those who were
29:36
professional in certain arenas that he
29:38
expected the truth to be given to him
29:39
and he's finding out that was not so I'm
29:42
not saying every single person but there
29:44
are people that were doing it on purpose
29:46
and plotted and planned to that for
29:48
their purpose so Trump doesn't stand in
29:51
the counsel of the ungodly he seeks the
29:53
counsel of the godly and even God
29:55
himself number two he allows and
29:58
welcomes God to be in our country on
30:01
purpose
30:02
yes and so there are things he his own
30:06
self has prayer they have prayer
30:08
meetings they have Bible studies in the
30:10
White House his wife is such a powerful
30:13
prayer warrior right now and it's not
30:14
just Tim it's his family also they can't
30:18
they try to separate them and read them
30:20
apart because they're even more
30:21
dangerous when they come become unified
30:23
any family is by the way but the way
30:26
he's focused himself he wants the best
30:30
for this country and he's willing to do
30:33
what he knows inside he has to do he's
30:35
certainly both enough to do it he can
30:38
brush everything else aside I've never
30:39
known a single person on the face of the
30:41
earth has probably been bashed trashed
30:43
as much as he has in that position that
30:46
he's in and yet has gone full force what
30:49
he knows will help our country make a
30:52
country great and not just our country
30:54
he's reaching out to other leaders of
30:56
countries to help them so why would
30:59
God abandon him and pick somebody who
31:03
doesn't even want babies to live they
31:05
don't they want to control they don't
31:07
care about anybody really except
31:09
themselves
31:10
why wouldn't he choose the darkness over
31:12
the light he's not going to
31:14
well good stuff can't our third area
31:18
we're gonna cover today is down on the
31:19
body of Christ kind of needs to prepare
31:22
for what God is going to begin to do
31:24
from heaven most of it I mean I've heard
31:27
different prophetic words about we don't
31:29
know the the tiniest bit tenth of what
31:33
he's about to do has never been done
31:35
before but we don't know what that is
31:37
how do we prepare for that what can we
31:40
do well I would say I'm praying that
31:43
most people took advantage of the time
31:46
they have had with their families I know
31:48
one thing that's extremely important to
31:50
God even if even if we want in this time
31:53
even it was just like normal times but
31:55
we're not wondering a very divine time
31:57
right now your relationship with your
31:59
own family and I'm saying like husbands
32:02
and wives first and then then with their
32:04
family members to make that you're
32:06
bonded together that each of them are
32:09
giving love to each other because God
32:11
loves the home he loves marriage and he
32:13
loves family and so this to me I kept
32:17
telling people you have an opportunity
32:18
that's never happened in the world
32:20
before where it's kind of stopped
32:22
everything's stopped and you maybe
32:24
quarantine I didn't even call it
32:25
quarantine the you are now secluded with
32:28
your family and you get to be together
32:30
do things together
32:31
you're literally a seeding into the soul
32:35
of the generations that are now on the
32:38
earth growing up and they will never
32:40
forget these days the things you said if
32:43
you taught them to pray if you never did
32:45
that before if you haven't ever prayed
32:46
for them to floor let them see that in
32:49
you because that's going to be so
32:50
important for how they live the choices
32:52
they will make and so even in not even
32:56
considering all the spiritual leaders
32:58
right now but just in the home and the
33:00
family the number one preparation you
33:02
should be making for what is coming is
33:04
to know and understand God has great
33:07
plans for you no matter what is going on
33:09
there could be a whirlwind of going
33:12
around in your
33:13
life you know maybe you've lost your job
33:14
maybe the company closed maybe whatever
33:16
that isn't gonna stop God from blessing
33:19
you you have to see that know that and
33:21
you should be telling your children
33:22
there
33:23
my dad always seated us with faith with
33:26
hope for a future the the greatness of
33:30
God his a love for us the possibilities
33:34
even when it seems impossible all of
33:38
that impossibility gets wiped away
33:40
because nothing's impossible with God
33:41
and I say number one don't run after
33:44
everything else run out there try to do
33:47
things in abandon the ones he first gave
33:50
you you know I do happen to know that
33:52
when you first get to heaven the first
33:55
question guy will ask you is what did
33:57
you do with your family I'm gonna stand
34:00
on his throne and say how many souls did
34:03
you win it's like he didn't know right
34:05
he knows everything it's not that he
34:08
doesn't know that or care about that but
34:10
the ones he gave you personally to care
34:13
for to love I know there's a lot of
34:15
broken homes pray for those people
34:17
anyway but your spouse's love you pray
34:19
for them anyway that they know God that
34:22
they understand God and always for your
34:24
children especially if you've been a
34:26
strange call them have conversations
34:28
with them and I know you people were
34:30
thinking maybe they'd been more than
34:32
that that's number one
34:33
okay make sure you're spending that time
34:36
with God to even be able to do these
34:37
things you have to have that time with
34:39
God you need people say how did you
34:43
develop your relationship with God I
34:45
spent time with him well what does that
34:47
look like I didn't lay on my face and
34:49
cry out and tremble and pray for eight
34:51
hours a day I went in a room and shut
34:53
the door and say okay God I want to know
34:55
you I want to know you I want to be just
34:58
like you I want to understand what you
35:00
want from me I want to know you closer
35:02
than anyone else on the earth I'm gonna
35:04
do great things I need you here you
35:07
because I love you and I did that for
35:11
days and days and days and days and one
35:12
day he walks through the wall of my home
35:14
and after that he never stopped coming
35:17
and I never stopped seeking Him it says
35:20
in the Bible no matter what's going on
35:23
in your life I love the scripture seek
35:25
ye first the
35:27
I'm up God and His righteousness sake
35:30
everything else you need is going to be
35:33
added to you yeah and yet so many people
35:37
are listening to so many other voices
35:39
and yet if there was one scripture in
35:41
the Bible I would tell them they need to
35:43
meditate on and run after and declare
35:45
that when you talk about what God wants
35:49
it draws him to you not that he doesn't
35:53
care about you but he's listening for
35:55
those who want to know him more who
35:57
cares about what he cares about and so
36:00
number number one probably would be make
36:02
sure you're seeking God more then don't
36:04
forget your family and then after that
36:07
you need to change your mindset about
36:10
who you are and what God thinks about
36:13
you because if he put you here now he
36:15
has a purpose for you he has a vision
36:18
and a purpose for every single person he
36:20
really does I have a 12th grade
36:23
education
36:24
I'm not some great big Brian that's been
36:27
to universities and have all kinds of
36:29
certificates and things like that but I
36:32
have a heart that's after God yeah David
36:36
did and look how many mistakes
36:38
David me but look what she did for God
36:40
he never stopped loving God and when he
36:43
made mistakes he'd go to him and ask for
36:45
forgiveness but he had a heart ram
36:47
that's what God says about him it was
36:51
after him and so the simplest things cuz
36:54
people get all these study books and
36:56
resources and they want to look in here
36:57
maybe I'll find something that will just
36:59
kick me into high gear
37:01
it's called God that's what it's called
37:02
it's called it's Christ it's known him
37:05
he holds everything in his hands he made
37:07
everything never existed he knows the
37:09
future he knows every every desire of
37:11
your heart and he came to me one day
37:14
because I people said well how much do
37:16
you pray and I heard God say you tell
37:19
them I said you pray all the day because
37:22
you never stopped talking to us clear
37:24
conversation with God and prayer doesn't
37:28
mean it's okay to give him his needs of
37:30
course he cares about you cast all your
37:32
care upon him he cares for you I'm
37:34
talking about just having conversation
37:36
about anything I include him in
37:39
and I will ask him all kinds of things
37:41
or discuss things with him even if I
37:42
don't see him in front of me that
37:43
doesn't stop me from doing because I
37:45
believe he hears me which is well again
37:48
back to the word so many people don't
37:50
even read the words you need to read the
37:51
word how about put that on your list
37:53
okay but he's serious if you seek him
37:57
whether all of your heart all of your
38:00
might and all your mind you'll find him
38:02
because he's waiting right there next to
38:05
you but there are great things coming
38:08
and he will use many unknown people not
38:11
unknown to him but I'm known to mankind
38:16
these people have just kept themselves
38:18
I'm not saying be a hermit and go hide
38:20
in the hills and by the way you can't
38:22
get anyone's age or share the kingdom or
38:24
stuff you know with people if you hide
38:26
from people and I was always a person
38:29
who didn't really want to be by people I
38:31
was one in fifteen I already had major
38:33
jobs going on for me and my family to
38:36
help with my siblings because I was you
38:39
know older than most of them and I
38:41
didn't know God even from a young age I
38:43
was four and I actually saw Jesus Christ
38:47
up inside of me so you can imagine
38:48
living my life like that being a seer
38:50
seeing the spirit realm all around me I
38:52
know I didn't have a normal life and and
38:55
yet I still had to make choices like
38:57
everyone else right
38:59
I don't live a stress-free life I don't
39:01
know if you are you kidding if we gave a
39:02
list of things that were going on around
39:04
us were you Lucifer my soul we give it
39:07
to God we bind him to our heart and run
39:11
after whatever he has said he wants to
39:13
do and I will assure everybody people
39:17
can fight and yell and argue all they
39:20
wanted this is not the end don't waste
39:23
your time preparing to get on your
39:24
rapture rug you will do nothing okay he
39:27
didn't say to you that I said take
39:28
Dominion take authority that means you
39:31
rule and reign that means you take you
39:33
don't you know put up with anything in
39:35
the enemy don't tolerate don't
39:36
participate with him but you get your
39:38
crown on and you begin to rule by what
39:40
you say the choices you make and openly
39:43
manifest who and what you believe he is
39:47
and you who do you who do you follow and
39:50
unbelievers don't
39:52
big good job No yeah nobody let me we're
39:55
about out of time for today but I want
39:58
to ask you some people might not have
40:01
missed this but I I didn't miss it sent
40:04
me I'm missing I didn't miss what you
40:05
just said when you talked about how you
40:07
prayed and I'm going to ask you about
40:10
whether it's a selfish in a good way a
40:13
good selfish now you said make me closer
40:16
to you I want to know you better than
40:18
any person on the face of the earth that
40:21
one stuck with me when you said it's
40:23
never going to leave so it's not added
40:26
to my prayer that's kind of like be my
40:28
prayer talk about that for a minute how
40:31
selfish and how Germanic can we request
40:34
God to come like that he wants you to do
40:39
it he so desires if we really understood
40:44
we came from I'm down about the father
40:46
now we came from him he carried us
40:49
inside of himself until he timed our
40:52
births on the earth so we would have a
40:53
body he created a whole physical realm
40:56
how much time and energy did he take
40:59
himself to make a way for us to be here
41:01
and then also what did he do to make it
41:04
possible for us to come back to him
41:06
that's how much he loves us and he loves
41:08
everyone the same he doesn't pick some
41:11
people over other people because he
41:12
loves them more it's because they have
41:14
surrendered more because they're more
41:16
willing maybe to give up some things
41:19
maybe to change what they're doing or
41:21
saying it's your desire how great is
41:25
your desire to know him because his
41:27
number one desire and everything he
41:30
could have or do or want is us and he
41:34
wants to hear us say those words I
41:36
remember when I would hear him laugh out
41:38
loud when at one point I used to start
41:41
yelling I got side electrodes on you and
41:43
I would yell I want to be just like you
41:46
well I want to be just like you I want
41:49
to operate like you that is his that's
41:52
his bottom line for all of us not just
41:54
me but if people can get their eyes off
41:57
everything around them and begin to say
42:01
that to him do you think you'll escape
42:03
being great
42:05
answer is no and I don't do it to be
42:08
great it's not about what I get or don't
42:10
get it's about what he gets it's about
42:12
what he wants and in the Bible God said
42:16
let us make man in our image that's
42:18
Father Son and Holy Spirit and after our
42:21
likeness their life this is how they
42:23
operate he's not repeating himself an
42:25
image is an image but likeness means how
42:28
they operate so he himself said let us
42:31
make man to look like us and act just
42:33
like us it's good if we were operating
42:36
like him oh my word this would be a
42:38
whole different world but we're entering
42:40
into seasons and even generations where
42:44
it will be such a different life ok
42:47
and that will continue to grow and
42:49
improve until the end begins to come I'm
42:52
talking about the very end and I can
42:54
point to mark 16 all day long and Jesus
42:57
said can you music this is what you need
42:59
to tell all those people preaching this
43:01
is a perilous times this is a
43:02
tribulation he said no we don't have
43:04
time for that right now it's got its own
43:06
time
43:06
he said the devil gets a bump in the
43:08
road he only gets a few short years to
43:10
be in charge but until then the body of
43:13
Christ will grow an authority and
43:15
Dominion in inventions and creations we
43:18
have to create things because he's a
43:19
creator the world will look different ok
43:24
until that time starts and that is
43:26
generations away he said in mark 16
43:30
they'll be wars and rumors of wars
43:32
nations rise against nation Kingdom to
43:34
rise against Kingdom but the end is not
43:37
yet so they want to know where are we in
43:40
the Bible we are right there the end is
43:42
not yet
43:43
the manifested sons and daughters must
43:45
be in this earth visibly seen doing
43:48
supernatural acts never done in the
43:51
years before we will actually speak and
43:53
things will be healed not just an arm or
43:55
a leg or someone's body but cities God
43:58
has given us such authority use he's
44:01
going to build readings of light and
44:02
glory that sin and sickness won't be
44:05
able to exist in the Ruby regions of
44:07
darkness and evil because until Christ
44:09
you know comes and all the whole thing
44:11
ends until everything ends and evil is
44:13
still here they'll still be people who
44:15
want evil and so people have to live in
44:17
those evil dark cities
44:18
they want to be because they won't be
44:20
able to do any versions of glory so this
44:22
is what he's plenty his ultimate plan is
44:24
is to have this on the earth okay that
44:27
greatness is coming in every area five
44:30
major diseases will no longer exist on
44:32
this earth at one point and yet people
44:35
are saying a virus is bringing the
44:36
tribulation okay I can tell you the
44:38
virus and virus and it's passing and
44:40
that's what he said it will pass and he
44:42
said it will pass quickly and so I want
44:45
people to understand you can have as
44:47
much of him if me just just to you know
44:51
12th grade graduate all right with know
44:54
a high-minded education it's what's in
44:57
my soul it's what is in my heart it's
45:01
where are my desires my desire is for
45:05
him and if you're gonna have a best
45:08
friend you don't tell them every issue
45:11
in your life you don't go around spewing
45:13
and other people hurting and mourning
45:15
them were supposed to speak life we're
45:18
supposed to bring hope were supposed to
45:20
take authority we have a light in this
45:22
and the more you use that light and the
45:24
enemy looks at you one day you look like
45:26
a burning Inferno he wanted to be able
45:28
to see you that's what I'm going after
45:30
that's what every believer should go
45:33
after that they want to manifest who he
45:35
is and what he is breathing in our lives
45:37
at this time so run after him first seek
45:41
ye first the kingdom which is him yes
45:43
but it's also ruling in that kingdom
45:47
what does that look like it looks like
45:49
on earth as it is in heaven so good just
45:53
so good well we could talk for you I
45:56
know you and I we could go for a couple
45:58
hours like we did at one time on the
46:00
cruise your staff we're all looking for
46:03
a car worth it was it maybe she's
46:04
visiting Steve and dreams crazy yeah so
46:10
this one will keep me shorter but then
46:12
we'll have you back more often if that's
46:13
okay I would love to have it so thank
46:17
you so much I know if nobody else got
46:19

46:23

46:24
around it'll be fun we'll have you back
46:26
here several times of course before the
46:28
election because it'll be fun to talk
46:29
about what's happening there too and
46:31
yeah and I'm having that prayer out
46:33
there sometimes I pray those huge
46:35
prayers like that and I think man I hope
46:37
that's not too selfish but today I found
46:39

01:38
well
01:38
good morning if you happen to be on the
01:40
west coast of the united states this
01:42
morning some of you are watching
01:43
overseas so it's somewhere in the night
01:45
or the middle of the night and
01:46
uh welcome to elijah streams here when
01:49
you tune into this show
01:52
you are tuning into both the elijah list
01:54
which sponsors
01:56
uh and in effect pays for um the
01:59
foundation we we call
02:01
elijah's streams which is what you're
02:02
watching now the streaming portion of
02:05
prophetic revelation so we're about to
02:07
introduce in just a few moments Kat Kerr
02:10
be sure and text your friends and let
02:12
them know Kat's about to be on
02:14
she is an all-time favorite mo we get
02:17
more views when Kat
02:18
Kat is on than almost any other time so
02:21
she loves to talk about heaven before i
02:23
bring her on let me just tell you all
02:24
a quick story that about 2013 or 2014
02:28
can't remember which
02:29
year my wife and i went on a cruise uh
02:32
off of the east coast um the caribbean
02:35
cruise
02:36
and before we went all i had this sudden
02:39
insatiable desire to get every book i
02:41
could get on
02:43
heaven people that have visited heaven i
02:45
just got this big old stack of books
02:48
and i don't know why i was getting it
02:50
but uh
02:52
uh often by the way when you have these
02:54
desires that you don't know where they
02:55
came from where they pretty much come
02:56
from the lord when they when that
02:58
happens and
02:59
so during the whole cruise when we'd
03:01
have our downtime in the room we
03:03
i would read these books and the ones
03:04
that were my favorite
03:07
are the ones called revealing heaven i
03:09
think there was there's a volume one or
03:10
two i might have only had volume one at
03:12
that time can't remember but
03:14
and i would sit there in my i would just
03:15
string tears as i hear
03:18
heaven described by Kat so i'm going to
03:22
let's
03:22
this is a good time let's bring Kat on
03:24
about now
03:25
and we're going to hey Kat how are you
03:27
we can see you now
03:28
i'm doing great thank you yeah the setup
03:31
we have
03:32
is that Kat cannot see us but we can see
03:34
her
03:35
so uh there's that uh the focus isn't
03:38
that perfect but it's probably good
03:40
enough so
03:41
good well ken how are you you're in
03:43
florida today is that right
03:44
oh yes it's beautiful here we're not not
03:47
roasting like normal
03:48
we've really got like a little mini cold
03:50
way that means it's probably about 79 or
03:53
80
03:54
which is bad
03:57
well it's a little overcast and a bit
03:58
rainy just a little bit here in the
03:59
northwest but we could take that because
04:01
we had those fires
04:02
out here just a few weeks ago so yeah
04:05
listen kat i want to before we jump into
04:07
this and i
04:08
you know i see you got your red white
04:10
and blue in the stars and all along with
04:12
your pink hair i love that
04:14
i want to hear if you would do this for
04:16
the people some have not ever heard you
04:18
speak before and this will be passed
04:19
around
04:20
um i wanted to ask you about your visits
04:22
to heaven just a few minutes on
04:25
how many times you've gone if you can
04:27
even quantify that sort of thing
04:29
and then how does it help you to know
04:31
what God's saying right now today
04:34
well i've been a believer from the age
04:37
of four
04:38
i forget how old i am because i'm just
04:40
gonna
04:41
claim timelessness you know there you go
04:43
i've been on this earth for
04:45
i'm sure it's over 60 years at least but
04:48
you know when you're connected to heaven
04:49
you feel like a child
04:51
we all know what the word says you must
04:53
be like a little child to enter into the
04:55
kingdom of heaven and it's not just a
04:58
requirement it's
04:59
because heaven is so amazing and
05:02
beautiful and adventurous
05:04
and filled with awe and wonder that
05:07
you would almost have to have the mind
05:09
of a child when you get
05:11
it and that's that's your future home
05:14
everyone who belongs to jesus christ and
05:16
just so you remember this or
05:18
you know think about this there were
05:20
several people in the bible
05:21
the old testament the new testament that
05:24
either saw God himself he came down and
05:26
visited with them
05:28
or they were caught up to heaven so even
05:30
though i'm taken to heaven that's not my
05:32
plan i don't even do that
05:34
God catches me up by his spirit and
05:36
takes me on tours of heaven
05:38
and there's a reason for that i like i
05:41
said i've known the lord from age four
05:43
i've had a personal relationship with
05:44
him then a real intimate relationship
05:46
with jesus christ
05:48
probably 20 30 years just really seeking
05:51
him out to be in his presence
05:53
and so also as a seer i also didn't make
05:57
that happen
05:58
from the time i was a little girl i
06:00
could see into the spirit realm so i've
06:02
always seen
06:02
angels or demons activities of hell
06:05
activities of heaven
06:07
and in the spirit realm you know that's
06:09
called the unseen realm
06:11
there's more than just creatures and
06:13
angels
06:14
there's places that were built for
06:16
heaven to use or other places that the
06:18
enemy uses
06:19
all around us that spirit realm is
06:21
present so i see it all the time so you
06:23
have to understand it's normal to me
06:26
to see and understand these things but
06:29
probably my first encounter happened
06:31
when i was probably around 13
06:33
and i was just walking and talking to
06:35
God and he gave me an open vision
06:38
of me myself and i was asking God you
06:42
know i'm one of 15 kids by the way so if
06:44
you're
06:45
that means if you're not you don't have
06:47
a clue okay especially when you're
06:49
number three
06:50
that means a lot of responsibility and
06:53
you know i'll
06:54
build your character early learn to love
06:56
people no matter what they do or say to
06:58
you
06:58
and so God fully prepared me to be taken
07:02
to heaven
07:03
and see what he wants me to see then he
07:05
takes me and brings me back to share it
07:08
and i've been doing that for over 20
07:09
years
07:11
hear to me many times but in 1996
07:14
appeared to me and said that he and the
07:16
father were going to start taking me on
07:17
tours of heaven
07:18
so they could reveal heaven to earth in
07:21
great detail
07:22
i happen to be a detailed person and the
07:24
few companies i worked for
07:26
especially the law office you know or
07:28
design interior design they loved
07:31
that detail thing in me because nothing
07:33
was left out
07:34
nothing was forgotten i also have a
07:36
photographic memory which God uses that
07:38
so i remember every time i've been to
07:40
heaven and i stopped
07:42
counting after one 000 times wow
07:45
i'm like you know i'm i'm like this
07:47
warehouse of revelation
07:50
on heaven but also the word of God
07:52
revelation on the word of God
07:54
and the father son and holy spirit and
07:56
even time itself
07:58
so i do know many things that are going
08:00
to happen on the earth
08:02
and i've been taking over 100 years into
08:04
the future so if you're sitting on your
08:05
rapture rug
08:07
get off of it and get your crown on so
08:09
you can get ready to rule with jesus
08:10
christ these are things that father has
08:12
me tell people all the time
08:14
wow and so he's just catches me up when
08:17
he wants to
08:18
i'm here one second and then my spirit
08:20
my spirit man
08:21
is somewhere in heaven when he's done
08:24
showing me things i could see four or
08:25
five different places
08:27
and i hear the angels talking nobody
08:29
sees me
08:30
except the angelic or father son or holy
08:33
spirit they see me in heaven the people
08:35
don't see me
08:36
because the father said i was seen by
08:39
people in heaven
08:40
they'd do the same thing you would you
08:42
would run up to me and say please tell
08:44
my family member i love them
08:48
and they would be doing that all the
08:49
time so people up there
08:51
know i come to heaven but they don't see
08:53
me when i'm there
08:55
that way i'm not chased down the streets
08:57
of gold that makes sense
08:59
hey i'm going to ask you a question i've
09:00
never asked you before kat we've talked
09:02
for hours about
09:03
all of this i've never asked you this if
09:05
you are a portrait
09:06
artist in detail if you if you could do
09:09
that
09:10
would you have been able to draw the
09:13
distinct characteristics of the father's
09:15
face
09:18
i could because of my photographic
09:20
memory but i think
09:22
one of the greatest experiences i've
09:25
ever had
09:26
was when jesus christ introduced me to
09:28
his father
09:30
and jesus himself gave me a commission
09:33
to reveal the father himself
09:35
what he's like the things he says what
09:38
his heart is on things
09:40
and so people hear me talk about the
09:42
father a lot and they go don't you care
09:43
about jesus well i'm just doing what
09:45
jesus
09:46
asked me to do to help people understand
09:49
who the father is
09:50
why jesus loves him so much why he's
09:52
willing to go to the cross for us
09:54
even when it's like to be around him in
09:57
heaven
09:58
the father is absolutely he definitely
10:01
has
10:01
white hair but it's got life and it's
10:04
like it
10:05
moves and i never forget that i touched
10:07
it one time when i was there
10:09
it's like life jumped into my entire
10:11
being
10:12
his eyes are like you can barely see his
10:14
eyes because of the glory coming out of
10:16
him
10:17
i so remember the rainbow which he talks
10:20
about in revelation 4
10:22
and when john said i saw a rainbow round
10:24
about the throne
10:25
like i'm to an emerald now i want to
10:28
stress
10:28
he said i'm too like an emerald it
10:31
actually
10:32
one of the biggest parts of the rainbow
10:33
is teal which happens to be the father's
10:36
favorite color if you like that
10:38
yeah that's a that is a beautiful color
10:40
i love that color yeah the rainbow is
10:42
not like just
10:43
stationary it comes from him
10:47
so it moves and waves in and out of his
10:50
very being
10:51
and it's very captivating and sometimes
10:54
he'll grab one of the bands of the
10:56
rainbow he throws it and it goes around
10:59
having them bring
11:00
somebody to him that he wants to visit
11:02
with
11:03
second thing
11:06
excuse me i'm sorry um when the when the
11:09
lord brings you
11:10
thousands of times i suppose now um
11:14
you're what you're saying Kat is that
11:18
his purpose is not just to tell you but
11:20
he
11:21
wants you to tell tell about it right
11:24
because you know paul or whoever was
11:26
caught up in the third heaven said i saw
11:28
things
11:28
i wasn't allowed to to say and i'm
11:32
guessing the lord must show you some
11:34
things you're not allowed to say is that
11:35
right
11:36
very few things because really
11:39
have a commission he said if i if i take
11:42
you there
11:43
you have to share good and now paul you
11:46
have to understand
11:47
saw things ahead of his time so
11:50
if he had tried to share in his own time
11:53
there's no way people had in their head
11:56
not even could they conceive of what he
11:57
was trying to say
11:59
and so the father says certain things to
12:01
be revealed at a different time
12:03
this is definitely the time when he
12:05
wants to reveal much
12:06
about himself about the trinity about
12:09
heaven itself
12:10
in the future also and so i i get a lot
12:14
of revelation on the word
12:15
on time and you know God's been the
12:18
father's
12:18
father son and holy spirit have been
12:20
from the beginning to the end in the end
12:22
to the beginning
12:23
they know everything already that's
12:25
going to happen they actually have a
12:27
timeline
12:28
uh in the throne room that has God's
12:30
important things that will happen on the
12:32
earth
12:33
and those things that are his appointed
12:35
time if you go check the book of acts
12:38
it actually says there are some things
12:40
that are not for man to know
12:42
that are appointed to happen that are in
12:44
the power of the hand of the father
12:46
himself
12:47
and only when he reveals himself is it
12:50
allowed to be given
12:51
so so some of the things i'm sure paul
12:54
saw
12:54
were things that he he could not at that
12:56
time reveal but in this time
12:59
he showed me things for up to a hundred
13:01
years that will happen on this earth
13:03
and one thing i can promise tell you
13:06
that he will always love you he will
13:08
always seek you out jesus christ will
13:10
always pursue you
13:13
even to the very grace that you might
13:15
know who they are that your that your
13:17
destiny might be saved
13:19
and you would be with them in eternity
13:21
it really is their greatest desire
13:24
so a person that um out again there's
13:26
people even watching that are gonna say
13:28
man i've sinned
13:29
i've made so many stupid mistakes i've
13:31
blown it all over and over
13:33
whatever the case may be and your word
13:35
to them
13:36
is what i would say don't let the devil
13:40
lie to you and say that God's not going
13:42
to want you that he would not receive
13:44
you in heaven
13:45
you simply have to repent of your sins
13:49
receive christ as your savior and you
13:51
have to remember what the word says he
13:52
wipes and blots out all of those things
13:55
you did
13:56
that were wrong every sin you ever
13:58
committed or anything you may have said
14:00
that would be
14:01
uh crushing the people or taking the
14:03
life out of people
14:04
he will forgive that and it will be to
14:07
you
14:08
like it never happened and he will write
14:10
your name in the lamb's book of life
14:12
and let me tell you we go to heaven for
14:14
a while but he will make a new earth one
14:15
day
14:16
i've had glimpses of that and the things
14:18
we'll get to do out in
14:19
space it is amazing but you do not want
14:23
to miss
14:24
the one who carried you before you were
14:26
in this earth
14:27
the one who loves you the most the one
14:30
willing to send his son the love that
14:33
comes from him
14:34
is consuming and to me
14:37
the most memorable times i have is when
14:39
i was in the throne room
14:41
or i was with the father to spend time
14:43
alone even with him which he does with
14:45
people in heaven
14:46
your loved ones are living in the most
14:48
amazing powerful beautiful adventurous
14:50
place that
14:51
you could not ever create and there's
14:54
some
14:55
view and declaring over you even now on
14:58
this earth
14:59
so i tell people if you don't know cross
15:00
you might as well give up
15:02
if your grandmother or your room is up
15:04
there praying over you
15:06
your words have power and the holy
15:08
spirit will get you
15:11
that's good well uh Kat thank you so
15:13
much for that let's
15:14
let's then talk about uh november 3 the
15:18
election God has been speaking to you
15:20
about the election coming up uh where
15:23
where do you want to start i'm going to
15:24
just
15:24
give you the floor well first of all i'm
15:27
going to say that
15:28
God actually started speaking to me
15:30
about trump before he was actually in
15:31
the running
15:33
right before he announced he would even
15:35
run and then i think there were 16
15:37
republicans running against him for that
15:40
spot
15:40
and God told me i will remove each of
15:43
them one by one
15:44
until there's only one person left that
15:46
the republican
15:48
uh national convention can say yes to
15:50
and that will be trump
15:52
God throws trump before he was even born
15:55
he knew everything he do what he would
15:57
become and he knew in this time he
15:58
needed somebody strong
16:00
who couldn't be bought who couldn't be
16:02
bulldozed who couldn't have fear put in
16:04
them
16:05
they would hear what he wanted and he
16:07
would carry that out
16:09
and this is what the father says about
16:11
trump he's an
16:12
all-american boy that cares all for
16:15
america
16:16
and i knew then that he would win no
16:18
matter what anyone said
16:20
or was trying to figure out in their
16:22
head that he
16:24
was going to win and i will say that
16:26
again God has never changed what he said
16:28
yes i just spent time with him last
16:30
night and trump will win that election
16:33
but
16:33
never in the history of our country have
16:35
we had so many people trying to
16:37
cheat steal harvest ballots i mean
16:41
everything bring violence to bring
16:44
distraction
16:45
and i'm sure that the left was even
16:46
hoping that the whole virus thing would
16:48
keep everybody in their homes and nobody
16:50
would get to vote
16:51
but each time something comes up hoping
16:54
that it will help them win their person
16:57
and by the way i have to add this
16:59
when i was just speaking in colorado
17:02
God spoke to me he's prophesied just
17:05
like in the old days where when you open
17:07
your mouth
17:07
and it's him speaking he actually said
17:10
why would you want a villain for your
17:12
president when i've already sent
17:14
a superhero so if you ever wonder what
17:18
does
17:18
does God think that's what he thinks
17:20
because he's going to choose who wants
17:22
life liberty freedom and justice and not
17:25
communism you know not socialism not
17:28
controlling
17:29
not violence not no no integrity no
17:32
one's
17:33
no respect does that party have and
17:35
they've
17:36
continually gone down into a deeper hole
17:38
a deeper pit
17:40
buying votes putting out commissions for
17:43
people to be defamed and
17:45
it doesn't matter who's running that's
17:47
good you're going to hear bad things
17:48
about them because of the fake news
17:50
they're all on their side on the side of
17:53
darkness because i don't know what's
17:55
what you would call it
17:56
and on the side of light and life is
17:59
trump
18:00
and God has evidently told me he will
18:03
win
18:04
despite the the crimes and the things
18:07
that they're committing trying to
18:08
make it happen for biden people want
18:11
somebody who knows what they're doing
18:14
and has hope for this country
18:16
and trump will win on november 3rd yeah
18:19
i think off camera before we went on i
18:21
had told you that i saw a major news
18:23
outlet
18:24
online version of it and they this thing
18:27
says that uh
18:28
now the statistics are that uh there was
18:31
like a
18:33
well they said a 91 chance i guess is
18:36
where they were that
18:37
that that biden was gonna win and all of
18:40
these statistics i can't remember
18:41
exactly but
18:42
in other words they're trying to throw
18:44
out that there's this is going to be a
18:46
a slam against uh
18:49
that there's no way trump could win and
18:51
and you're looking at that what do you
18:52
do when you see that do you laugh
18:54
what do you when
18:58
i laugh a lot because you know what
19:00
heaven laughs literally
19:02
laugh every time uh because God
19:05
knows that they represent the darkness
19:08
that represent
19:09
no hope for life no future if you want
19:12
to open the borders and let every
19:13
criminal
19:14
anyone come in from any country anywhere
19:17
without boundaries it's going to be just
19:19
like all the other countries that fell
19:21
into a hole became a third world country
19:23
they want to take the guns away they
19:25
want kids to pick what sex they are
19:27
this is what the other what the
19:29
democrats platform is i'm not making it
19:31
up
19:32
and i know at one point biden said give
19:34
me all your money i'll make america
19:36
russia
19:37
that's recorded that is literally
19:39
recorded
19:40
and God said all i have to do is let
19:42
them open their own mouths and they
19:44
they cause their own downfall and they
19:46
may have a few
19:47
handful of people and they may have
19:50
great wealth supporting
19:51
them but trump has the people
19:55
he has the moral majority he has the
19:57
body of christ
19:58
and God is on his side and when he won
20:01
in 2016
20:03
God literally put his hand on america
20:05
and moved it across
20:07
america and he changed it to red and
20:10
that meant the it's not that the
20:12
republican party is necessarily always
20:14
the greatest thing but it's the party
20:16
he's running in
20:18
and i can tell you not just will trump
20:20
win now
20:21
but God has said in 2016 there'll be 24
20:24
years of
20:25
me in the white house God in the white
20:27
house
20:28
with his plans and his his presence
20:32
welcomed by our government here in
20:35
america
20:36
so to the point that people will come to
20:38
america to find God
20:39
instead of the american God is that
20:42
detailed and he is
20:43
that focus so he said they're like
20:47
ants throwing themselves against a great
20:49
mountain that no matter what they say or
20:51
do
20:52
or spew or lie he is shown me them in
20:54
secret rooms literally
20:56
you show me them in secret rooms making
20:58
bargains with wicked people with poople
21:01
of violence and paying them
21:03
and God said i will expose every single
21:07
bit of it well i just can't ask you
21:09
about that when
21:10
when trump wins then when trump wins i'm
21:13
not going to say if he wins when he wins
21:15
it's a few weeks from now
21:16
what do you see is he going to go to
21:18
work what kind of things you see him
21:19
doing and does the father
21:22
people really knew him he's already been
21:25
making his plans he has things written
21:28
down he's got uh
21:30
agreements ready for leaders of
21:32
countries to sign
21:33
that's gonna make this country even
21:35
greater he's got all kinds of things he
21:37
doesn't sit statically around and i
21:39
don't even know how he finds that time
21:42
right quickly he got over that virus it
21:44
was like that i do know millions of
21:46
people were praying for him
21:48
not just in america but around the world
21:50
they
21:51
know this is what they say i've met many
21:53
people and even leaders like
21:55
um educational leaders government
21:57
leaders from overseas
21:58
they said that if if trump ever did lose
22:02
america would become a third-world
22:03
country and there'd be no hope
22:05
for the leaders of this world to have
22:08
someone to
22:09
be mentored by and so definitely is
22:12
adamant about it he said no matter what
22:14
they try to pull
22:16
you have to remember that God has
22:18
already spoken about this he did what he
22:20
said he would do in 2016.
22:23
he said and i did tell people for
22:25
several years and he did
22:27
that great exposure would come at every
22:29
level in the government in the business
22:31
arena
22:32
in the in the medical arena and all
22:34
those he said i'm going to expose
22:35
pull back the lid and let you see what's
22:37
really there and sometimes we look
22:39
around go it's so horrible it's got to
22:41
be the end oh no it is not the end
22:44
we're just beginning to be do some of
22:46
the greater things for God
22:48
but God has to when he's going to change
22:51
the platform to be accessible
22:55
to the body of christ to his plans his
22:57
will his way
22:59
he has to expose the darkness
23:02
it's always been there it's just that
23:05
now they have media
23:06
to let their lives out to and people who
23:09
have great money can
23:10
pay people this is the one thing they're
23:12
forgetting you're going to get this all
23:14
for free
23:15
when you pay for criminal activity and
23:18
those people are
23:19
weak enough in their in their soul and
23:22
weak enough to not care about this
23:23
country to do violence or do wrong
23:25
things like
23:26
harvest ballast and then dump them
23:28
places they'll be the first ones to yell
23:31
as loud as they can when the dominoes
23:33
begin to fall
23:35
and all this exposure happens the ones
23:37
that were bought paid for
23:38
will totally begin to to shout and yell
23:42
who paid them to do it and it'll go all
23:44
the way up to the wow
23:45
and so there'll be no hiding they can't
23:47
hide because they've already exposed who
23:49
they are
23:50
by buying these people and these weak
23:52
people
23:53
don't care about the plans that they
23:56
have a democratic party
23:57
they just care that they have money so
23:59
when whenever the devil tries to buy
24:02
people or do things
24:03
it never works you can't pay evil to do
24:06
evil
24:07
it's not exposed the Kat has the lord
24:10
showing you about
24:11
um because there's a lot of men people i
24:13
mean i don't even like to read those
24:15
because i don't want to take that in but
24:17
a lot of people are threatening or
24:19
saying that we're like this close to
24:21
civil war
24:22
because if trump wins or doesn't win um
24:26
is he showing anything about the
24:27
violence in the land after the
24:29
only violence we're having right now is
24:31
paid
24:32
violence exactly what we're talking
24:34
about
24:35
they tried doing that in obama's term
24:38
all they kept saying was there's going
24:40
to be civil wars
24:42
they kept saying we have half a million
24:43
i can't tell you many times it leaked
24:45
out and guess where it leaked from this
24:47
is obama term
24:48
uh when he was in office and we had i
24:51
had friends who
24:52
were actually in that office on purpose
24:54
for
24:55
other activities but it came from the
24:58
top
24:59
they wanted anarchy in our streets so
25:01
they could overthrow america
25:04
call in uh armies from outside america
25:07
to come and enjoy it it never worked
25:09
because remember what God said 24 years
25:12
in the white house
25:13
it never worked then and it won't work
25:15
now
25:16
people who they want to fight each other
25:19
have
25:19
families they have destinies they have a
25:23
future
25:24
they want that life and hope they are
25:26
not crazy enough to just start to run
25:28
out in the streets start hurting people
25:30
so i promise you the only ones who are
25:31
going to be fighting are the ones who
25:33
are paid to do it
25:34
and they've been dragged people into the
25:37
fight
25:38
it won't work wow what
25:41
what have you learned from the lord
25:42
about uh abortion and where
25:45
where that's going or how soon you have
25:48
is he giving any time frame about when
25:50
we're going to end this thing
25:52
i can tell you what it will happen
25:54
absolutely be on the shadow of that
25:56
within these years
25:58
and i would i would think most likely
26:01
within these next four years was trump
26:03
it will be ended because he despises
26:06
that
26:06
he knows his murder and he was
26:09
struggling with all that before he even
26:11
ran
26:11
until somebody showed him videos he
26:14
literally saw
26:15
medical videos of that procedure
26:17
happening and from that he was
26:18
absolutely
26:19
horrified he actually is the most
26:21
pro-life
26:23
president we have ever had in america
26:26
and that is high on his list and every
26:28
time i hear from him
26:30
or he does an updated survey it's always
26:32
on that list
26:34
how how do you feel about abortion being
26:36
ended do you stand
26:38
for life are you pro-life even though he
26:40
knows what i believe
26:41
he sends it out on a continual basis to
26:44
i know many different people but i
26:46
always get those it's still on his heart
26:49
it's high on his list he wants to end
26:51
that and guess what
26:53
God wants to end it too what people
26:56
don't realize
26:57
is every one of us at one time we're in
26:59
God himself
27:00
is the word in him we lived we moved
27:04
that means
27:04
in and out on the rays of glory we had
27:06
our very existence
27:08
and so we didn't live in another body
27:11
somewhere in heaven your little spirit
27:12
man lived in him
27:13
he times your birth on the earth it's
27:16
not an accident
27:17
and if he does that it's because he
27:19
needs that person
27:20
here and so he does not like it when he
27:23
sends them and then their lives are
27:25
ended and they have to go
27:27
they go back to heaven of course every
27:29
baby's taken back to heaven their own
27:31
angel takes them there so God you're
27:34
messing with his plans
27:36
you're messing with his little children
27:38
and he does not like it you know what it
27:40
says in the word it'd be better if a
27:42
millstone which is probably the size of
27:45
i don't know a dump truck if you've been
27:47
at a millstone tied around your neck and
27:49
thrown into the depths of the sea
27:52
uh if you touch one of his little babies
27:54
so guess what
27:55
i don't know what's gonna happen all
27:57
those people who promote it
27:59
uh i know repentance is always there for
28:02
those who
28:02
who haven't done or forced to do it you
28:05
need to repent for that
28:06
so that you can go to heaven and you get
28:08
your little baby back that you
28:10
ended in yeah i was gonna that actually
28:13
plays right into
28:14
what i was going to ask you because i
28:16
keep seeing even as you're talking
28:18
there's this
28:19
for lack of better terminology it seems
28:21
like we're split down the middle half of
28:23
the country
28:24
wants trump and the other half wants
28:27
to me it seems like evil because they
28:29
want abortion to be
28:31
to be contained so it seems evil but God
28:34
loves that other half
28:36
he does i guess i want to ask you
28:39
what do you see happening to that other
28:41
half
28:42
who in many ways many of them hate God
28:44
they don't all hate God but
28:46
many of them do what is God showing you
28:48
about awakenings or revivals or things
28:50
like that to come
28:51
of course he's if he showed me that much
28:53
time i i've seen
28:55
a lot he's going to have a habitation
28:57
that will so saturate people
29:00
with his very presence and his plans and
29:03
then we are there's the baptism in fire
29:06
there's his spirit being poured out over
29:08
all the earth there's many things that
29:10
happen that we talked
29:11
that talked about in the bible some of
29:13
them will touch the whole earth
29:15
but right now God is focusing on america
29:18
to be an example
29:20
of heaven culture on earth and that
29:22
shows you where he's going
29:23
uh there'll be many people who
29:26
if they're they're pushing and the
29:28
reason why a lot of people
29:30
hate the other side or hate life is
29:33
they're listening to the fake news
29:35
and the fake news is focused especially
29:38
on lying
29:40
and making unjust accusations
29:43
and they have caused people to
29:45
compromise their soul which God will
29:47
hold them accountable to
29:49
what you watch what you read and what is
29:52
what you hear or what you say yourself
29:54
it goes into
29:55
your soul it has layers it collects this
29:57
stuff and if you get
29:59
too much of it you're going to
30:00
compromise your soul and
30:02
then you may be deceived and you can't
30:04
even see
30:05
people some people have changed their
30:07
whole character and everything
30:08
because they've been feeding on it and i
30:10
tell people all the time
30:12
don't watch that it's nothing very
30:14
surprised
30:15
and so the thing about half the country
30:18
is
30:18
i know there's governors who have
30:20
compromised their life and compromise
30:22
their whole state
30:23
i don't see how they ever expect to be
30:25
re-elected and some many will lose
30:27
and i'm saying many will lose their
30:29
seats whether it's in the house or
30:32
whether it's uh
30:33
like governors or people like that
30:36
they're going to lose their seat
30:37
because God wants in this time for
30:40
freedom and liberty to abound
30:43
for prosperity to abound he needs it so
30:46
that this
30:46
the message can be taken around the
30:48
world that people can
30:50
build and have places to use that God
30:52
needs for things
30:54
and it's just his time for that wow not
30:57
going
30:57
well and i know people think it's the
30:59
most
31:00
literally there are more that want God
31:04
in this country than those who don't
31:06
want him
31:07
no that's good because a minute ago i
31:09
said 50 50. you're saying it's not 50
31:11
50.
31:12
it is not it's almost like 20 80. really
31:18
well yeah we don't have a voice most
31:20
people unless you have
31:22
if you're watched on youtube or facebook
31:24
you have a voice
31:25
you know if you know in your community
31:27
but as far as the major networks
31:30
none of them want God and they're being
31:33
used by the enemy they don't even
31:34
realize that
31:35
well you know when trump won the first
31:37
time God actually recently talked to me
31:39
about this when God won
31:40
when God uh said trump would win and he
31:43
won
31:44
and he had me actually prophesy that
31:46
many people in the democratic party
31:48
or people who voted you know against
31:51
what God wanted
31:52
they would need psychiatric help and it
31:54
was all over the news
31:56
um they had to go get psychiatric help
31:59
because you know why
32:00
their soul was compromised and they felt
32:02
defeated they felt like they would have
32:04
no life that
32:05
that it was all going to be over because
32:07
you know trump is such a horrible person
32:09
and all those are lies because look what
32:11
he did in our country
32:13
all the millions of jobs and our life
32:16
was so much better because he was here
32:17
and that was God's plan
32:19
well God said the same people if they've
32:22
been feeding themselves
32:23
this next these last four years the same
32:26
lie
32:27
the thing we need to pray about as a
32:29
body is that some of them will not take
32:31
their life
32:32
because you've got that many years of of
32:34
your soul being
32:35
compromised and twisted and trump
32:38
wins they'll think they'll believe what
32:40
the fake news says
32:42
there's no life for you anymore in my
32:45
prayer since he told me that just a a
32:47
couple weeks ago
32:48
that that would happen because um
32:51
they've been told everything bad about
32:53
him
32:54
and about life uh if he was going to be
32:56
here another four years
32:58
and this is the crazy thing even
33:00
psychiatrists know this
33:01
it's a term he's in there for a term
33:04
never
33:04
in the history of our country have
33:07
people
33:10
you know riled up against somebody or
33:12
hated somebody so much and
33:14
plotted and planned against him spoke
33:16
against him every minute of the day
33:19
i don't think the real news i don't
33:21
think cnn i'm just gonna say
33:22
they don't even know what real news is
33:24
anymore because it's biased
33:27
a news person and the reason for the
33:29
network and the news was to make us
33:30
aware of things
33:32
and we decide what to do about it but
33:33
they don't even give you that they tell
33:35
you
33:35
what is truth which is lies really lies
33:38
and so it's hard to get it out if you
33:41
don't know how to lose it from your soul
33:42
which i actually have free
33:44
post election therapy for people i did
33:47
that when
33:48
trump won the last time swallows who
33:50
thought it was all over because they
33:51
believed
33:52
the lies helped them to loose from their
33:55
soul
33:56
God of course and then buying the things
33:58
of God i actually had people show up on
34:00
my meetings and say thank you for
34:01
putting that free post-election therapy
34:03
out there
34:04
because people are going to people are
34:06
going to need it
34:07
even ordinary nice people believed a lie
34:11
and i can tell you the enemy loves
34:13
deception
34:14
but no matter what he tries satan will
34:17
not win that's so good
34:21
let me tell those two people that are
34:22
watching that have never heard Kat does
34:24
have a brilliant
34:25
teaching in fact i'm going to ask you to
34:27
give me a one minute version of
34:29
of uh or one or two whatever uh what
34:32
how a person is uh it's not only the
34:34
election they're struggling in their
34:35
life maybe they're
34:36
unforgiveness tell people let's let's do
34:40
that one unforgiveness how do you
34:42
lose that from your soul so you get some
34:44
freedom from that
34:46
well actually it's the keys to the
34:48
kingdom jesus talked about it he said
34:50
what you loose on earth
34:52
will be loose from heaven that means it
34:54
will be taken
34:56
out of you and you use your will to do
34:58
it it's very simple you just have to
35:00
have an understanding on
35:02
it and then after you loose the jump
35:04
whether it's unforgiveness
35:06
whether it's offense whether it's
35:07
addiction whether it's hate
35:10
or anger issues severe grief
35:14
lack whatever it is in your life that
35:16
you know the enemy is thrown at you
35:18
or you've been living in and you don't
35:19
want it or like the hate thing that's
35:21
going on
35:22
you need to lose that from your soul
35:25
because it says in the bible
35:27
jesus is the restorer of our soul so
35:29
when we choose
35:31
we simply say as an act of my will
35:34
okay now jesus and
35:37
tell him you want him as your savior or
35:40
you're going to have to do it in his
35:41
name anyway because he's the one who
35:43
comes and does this
35:44
i choose as an act of my will
35:48
to lose from my soul all hate
35:52
all unforgiveness all offense
35:56
all fear all addictions
36:00
all sadness all oppression
36:04
uh depression all suicidal thoughts all
36:08
these things are going around
36:09
everywhere right now any of that stuff
36:12
that's
36:12
in you that doesn't belong there you'll
36:15
think about it
36:16
you'll choose it again and display it in
36:19
your emotions
36:20
if you don't get out of your soul and so
36:23
who is all that in jesus name this is
36:26
another important thing
36:28
the bible says once you've cleaned
36:29
yourself out don't leave your soul empty
36:32
you need to say i choose as an after my
36:35
will
36:35
to bind to my soul the life of God
36:40
the presence of God the joy of the lord
36:44
his expectation his plans
36:48
his will his way
36:52
and then you will be totally different
36:55
and say in jesus name that's good
36:59
i i do that after i learned that from
37:01
you
37:02
i think we first moved over on a cruise
37:04
because i make sure i went on the cruise
37:05
with you
37:06
uh but i do that now all the time you
37:08
know several times a week i find myself
37:10
you know i'm
37:11
i'm inundated there's a there's
37:12
unforgiveness about something creeping
37:14
in
37:15
i will say as an act of my will i lose
37:18
unforgiveness and then i'll take
37:19
anything that's related to that
37:20
i hate um judgment that i've judged
37:24
someone i lose
37:25
that whatever it is that i know that i'm
37:27
not walking in the spirit
37:29
i lose that for my soul and then i bind
37:31
to myself it's opposite
37:33
which is love kindness
37:36
forgiveness whatever it relates to that
37:39
and then sometimes i think
37:40
hey while i'm at it why don't i just do
37:42
these things that have been kind of
37:44
i've thought about it very powerful
37:46
because i walk around
37:48
you know there's a scripture that says
37:49
if our hearts don't condemn us
37:51
that's really if our heart condemns us
37:53
God is greater than our heart
37:54
but even if our heart does condemn us
37:56
you know God's there
37:58
my point is i when i do that my heart
38:02
stops condemning me yeah it feels like i
38:05
i'm not i'm not beating myself up
38:06
anymore that's right
38:09
and that's important too because as you
38:11
think about yourself that's what you're
38:13
going to believe
38:15
like the people believe the false stuff
38:18
because they listen to it they listen to
38:19
it so much
38:20
they begin to believe it you need to
38:22
walk free
38:23
of all that stuff especially as a member
38:25
of the body of christ
38:26
we're witnesses and testimonies of jesus
38:30
christ
38:31
and so you shouldn't walk around angry
38:33
or
38:34
sad or filled with fear you know
38:36
especially not
38:37
unforgiveness or offense because it
38:40
begins to eat away
38:41
at you and pretty soon you know people
38:44
might not want to be around you
38:46
when it's our job actually to share the
38:48
good news with people
38:50
i call that and the holy spirit calls
38:52
that by the way he calls it a soul
38:53
checkup
38:55
and i'm more now when i'm out traveling
38:58
if people
38:59
bash me or say hey things to me i will
39:01
immediately lose the very words they
39:03
just said
39:05
my will to lose all the words of hate of
39:08
anger
39:08
of you know um unjust things that they
39:11
have said about me
39:12
i loose it all any sadness that came
39:15
with that
39:16
i loose all of it in jesus name and then
39:20
i will bind
39:21
the love of God to me and his validation
39:24
and his expectation
39:25
and you know what it's like it never
39:28
happened yeah and it feels
39:30
a lot better inside i mean
39:33
as a person that doesn't get to go to
39:35
heaven all the time like you do
39:37
yeah you know i feel like sometimes
39:39
maybe i i have to work a little harder
39:40
because you you're with the hard disk
39:42
you can't be
39:43
unclean but i feel like i'm in on the
39:46
trenches sometimes and then
39:48
but when i do that i feel better
39:51
i don't sell condemn anymore if you're i
39:54
don't say oh i wish i hadn't
39:56
thought that or it's gone you bind to
39:59
your soul whatever it is
40:00
forgiveness who had a trauma let's say
40:03
30 years ago it was a horrific
40:05
trauma you saw something where a part of
40:07
something was very traumatic
40:09
you can lose that trauma from your soul
40:13
because your soul stores everything
40:15
lose the drama you had 23 years ago and
40:18
you won't have nightmares about it
40:20
i mean this has been proven over and
40:22
over again
40:23
uh even witchcraft if you operated in it
40:26
or were involved in any way
40:28
lose that from your soul because that's
40:31
all about control
40:32
it's such a beautiful thing that the
40:35
father actually taught me all of this
40:37
about the keys to the kingdom
40:38
he said i need the body of christ to be
40:40
well and whole
40:42
and excited and he said i don't want
40:44
them to take
40:45
six weeks six months of therapy for them
40:48
to get better
40:49
the main thing is you it says to guard
40:52
your heart in the bible that is your
40:54
soul
40:54
you guard what goes in there if you
40:57
allow things in and it's not God you
40:58
need to lose the money your soul
41:00
so make sure you're doing a soul checkup
41:03
there's stuff
41:03
on my facebook or on youtube you can see
41:06
over 400 hours of video that is on there
41:10
about all different types of subjects
41:12
about heaven but also about how to live
41:14
a powerful life free from darkness
41:18
which is what he needs to rule and reign
41:21
with him if these are greater works days
41:23
that we're in
41:24
yeah then you need to have your soul
41:27
free
41:27
all the time and if your family will do
41:29
that even together or separately
41:32
it'll be a joy to live in your home
41:35
that's good hey Kat tell people how they
41:38
can get your books
41:39
revealing heaven and some of that stuff
41:41
tell them how to get your websites and
41:43
oh yeah we have two websites we have
41:46
revealingheaven.com
41:48
which is where our store is and a lot of
41:51
the
41:51
things that we offer we also have a
41:54
commission from God
41:55
to create things of heaven and put them
41:57
on the earth for example this cup that
41:59
says
42:00
can you imagine going somewhere and
42:01
having this guy it says i don't do
42:03
demons
42:05
now the holy spirit gave me this idea
42:08
said you're not bashing people or
42:09
accusing people
42:10
but you are pointing out that you do not
42:13
involve yourself with darkness
42:15
and so we have other things like this
42:17
for people to
42:18
demonstrate that they're with the sight
42:20
of God and on the side of life and light
42:23
but revealing heaven.com is our one
42:25
website and also you can find out about
42:27
our events there
42:29
and then i have KatKerr.com
42:32
where there's many hours of videos that
42:35
help you
42:36
teach you how to pray for your unsafe
42:38
family members
42:39
how to do what i just talked about
42:43
many other things and some interviews
42:45
people have done over the
42:46
over the years that have been very
42:47
significant and it doesn't cost anything
42:50
to go on there
42:51
or listen to any of that stuff so for
42:54
those of you get these steps
42:55
get on there because Kat spends hours
42:59
describing
43:00
places in heaven this is where you go
43:02
this is what the trees do this is what
43:04
they say or do
43:05
this is you know the plants this is the
43:08
pets who sit at the table with you right
43:12
pets do all go to heaven and people
43:14
tried to argue with me
43:15
and the father said show them the
43:17
scripture in genesis where i told um
43:20
noah to put all the animals on the ark
43:23
that had a spirit of life in them
43:27
is a spirit man and if you go back
43:29
further
43:30
at the beginning of genesis when he made
43:32
adam and adam had no life in his body it
43:35
says God leaned over and
43:37
breathed the spirit of life this is the
43:40
father now the word that would be jesus
43:42
made out of his body but then the father
43:44
leaned over and breathed the spirit of
43:46
life the bible says
43:48
into adam's body and then that's when he
43:51
came alive that was his spirit man
43:53
so he told me to look there and then
43:55
look at where noah so
43:56
there are animals that have a spirit in
43:59
them all of your pets do
44:01
and yes they have a soul or they your
44:03
soul is your mind what you think about
44:05
your will what you choose
44:07
and emotions you display and if they
44:10
didn't have those in them
44:12
like a dog couldn't decide if i wanted
44:13
to eat do i like that person do i want
44:15
to lay over there
44:16
and so knowing about and understanding
44:18
the soul is very key
44:20
and that's why he takes your pets to
44:22
heaven when they die your own guardian
44:24
angel will take your
44:25
pet's spiritual body to heaven and
44:28
they'll be waiting for you
44:30
awesome yeah that reminds me of my a
44:32
number of years ago we had both of our
44:34
dogs were
44:35
you know breathing their last it was a
44:37
very sad time for us
44:39
and i had been sick in those days but my
44:40
wife got stuck with dog duty while i was
44:43
doing a conference and
44:44
during that time she she went from
44:47
because these were the kids dogs
44:49
but the kids had moved on and she went
44:51
from
44:52
being i don't like dog person to loving
44:55
dogs because she said as i fed them
44:57
and i was there with them and the last
44:59
she says i looked into the eyes and i
45:01
looked right into their soul
45:03
and God just flipped the script suddenly
45:06
she was a dog now we're dog lovers
45:08
you know because she looked in and saw
45:10
the soul of this dog
45:12
so God loves animals and you know i've
45:14
had you told that story about rescuing a
45:16
bird online recently and right after
45:19
that like the next day or two
45:21
a friend of mine said hey we rescued it
45:22
was an owl and she went on to describe
45:24
it
45:25
and i said told her that i had just
45:27
heard you do the same thing and i said i
45:29
just thank God
45:30
we put a smile on God's face when we
45:32
take care of his creatures like that
45:34
he does he he of course does not like it
45:37
when
45:38
anyone is abused when life is abused
45:41
it does not because he made this world
45:44
he chose what to put on this world he
45:46
loves the earth actually
45:48
he loves all the different races of the
45:50
earth he wants very much for them to
45:52
know
45:52
him he also cares about the creatures
45:55
it says he knows when one sparrow falls
45:58
to the ground
45:59
and he does care about them and it's
46:01
important for us
46:03
especially if we have been entrusted if
46:06
we have
46:06
pets and they're trusting us and they do
46:09
trust and also says the eyes are the
46:12
window to the soul
46:14
so um she couldn't have described it a
46:17
better way
46:18
you can usually look at the eyes of
46:20
somebody and stay and see
46:22
if there's light or life in them or the
46:24
opposite
46:25
and so i know God does care but he needs
46:29
us as a body of christ to begin to
46:32
um show that we can have a life as a
46:34
believer we can
46:35
have happiness we can have joy we can
46:38
even have
46:39
fun and that's what we need to portray
46:41
to the people in this world
46:43
not that we're sour and angry all the
46:46
time
46:47
but we should care but we also can't
46:49
ever compromise
46:51
our standing with jesus christ
46:54
thank you that's awesome i love i love
46:56
all this teaching i'm glad we i wanted
46:57
to touch on a couple of these things so
46:59
we're going to have you back more often
47:00
now than we've been doing kat
47:02
now as we wrap this up tell people i
47:05
assume you're telling people God's
47:06
chosen trump but we still need to vote
47:08
is that right
47:10
absolutely you have to vote i would
47:13
encourage you
47:14
if any way possible go to the polls
47:17
where you have always voted
47:19
i'm not so uh great on having people get
47:22
the mailing ballots
47:24
and if you have to do it only that way
47:26
you pray over that ballot
47:28
that the enemy will not take it or hide
47:31
or destroy it
47:32
they will go where it's supposed to go
47:35
so that it can count and yes we all do
47:37
need
47:38
to vote but i think people um before
47:41
when they didn't want to wear
47:42
things you know as as a leader and you
47:45
share with people about the darknesses
47:47
out there and what's in the people's
47:48
souls
47:49
they go well yeah maybe but that's been
47:51
made so apparently
47:53
clear especially by the democratic
47:55
governors who think they're dictators
47:57
they're not letting their states open
47:58
they're not people even have church not
48:00
letting them meet anywhere
48:02
they're not letting them do anything and
48:03
that's a good example
48:05
that was in the heart of that governor
48:07
or mayor when you elected them it didn't
48:10
just appear
48:11
okay they already had an agenda and all
48:14
God did was make that very apparent
48:16
and so it's so apparent everywhere in
48:18
the news which mainly has lies
48:21
i tell people if you have to check the
48:23
news channel
48:25
why not every now and then check fox
48:27
news but you can also go to trump's own
48:30
website or you know he also does twitter
48:33
he has a facebook
48:34
and you get all the information you need
48:36
that has truth in it
48:38
and i'm sure another good one to check
48:40
out is kenneth copeland
48:42
ministry and when their elections ran
48:45
last time you could either go to the
48:47
general
48:47
news networks and hear all the stuff
48:49
they kept they kept
48:51
you know forecasting that trump would
48:53
lose but they never
48:55
could show that even on the actual maps
48:58
but
48:58
kenneth copeland who has intelligence he
49:01
had intelligent
49:02
people in the in the government there
49:04
then the whole night of the election
49:07
and he at one in the morning called
49:10
trump as the winner
49:11
but even though he had enough votes and
49:14
enough estates
49:16
the other channels refused to announce
49:18
that he won
49:19
and i remember at 303 a.m
49:22
fox news finally came out and said trump
49:25
is the winner
49:26
he is going to be president of the
49:27
united states because the other ones
49:30
refuse to even mention it so if you want
49:32
to find someone
49:33
kenneth copeland ministries will be
49:35
running his fair true
49:37
election through the whole entire
49:39
process i really want to
49:41
uh i know people who know him and
49:42
actually i've met him several times
49:44
he's filled with truth and excitement
49:46
and expectation
49:48
a great trump supporter also has a lot
49:50
about the historical stuff that's going
49:51
on in our government
49:53
that people have tried to tear about
49:55
apart our forefathers who actually
49:57
started this country
49:58
most every one of them were christians
50:00
and God said
50:02
that i was with them from the beginning
50:04
america is like a gift to this world
50:06
because of the light
50:07
that's in there and the gospel of my son
50:10
has taken
50:11
two thirds of the gospel around the
50:13
world from this country
50:15
wow kat thank you so much i know that
50:18
this is going to be shared and shared
50:20
and shared i do encourage all of you to
50:21
share
50:22
some of those there will be people that
50:25
are not believing that trump's going to
50:27
be uh the next president when either
50:30
before or even after
50:32
some of your friends who are open to
50:34
hearing to say you know
50:35
prophets were telling us that this was
50:37
God's choice and you share this with
50:39
them
50:39
because there's no animosity in this
50:41
video we're not speaking against human
50:43
beings we're not
50:44
dissing anybody God loves people from
50:47
both sides of the
50:48
aisle and he very much wants all to come
50:50
to him

51:12
the beginning of december
51:14

51:17

thank you so a lot of people don't know
01:35
that she can we can see her but she
01:36

01:37
us so she can't even see my tie
01:41
but she's got a bobble head the trump
01:43
bobble head there
01:44
does he bubble yeah
01:48
he's here and he's excited all right
01:51
well kat let's spend a minute or two
01:53
what's on your mind
01:55
yesterday was day one or we could say
01:57
it's ten now this is
01:58
not we're doing the countdown now we're
02:00
at nine what what's on your mind to
02:02
share before we get into the questions
02:04
well this is about the re-election of
02:07
donald trump
02:08
and this is day two and of course i have
02:11
my celebration scarf on everybody i hope
02:13
you're celebrating
02:14
and my vote shirt please remember to
02:17
vote
02:18
but trump is very happy because guess
02:20
what
02:21
only got sworn in
02:24
to the supreme court now we're
02:27
celebrating for
02:28
so many people said that wasn't going to
02:30
happen God was saying it would happen he
02:32
wants anyone he was for life
02:34
and for uh you know for justice liberty
02:36
and freedom that would be
02:38
amy and so we're celebrating with her
02:40
and all of her family
02:42
last night i got to watch it as she was
02:44
sworn in it was powerful
02:46
so of course this is another great
02:48
victory for all of us
02:50
that was wonderful that means we need
02:52
the judges who want
02:53
life so we can just get rid of that
02:55
whole abortion thing
02:57
and abolish it that's definitely on
02:59
God's timeline
03:00
and so i'm here to report about what
03:02
heaven is saying what God himself is
03:04
saying
03:05
about the elections and so like i said
03:08
heaven is having a celebration right now
03:09
because of judgment
03:11
being put in sworn into office and
03:14
that's going to change a lot of things
03:16
is really going to cause a swing uh
03:18
to go for uh for abolishing many
03:20
different things or not allowing things
03:23
i know that she's gonna she promised to
03:25
do her very best to be
03:26
fair and just but she is definitely
03:29
a powerful born again believer so that's
03:32
a great victory already
03:33
before we even get to november 3rd and
03:36
expect more things like that to happen
03:38
because
03:39
on God's timeline this is a time for
03:41
celebration
03:43
it's not a time for fear it's not time
03:44
to prepare for the end
03:46
or for civil war that will never happen
03:50
and i do want to add something because
03:52
the holy spirit is telling me to say it
03:55
that i know some people are having
03:56
dreams and visions about civil war
03:59
you know about cities burning number one
04:03
God is revealing the enemy's plans
04:06
but that does not mean it will happen
04:09
and when people get these dreams they
04:11
don't know how to interpret them
04:13
or they've not received anything from
04:14
God about it you just pray about it
04:16
yourself
04:17
don't just go posting this is to help
04:19
people do not just go post on
04:22
facebook or youtube what you dreamed
04:24
because if people
04:25
don't like it you're going to get a
04:26
million bashes and that's already
04:28
happened to some people
04:30
and the thing is this that stuff is
04:32
never gonna happen this is God's time
04:34
for celebration justice liberty and
04:35
freedom
04:36
and acceleration for the body of christ
04:39
and for his plans
04:41
and you can't have the day of his wrath
04:43
in the day of his power
04:45
in the same timeline it's not going to
04:46
happen so this is a day
04:48
of his son's power where we get to
04:50
operate in it with him
04:52
and so i'm looking forward to justice
04:55
liberty freedom
04:56
and great victories and so that is
04:58
really kind of the report from heaven
05:00
that they're looking forward and i will
05:02
say this in my own
05:04
city they have early voting in many
05:06
different places and my husband actually
05:08
visited each one of the five places
05:10
and the lines were around the building
05:14
wow down the street and those are people
05:18
voting for trump wow
05:21
that is amazing now can't let me just
05:23
ask you straight out because there's
05:24
going to be a bunch of new viewers today
05:26
who are not here yesterday
05:28
so i'm asking you straight out i can see
05:30
your bobble head trump there
05:31
who has God told you is his choice for
05:34
this election
05:36
donald j trump he's never changed that
05:39
he's never changed what he said about
05:41
him since 2015 when he began to speak to
05:44
me about
05:44
it and there's so many hundreds of hours
05:47
of
05:47
on youtube you can go look they're all
05:49
out there uh declaring prophetically
05:52
on behalf of God that he chose trump
05:55
because he knew that he would do what he
05:57
needed done
05:58
he's bulldozing things God doesn't want
06:00
he's clearing the way really well i'm
06:02
either thrown out there for pets
06:04
and i haven't been not talking a lot
06:06
about pence but you'll hear that
06:07
change about two years into president
06:11
trump's term and you'll also see more of
06:13
him because trump will be
06:15
helping him to prepare to be president
06:17
himself for guess what
06:19
from heaven eight years of pants
06:22
i tell people if you don't like all this
06:23
maybe you should move to another country
06:26
God loves everybody but in God's time
06:28
he's going to have his way
06:30
and jesus said pray that my people be
06:32
willing
06:33
and the day of my power and that's the
06:36
days that we're in right now
06:38
so yes donald trump will absolutely win
06:41
the election
06:42
for four more years that's good now
06:45
people just
06:46
especially if you're new but even if you
06:48
were here yesterday we're asking you
06:50
right in there below
06:51
facebook or below youtube if you have
06:53
questions type them out now we'll get to
06:56
those
06:56
or we'll go to that group tomorrow we're
06:59
now working on questions that came in
07:01
from yesterday
07:02
so i'm going to ask the first one
07:06
and then i've got my list here's the way
07:09
i want to ask Kat
07:10
when trump does something that we would
07:14
call
07:14
root or he's in your face or he names
07:17
somebody like
07:18
sleepy joe um
07:21
is God suddenly shocked or disappointed
07:24
that he
07:24
act acts that way absolutely not
07:28
he knows exactly who he's going to pick
07:30
and you all know none of us are perfect
07:32
is that correct but he chooses because
07:36
you know God's seen the beginning in the
07:38
end
07:38
he knows exactly who he needs to do
07:40
those jobs and my mom
07:42
always wants me to remind people if you
07:44
were around during world war
07:46
ii i don't remember his name now the one
07:48
guy that was so
07:50
absolutely so rude but rescued england
07:53
i'm telling you if she was here she'd be
07:55
telling me what his name is some people
07:56
probably already saying what it is
07:57
churchill maybe
07:58
churchill or something like that winston
08:00
churchill let me tell you a lot of
08:02
people
08:02
same kind of personality as trump he was
08:05
a bulldozer he was a bulldog
08:08
and he was not afraid of anything but he
08:10
was not quite polite
08:12
when he spoke to people all used those
08:14
words he probably was less polite than
08:16
trump is
08:18
and uh and yet both of these men
08:21
knew that they had to give themselves to
08:23
a purpose
08:24
greater than their self and winston
08:26
churchill did exactly
08:28
what God appointed him to do he saved
08:31
england
08:31
in world war ii and God likes bold
08:34
personalities and i can tell you this
08:36
passionate people that means they're
08:39
expressive
08:40
they're fierce about what they believe
08:41
in and sometimes you know those people
08:44
maybe go over a line we don't like but
08:47
he's not shocking God at all
08:49
that means it's not necessarily okay but
08:52
you get it with the package
08:54
okay and he is accomplishing everything
08:57
God wants
08:58
and actually this is hilarious the
09:01
angels sometimes will repeat the very
09:03
things that trump say
09:04
like they call him sleepy joe
09:09
himself called well we're just going to
09:10
repeat it since it was said right
09:12
when when God had me prophesying up in
09:15
colorado
09:16
he actually said these words why would
09:19
you pick
09:20
a villain for a president when i have
09:22
already sent you a
09:23
superhero that would be trump wow so you
09:26
want to know what heaven thinks they
09:27
know exactly the heart of every person
09:30
they know the agenda now God loves
09:33
everybody right even the villains he
09:35
loves them he loves us
09:37
who are doing wrong but but and his son
09:40
came to make us all free but you have to
09:42
choose him
09:43
but God also knows who's going to choose
09:46
life
09:46
who's going to represent those unborn
09:48
babies and one thing that's
09:50
high in God's list is you choose life
09:53
you know it says that in the bible
09:54
this day i offer you life and death
09:56
choose life
09:58
well the left is not choosing life i'm
10:00
not choosing life
10:02
now you what you can you said yesterday
10:04
you've been out you stopped counting at
10:06
a thousand or so you've been up to
10:07
having
10:08
thousands of times and here's the
10:11
question i'm going to mix two questions
10:12
together
10:14
do you get to ask any question you want
10:17
or do you have to just wait for what he
10:19
desires
10:20
and the other question that i'm going to
10:22
put with it is people have said have you
10:24
asked God
10:26
um if if we're going to win uh the house
10:28
and the senate now you said yesterday
10:31
um we're not you don't know if we're
10:34
going to win the house
10:36
i just said i didn't know that and no so
10:40
so someone wrote to me and said this
10:43
when
10:44
would you ask Kat when she goes to
10:46
heaven if she would ask the lord
10:49
if we'll win the house and senate how do
10:50
you respond to it to something like that
10:52
the first thing i'm going to say to
10:54
anybody
10:56
who thinks they can just walk off
11:01
to jesus christ or the father
11:04
or holy spirit and think you're going to
11:07
remember
11:08
in your head that question
11:12
all of your questions will be like dust
11:14
standing in front of them
11:16
they are holy they are beautiful beyond
11:19
description
11:20
the wall and the glory and the splendor
11:23
would feel you would feel like you were
11:24
melting into the floor the last thing in
11:26
your mind would be ask them a question
11:30
and i feel the same way even though i go
11:32
often
11:33
i don't choose he takes me but i feel
11:36
like i'm eight years old and no little
11:37
eight-year-old kid's gonna be concerned
11:39
with any of the matters ourselves would
11:42
be concerned
11:43
they're excited to be there they're just
11:45
in love with the father with jesus with
11:47
the holy spirit
11:48
and having you go to get you
11:51
so undone that you never knew there'd be
11:54
exciting and adventurous places there
11:56
i just know he will tell me what he
11:58
feels is real important to say
12:00
but he has an agenda for this country
12:04
to represent heaven on this earth
12:07
and to be a place where you absolutely
12:10
can step into the presence
12:12
of God and i know it's where people talk
12:14
about the american dream
12:16
our country's blessed because of God and
12:18
that's the bottom line
12:20
we mention him in our songs and even our
12:22
our
12:23
official papers his name is written on
12:25
those and
12:26
we're for we're for God in this country
12:29
and that's how we establish it
12:31
who wins and doesn't i know trump is
12:34
going to win
12:34
i know God wants to have an atmosphere
12:37
that will be a lot more productive than
12:39
these last four years that trump has had
12:41
because God has a big list of the things
12:44
that he will shift and change
12:46
and abolish regulations things that we
12:49
never expected would be gone
12:51
and not in the country you will not see
12:53
them anymore hear about them
12:55
your life will become a different type
12:57
of life over these 24 years God has
12:59
planned to be in the white house
13:01
so this is definitely a very key here's
13:04
my key
13:04
this is a key time for all people to
13:08
vote you have to vote you've got to vote
13:11
in our country
13:12
God has his plans and he can impress
13:14
people he can move on people
13:17
and and that has happened before but i
13:19
want you to know that
13:21
all through heaven you will hear angels
13:24
make comments about the fake news
13:26
and here i have my book gonna push it
13:28
for y'all
13:36
[Music]
13:37
everyone in heaven probably has that but
13:40
that one right there
13:41
because that's how they feel about uh
13:44
the news
13:45
service is supposed to be unbiased
13:47
they're supposed to do only that
13:48
give us the news
13:51
turn and they have their own agenda also
13:55
and i've been saying this from the
13:56
beginning somebody
13:58
is going to lose their network because
14:00
they can't change
14:02
stop saying what they're saying against
14:04
the president and against God himself
14:06
you wait to start it's going to happen
14:08
someone's losing their network
14:10
a news network
14:14
now one of the questions that has come
14:16
to me several times in on this paper is
14:20
okay there are some very famous
14:23
televangelists or just evangelists that
14:26
televangelists have sort of a negative
14:27
kind of
14:28
but very famous very highly regarded
14:32
and some of those turned into
14:36
never trumpers or anti-trumpers they
14:38
almost
14:40
hate him they almost at least they
14:42
despise him and they're preaching
14:44
against them and people are asking me
14:47
to ask you what is how does God feel
14:50
about that or how should we feel about
14:54
otherwise highly respected christian
14:57
leaders
14:57
who basically hate trump you know what
15:00
the bible says about that right
15:02
pray for those who are in authority and
15:05
he also says in his word i'm quite
15:06
acquainted with these words
15:08
bless and don't curse i mean it's all
15:10
through the bible especially
15:12
we have us we have a greater
15:13
accountability double accountability as
15:16
leaders in the body of christ because we
15:19
we're supposed to represent God himself
15:21
his son
15:21
holy spirit and even heaven and we're
15:24
supposed to
15:25
that's what we have to put before the
15:26
people they have no right
15:29
and as not good as the other side is i
15:32
don't hate any of them
15:33
i don't hate the people on the left i
15:34
don't even hate the liberals i don't
15:36
hate the
15:37
fake news i know they're going to be
15:38
great accountability with God himself
15:41
because they speak against life to speak
15:43
against you know
15:44
the sanctity of marriage i go down a
15:46
long list with that
15:47
all these things that the bible says
15:49
have nothing to do with
15:51
and don't be a part of them don't
15:53
partake of them and don't participate
15:55
with them
15:55
but when you side with a group of people
15:59
that want to kill
16:00
unborn babies and the sanctity of
16:03
marriage out
16:04
and let children pick what sex they are
16:07
i can assure you
16:08
God is not pleased with that especially
16:11
with his leaders because they're
16:13
standing before the people to speak on
16:15
behalf of God
16:16
and he's saying to me they're not saying
16:18
what i think or what i believe
16:19
what i want well the second question
16:22
this next question
16:23
is kind of like the first question that
16:26
i'll i'll throw it in the mix
16:28
back in my younger days you could be
16:33
a born again believer i'm not saying you
16:35
can't now but i'm saying you could
16:37
easily be in a born-again believer
16:39
whether you were republican or democrat
16:41
it had to do with
16:42
your philosophy of finances and all that
16:45
there was not the spiritual
16:47
component and then prayer was taken out
16:50
of public school
16:51
and that started a whole thing so the
16:53
ques several people have asked this
16:55
question
16:56
um how do we look at
17:02
christians or who say they're christians
17:05
who are absolutely adamant that i'm a
17:08
democrat and they're going to vote
17:09
democrat
17:10
so it's kind of the same kind of
17:12
question how do
17:13
how does God look at that how do we look
17:15
at that when they say they're believers
17:16
but then
17:17
then they they identify with a
17:20
with not pro-life what are your thoughts
17:22
i will say this one of the reasons
17:24
why they are feeling that way is because
17:26
they are watching the fake news
17:28
and it all comes down to your soul it
17:30
really does your soul is very powerful
17:33
it's what you think about and with your
17:35
will you choose it
17:36
those people have chosen with their will
17:38
to go to the left
17:40
and it's hard for you as a person to try
17:42
to talk them out of it
17:43
i would definitely pray God's mercy on
17:46
them that they change their heart that
17:48
they change what they have chosen
17:50
he will hold them accountable and he
17:52
said that to me in the first election i
17:53
will hold them all accountable
17:55
and no one who votes for not lie not to
17:58
have life with the unborn he keeps
17:59
bringing it back to me all the time
18:01
because see these these little babies
18:04
that we all lived in God he chose your
18:06
birth on the earth because he needs
18:08
you here for that so when something
18:11
stops that from happening that is
18:13
absolutely against God's plan some of
18:15
these people he wants to send are highly
18:17
anointed they have a defined
18:19
assignment down here on the earth and
18:21
when man's
18:23
plans which are the enemies it's
18:25
definitely hell's plan
18:27
to get rid of any babies they don't want
18:29
them born on the earth you might be
18:31
someone too powerful
18:32
for hell to handle and in these days
18:35
there's a lot of very key people being
18:37
born
18:38
in the earth and so God is not pleased
18:41
and his word already says what he thinks
18:43
about people
18:44
that would like to take the life of the
18:45
um unborn that would be better for a
18:47
millstone to be i'm going back to the
18:48
word
18:49
a million stone be tied around your neck
18:51
that's a millstone that would grind
18:53
wheat and stuff all about the size
18:54
probably of i don't know a semi almost
18:57
half the size of a semi
18:59
in some places overseas even they grind
19:03
things with it and he said it would be
19:04
better your judgment
19:06
will be better than if that was tied to
19:08
your neck and thrown into the sea
19:10
he does not want babies lives to be
19:13
taken
19:14
and it is called murder in heaven so
19:17
you you're choosing a sign God said
19:20
choose
19:20
life whether you want trump or not if
19:23
you don't like his personality
19:25
uh you should have looked at the
19:26
evidence of what he had already done in
19:28
our country
19:29
and i'm just telling you the left if
19:30
they get in they want to stop
19:32
everything that's being done they want
19:34
to let people from outside this country
19:36
come in with no
19:37
boundaries on them which would be
19:38
terrorists and murderers
19:40
they want to take a lot of your money so
19:42
they can make it this is just truth it's
19:44
the social
19:45
tree you don't even know what socialism
19:46
is people if you're if you're young
19:48
you have no idea what it's like to live
19:50
in a country that takes everything you
19:52
have and then they hand feed you
19:53
but you have no power no authority no
19:56
property and no
19:57
way to defend yourself and these this
20:00
agenda is of hell no matter how you look
20:02
it's a spiritual
20:04
battle and God's not going to lose
20:08
now let me vote other side will be held
20:11
accountable by God
20:13
i want to add i want to have just
20:16
because of time
20:17
pardon me for rushing only because i
20:18
want to get a couple more questions
20:20
but now i'm going to flip this and say
20:23
okay
20:24
we now fully understand that God hates
20:26
abortion
20:27
he calls it murder we also know and i
20:30
think i've heard you teach that those
20:32
who are born go to be with the lord
20:34
yes so among both democrats and
20:37
republicans
20:39
are and or anyone else any are people
20:42
who have had
20:43
abortions in the past and and so
20:47
many of them now regret it deeply
20:50
and they're sorrowful for it talk to me
20:52
about God's attitude for
20:54
the people who have had abortions and
20:56
are now sorrowfully and they feel they
20:58
still carry guilt
21:00
yeah sometimes they have nightmares too
21:02
because the enemy makes sure they do
21:04
all babies when they pass from this
21:06
world they
21:07
all go to heaven every one of them
21:09
there's millions of them
21:10
they know who the parents are they
21:12
actually forgive them for doing that so
21:15
your baby has already forgiven you you
21:17
need to repent for having done that
21:19
when you get to heaven you will get that
21:22
exact
21:23
same baby back they're not going to be
21:25
angry with you
21:26
they've already love you they know who
21:28
the parents are i always tell people if
21:30
you've repented of it
21:32
pick a name for your little baby in
21:33
heaven and God make sure they know that
21:36
their parents
21:37
named them and so you will get your baby
21:40
back
21:40
i have uh prayed with people many times
21:42
about that
21:43
and God showed me five little babies
21:45
looking over a portal from heaven
21:47
and this woman came in the bookstore
21:49
where i was having a book signing
21:51
and she actually came up to me and said
21:53
she repented
21:54
but she had nightmares would i pray with
21:55
her so i had her loose all that from her
21:57
soul
21:58
the nightmares and everything and she
22:00
began to rejoice and i said God said you
22:01
need to name your five babies which
22:03
freaked out
22:04
because i knew there were five she
22:06
hadn't told me there were five
22:08
and when she began to stand in front of
22:10
me and name them i i know they have a
22:12
celebration in heaven God sends for the
22:14
little baby
22:15
he holds on his lap they may be a little
22:18
tiny thing down here but their spiritual
22:20
little body up there
22:21
understands that laughs that plays he
22:23
holds himself and said your mother just
22:25
named you this
22:26
is now your name and everyone in heaven
22:28
will call you by that name
22:29
and they actually have a party for the
22:31
little baby and so
22:33
this is real God's mercy is beyond
22:36
anything of our understanding and so he
22:39
desires them to be reunited
22:42
and your babies want to be reunited so
22:45
even in all our life if we make a mess
22:47
of it down here
22:49
God is always willing christ is always
22:51
willing to forgive those who repent
22:54
and restore you to to him and christ is
22:57
the only way back to the father i'll
22:58
give you that for free
22:59
now when i read that book
23:03
um about rev your book is called
23:05
revealing heavenly God revealing heaven
23:07
one and two and before we're
23:09
done i'll have i'll have you tell people
23:10
how to get that book
23:12
we were on a cruise and you were talking
23:14
about people going to heaven now my wife
23:16
and i had not had abortions
23:18
but we had a miscarriage and you talked
23:20
about miscarriage and that
23:22
they also went to heaven and you talked
23:24
about naming them
23:25
we had never considered the idea so we
23:28
either immediately i can't remember if
23:30
we waited a few days but we
23:32
we agreed on a name and we named
23:35
the baby that was miscarried do you is
23:37
that the way to do it
23:38
do people yeah if you're not sure if it
23:41
was which one male or female
23:43
you can pick a name that could be either
23:45
or there's many names that's what we did
23:47
either or or you pick a little girl's
23:49
name and a little boy's name and
23:50
whichever one
23:51
is whatever it is God will tell them
23:54
that's
23:54
its name that's what we we did we i feel
23:57
it was a girl i think we both think it
23:59
was a girl but we picked
24:01
we picked a name that wouldn't work
24:02
either way and so now
24:04
we have we raised three children who are
24:06
now adults that have given us all
24:08
grandchildren
24:09
but there's a there's a fourth child
24:12
that is
24:13
ours that we have named and when we get
24:16
to heaven
24:17
you have a word about how old these
24:19
children will be
24:21
you know what it depends on usually the
24:23
mother if she wants it to remain a baby
24:25
it will still be
24:26
a baby and some are still babies i'd say
24:30
like you know a nine months
24:31
little baby uh the same age it would
24:34
have been if it had been born
24:35
now these babies have been playing all
24:37
over heaven and with family members in
24:39
heaven
24:39
they're not ever left alone but you
24:41
actually get to see the baby grow
24:43
very slowly and this is the breath the
24:46
best thing
24:47
whatever gift God gave it your your
24:49
natural gifts i'm talking about
24:51
whether it's like a dancer a singer you
24:54
know a designer whatever it is
24:55
a chef whatever um it could be many
24:58
different things
24:59
they still have that gift inside of them
25:01
and as they grow slowly in heaven
25:03
they actually will get to use that very
25:05
gift which is their ultimate destiny
25:07
to bless everybody in heaven and so they
25:10
don't
25:10
they don't they don't miss anything
25:12
except maybe being with you
25:14
but so if if this child uh was to be
25:17
i'm making this up on if this child was
25:20
to be
25:20
a concert pianist who also could play
25:24
other kind of music too
25:25
and that's what his gift was intended to
25:28
be
25:29
you see him or her doing that in heaven
25:31
as well
25:32
yes absolutely positively yes he says
25:35
your gifts are without repentance and he
25:37
won't take them away because his whole
25:39
plan
25:40
the way heaven is designed is that
25:42
everyone gets to use that
25:43
natural gift when they get to heaven and
25:45
that's why there's so many
25:47
things to do in heaven that's because
25:48
everybody's mansion and all the property
25:50
is designed around that gift
25:52
and for free you can go all over having
25:54
to enjoy these people's gifts some have
25:57
like
25:58
host centers like um let's say if they
26:00
were going to be a dancer or they were
26:01
going to teach it
26:02
they have a performance center as part
26:04
of their mansion and everybody
26:06
enjoy it yes or they had rodeos they'd
26:09
have like a thousand horses and ranches
26:11
and people could come and go ahead
26:12
God provides everything so nobody
26:14
actually misses the thing i hear the
26:16
most is my child mr destiny no they did
26:18
not miss their destiny
26:20
because the one who made them and put
26:22
that gift in them they still get to use
26:24
it
26:24
that's amazing well that's our time and
26:27
because we're going to do 10 of these in
26:29
a row we won't go
26:30

02:33
amazing

02:36
mean we we saw your
02:37
five-minute video what what were you
02:39
able to do there
02:41
if it's not too secret i did get to me
02:44
no
02:44
it's fine i got to meet a lot of people
02:47
that were
02:47
around in the area and of course it
02:50
didn't matter where i went
02:52
i got to talk about trump and when i
02:55
talk to people about him i act like they
02:56
already want him so it makes it much
02:58
easier for me
03:01
he had a positive report i met people on
03:03
the plane in the airports it didn't
03:06
matter where i was
03:07
i was continually campaigning and
03:10
talking about
03:11
trump and God and every person whether
03:13
they worked in the airport
03:14
on the airplanes over or flying or just
03:18
in the area in capitol hill
03:20
they were all excited about trump which
03:23
shows you
03:23
wow the fact that the majority really is
03:26
for him but it was very powerful
03:27
we saw another camera crew all set up
03:30
between we were like so between
03:32
um the supreme court and capitol hill
03:35
which
03:35
there was so much power of God people
03:38
have been coming there doing meetings
03:40
prayer meetings um all kinds of things
03:43
about the campaign
03:44
on behalf of trump and you could feel
03:47
the presence of God but not just feel
03:49
that the angels were all over in the sky
03:52
they were around every single building
03:54
there
03:55
and so it was it was really powerful
03:57
atmosphere so we did our broadcast
04:00
and right after that this reporter came
04:02
up and said can i interview you i just
04:04
heard you talk about trump winning
04:06
and he was from iraq is that really
04:09
a christian group from iraq and he said
04:12
the people in iraq
04:14
love trump he represents freedom and
04:17
justice of course they don't always like
04:19
their own leadership
04:20
but they're certainly for him and so we
04:23
got
04:23
interviewed talking about God's plans
04:25
for america and for trump
04:27
and now that's in iraq so you never know
04:30
set up as a divine appointment totally
04:33
hey that reminds me
04:34
Kat um i forgot the other day
04:37
you didn't say a word about it but i
04:39
forgot to ask people
04:41
to tell people how to get a hold of you
04:43
and i do want people to support your
04:44
ministry
04:46
so i'll do this early in the show so i
04:48
don't forget at the end
04:49
how do people contact you and do you
04:53
take donations or do you mainly just
04:55
sell your
04:56
your books how do you how do you work
04:58
that we have two different
05:00
sites because uh God had me established
05:04
as a business on purpose his son came as
05:06
a carpenter
05:07
you know paul was in the fabrics and
05:10
stuff like that God can use business
05:11
people they can go
05:12
places maybe not a licensed minister can
05:16
and i didn't get invited many places so
05:18
we have revealingheaven.com is where you
05:21
go to find
05:21
all the products and the rev on some of
05:24
the revelation on heaven
05:25
it's where you go to set up events or
05:27
see events
05:29
but if you go to KatKerr.com that has
05:32
free with no cost hours of revelation on
05:36
how to live your life how to declare
05:38
over others
05:39
how to understand the spirit realm how
05:41
to rule
05:42
and and that's the only place online you
05:45
can actually give to me
05:46
because you can't give to my business
05:49
and expect me to receive that i can't do
05:51
that
05:51
but you can go to Kat Kerr.com click on
05:54
the
05:55
treasury it takes you and tells you all
05:57
about the guardian zone
05:58
those are my monthly supporters which
06:01
i'm so grateful for
06:02
you can become a guardian they guard the
06:04
treasure the revelation that God has put
06:06
in me
06:07
so this is two different places out
06:09
there that you can get all kinds
06:11
especially Kat Kerr.com it's God's
06:13
platform to say whatever he wants to
06:15
that's right whenever he wants to so
06:17
those are the two main places
06:19
that's good so so back to dc you were in
06:22
were you praying were you
06:23
decreeing were you what what were you
06:25
there for
06:28
we were there you've already announced
06:30
that
06:31
that trump was gonna win so why were you
06:34
there
06:35
it had to be done in washington d.c
06:38
absolutely
06:39
it is the seat of our government that's
06:41
a whole different spiritual atmosphere
06:44
and what has been posted there and
06:45
people need to understand
06:47
when you have your feet on the ground
06:50
you really can take authority and
06:52
dominion i will remind you all
06:54
when christ stopped the storm where was
06:56
he he was
06:57
in the storm uh that is a significantly
07:01
um spirit realm truth you need to
07:03
understand
07:04
so when you're there if you live in a
07:06
certain area and something's coming
07:08
against you you have
07:09
great authority in the spirit realm to
07:10
take it down and
07:12
declare not to tolerate it or to invite
07:15
heaven places
07:16
and he actually had me going on purpose
07:19
and i was between the supreme court and
07:20
capitol hill
07:21
where most of the business is done on
07:23
behalf of our country
07:25
and release those words into the
07:27
atmosphere
07:28
into the buildings into the very ground
07:30
that was there
07:31
that God had chosen trump that he would
07:34
win he would
07:35
sit in the white house for another four
07:36
years and those words go out like
07:39
streaks of light in the spirit realm and
07:41
they pierce the darkness around there
07:43
so that was my number one assignment to
07:45
release those words
07:46
right there because i represent heaven
07:49
on earth
07:50
and i'm actually wearing heaven colors
07:51
today because i represented heaven the
07:53
other day
07:54
on behalf of our country and so that was
07:57
very significant
07:58
but because of obedience we were able
08:01
without any knowledge
08:02
to be put on iraqi tv to lose people who
08:06
want to see trump win and they are all
08:09
actually praying for him
08:11
it was just it was a it was an amazing
08:13
event and so i did what God had asked me
08:16
to do
08:16
and the ground now has seeds of victory
08:20
those were seeds of victory words of
08:21
victory have to be released in the area
08:24
because there's so much conflict in the
08:25
area
08:26
they were literally boarding up some of
08:28
the buildings getting ready for whatever
08:30
they thought would happen or might not
08:31
happen
08:32
on the election and so we got to declare
08:35
over
08:36
all of that which was very powerful in
08:38
the spirit realm
08:40
now we have some questions and um if
08:42
you're ready for those
08:44
we have had some people say couldn't you
08:47
do more on the election
08:48
and we've had other people say couldn't
08:50
you do more on heaven
08:52
so it's a little bit hard to to do
08:56
both of those but we've done some things
08:58
on the election you've absolutely said
09:00
that God has chosen trump for another
09:02
four years
09:03
he's going to be elected my first
09:04
question involves
09:06
that and that and here's what i want to
09:09
ask
09:10
even if trump is elected let's say he's
09:12
even elected with a wide margin
09:14
for or you tell me my question is
09:17
are you saying and and i haven't asked
09:20
this before so
09:21
so i'm asking it for the first time are
09:24
you saying there will be no
09:25
chaos after the election
09:28
i wouldn't call it chaos chaos is a
09:31
whole different thing
09:32
chaos is uh absolute havoc you have no
09:36
control over chaos
09:38
so the word probably isn't chaos that
09:40
you're looking for
09:41
there definitely will be some
09:42
disruptions of course there can be
09:44
unhappy people that are in the flesh
09:47
uh especially on the left or people who
09:49
have already they've already been paid
09:51
they've already made plans to do some
09:53
destruction
09:54
and to cause disruptions and anger but
09:57
it can't stop him from winning
09:59
i i'm not saying that won't happen
10:01
because it happened in the last one
10:03
but i will say this that trump is much
10:06
more better
10:06
prepared for it and he can't tell
10:09
everybody everything
10:10
so i can let you know this he's much
10:12
wiser
10:13
about how these people react because
10:15
before he thought everybody would be
10:17
happy and celebrate
10:18
he thought when the election was over
10:19
they would drop it but but satan doesn't
10:22
just drop things he will
10:23
he will drag things out as long as he
10:24
can nothing they try or do
10:28
whether it's in washington d.c we
10:30
already posted more
10:31
the army was sent there probably about a
10:32
million more of the hosts were posted in
10:35
that whole area
10:36
if that stuff starts it will not
10:39
continue
10:40
very long so i wouldn't call it chaos
10:43
uncontrolled stuff i would say he's well
10:46
prepared
10:47
trump is well prepared now for anything
10:49
that might rise up like that when that
10:51
stuff's going on
10:52
it will not stop people from celebrating
10:55
from having great victory
10:57
even if it drags over into the fourth
10:59
for whatever that happens
11:01
if the voting thing takes that long to
11:03
decide
11:04
nothing they come up with if you want to
11:06
remember gore bush
11:08
when they had to do all the recount
11:09
florida it took like a week and a half
11:11
before they actually finally had to say
11:14
that bush won
11:15
and yet God all along was saying i'll
11:17
have a burning bush in the white house
11:18
and they announced the night of the
11:20
elections
11:21
that gore had won which was totally
11:23
wrong and our people call me i said no
11:25
bush is winning God wants him so
11:28
regardless of what you see on the tv and
11:30
i'm sure the fake news
11:32
will embellish it and make it look
11:33
greater and worse than it is
11:35
but trump is well prepared this time
11:38
to adopt to that stuff that's cool i
11:41
just have to tell you you must remember
11:44
that the left lie they lie and they lie
11:46
big they've gotten really good at it
11:48
and because they control the media they
11:50
can show images
11:51
even from past times and they have done
11:54
that
11:55
all violence and all this other stuff
11:57
breaking out don't participate
11:59
in it that's the biggest thing you keep
12:01
celebrating do not participate by having
12:03
fear
12:04
or thinking you have to run out there
12:05
and shoot some people i'm sure that
12:07
that would love to do that rednecks just
12:10
hold it back if they come
12:12
what you have to do but but this is the
12:14
thing you don't participate with fear
12:17
and don't participate with violence
12:18
because the only ones who've been doing
12:20
violence
12:20
are the ones who were paid for it
12:22
they've already received
12:24
their orders they've already been paid
12:25
for their jobs they don't realize this
12:27
time there's someone collecting
12:29
names so i would say you get on this God
12:33
keeps saying i'm on a spirit of
12:34
celebration
12:35
in your hearts even before november
12:37
third comes if it goes into the fourth
12:39
just keep celebrating because we have
12:42
great victory in this day
12:44
that's good now you talk about and i'm
12:46
always aware that there's new people
12:48
joining every day who
12:49
they've not heard some of the
12:51
terminology in heaven there's many
12:53
beings many types of beings there's
12:55
angels and everybody thinks
12:57
all those things flying around are
12:59
angels but there's
13:00
also a great heavenly host and the
13:03
heavenly host was there
13:04
if that's the same word at the birth of
13:07
christ and i don't know if those are
13:08
angels of the host but the
13:10
heavenly hosts are the armies of heaven
13:12
that's why jesus is the captain
13:15
of the host and you are saying that God
13:18
has told you that we are to send
13:21
the whole art that is the soldiers
13:25
the soldiers of heaven uh the armies of
13:28
heaven
13:29
to fight our battles is that about right
13:31
how would you say that that is
13:33
absolutely right and you're also correct
13:35
about the terminology
13:36
in heaven there's very distinct ways
13:39
they talk about the army
13:40
the army is called the host and
13:43
that's what they want to be called the
13:45
angels now they're all
13:47
tribes they're tribes of beings that God
13:49
made they're all divine beings
13:51
they're not immortal they are eternal
13:54
i'll explain that another day when we
13:55
have one of our other broadcasts
13:57
but there they all belong to God he made
14:00
them
14:00
and he made them for purposes they're
14:03
made in tribes
14:04
the most of the tribes are under gabriel
14:06
one-third of the tribes are under
14:07
gabriel they're the cursed angels
14:09
messenger angels they look like you and
14:11
i with wings
14:12
they look more like humans but the army
14:15
God designed them and made them
14:17
fierce many of them look like lions they
14:19
look like creatures
14:21
creatures of good work creatures are
14:23
talked about in the bible
14:24
like the living creatures they didn't
14:26
look like you and i
14:27
they had eyes in their bodies some of
14:29
them had more than one head
14:31
you have to think of God as the creator
14:33
he made the army to look
14:34
fierce because their whole reason was to
14:37
fight the satanic
14:39
armies and he made them before there
14:41
were satanic armies he's well prepared
14:43
ahead of time
14:44
and they are very fierce looking and
14:47
i've
14:48
seen many of them and yes actually in
14:50
this time
14:52
they are one of our mighty weapons you
14:54
know what the word says your weapons
14:56
that's a plural are not natural they are
14:59
not physical they are spiritual
15:01
they i will say they not yet
15:05
they are muddy to the pulling down the
15:07
strongholds good
15:09
we declare we command we command
15:12
we command and then they go hold down
15:15
the strongholds but if you don't have
15:16
jesus in you you're not going to get
15:18
anything okay
15:19
you must be living according to the word
15:21
the word the
15:22
jesus christ christ in you the hope of
15:25
glory
15:26
they hearken unto the word of the lord
15:28
and that's what it says about the army
15:30
in heaven he was the lord of hosts he
15:31
was over
15:32
all the armed armies and as joint ear
15:35
i know you have this hard to understand
15:38
but in this time
15:39
one of our greatest weapons we have will
15:41
be the army of heaven
15:42
and i send them by the millions into
15:44
places where violence is taking place
15:47
the demonic is over every bit of
15:48
violence even though people acted out
15:51
you remove them you remove them send the
15:53
army to
15:54
shred platforms they're ruling from put
15:56
on strongholds they've built the spirit
15:58
and it renders the satanic army harmless
16:02
wow now let me ask you this Kat so
16:06
you're in dc yesterday i know you i know
16:09
you
16:09
sent the host i know you sent millions
16:11
of them God's entrusted
16:13
millions because he knows you'll send
16:15
them out they're not unemployed they're
16:17
employed because you're willing to send
16:19
them out
16:20
so give me a quote of how you would word
16:23
it
16:23
when you send out a what did you do
16:26
yesterday how did you send that host
16:28
yesterday the thing everybody has to
16:29
remember is none
16:31
of the angels or the hosts have been
16:34
given power
16:35
over the enemy we have the right to rule
16:38
we are the ones who get to rule uh the
16:40
only reason these wicked spirits rule is
16:42
because we let them get away with it
16:44
we have flesh in our body we were made
16:47
by God to be over this earth
16:49
so you have to have flesh on you and you
16:51
have to understand jesus christ
16:53
said to us who are redeemed i give you
16:56
power over all the power of the enemy
16:58
that's very significant
17:00
anytime i send them i'm standing in
17:02
front of capitol hill
17:04
and i say these words i take power over
17:07
all the power of the enemy trying to
17:08
mess with the election
17:10
harvesting destroying lying
17:13
about ballots bringing violence into the
17:16
streets
17:16
violence against the buildings i take
17:18
power over all that
17:19
i command the army of heaven to come and
17:22
shred
17:23
the planes of the enemy expose every
17:27
wicked thing being done behind closed
17:29
doors or openly
17:30
that would bring the violence or pay for
17:32
the violence i want it totally exposed
17:34
go host make toast to the enemy's plans
17:37
and i've been saying a number i want one
17:39
million of you to do that and i see
17:42
these beams of light shoot out and other
17:44
people who've been around me see it
17:46
that's the host of going immediately
17:49
because see satan's already set up his
17:51
territory he thinks it's his in
17:52
washington
17:53
they begin to pull that stuff down
17:55
before election day
17:57
comes wow and it will make it a lot less
18:00
anything going on they had planned will
18:03
be minimized
18:04
that's why it's important to be
18:06
somewhere to do that
18:08
that's really really good well let's get
18:10
into a couple of other questions
18:11
this is the most common one i've gotten
18:14
other than what i've already said
18:15
and that is you you know i said
18:18
yesterday
18:19
or the last time we talked uh Kat are
18:22
you saying
18:23
you sit down with the creator of the
18:25
universe and you sit down on
18:27
and talk with him face to face your
18:29
stand or whatever
18:30
face to face and people are saying well
18:32
wait a minute
18:33
the bible says you cannot see his face
18:36
and live so talk to me about that
18:38
then i have another scripture that you
18:39
need to start saying after that okay i
18:42
know who said that
18:43
john the disciple the beloved the one
18:46
who was the closest to jesus he was like
18:48
glued to him most of the time john had
18:51
encounters no other disciple had
18:53
because of his um intimacy with him
18:56
because of the love he had the obedience
18:58
he had
18:59
he got more revelation than the others
19:01
did so john
19:03
knowing what what it said john himself
19:06
said no man can see the face of God and
19:08
live
19:08
however i have news for you if you've
19:12
ever read revelation 4 where it talks
19:14
about where john was
19:15
in the spirit that's a place in that
19:18
time today
19:19
john was in the spirit on the lord's day
19:22
that meant his focus was in the spirit
19:24
realm he was listening and he heard a
19:26
voice
19:27
remember come on saw a door open
19:30
remember and guess what he went up
19:32
because he had focused himself and
19:34
prepared himself for that when he was
19:36
caught up
19:36
he saw the throne that was the father on
19:39
the throne
19:40
okay he describes him his eyes
19:44
the rainbow was coming around him life
19:47
was flowing in
19:48
this was God the father saying you can
19:50
see my face
19:51
and live when you belong to my son when
19:54
you receive christ
19:55
that puts you in another whole category
19:57
your name is written in the lamb's book
19:59
of life
19:59
all your sins are wiped away it gives
20:01
you entrance to come
20:03
to the father and then so this is the
20:06
scripture you use now
20:08
john himself changed what he would say
20:10
before
20:11
and the opening would tell people i saw
20:13
him
20:14
so that means you can see him that's
20:16
true
20:17
he did describe his eyes his face his
20:21
his hair was like that was not jesus
20:24
christ jesus doesn't have the rainbow
20:25
coming in and out of him he's got
20:27
he looks like a million diamonds okay
20:30
he's got power coming from him
20:32
but the father is the only one who has
20:34
the living rainbow coming
20:36
out of him he describes him and that
20:39
changed john forever knowing wow
20:41
i've got to start changing what i'm
20:42
saying so everybody if you're a believer
20:46
you can see the face of God and live and
20:48
it's not my choice
20:49
they catch me up i'm in heaven
20:52
i've been before the throne many times
20:54
i've been in other places with the
20:56
father
20:57
he shares plans with me it says he
20:58
delights to share his secrets with his
21:01
children
21:01
in the bible so all this is very
21:03
scriptural
21:04
yes i've been in the presence of holy
21:06
spirit i've seen jesus
21:08
many times even from when i was four
21:10
years old
21:11
i would see christ and he would speak to
21:13
me and so
21:15
you're part of a family now when you're
21:17
born again everything
21:18
changes you're a new creation that new
21:21
creation he makes us
21:23
we have the ability to see him don't
21:26
argue
21:26
just say God i'm ready when you're ready
21:29
that's it
21:29
hey now i i didn't study this but this
21:32
is from memory but it was
21:34
i believe it originally was moses where
21:36
he said you can't see my face and live
21:38
so i'm gonna you have to watch my behind
21:41
parts or whatever
21:42
but didn't he later say but moses
21:46
i speak with face to face yes he did
21:49
and i loved it that was the other one
21:52
that was going to use
21:53
also yes because miriam remember miriam
21:56
and
21:56
aaron were grumbling and complaining
21:58
about moses
22:00
who does he think he is why does he
22:01
think he is the only one who can see God
22:03
and God came down and called them out of
22:06
the meeting
22:07
and corrected them when i meet with
22:10
moses
22:10
i don't do it in secret i don't do it in
22:12
a cloud i
22:13
meet with him face to face that was the
22:16
God of heaven and earth
22:18
there you go that was even before jesus
22:20
was here
22:21
because he was counted to be righteous
22:24
because of
22:25
moses's faith he was counted righteous
22:28
of course she eventually received christ
22:30
everybody does
22:32
but yes you're correct he did say that
22:34
and so that's another scripture that
22:36
says
22:36
what God desires and what God approves
22:40
of
22:40
he's God he's going to make it possible
22:44
so i can tell you there's other people
22:46
who signed too you know isaiah
22:48
ezekiel ezekiel especially he saw the
22:51
throne with the living creatures he saw
22:53
it moving
22:54
he saw the the i can't go into the side
22:56
of it but he saw that wheel within the
22:58
wheel come
22:59
out of the creatures and they moved the
23:01
throne with the father on it
23:03
so he saw him so this is that's really
23:07
he's good he wants you just say yes to
23:09
him well i get a lot of questions about
23:12
i've had a lot of questions about um how
23:15
trump's reelection is going to affect
23:17
europe but guess which country
23:19
and people say well what does he say
23:20
about this country or that country and i
23:22
know you
23:22
God may not tell you about any country
23:24
he may tell you about everyone but the
23:26
only one
23:27
or the main one that keeps being
23:29
mentioned i'm just going to throw it out
23:30
there
23:31
i keep getting this question what is God
23:33
saying about new zealand now you may
23:36
know nothing about what God's saying
23:37
about new zealand but i'm going to throw
23:39
it out to you
23:41
i will tell you this there are places
23:43
for whatever reason God has chosen
23:45
he called me up one time and showed me
23:47
his space planning and he called it
23:49
space planning
23:51
a grid around the earth by the way
23:53
people it's round not flat i always have
23:55
to say that
23:56
he put a grid around the earth and some
23:59
of these places were highlighted and he
24:01
said
24:01
great revival will come here the
24:03
habitation the glory will come from here
24:06
i will have these people raise the dead
24:08
he has made plans already
24:10
about this earth new zealand was
24:13
highlighted i can tell you other places
24:14
california was highlighted people
24:17
vegas was highlighted to become a region
24:19
of light uh
24:20
florida of course one of the reasons why
24:22
i'm here there are many places in
24:24
america God will create
24:25
regions of light and by the way we live
24:28
the things we
24:29
choose carrying his glory uh
24:32
not participating with sin or the enemy
24:34
of any way new zealand is powerful and
24:36
you can tell countries that keep
24:38
getting attacked yeah the reason the
24:41
enemy attacks them is because he is
24:43
afraid of what they will become even
24:46
germany was called to carry the glory
24:48
that's why satan picked it for hitler
24:50
that doesn't mean everybody there liked
24:52
him and so i
24:54
and i know other countries depict he's
24:56
picking vietnam for greatness he's
24:58
picking
24:58
uh the uk of course of course england
25:02
and all those other countries in there
25:03
that did great things for God
25:05
he has a plan and it's right now he's
25:09
he's touching the hearts of leaders to
25:12
shape nations
25:13
and one of the people who's using to do
25:14
that is guess who it's trump
25:16
and i know even the iraqi person we
25:19
talked to the other day
25:20
said they want trump to visit their
25:23
country to help them
25:25
this isn't a leader this is a people
25:27
people people people
25:28
and these countries recognize that he
25:30
can bring hope
25:31
for their country and they know he's not
25:33
tolerating evil
25:34
so that God did that on purpose to make
25:37
him stand out
25:38
so he will help to help because of his
25:40
authority and his knowledge
25:42
he will help to shift the leaders of
25:44
governments and God can then shake that
25:46
nation i know brazil is definitely one
25:49
there's quite a few of them actually
25:50
that maybe some we don't even know about
25:53
i know panama is going to be used
25:56
greatly by God oh
25:58
wow well okay so
26:01
that's amazing stuff i i i got more than
26:04
i was expecting very good
26:05
lots of countries okay so here's a this
26:08
i thought this was a good question
26:10
i've thought of this in my own words so
26:13
i'm going to go ahead and ask it
26:15
it says Kat says our relatives in heaven
26:17
wishes happy birthday
26:19
every year that's awesome but does that
26:22
mean they in heaven are aware of the
26:26
passing of time
26:27
on earth they have no time in heaven
26:32
it's a whole different way you live your
26:34
life
26:35
they realize events take place and God
26:38
does count time it counts time by events
26:41
we count it by our clock by our
26:42
calendars i'm not saying God doesn't use
26:44
him sometimes but he himself on his
26:46
own timeline has events that are major
26:50
events and when events happen
26:51
things happen in the spirit realm and on
26:54
the earth
26:55
they're aware that it is our birthday
26:57
and
26:58
they will go to the a portal in heaven
27:00
where they can sit down and see us they
27:01
will actually sing happy birthday to you
27:02
this is the greatest thing
27:04
they go get a gift in heaven there's so
27:06
many gifts to give
27:07
and to keep for people and they put it
27:09
in your mansion so
27:11
every year you were apart they will have
27:14
a gift for you when you arrive in heaven
27:16
wow
27:17
i got to ask you this you said this once
27:20
and i thought
27:20
really and it was the good really but i
27:23
thought would God do that okay
27:25
because things of this earth are dim and
27:28
less than
27:29
you said once this was years ago i heard
27:32
you say
27:33
God loves you so much he will even take
27:35
some of your favorite
27:37
photos that were on your wall and he'll
27:39
put it in your mansion in heaven is that
27:41
true
27:41
that is absolutely true and my
27:45
gift is actually not the stuff i'm doing
27:47
this is the commission
27:48
my gift is a photographer i was sent
27:51
from heaven
27:51
as a photographer it is my passion and
27:54
when he
27:55
called me to do this i i didn't have
27:57
time to go take photographs and i'll
27:59
look at things all the time and
28:00
i was hoping that i would get a picture
28:02
of that and so the lord came and said
28:04
every time you want to take a picture
28:07
you will just say
28:08
make sure you get that and i have and
28:10
then
28:13
yeah but but he does that for anyone if
28:15
you have very favorite things like a
28:18
favorite photograph especially
28:19
everyone has a gallery in their home
28:23
and i was taken to someone's gallery
28:25
that was
28:26
alive on the earth and they had only had
28:28
one son
28:30
who actually went ended up by in being
28:32
in heaven but i saw
28:34
in the gallery with his mom and dad
28:36
other
28:37
children that would be born so he has
28:40
some pictures already there
28:42
of those who will be on the earth with
28:44
these different families so
28:45
God is God if you have something special
28:48
and precious he has some way to make it
28:50
even more special for you
28:52
in heaven wow let's finish with this
28:55
question
28:55
we're out of time today but let's talk
28:58
about you mentioned it a minute ago
28:59
about
29:00
the portals of heaven is there one
29:03
main portal are there millions of
29:05
portals and
29:06
our rel you said our relatives get to
29:09
watch
29:10
us is this because they're the great
29:12
cloud of witnesses do they only watch
29:14
events
29:15
and then they go back to heavenly things
29:18
um
29:19
i've thought about our children being
29:21
born then our grandchildren being born
29:23
and
29:23
weddings do they get to see these things
29:28
they don't miss any significant day in
29:30
your life on the earth
29:32
whether it's uh you know when you're
29:34
married they'll see every
29:36
they see all the weddings they see all
29:38
the babies being born they already know
29:39
who your baby is they know the name of
29:41
your baby
29:42
uh God's shown them a lot of your future
29:45
actually when they go to heaven
29:47
but they don't miss anything significant
29:49
even if it's a raise in a job or for
29:51
something you really
29:51
have been wanting and you get that thing
29:53
and you're celebrating they will
29:54
celebrate from heaven
29:56
and the scripture he's talking about is
29:58
hebrews 12
29:59
1. because there's such a great cut of
30:02
witnesses
30:03
round about us guess what a witness can
30:06
see in here
30:07
people argue all the time they're up
30:08
there they don't know what we're doing
30:10
that is not true they can see you they
30:12
can hear you
30:13
and sometimes they're right near you
30:15
sometimes they're watching from these
30:17
beautiful places in heaven
30:19
uh they're in my books in revealing
30:20
heaven you can see one of them
30:22
they're also though and in the throne
30:25
room there's this massive wall you can
30:26
walk up to and see things when you go to
30:29
that
30:29
and you think of your loved one you can
30:31
see them on the earth they don't see
30:34
horrific things happening to you they
30:36
don't they don't see you being crushed
30:38
or
30:38
killed or stuff like that but they do
30:40
know the day they do know that you'll be
30:42
coming home they know when
30:43
they they find that out too and these
30:45
places called the portal
30:47
so they're not kept from you or your
30:49
life
30:50
they're declaring the will of God over
30:52
you on your birthday they will go and
30:54
sing
30:55
over you they'll sing happy birthday and
30:57
then you throw these beautiful petals
31:00
from these vases
31:01
they look like rose petals and it's
31:03
peace or joy and they'll throw them down
31:05
in the spirit and they will fall around
31:07
you and sometimes
31:08
you feel somebody really close that's
31:11
probably where they're at they're
31:12
watching you declaring but these rose
31:14
petals when they throw them down
31:15
over you it brings like the presence of
31:17
God
31:18
and either joy or peace to you so
31:21
heaven is very amazing wow
31:24
so let me uh well that's a part of me
31:27
for interrupting
31:28
um when uh final question i gotta ask
31:31
this
31:32
so when they see us or maybe even when
31:34
they're not seeing us
31:36
are our loved ones i'm gonna make this a
31:39
dual question
31:40
our loved ones praying for us
31:44
and how do we if so and i don't know the
31:48
answer because i'm not sure i've heard
31:49
you talk about this
31:50
if they're praying to the father in the
31:52
name of jesus for us
31:54
how is that different than people saying
31:56
mother mary
31:57
will you pray and they're praying to the
31:59
mother of jesus
32:00
talk about that well another one they're
32:03
not praying to mary
32:06
no one in heaven prays to mary okay it
32:09
is perfectly okay
32:10
for anyone in heaven and it's really a
32:13
conversation they'll actually go have a
32:15
conversation with the father
32:16
have a conversation with jesus they live
32:18
there with them
32:19
it's not like they have to be on the
32:21
earth and pray up somewhere they're
32:22
there with them they will just go and
32:24
talk to them
32:25
i i'm really you know um i'm excited
32:28
about the blessings you're bringing to
32:29
my loved one
32:30
i would love them be consumed by your
32:32
presence i thank you remind me to see
32:35
the activities of holy spirit around my
32:37
love on the angels that are around them
32:39
so they have more assurance that they
32:41
know what they declare and pray for
32:43
heaven
32:44
from heaven is what God would want for
32:46
them
32:47
and he's always wanting to bless us so
32:49
yes people in heaven is certainly okay
32:51
for them
32:52
they're praying to the father son and
32:53
holy spirit who are God right so yes
32:56
they do that all the time
32:57
and and God loves it when they come and
33:00
remind reminding you that my loved one
33:02
is out there
33:03
uh preaching the gospel or helping
33:05
people to loving people
33:07
would you please bless them and that
33:09
happens a lot and sometimes you get an
33:11
unexpected blessing or suddenly it's
33:14
probably because your family members
33:16
before the throne of God
33:18
saying i love them i know you love them
33:19
but they're doing all this for you
33:21
it would be amazingly wonderful if you
33:24
could give them a gift
33:25
now i just remembered i said one more
33:27
but i just remembered one that i don't
33:29
think made it on my list but i read it
33:31
and they wanted to know they said you
33:33
know Kat said we do
33:35
our occupation or not that we do it for
33:38
money but the things
33:39
we do relate to what we did on earth but
33:43
they said well what do people like
33:45
doctors
33:47
and lawyers and chiropractors do in
33:50
heaven
33:51
since there's no need for those i mean
33:54
that may be too
33:55
big of a question but i'll throw it out
33:57
to you
33:58
actually there is a big difference
34:00
people have a job
34:02
or they have a position they have
34:04
whatever you want to call it
34:06
is something you do for your living and
34:08
sometimes you just want to help people
34:10
and like a doctor that's not the kind of
34:12
gift he's talking about
34:13
no their gift would be a passion he gave
34:15
them maybe they do art on the side
34:18
and you don't know that or something
34:19
that they love to do for fun
34:21
that's their gift their natural gift he
34:24
gave them
34:25
and in heaven you get to use that gift
34:27
to bless everybody the doctors they
34:29
don't need doctors they don't need
34:30
lawyers they don't
34:31
need policemen um a lot of the military
34:34
people who go to heaven sometimes
34:35
they're actually tour guides which
34:37
they love because they're still giving
34:38
people directions or helping them or
34:40
some of the police do that
34:42
but know there's things you just don't
34:43
need in heaven your job that you work
34:46
every day is not what you will
34:47
be doing in heaven unless you're one of
34:49
the blessed people if you're meant to be
34:51
an artist you're an artist
34:52
that passion you will get to continue in
34:54
heaven but
34:55
most people are delighted maybe they
34:57
were supposed to be a concert pianist
34:59
and heaven you have a mansion with a
35:00
concert hall you have
35:02
grand pianos you can teach it if you
35:04
never did it here but he put it in you
35:06
you'll get to use it there i do remember
35:08
you saying
35:09
that morticians were doing the opposite
35:14
in heaven
35:15
instead of putting people down they were
35:18
welcoming them
35:19
is that about right they are welcoming
35:21
to heaven do you think God does not have
35:23
a sense of humor yeah
35:25
the biggest sense of humors i ever saw i
35:27
knew a family in our city the hardage
35:29
family who had more funeral homes than
35:31
anybody
35:32
and they had such kindness and
35:33
compassion that was a gift they had
35:35
kindness and compassion for people
35:37
and one of them i knew a long time was
35:39
still living God had me
35:40
make this word on a scroll it was
35:43
beautiful because this guy
35:44
gave himself 100 to love people and i
35:46
read it to him outside his funeral and
35:48
said this is God's word to you
35:50
that your family in heaven on the earth
35:52
you get them when they're going to
35:54
heaven
35:55
but in heaven you get them when they're
35:56
coming they're leaving earth they're
35:58
going to heaven from earth
35:59
you get them there because they actually
36:01
operate the welcome center
36:03
so here's these morticians who got you
36:06
when you were going to heaven you know
36:09
and you died they helped the family
36:11
because they were grieving
36:12
and having you help them because they're
36:14
in shock they didn't think those things
36:16
would be in help and they actually
36:17
it's okay you're really in heaven yes
36:19
they're having fun in the streets yes
36:20
they're celebrating in heaven
36:22
and so it is funny this whole family now
36:25
operates the welcome center in heaven
36:27
so they give them they get them when
36:29
they're going to heaven on earth you get
36:31
them with them
36:31
you know when they're coming and going
36:33
that's what it's about
36:35
it was that's right when you said that
36:38
that was that only the wisdom of God
36:41
could say
36:42
you know maybe they got a little tired
36:43
of laying people down
36:45
and now they get to welcome them as a
36:47
result of that that's perfect
36:51

01:35
hello everybody how are you doing today
01:38
this is day six in the re-election
01:41
of trump and here we are studio
01:45
q1 and of course our
01:48
good friends elijah by the way steve's
01:51
taking a break today he probably
01:53
deserved it
01:54
so guess what you're stuck with me so
01:56
here we go
01:58
we had an amazing meeting last night i
02:00
was in sanford florida you know trump
02:02
loves stanford this is a little laid
02:04
back town here in florida but everyone
02:06
in the town
02:07
loves him and there's such energy in the
02:10
air and last night it was so
02:12
powerful we all came together declaring
02:15
over the elections
02:16
even the polling places i mean the every
02:18
precinct
02:19
we sent angels and assigned them there
02:21
we dealt with violence that might rise
02:24
up this is your right as a believer
02:26
you have power over all the power of the
02:28
enemy now when i say
02:29
enemy i'm not talking about people i'm
02:32
talking about the spiritual darkness
02:34
that is trying right now to control our
02:36
country and so
02:37
uh i don't remember what they were
02:39
called i think they probably will be on
02:41
my facebook later
02:43
but you know we've already discussed
02:44
that right here about how to take
02:46
authority over the enemy
02:48
and all the things he's been doing you
02:49
know especially the ballots we prayed
02:51
about the ballots
02:52
the nun would be lost stolen changed
02:55
burnt
02:55
hidden you know because when the enemy
02:58
wants to win he'll do anything he can
03:00
and when he finds people willing to do
03:02
it
03:03
everyone actually who's involved in that
03:06
helps
03:06
hell to get their way but they will not
03:09
get their way
03:10
and trump agrees with me here he is
03:12
right here
03:14
he's very excited about the elections
03:16
and
03:17
guess what eric trump
03:20
is in my own city he's here today
03:24
actually speaking probably right now at
03:27
jacksonville beach
03:28
anybody in this area head over there
03:30
right now they have a few other people
03:32
speaking i'm not sure who they are
03:34
probably someone involved with
03:35
re-election also
03:37
but how awesome to have his son eric
03:40
here right now and if i was anywhere
03:42
else i would be there
03:44
cheering him on so yes God does have
03:47
plans he's not given up on any of his
03:49
plans he actually shared
03:51
in early 2016 about america
03:54
God knew everything would happen don't
03:57
be consumed with fear
03:59
and there may be some people acting up
04:01
you know when trump wins because of
04:03
course they're
04:03
they're not very good losers but that's
04:07
only because God is going to have his
04:09
way in these times do you know
04:11
in the book of acts it actually says
04:13
there are some days and times on this
04:15
earth
04:16
there are only in the hand of the father
04:19
and so guess what this is his time to do
04:22
one of those seasons
04:23
when he's making america greater than
04:25
before a powerful
04:30
and people in that meeting last night we
04:32
were all in one accord there's such
04:34
power
04:34
i do know right now there are actually
04:37
events and have been events
04:39
at the mall in washington that's usually
04:41
between the capital and the washington
04:42
monument that whole sea of people
04:45
they've come together they have
04:46
saturated that place with prayer
04:48
with intercession with declarations
04:51
there'll be so much
04:52
God in that area on election day people
04:56
will be consumed by it just coming into
04:58
that area
04:59
no matter what their plans are they'll
05:01
be stepping into a cloud of God
05:04
i love God's plans because all of this
05:06
it was not planned from the beginning of
05:08
this year at all but people are standing
05:11
up
05:11
taking their place as the body of christ
05:14
aligning with God
05:15
wanting us to choose life and that is
05:18
going to cause
05:19
things to happen in this physical realm
05:22
so if you think no one's praying you
05:25
better take a second
05:26
look i know that there have been i know
05:28
charlie champs there
05:30
all kinds of people have come and have
05:31
these mass meetings
05:33
they've surrounded the capitol the
05:35
supreme court
05:37
even down in front of the white house
05:39
i've met people when i was there in dc
05:41
they were parts of these meetings and
05:43
we're hoping i could stay
05:45
this weekend but i said i can't do that
05:47
i got to go do what God's asked me to do
05:49
and i do want to thank absolutely
05:53
with steve schultz and elijah listen all
05:55
his behind the scenes people
05:58
i love you because i have learned this
06:01
having a studio myself
06:02
you do nothing without those people
06:04
because i certainly am not
06:06
and steve certainly is not going to get
06:09
back there and work the cameras the
06:10
sound the computers
06:12
it takes a lot to to run a place like
06:15
this and so i'm very grateful to them
06:17
i'm sure they will get great reward but
06:19
part of that reward is
06:21
waiting to see what happens and we get
06:23
to broadcast all this we get to share
06:25
what heaven is saying
06:26
what God himself is saying about the
06:28
elections each day
06:30
and he is still saying today please
06:33
celebrate
06:34
that is your faith stepping out
06:37
celebrating the victory
06:38
of God putting trump in that white house
06:41
for four more years
06:42
to see great things happen that is going
06:44
to affect you
06:45
me and even those who don't want him
06:47
will benefit from it
06:49
and so i love God's plans they're better
06:51
than ours right
06:53
i want to thank all the people who've
06:55
been praying for all of us
06:56
and cheering us on i've met people who
06:59
have very excitedly have been watching
07:02
these every day re-election of trump
07:06
meetings that were have here with elijah
07:07
list and they're so excited they get so
07:10
much information
07:11
then they get to take it and apply that
07:13
stuff that revelation that they've
07:14
learned themselves so
07:16
we must be doing a good job because
07:18
people are celebrating they're watching
07:20
right now
07:21
people have met in sanford are watching
07:23
right now i know people are watching
07:24
from dc
07:25
people watching from philadelphia from
07:28
other places in america
07:30
we actually had people that were so
07:32
hungry
07:33
last night to hear about this uh
07:35
firsthand
07:36
about the elections and be a part of
07:38
praying they got on a bus
07:40
and rode for three days that's crazy
07:44
not just them but their family and i was
07:47
so grateful then we had other people
07:49
from other states fly in here
07:51
just to be a part of that one meeting
07:53
because people are hungry
07:54
they want a life they want a life they
07:57
have a future
07:58
we have a destiny that God's got planned
08:01
for us and he doesn't want us to miss it
08:03
so i think as crazy as it sounds
08:06
this one election this one election time
08:10
has brought the body of christ closer
08:12
together than any other time
08:14
probably on planet earth we have one
08:17
goal
08:18
we have one goal and this get in office
08:21
that person that God chose
08:23
to be our president and and to actually
08:25
get to be a part of it i'm grateful to
08:27
all of you out there thank you for your
08:29
prayers for trump for his administration
08:32
for his platform i thank all of you for
08:35
praying for his family
08:37
because you know when it's you out there
08:39
it still involves your family
08:41
when you're the one out there at the
08:42
head and you're taking charge
08:44
it still impacts your family so we do
08:46
pray for melania
08:48
for his sons his daughters his family
08:51
trump's family
08:52
the God would cover them protect them
08:53
but also put
08:55
excitement and celebration in them too
08:58
they know that they know
08:59
he's God's choice and i love the his
09:03
family that they come together all the
09:05
time
09:06
they play together they pray together
09:08
he's a great example
09:10
as a leader of our country so i try not
09:13
to talk
09:14
all day today i actually have some other
09:16
things on my list
09:17
that's why i am very casual right now i
09:20
actually get to go out and run some
09:21
errands and maybe go
09:23
sit at the beach somewhere and just soak
09:25
in the sun a little bit
09:27
but i just had to say thank you today
09:29
and thank you for all you guardians who
09:31
helped to protect the treasure
09:33
that God is releasing into the earth
09:35
today you intercessors you prayer
09:37
warriors
09:38
we couldn't do this without you we we
09:40
even know there are children now
09:43
that have their own prayer groups for
09:45
trump is that amazing
09:47
even young children know what's going on
09:49
they're aware
09:50
that we have somebody who wants God in
09:53
our country
09:54
they want safety protection and even
09:56
better jobs you know we already know
09:58
what the other side wants they want to
10:00
tear it all apart
10:01
and i pray for them make sure you pray
10:03
for them to know the truth and to be
10:04
free
10:05
because they're being controlled by the
10:07
enemy and the enemy doesn't want us to
10:09
have
10:10
anything he doesn't want us to have a
10:11
life not a country he'd like to make
10:14
this a third world country
10:15
where everything is controlled but they
10:17
don't know what they're doing
10:18
i will repeat what God said to me in
10:20
heaven
10:22
don't let them take your guns they would
10:24
never get close enough
10:26
there are so many rednecks in america
10:28
they take them down before they get
10:30
close to where they live
10:32
and so God even needs rednecks hello are
10:34
you rednecks out there
10:36
i know what you're like some of my
10:38
family are some
10:40
and so i know it's not always easy to
10:42
live with them but one
10:44
comes to push to shove man they'll be
10:46
the first ones out in front to defend
10:49
and i also want to thank you thank all
10:51
of our military who protect our country
10:54
who protect inside of our country it is
10:56
a massive organization
10:58
but finally they're getting recognition
11:01
and all the vets
11:02
i have a long line of military people in
11:05
my own family
11:06
and i know what it means when they have
11:08
to you know they retire they don't
11:09
maybe have a lot it's so good to see
11:12
people care about them but especially
11:14
our president
11:16
i never forget the day when he was
11:17
campaigning in 2016
11:19
and he was bored with the campaign
11:21
process he wasn't going to show up that
11:24
night
11:24
for the the squats and the fights going
11:27
on
11:28
he said i'm taking this time i'm gonna
11:30
go raise money for the veterans
11:32
and that little bit of time that whole
11:34
thing went on he raised thousands and
11:36
thousands probably hundreds of thousands
11:38
of dollars if not millions
11:39
to help the vets even before he was
11:42
elected
11:43
that shows you where his heart is he's
11:46
an
11:46
all-american boy who was all for america
11:50
and so i want to assure you heaven is
11:53
very much
11:54
involved in this country right now
11:56
they're up there
11:57
cheering us on your family members your
12:00
friends who are living in heaven
12:01
are watching from portals all over
12:03

12:05
holding american flags and as crazy as
12:08
that may sound
12:09
they have a real life up there too and
12:12
they're excited that God's involved in
12:14
this country
12:14
that has always stood for justice
12:18
liberty and freedom and now God is
12:21
adding righteousness so people say to
12:24
you what does america
12:25
seem for justice liberty freedom
12:28
and righteousness that is right standing
12:32
with God so whether you're on the
12:34
streets
12:35
knocking on doors right now even as i
12:37
speak i know this is their last big push
12:40
trump has people in the streets right
12:42
now everywhere
12:43
driving to different cities speaking in
12:45
little places
12:47
holding meetings in churches or going
12:49
door to door
12:50
knocking on doors encouraging people to
12:52
vote handing out flyers
12:54
handing out yard signs by the thousands
12:57
i even got to pay for some of those
12:59
myself so somewhere there's 100 yards
13:02
out there
13:03
that have the yard signs that i was able
13:06
to pay for
13:07
and i was great it was great to have a
13:09
part in that so if you get a chance
13:11
to give a donation somewhere to help all
13:14
this and people go well he's got all his
13:15
own money
13:16
he's been using his money he doesn't
13:19
even take a paycheck
13:21
okay he donates it and so what a great
13:23
person
13:24
to lead our country forward in this time
13:28
with God and with all the body of christ
13:31
beside him cheering him on praying for
13:34
him
13:34
his closest friends are believers
13:38
and some of his really close friends are
13:40
prophets who actually hear God
13:43
i love it that he does not stand in the
13:46
counsel
13:46
of the ungodly no he chooses to stand in
13:51
the counsel
13:52
of the godly of the godly and get wise
13:55
direction from God one day
13:58
i pray i will be one of those who will
14:01
get to stand by his side
14:02
and share things from God to him that is
14:05
one of my focuses
14:06
is one of the things God said he would
14:08
do so i look forward to that
14:10
i'm sure you'll find out when i do so
14:14
anything else out there anybody's
14:17
thinking about
14:18
please send your questions in to elijah
14:20
list
14:21
we'll be back tomorrow and we will be
14:23
here every day
14:24
we still have day 7 8 9 10.
14:27
we're even going to november 4th don't
14:31
not
14:31
don't stop watching after the third
14:34
things
14:35
will be happening and even i may be
14:37
delighted by them
14:39
but we will win because trump
14:42
will win and heaven is still shouting
14:45
that
14:46
the angels are talking about it all over
14:48
the place
14:49
and even in the meetings may you may not
14:51
know this angels go to the meetings with
14:53
you
14:54
and they already have angels that are
14:56
there part of their ministry so all
14:58
these angels get to meet sometimes for
15:00
the first time
15:01
they actually fellowship do you know
15:03
what an angel does
15:04
when they want to make a friend of
15:06
another angel they exchange
15:08
feathers how about that i learned that
15:12
when i was in heaven how wonderful to
15:14
know that they have friends too
15:16
and they have uh a whole groups of them
15:19
that get together even in heaven
15:21
there's places for angels just to have
15:23
fun and they get a lot of r
15:25
r because guess what they have to live
15:27
with us and they have to put up with us
15:30
they deserve it too so i guess steve
15:33
definitely deserves a break pray for him
15:36
bless him please give to the elijah list
15:39
they are the leading according to heaven
15:42
the leading number one organization that
15:45
puts out the true
15:47
word of God and only allows true
15:50
prophets of God
15:52
to come on the air with them and to post
15:55
and you can sign up also
15:57
to be uh to get um emails from a lodge
16:00
list
16:01
i get them also before i ever started
16:03
doing this i got emails from elijah list
16:06
and they were
16:07
powerfully amazing exciting so God's got
16:10
his word still in this world
16:12
he just picked steve schultz to be one
16:15
of the leaders
16:17
and the watchers of those people it's
16:20
not an easy job and sometimes
16:23
he has to say no not because it doesn't
16:26
care about the people
16:28
but you better have a word from God that
16:30
brings a life
16:32
hope a future and a destiny and if
16:34
there's any darkness involved
16:36
it will always have to say how to take
16:39
authority over it
16:40
this is our day to rule and reign with

or https://youtu.be/rH0SjlL5OW8

01:38
well good morning everybody from the
01:40
great state of oregon
01:41
it's about 11 a.m pacific time
01:44
and we're glad to have you be sure and
01:46
alert your friends
01:47
some of you may not have gotten a notice
01:49
uh in time to
01:51
to be ready for this but you know you
01:52
can replay this if you didn't get that
01:55
notice but uh sorry i missed you some of
01:57
you yesterday i needed the day off and
01:59
then
01:59
i'm back with bells on or whatever
02:02
whatever that means but
02:03
uh if you're ready i'm ready let's go
02:05
ahead and bring Kat in here and see if
02:07
she pops in here like
02:08
she is hello hello your your camera's
02:12
got
02:12
a little soft focus on it but that's
02:14
probably okay right there
02:15
how are you doing kat i'm always great
02:19
well i appreciate you feeling it for me
02:21
to uh yesterday
02:22
very much so let's just jump in what's
02:24
on your mind what do you want to tell
02:26
people
02:26
well i know that hopefully none of you
02:29
are listening to the fake news that's my
02:31
biggest
02:32
encouragement for you don't listen to it
02:35
if you want to watch your local news
02:37
maybe that make sure you're
02:39
uh catching uh trump's tweets and his
02:42
website and uh places you know that you
02:45
can trust people to say the right things
02:48
about what's actually going on because
02:50
they're so afraid
02:52
uh i'm telling you the left the liberals
02:54
the democrats are so afraid of this
02:56
election it's going to squash them for
02:58
generations to come
03:00
see so you're hearing from God's point
03:02
of view this is heaven's point of view
03:04
not men's point of view it will be so
03:06
crushed and pushed back
03:08
the darkness trying to overtake our
03:10
country God's gonna expose a lot of it
03:12
i'm really serious about the exposure
03:14
and so is God
03:15
and it will carry you on past november
03:18
the 3rd
03:19
so just be prepared that you know that
03:21
that there probably may be some
03:23
altercations some other stuff uncovered
03:26
but trump is absolutely winning that's
03:28
from the throne of God
03:30
i also want to encourage you by letting
03:32
you know what is actually going on in
03:34
other states
03:34
because you know the the fake news will
03:37
not tell you what's going on they want
03:38
everyone to think that biden has all the
03:40
numbers
03:41
well that's absolutely not true and now
03:44
we have actually on purpose spoken to
03:47
people from other states
03:48
to see what was going on with them and
03:50
even though there may
03:52
be some liberal activity there i can
03:54
tell you the majority of people
03:56
in states of the people are excited
04:00
about trump and they come for miles wow
04:03
you have rallies for him even if he's
04:05
not there
04:06
here's a good example right here no just
04:08
to show you both sides
04:10
yeah we spoke to somebody who lived in
04:12
new york city
04:14
and actually moved because they couldn't
04:16
stand it anymore because it was so
04:18
liberal
04:19
you know uh their mayor and they're not
04:21
doing a whole lot from new york city
04:22
itself
04:23
and there's no movement no life you're
04:25
not allowed to do anything even now
04:27
still
04:29
there for a second wave of the virus
04:31
there is no second wave of the virus
04:33
and so we talked to people who felt that
04:35
way it was so awful in the city
04:37
but they said outside the city it was
04:39
great and here's a good example
04:41
there are people who came to support
04:44
trump just by having a drive rally
04:47
wow and that rally went for 85
04:51
miles either of these are people in cars
04:56
so how many people is that
04:58
they were went from seaford
05:01
new york all the way to monatoc
05:04
this 85 miles of a drive
05:07
through rally for trump all these people
05:11
in new york so you can't hear what the
05:14
fake news says you know new york's gonna
05:16
go
05:17
uh blue they're gonna go to the
05:18
democrats that is not
05:20
probably true at all wow this is one
05:23
example of what's been happening
05:25
even if it's a democratic state or not
05:27
there are people by the
05:29
thousands gathering together in places
05:32
praying declaring some of them are just
05:35
outright celebrating
05:36
because they know that they know that
05:39
trump is the person that God
05:41
wants in this country and what God wants
05:44
he's going to get this time
05:46
so this is a real uh eyewitness account
05:49
of this happening in many different
05:51
places people are coming
05:53
to vote early let me tell you in florida
05:56
at some of the early voting places
05:58
they processed 80 000
06:02
votes for trump a day
06:05
wow 85 000 that's one little county
06:09
in central florida and people are going
06:12
went to the early polls and they're just
06:14
going
06:14
wild to make sure their vote gets in
06:16
there for trump i'm telling you the wave
06:19
the way for trump is coming on november
06:22
3rd
06:23
and my mama made me wait i was
06:25
determined to vote early
06:27
my husband's already voted but my mom
06:29
said i am showing up
06:30
she's almost 90 with my red white and
06:32
blue and i'm casting my vote for the
06:34
greatest president we ever had
06:36
and she goes and you're doing the same
06:38
thing
06:40
on november 3rd hopefully won't be
06:43
outside too long but she doesn't care
06:45
and so there's many seniors who feel the
06:48
same way
06:49
the seniors we even know groups of the
06:51
youth by the thousands
06:53
who are gathering together to cheer on
06:55
trump
06:56
they send him many videos they send him
06:58
cards they send him all kinds of
07:00
emails and stuff like that whole groups
07:03
of people are sending
07:04
so many thousands of emails trump
07:06
reporters can't get through them
07:08
so i'm encouraging from God's point of
07:10
view and from the people's point of view
07:13
trump is our man that's good
07:16
now you actually i've answered a couple
07:18
of questions i was going to ask you but
07:19
let me expand on
07:21
on the first question i was going to ask
07:23
was you've been saying for several days
07:25
that God wants us to be celebratory now
07:29
about the trump win and then i've got
07:31
lots of people in tents and saying how
07:33
could you know
07:35
why if you if you could just this could
07:38
just be your opinion why do you think
07:39
God wants us to celebrate
07:41
now is that just for our faith is this
07:44
does this free his hand what time but
07:46
why celebrate now
07:47
why not celebrate now we know that God
07:50
is in this he's been in it from the very
07:52
beginning
07:53
when God has a plan he has started into
07:56
that plan
07:57
he's already laid his hand on this
07:59
country he's made his choice
08:01
the body of christ is standing up but
08:03
not just the body
08:05
the moral majority of the people moral
08:07
majority means you want a life you have
08:09
a home you have a family you want a
08:10
future
08:11
they are adamant i believe it's 80
08:15
20 no matter what anyone says no matter
08:17
how it comes out in the end
08:18
the majority of the people in america
08:20
want our life
08:22
they know what trump has done they know
08:24
what he's going to be doing in the
08:26
future
08:26
and then after that of course you know
08:28
eight years of pence just take it people
08:30
because it's going to happen
08:32
God is really adamant about taking the
08:34
white house actually you don't have to
08:35
take it
08:36
trump has invited him to be there so why
08:39
not celebrate
08:40
we have a room to celebrate our entire
08:43
country is being shifted by God
08:47
look at this when you make a shift let's
08:49
just say here's the here's
08:51
here's the ground when there is a shift
08:53
two things happen
08:55
you expose what's been underneath
08:58
and when it's it goes to a higher level
09:01
so this is where God is taking us and
09:04
when that happens you will see
09:05
everything the devil has had all along
09:08
it will be exposed
09:10
and that is what God is actually doing
09:12
that's why he wants us to celebrate he
09:14
wants us to believe what he's saying
09:16
and those pastors bless their heart who
09:18
think it's going to be better for the
09:19
other side we're all praying for them to
09:20
be saved
09:22
but anyway because God is going to
09:24
reveal himself
09:26
in this country without any obstacles
09:29
and the body will operate in
09:31
levels without hindrance from the
09:33
government
09:34
like we've never had before so this is
09:36
the reason to celebrate
09:38
and i will celebrate every single day
09:41
and every day that trump is in office
09:43
for this next four years dorine and i
09:45
you know we were going to
09:46
fast the last three days before the
09:48
election a few days ago she said you
09:50
know what
09:51
i think we're supposed to celebrate and
09:52
not fast and i said i think you are too
09:54
because that's what Kats say
09:55
so we decided instead to get ourselves a
09:58
few treats
09:59
that we would normally have a party
10:01
people
10:02
yeah these people in that long 85 mile
10:06
line were
10:06
celebrating they were shouting they had
10:08
all kinds of things to make noise
10:10
they had trump flags all over the place
10:12
that was a mobile celebration
10:14
and i've seen people doing it around our
10:16
own city here blowing horns
10:19
having their big trumpet line on there
10:21
we're definitely a trump city here but
10:23
i'm telling you
10:24
trump God has put in the heart of so
10:26
many people
10:27
and they have seen the goodness come
10:30
from him that he cares he really cares
10:33
he cares about life he cares about God
10:35
it's about us
10:36
what else is important because the side
10:39
of the darkness is not going to be good
10:41
for you
10:42
and not just you the devil wants this
10:45
country
10:46
permanently and God is saying no he's
10:49
not getting it
10:51
and he's saying that from his throne and
10:53
they are having a party in heaven
10:55
already
10:56
have some treats blow the candles off
10:59
celebrate
11:00
with jesus that's good it's gonna win
11:02
and i really am
11:03
telling you we do celebrate here every
11:06
day that's awesome now
11:08
probably the single most common question
11:10
i'm getting and i
11:11
want to almost exhort the viewers that
11:15
we
11:15
we never want to treat a prophet like a
11:17
psychic and say this is what i want to
11:19
know from you and if they
11:20
can give it to you there so some will
11:22
ask have asked it that way and i
11:24
and and you don't go to a prophet and
11:27
demand to know
11:28
something you ask a prophet has the lord
11:30
shown you anything about that
11:32
or or if you know so the question in
11:35
many forms
11:36
is and you mentioned it a few minutes
11:39
ago
11:39
was this going to be over on november 3
11:42
or was this going to go to the courts
11:43
has the lord showing you anything on
11:45
that he has not said to me that it would
11:48
go to the courts
11:49
i'm pretty certain that something is
11:51
going to happen on november 4th or he
11:53
would not have had me
11:55
uh this is all about the re-election of
11:57
donald trump
11:58
that's what these uh this this is what
12:00
all these broadcasts are about
12:02
and God said don't stop with the third
12:04
go to the fourth go to november fourth
12:07
and then well we had already discussed
12:09
you and i had discussed maybe
12:11
once a week up until he takes office
12:14
and gets sworn in we will have an update
12:16
for everybody once a week
12:18
one day we'll pick one day and do it to
12:20
steve and i will
12:21
i can tell you the excitement will begin
12:23
to rise in the people
12:24
it's not going to be something that's
12:26
bad or dark it'll be the good
12:29
the good stuff that's going to start
12:30
happening and the exposures
12:33
i don't think it'll ever have to go to
12:35
court
12:37
i think at all that God's talking about
12:39
is so deep it will be so
12:40
evident there won't be any you won't
12:42
need to have a courtroom
12:44
uh so this just stay excited it will not
12:47
be weeks and weeks and months weeks and
12:48
weeks and months and months of drawing
12:50
out junk
12:51
that is not going to happen and so this
12:54
is
12:54
time to to have no fear at all in your
12:57
life no fear
12:58
just a great future for you and the
13:01
generations to come
13:02
so why not let people know take pictures
13:05
of you celebrating
13:07
that's good to us send them to trump let
13:10
them know we're celebrating
13:12
i got some very powerful um texts just
13:16
recently from
13:16
trump's headquarters about how excited
13:19
they are
13:20
about what they know they know things
13:22
behind the scenes they can't even say to
13:24
you yet
13:24
but i do know that they are actually
13:26
focusing themselves
13:28
for him to be in that white house for
13:30
another four years
13:31
wow that's good news now you addressed
13:34
this other one yeah
13:34
and again when you opened today about
13:37
the coronavirus
13:39
that is probably the other single most
13:41
common question lately
13:43
all week is what is Kat saying about
13:46
when the coronavirus will end or
13:48
what has God told you about the
13:50
coronavirus if anything
13:52
he told me from the very getting all
13:54
this stuff happened
13:56
he said they're they're blowing in out
13:58
of proportion
14:00
he told me people were lying to our
14:02
president like
14:03
the world health organization and he
14:05
said that this is what God said they're
14:07
not going to last long because they're
14:08
they're starting to demand ridiculous
14:10
things from people
14:12
they thought they had the right to take
14:13
over just because the president was
14:15
receiving
14:15
information from them go go back and see
14:17
when he fired them he fired them
14:19
they were saying crazy things like if
14:22
you don't wear a mask in your home we
14:23
can come take your children away and
14:25
when he hurts
14:26
and stuff like that he goes this that's
14:28
it i'm not that dumb
14:30
he said they're going they're out the
14:33
door
14:33
and he he fired him because he knew that
14:35
they were blowing it up
14:37
out of proportion the demands that were
14:39
being made on the on
14:40
trying to be made on the american people
14:43
and i know that trump would have already
14:44
said
14:45
if he if you could he would have said
14:46
this whole thing is over let's just
14:48
leave it and go on with our life
14:50
i can tell you if you feel like we're in
14:51
a mess where one i'm done with them
14:54
God says they need to be burned now i'm
14:56
telling you he said that from
14:58
heaven he said because they want to keep
14:59
us separated and isolated i'm not
15:01
talking about the president
15:02
i'm not about the people who are in the
15:04
backgrounds as long as they can keep you
15:07
separated they're hoping to do it
15:08
through the elections
15:10
so we can't discuss things we can't come
15:12
together oh they were upset when we
15:13
started coming together at church again
15:15
they didn't like it that kind of ruined
15:17
their plan i'm talking about the
15:18
democrats and the liberals
15:20
that ruined their plan it didn't work so
15:22
they're trying to keep us
15:23
muffled our kids muffled as long as they
15:26
can and i know our own mayor was ready
15:28
to say we're just done with it
15:30
and i don't know i guess he had some
15:31
more discussions with other doctors in
15:33
the city
15:34
i don't know who they were but they said
15:36
we'll probably go 30 more days something
15:38
like that or a couple more weeks
15:39
but i can tell you this right now there
15:41
is no fear there should be no fear in
15:43
you about that virus
15:44
uh and the meetings we hadn't seen for
15:46
we actually kicked it out of our city
15:49
we're not tolerating it did you know
15:51
that you're actually over sickness
15:53
to your sickness yeah he's christ said i
15:56
give you power over all the part of the
15:57
enemy
15:58
all sickness and disease it comes from
16:00
the devil
16:01
and he wants us to be in fear to stay
16:03
away from everybody to stay
16:04
out of being involved in things and
16:07
everything i've done recently has been
16:09
unmasked
16:10
we didn't wear masks we were doing a
16:11
silent protest like trump said
16:14
nobody got anything nobody got sick from
16:17
anything
16:17
if you feel like you might be
16:19
compromised wear your mask
16:21
but i think anyone else who feels they
16:23
want to be free from it
16:25
your immune system is actually better
16:27
and the health organization knows this
16:30
you're better when you're together your
16:31
immune gets built
16:33
up and so i don't believe most of the
16:35
stuff that's being said about that God
16:37
said
16:37
it's passing that's good that's really
16:40
good
16:40
well are you ready for a couple of other
16:41
questions like about heaven
16:43
sure i sure am let me give you a couple
16:45
one of them uh
16:47
is is a woman really want to know
16:50
and i won't read it because it's longer
16:51
but basically she wants to know where do
16:53
we have in the bible
16:54
that that that our pets go to heaven now
16:57
we know you've seen them in heaven
16:58
but she said is there a scripture with
17:00
that for that
17:01
um there's a scripture that God gave me
17:03
himself how about that one would that do
17:05
yeah that'll work that'll work he did
17:07
catch me up one time when he wants to
17:09
say something really significant to me
17:11
and he made it quite a plain that he did
17:15
take
17:16
pets to heaven and there are other
17:19
animals he takes to heaven
17:21
in heaven people go it doesn't say
17:22
animals in the bible they're called
17:24
creatures i don't know if you knew that
17:26
it says gospel to every
17:28
creature i always preach the gospel to
17:29
all of my pets
17:31
but this is what he said to me he said
17:34
go back and read in genesis
17:35
go read in genesis where i made adam
17:39
now this is how far back he's said to go
17:41
go back to where i made adam with my son
17:44
who was called the word at that time
17:46
he said when we made adam i spoke
17:49
the word adam and who was the word was
17:53
jesus christ stepped out and made him
17:55
and he was perfect but you know the
17:56
bible says there was no life in that
17:58
body it just laid there
18:00
until the father leans over and breathed
18:04
adam's spiritual being the spirit of
18:06
life is your spiritual being
18:08
he breathed that into adam's nostrils
18:10
and God said he has now become a living
18:12
soul that means he was alive
18:14
so until the spirit man is attached like
18:17
at the time of conception
18:18
there really is no life but this at this
18:21
point when he made adam he was the first
18:23
you know he said that right
18:24
so he brings from himself the father
18:27
carried all of us
18:28
all the little spirits of life they come
18:30
under the father himself
18:32
once that is attached there is life so
18:35
anything with the spirit of life in it
18:37
that's a spiritual body
18:38
if it belongs to jesus christ if it's if
18:40
it's a human it goes to heaven but if
18:42
it's an animal or a creature
18:44
they go to heaven also why wouldn't he
18:46
they belong to him he made them
18:48
and then he said i'm going to tell you
18:50
the scripture to go
18:52
go show everybody why this this term
18:55
spirit of life is so important and that
18:57
means your spiritual body
18:59
he told noah in the book of genesis go
19:02
back where it talks about noah
19:04
he told noah put every animal on the
19:07
ark that had a spirit of life in it now
19:10
those are the very words he uses
19:12
so what he's doing at what he's telling
19:14
noah is put
19:15
every don't grin at me jen
19:20
he told noah to put every animal who had
19:24
a spiritual body
19:25
in him on the ark and and what he was
19:28
saying was he was preserving
19:30
them that each of these species you know
19:33
two of every kind
19:34
had a spirit of life have a spiritual
19:36
body in them and that
19:37
clearly shows you your pets have a
19:41
spiritual body they not only have that
19:43
they have a soul
19:44
your soul is your mind your will what
19:47
you choose and your emotions what you
19:49
display well
19:50
if your pet didn't have a soul it
19:52
couldn't choose what food it liked
19:55
whether it liked people or not where it
19:57
liked to live
19:58
it didn't want to play and all this
20:00
bothered me
20:02
he said so they have a soul when your
20:05
your pet that you love
20:07
when it passes your own guardian angel
20:10
this all came from the father
20:12
your own guardian angel takes your pet
20:14
spiritual body to heaven
20:16
and i see almost all the pets i've ever
20:18
had up there
20:19
and this is opening on you they're all
20:21
waiting on you they know who you are
20:23
they'll look just like they did except a
20:25
little bit younger probably a little bit
20:27
better
20:28
so because they have that spirit of life
20:30
that the spiritual body and it's all on
20:32
them
20:32
like like noah put those on the ark your
20:36
pets
20:37
are taken to heaven that's that's good
20:39
good good good news because we've had a
20:41
lot of pets
20:42
okay this one um this is asked by a
20:44
couple of people
20:45
over the last few days and that is since
20:47
God sends us down
20:49
we are in him and he he sends us to this
20:52
earth to be born
20:54
how this and i've never heard anyone ask
20:56
this question or attempt to answer it so
20:58
here's the first
20:59
uh why did why or why does he put some
21:02
in really wonderful families and others
21:05
he puts in what she says an abusive
21:06
family or poor and abusive
21:08
how would you what would you say to
21:10
someone like that i will say
21:11
just exactly what he said to me he has
21:14
to defend them there are specific
21:16
times he needs them them the people the
21:18
ones he sends
21:19
he needs them in the earth because
21:22
there's something he's given them a
21:23
commission to do
21:24
in the earth okay how they are treated
21:28
man was given the choice we are all
21:30
given a choice are we not
21:33
and some people can choose to do what is
21:35
right even if they're not a believer
21:36
they can still choose the right thing to
21:38
do
21:39
for their children there is a devil
21:42
and the devil will go as many places as
21:45
he can to pervert the parents
21:47
to file the parents because he wants
21:49
that passed down
21:51
and the so many accounts i have heard
21:54
from people
21:55
who grew up in a a terrible uh
21:58
atmosphere
21:58
with a tear with not good parents but
22:01
God
22:02
got them he got them to know him he got
22:05
them to serve him
22:06
and today they are powerfully walking
22:09
out their destiny
22:10
so it's really so important for us to
22:13
encourage everybody especially
22:15
children because their shaping of that
22:17
soul and that child
22:19
is very important to God so he sent me
22:22
to this earth he timed my birth on the
22:24
earth he sent me
22:25
and sometimes he's building a
22:28
generational line
22:29
for his purposes and some people in that
22:33
generational line
22:34
some throughout that line let's say a
22:36
200 year span
22:37
some had good parents some didn't have
22:39
good parents but the ones he wanted he
22:41
will pass the seed of that
22:43
destiny of that that family line
22:46
would be passed down down down until he
22:50
is ready to reveal it
22:51
and have that person stand out and do
22:55
things for him
22:56
that actually will affect the whole
22:57
entire family line
22:59
and in my own lineage i had great people
23:02
that loved God
23:04
i had people who didn't love God and
23:05
didn't want him until two weeks before
23:07
they died but he got him anyway
23:09
now but what was produced in the in the
23:11
youth throughout these times
23:13
i'm seventh generation believer and look
23:16
where i
23:16
am yeah i've had to choose myself to
23:20
follow God and say yes to God even when
23:21
things weren't the best now my family my
23:23
dad my mom they loved
23:25
me um our living situation was always
23:28
the best but we always had jesus in it
23:30
we
23:30
chose jesus and even in your family line
23:34
if your family didn't
23:35
you can choose him you can choose him
23:37
powerfully and let your children know
23:40
so what God has planned for that family
23:42
line won't be
23:43
lost you see i have i can relate to what
23:46
you're saying about
23:47
even allow allowing a child to be born
23:50
in a place of abuse
23:52
i was one of those children i was one of
23:54
six and i was my father's least favorite
23:57
child
23:57
uh he literally hated me as a kid and my
24:00
mother
24:01
as i stood over her cast his casket 30
24:05
years ago because he died at
24:06
only 59. and i said why did he hate me
24:09
so much as a kid and i'm weeping
24:11
he says yes but when you became an adult
24:13
you became his favorite which is true
24:15
but the damage he had done was still
24:17
real and i had to get help
24:18
to get through all of that i believe
24:20
he's with the lord now he got his heart
24:22
right
24:22
but he was highly abusive in every way
24:25
including sexually
24:26
to me and my sisters the whole thing and
24:28
yeah that wasn't God's
24:30
voice for you that was that that was
24:32
your own father's decision
24:34
to choose that God didn't choose for you
24:36
to suffer all that
24:38
but because mankind is allowed to have
24:41
their own
24:41
will he's not made us into robots okay
24:44
we are not robots we all have a will to
24:47
choose
24:48
we choose the darkness and we choose the
24:49
light and uh
24:51
and i always pray especially for
24:53
families and for children in them
24:55
that their parents will know the right
24:57
way and the way to raise them and to
24:59
train them
25:00
and i think we're coming into a whole
25:01
new time on the earth
25:03
where the families are now going to be
25:05
in the highlight not shoved in the
25:07
background
25:08
and i think children will have a greater
25:10
chance now even though the darkness is
25:12
still there
25:13
the knowledge of God himself and jesus
25:15
in this generation
25:17
will shift and change the way a lot of
25:19
them have been living
25:21
i just thank God every time i hear a
25:22
testimony like your steve
25:24
you chose God and you chose what was
25:27
right and look what you were doing right
25:29
now
25:30
the enemy didn't win remember
25:33
what he tried to kill you several times
25:34
and now to wipe you out and take you off
25:36
the earth he knew you had a divine call
25:38
on your life
25:39
and you still chose it and now according
25:42
to God in heaven
25:44
you are the number one place in this
25:47
world to
25:47
hear the true prophetic word of God so
25:50
that was God's call on your life so even
25:52
though you
25:53
press in and get through stop and lose
25:56
it from your soul people please if
25:58
you've ever been abused
25:59
say i choose my life to lose all the
26:01
abuse and all the trauma even all the
26:02
way through my childhood
26:04
i won't keep it anymore my soul i choose
26:06
to bind the life and love of God
26:09
and he'll actually take all that stuff
26:12
away from you
26:13
and you can start like with a free soul
26:16
open to God
26:17
and that's when he released that
26:19
revelation in this time
26:21
about the keys of the kingdom which you
26:22
bind to yourself
26:24
that's God you cannot be taken away
26:26
which you lose from your soul that the
26:28
enemy put in there
26:29
it can't stay and so i know that God
26:32
still has that plan for your
26:34
for your lives everybody out there don't
26:36
give up on him that's good that's good
26:38
and forgiveness enough
26:40
if i could say anything the one thing
26:42
that that you know i
26:44
took so seriously is when i understood
26:46
that God's requirement
26:47
not just a request but he requires us to
26:49
forgive
26:51
and when i got a hold of that and i've
26:53
lived a life of that
26:55
i could feel myself being promoted
26:56
through the years
26:58
through the forgiveness and then healing
27:00
can come and
27:01
uh there's a some of my family versus
27:03
still suffering one is a wicked
27:05
witch a practicing wiccan witch but she
27:08
she was horribly abused by my father
27:11
pardon me everybody while i'm really
27:12
vulnerable here
27:13
but she still needs to get saved and
27:17
and so far with you we declare she will
27:19
be
27:20
free in jesus name that she will be
27:23
overwhelmed by the holy spirit that will
27:25
prove her
27:26
towards christ
27:29
hold the enemy on her and break that off
27:31
for her in jesus name
27:33
we expect a good report about her life
27:36
because she comes from that same
27:37
lineage and she has gifts too that God
27:40
wants
27:41
yes she knows in jesus name good good
27:44
thank you Kat awesome
27:46
well let's do this last one on time uh
27:48
uh
27:49
well second to the last one because you
27:51
just just give me a minute on this
27:53
because
27:53
as she says uh this person says has the
27:56
lord spoken to ken about the rapture now
27:58
i know what you say about the rapture so
27:59
go ahead and say it
28:01
about your rapture road well the rapture
28:04
is not for now
28:06
and there's some things that actually
28:08
prove that it is not for now
28:10
right when the rapture happens the word
28:13
rapture
28:13
number one does not mean rescue it means
28:16
a celebration it means to be in rapture
28:19
to to have an extreme celebration
28:22
when christ does come back it's for a
28:24
church that's not
28:25
sinning and full of their self well
28:28
hello yeah
28:30
let's run look at the church today he's
28:33
not
28:33
coming there's no bride yet there's some
28:36
but there's not a bride full out ready
28:39
that has no spots those are sins and has
28:42
no wrinkles that's the
28:44
flesh that's your attitude your opinions
28:46
and your rights not God's
28:48
and it also says this the world will
28:51
know us the body of christ
28:53
by our love for each other
28:56
and there may be a few places but the
28:58
majority of the body
29:00
are fighting each other so he's not
29:02
coming anytime
29:04
soon he has generations still planned on
29:07
the earth
29:08
the antichrist is not on the earth and i
29:11
don't believe the antichrist will ever
29:13
be able to appear with the body of
29:14
christ getting
29:15
stronger and greater the glory getting
29:17
greater and greater
29:18
the people only will choose satan
29:22
because there's not people on the earth
29:24
that are filled with God
29:25
and there's no one else to rescue them
29:27
from the tragedies and the perilous
29:29
times
29:29
it's the only reason they'll pick him
29:31
and they won't need
29:33
that because of God getting greater in
29:35
us
29:36
and us beginning to manifest and
29:38
demonstrate for God
29:39
there's miraculous days and times that
29:41
haven't even happened yet God's not
29:43
going to forget about them
29:45
he's not going to forget them so don't
29:47
look in this stuff this stuff is not the
29:49
perilous times trust me
29:51
it isn't you're still breathing clean
29:53
air there's still a blue sky up top out
29:55
there
29:56
true home is available to live in so
29:58
this is not the perilous times
30:00
God wants us to be great for him roll up
30:02
your rapture rogue the holy spirit says
30:04
stick it in your closet
30:06
you you need to get your crown on and
30:09
rule and reign with jesus christ in
30:11
these days
30:13
that's good so i'm going to ask this
30:15
last question for everyone else be sure
30:16
you
30:17
type your questions out below this
30:19
program whether it's on youtube or the
30:21
other and tomorrow we'll try to get to
30:23
to more of them this this is something
30:26
i've wondered about
30:27
i kind of feel like i have an answer uh
30:31
because God can be all places at once
30:34
but she says Kat i've always wondered
30:35
how jesus
30:36
can have quote time for lack of another
30:40
word to see everyone who loves him in
30:42
heaven
30:42
i know there's no time in heaven but but
30:44
with millions of people who want to see
30:46
him and you mentioned today
30:47
just go talk to him how does that work
30:51
it works because he can be everywhere
30:53
all at the same time if he wants to
30:55
he can actually himself because in your
30:57
in your mind
30:59
you say i have one body it's me this is
31:02
this is here this is all i got he only
31:04
has
31:04
one of himself but he actually can be
31:09
many different of him many places at the
31:12
same time
31:13
even when he's on the earth he can do
31:15
that he is God
31:17
there's layers of himself and it's
31:19
they're all a whole of him just like the
31:21
holy spirit
31:22
can be everywhere all at the same time
31:24
most people don't ask that question
31:26
but they can be because there's layers
31:28
of themselves and they can send one to
31:30
everybody in heaven to be
31:32
alone in special time is still him
31:35
it's not not duplicates it's not little
31:37
robots it's not that
31:38
it's him and so he can he can be with us
31:41
here on the earth he can be with people
31:43
in heaven
31:44
because he is God and let me tell you
31:46
there's nothing like
31:47
being with him face to face and everyone
31:50
in heaven does love him
31:52
and you can tell where he is if he is
31:55
going somewhere around heaven
31:57
because people will chase him even the
31:59
creatures will chase him they want to be
32:01
with him
32:01
so don't be concerned about that that's
32:05
good that's really good
32:06
when i he when i dealt with this when i
32:08
dealt with his everywhere at once
32:10
he's omni omnipotent omnipresent
32:13
omniscient
32:14
all those three omnis it's a lot easier
32:17
to to converse with him
32:19
in in heaven as i land my bed i know i
32:22
have his
32:23
for lack of a better term undivided
32:25
attention i can talk with him as long as
32:28
i want and he'll talk back
32:29
with me as long as we want and it's
32:32
undivided attention meanwhile my wife on
32:35
the other
32:35
bed could do the same thing yes right
32:38
because
32:39
you have to do that absolutely true
32:41
that's absolutely true however
32:43
okay the more time you give him of
32:45
yourself
32:47
here on the earth the the clearer you
32:50
will hear him
32:51
speak to you and according to them
32:53
especially holy spirit he says holy
32:55
spirit says i'm
32:56
speaking all the time so make sure that
32:59
you are focused and you're listening
33:01
and he said i've always spoken but not
33:04
everybody
33:04
hears me so we get caught up in the
33:07
day-to-day
33:09
life or we get caught up in traumas or
33:11
fear
33:13
fear offense and unforgiveness
33:16
will block you literally like there's a
33:18
block over you
33:19
that keeps you from hearing clearly from
33:22
heaven or from jesus
33:24
or the father or holy spirit so make
33:26
sure you have none of those in your life
33:28
you don't want to keep those in your
33:29
life
33:30
and right now fear is everywhere
33:33
deception is a no
33:34
another whole thing that people choose
33:36
to be deceived
33:37
some of them and they don't want to hear
33:40
him that gives the enemy
33:42
more opportunity just like the opposite
33:44
to speak and they'll hear what he's
33:45
saying
33:46
so make sure that you have your radar
33:49
out for jesus christ and let him know
33:51
i give you permission to get my
33:53
attention
33:54
if i am not paying attention and let me
33:56
tell you he can do that
33:58
if you give him permission that's really
34:01
good
34:02
well kat thank you for another amazing

02:22
hopefully it's good
02:23
hopefully it'll the sound will be good
02:25
so hey so Kat
02:26
let me do this before i ask the first
02:28
question i want to do a shout out
02:30
a lot of people probably most people do
02:32
not know that johnny enlo had a word for
02:34
me
02:35
and he did not say i had to do it but he
02:37
told me
02:38
basically it was a word for the lord to
02:40
have Kat for 10 days in a row
02:42
up to the elections and he had never
02:44
given me such a word
02:46
and that was like whatever has been 12
02:48
13 days ago
02:49
we got that word and i said all right
02:51
let me go to work on that and
02:53
and within a few minutes we had that
02:54
dance i want to give a shout out to
02:56
johnny
02:56
didn't and then he was telling me off
02:59
camera that the lord
03:00
told you ahead of time what did he tell
03:02
you
03:04
yeah he did actually it all started with
03:06
him
03:07
continually telling me every day
03:09
whenever i spoke
03:11
anywhere for the people to begin to
03:13
celebrate don't wait till november the
03:15
3rd
03:15
he wants celebration in your heart he
03:17
literally had me say that many times
03:19
over
03:20
this is a time for the body of christ
03:22
and really america to celebrate
03:25
what God is bringing this is just the
03:27
beginning of what he's going to do in
03:29
our country
03:30
he's cleaning the platform clean
03:33
exposing all the darkness and setting in
03:35
place exactly who he needs to be there
03:37
of course number one would be trump
03:40
and so he kept telling me tell the
03:42
people to celebrate get rid of any fear
03:44
out of them and i mean every place i
03:46
spoke we did that
03:48
and it was very powerful and i think
03:50
it's very significant
03:52
that johnny emma actually said why God
03:55
wanted me to do this he said he wanted
03:57
celebration in the hearts of the people
03:59
before the election came oh wow i did i
04:02
forgot that part
04:03
he did say that i remember reading it
04:05
and so God told me
04:06
he said i'm actually going to put you
04:08
out there in front of the people
04:10
days before the election so you can keep
04:12
encouraging them
04:13
empowering them and letting them know
04:15
what i am saying
04:16
about these elections all the way up not
04:19
just to the third
04:20
God actually asked for november the
04:22
fourth and
04:23
said to please do it that way so we
04:25
actually will be doing that way but
04:26
johnny and lo clearly heard God when he
04:30
had him contact steve and say i believe
04:33
that that would be a good thing to put
04:35
Kat out there to let her share with the
04:37
people
04:37
to get them excited and let celebration
04:40
be in their hearts on wow he's already
04:41
said
04:42
two things God said to me so clearly
04:44
this was all God's plan
04:46
and i was very happy i didn't know who
04:48
it would be but it was really happening
04:50
if i knew that it was you stephen elijah
04:52
this boy you're going to be super
04:54
blessed for not just hearing what God's
04:56
word was but you saying yes to it
04:58
wow that's good well thank you for that
05:01
well let me let me
05:02
ask this next question um you know in
05:05
past elections it's been very common for
05:08
pastors
05:09
to get up in front of their congregation
05:10
they'll say something like
05:12
be sure to vote it's very important to
05:13
vote go vote vote your conscience vote
05:16
for who you feel like
05:17
God has told you and then we release
05:20
this is not
05:21
that is it this is not no okay and it's
05:24
not what this
05:25
is at all this is what you choose what
05:28
God would want
05:29
you choose what you know according to
05:31
the word unto the heart of God
05:33
what would he choose for this country
05:35
well the number one thing would be
05:36
life that means that you should be
05:38
anti-abortion
05:40
and trump is the most pro-life
05:43
president we have ever had literally
05:46
in the history of this country and
05:48
people may not know this
05:50
in the beginning when he first started
05:52
iran he wasn't sure but
05:53
literally somebody took him aside and
05:56
they showed him
05:57
an abortion a video of one i don't know
06:00
if anybody knows that
06:01
it was a group of pastors and people who
06:02
showed him and from the moment he saw
06:05
they said this is
06:06
murder i'm not putting up with this i am
06:08
clearly against this this is
06:10
wrong because he's definitely he wants
06:13
the best for people
06:14
but once he saw that that was it there
06:16
was no question
06:17
he never talked about anything else
06:19
except wanting to end abortions he wants
06:21
to end them he wants that
06:22
wiped out and he is definitely a
06:24
pro-life president so you're going to
06:26
hear some inside things maybe today that
06:28
you didn't know about him
06:30
but he clearly stands for life and just
06:32
so you know this
06:33
i want to say this that biden is
06:35
actually running commercials right now
06:37
that says that
06:38
trump is against a baby that he wants to
06:41
continue abortion
06:42
and that biden himself wants to end them
06:44
that is the biggest
06:45
lie i think that they've been promoted
06:47
because you know maybe you don't know
06:49
this either
06:50
they've had hundreds of millions of
06:51
dollars given to their side
06:54
because of these very little wicked
06:56
people who want
06:57
to have control of this country and
07:00
therefore he's able to run all these
07:01
crazy ads that most of them are lies
07:04
trump's not wasting his time coming
07:06
against him because he is too busy
07:09
making america great clearly sharing his
07:12
program this is it
07:13
he has his program outlined dotted
07:16
underlined everybody knows what trump
07:18
has planned
07:20
almost nobody knows what biden has
07:22
planned they're too busy spending their
07:23
money and their time
07:24
bashing trump and let me tell you
07:26
they're hiding things when they do that
07:28
they don't want to tell the truth some
07:29
of them just slip it out like
07:31
i remember in the beginning when biden
07:33
was speaking
07:35
at a at a place and he said give me all
07:37
your money i'll make america russia
07:40
and i am not making that up that's a
07:42
communist country
07:44
so if you think that they want if i
07:46
don't want something that's good he does
07:48
not
07:49
he's a property being controlled but
07:51
he's not for
07:52
life you cannot vote for people who are
07:55
for death
07:56
because that is not God's uh choice this
07:59
day i offer you life and death
08:00
and God says choose life so so Kat
08:04
on that on the accountability thing
08:06
you're saying some off-camera and i'm
08:08
i'm mixing up what you said often versus
08:11
what's what you said on camera but
08:13
um how accountable are we for this
08:16
voting meeting if i choose to vote for
08:19
biden because he's a nicer guy
08:21
i think i'm just making this out because
08:23
i'm i'm all in for trump i've already
08:24
voted for him
08:27
how accountable am i what what is how is
08:29
God going to look at that and
08:31
how is it when it comes to blessing my
08:34
life or not blessing my life
08:36
i assume that you're talking about
08:38
believers correct
08:40
right you know i'm not believers because
08:42
let me tell you
08:43
even the secular secular people are
08:46
people who are good people that don't
08:47
know christ
08:48
they don't know him yet they're called
08:50
the moral majority
08:52
the moral majority in this country they
08:53
don't want abortions
08:55
they don't like it they don't want it
08:57
they have families they love children
09:00
and that's why most of them most of the
09:02
moral majority would pick
09:03
trump over biden and the whole
09:05
democratic party
09:06
is extremely liberal and yes you will be
09:09
held accountable
09:10
because you choose what you choose with
09:14
your will
09:15
is what will be put inside of you so
09:17
what you don't realize
09:19
is when you choose all that junk and the
09:21
lies and the hate
09:23
and if anybody hated you know satan
09:25
hates
09:26
and they're certainly operating for him
09:29
because
09:30
satan wants violence he wants to steal
09:32
kill destroy he wants
09:34
all the babies to not be on this earth
09:36
because they're all a threat to him
09:38
so when you choose the left you're
09:39
choosing what the enemy wants that is
09:41
the devil
09:42
and uh they have all kinds of people
09:44
behind the scenes you don't know that
09:46
are doing things speaking against
09:47
america putting curses and all kinds of
09:49
stuff on it
09:50
thank God all the body has been praying
09:53
for america and intercessors i thank you
09:55
so much for standing in that gap
09:57
for truth life and hope but yes you will
10:00
be held accountable because you're
10:02
choosing it's very important to
10:05
understand when you choose something
10:07
that's with your will when you know only
10:10
go and vote for something and you
10:12
know that's not lining up with God it
10:14
cannot be good for you God will still
10:16
love you
10:17
that doesn't mean he's going to wipe you
10:18
off the planet you may not
10:20
reach the fullness of your destiny if
10:22
you keep listening to the stuff from the
10:24
left
10:25
because it will fill your soul with it
10:27
as a man thinketh in his heart or a soul
10:29
that's what you will become
10:31
so you need to choose life you need to
10:33
choose what God has chosen himself
10:36
and he has chosen trump so i would be
10:38
very careful
10:39
if you still have time to change your
10:41
vote and you have voted for biden i
10:42
would encourage you to change that and
10:44
vote for
10:45
life and choose life because that God
10:48
according to his word
10:49
that's what he wants on this earth and
10:52
in our lives
10:53
you know i remember a scripture where he
10:55
talked about the babies that were being
10:57
offered to molech
10:59
israel turned very wicked and God
11:02
at one point said it never entered my
11:04
mind that you would do this
11:06
which is a weird thing for God to say
11:07
but he said that
11:09
but God now knows that how wicked man
11:13
will allow himself to go if God if he
11:15
does intervene
11:16
and voting for the other side is like
11:18
offering your children to molech you
11:20
might as well take those children
11:22
and throw them into them if you've ever
11:24
had a child born and you held that child
11:26
in your arms
11:27
you knew the love and the life that
11:29
flowed
11:30
that you had such a love for that child
11:33
that's how God really feels about all of
11:35
us
11:35
but you know the choices we make every
11:37
day of our life makes a difference in
11:39
our destiny
11:40
and the word clearly says what God
11:43
thinks about
11:44
abortion about you touching or harming
11:46
one of his babies
11:47
he said it'd be better if a millstone if
11:50
you've never seen or visited an old
11:51
grist mill or a grinding mill
11:53
those stones are bigger than a car
11:56
and he said better if that was tied
11:59
around your neck and thrown into the sea
12:02
it'd be better if that can happen to you
12:03
than the punishment you will get for
12:05
taking the life of babies
12:07
he was saying that would be better than
12:08
what your judgment will be against you
12:11
so that's just like
12:12
you you you better not touch his babies
12:14
you better not come against
12:15
babies you know why he's sending him to
12:18
the earth for a purpose
12:19
they're not just a little baby they have
12:21
a destiny
12:22
they have a commission from God when he
12:24
sends them he
12:26
doesn't want that life taken from them
12:29
so that they can achieve what they want
12:30
on the earth
12:31
and there's millions of them in heaven
12:34
that their life has been taken
12:36
and just so you know this the top guy in
12:40
new york city just signed an agreement
12:42
saying that it would not be all right to
12:43
destroy the life of the baby even as
12:45
it's being born
12:46
so if you don't think wickedness can get
12:48
more evil and more evil
12:50
they came up with all these reasons why
12:52
you should have abortions
12:54
but that is outright murder and that is
12:57
how God sees it so make sure you're
12:59
lining up
13:00
for no other reason than that reason
13:03
God wants those babies lives to be
13:06
preserved
13:06
and to be shaped their soul in their
13:08
life so that he can use them
13:10
and so i would be very careful for you
13:14
and what your decision would be make
13:16
sure you're choosing life
13:18
and not death that's good now i i always
13:21
like when we come on a really serious
13:23
note like this and we talked about
13:24
abortion
13:25
there are people watching right now or
13:27
who will see this
13:28
who have had abortions and never dealt
13:30
with that and never repented would you
13:32
talk to them about repenting for
13:34
abortions they may have had
13:35
in God's grace once they do that yeah
13:38
it's so important that
13:40
no matter what age you were and i want
13:42
to add this i always will add the more
13:45
some didn't want it and i know people
13:47
when they were young
13:48
just got in a situation got pregnant
13:51
either the parents or someone else
13:53
outside of them
13:54
uh encouraged or even sometimes made
13:56
them
13:57
have an abortion okay that's a little
14:00
different than you choosing it yourself
14:02
right because people wept and cried over
14:04
all that
14:05
you need to know this your babies that
14:08
all were aborted no matter how
14:10
or why they are all in heaven wanting
14:13
very much to have you there with them
14:16
and this was a beautiful thing God
14:17
showed me that when you repent of having
14:20
that done
14:22
you receive christ when you get to
14:24
heaven
14:26
your babies will be waiting for you they
14:28
know who you are they've already
14:30
forgiven those who did that they've not
14:32
just forgiven if the parents did it or
14:34
someone else had it done
14:36
they've even forgiven the people who
14:37
performed it
14:39
they're living in heaven with the life
14:40
of God but the thing that their heart
14:42
cries out for
14:43
is for their parents to be there with
14:45
them and spending time
14:47
you get that baby given back to you you
14:49
get to raise that baby it grows very
14:51
slowly
14:52
it won't miss its gift because the gift
14:54
God sent it with
14:56
they still get to use that gift in
14:57
heaven so please
14:59
if you have not please repent of that
15:02
and make sure you receive christ and
15:04
you'll have some surprises when you get
15:06
to heaven your babies will already know
15:08
who you
15:08
are they will celebrate in heaven
15:11
knowing that you've received christ that
15:13
you have
15:13
repented of that and they will be
15:16
restored to you so would you
15:18
know that that one of my uh one of the
15:21
questions that came
15:22
came in overnight was someone had asked
15:25
when we get to heaven
15:26
because we're all going to be young it's
15:28
30-ish i guess
15:30
is it i haven't seen them but you've
15:32
seen that but i mean
15:34
so am i at 30 something looking at my
15:37
grandfather who is 30-something and my
15:39
father who
15:40
looked like am i calling him dad and my
15:42
grandparents
15:43
grandma and grandpa do you know i think
15:46
that God would not mind you doing that
15:48
at all that's how you knew them it says
15:50
in the bible you will be
15:52
known as you were known that means
15:54
you're gonna know who your parents were
15:56
who your grandparents were
15:58
uh we are our we are coming home however
16:01
is God's son or daughter everybody has
16:04
their own mansion you're not married in
16:06
heaven you're like
16:07
best friends families do things together
16:10
all over heaven and uh regardless of
16:13
what
16:13
age they know when someone passes away
16:15
like at 50 let's say 15
16:18
or 9 or 8 they will be almost that same
16:21
age even if you go home 50 years later
16:23
because
16:24
time is not there people grow so slowly
16:27
however if you were 90 or 100 and i'm
16:29
sure there were people that were
16:31
you your spiritual body doesn't look to
16:34
me
16:34
it looks like it's 25. it's that
16:36
timeless
16:37
age and it will never age in heaven
16:40
everybody looks
16:41
amazing uh you have no no imperfections
16:44
in you
16:45
everything is just beautiful about you
16:46
the light of God comes from you
16:49
your spiritual body is a little bit kind
16:51
of transparent but you still live a real
16:53
life in heaven just like our physical
16:55
body does on this earth
16:56
so everybody looks good you know what
16:58
they're all excited about seeing each
17:00
other and they're celebrating
17:01
when people come home to heaven i know
17:03
we have a funeral but heaven has a party
17:07
so right now though because we're still
17:10
here you who are here
17:12
your birth was timed by God on this
17:14
earth
17:15
for these days to do great things for
17:18
him not to be beat up not to have things
17:20
stolen from you
17:21
but who you put in power and the bible
17:23
even talks about it
17:24
the people rejoice when there's someone
17:27
who's righteous
17:28
and who is good that is in power it says
17:30
that but they don't
17:32
rejoice that grief comes on them when
17:34
you have someone in there who wants evil
17:36
who wants to bring in dangerous things
17:38
who doesn't want to have
17:40
accountability uh they want to oh just
17:42
think about this y'all the left want to
17:44
do away with all the sheriffs and the
17:45
police
17:46
department what do you think is going to
17:47
happen if somebody like that got in
17:49
there they're being anarchy
17:51
for sure they want to pull the borders
17:53
down let anyone from anywhere in the
17:54
world come in without any accountability
17:56
whatsoever
17:57
this is their platform if you've never
17:59
heard them say it okay that's
18:01
what biden stands for so make sure you
18:04
choose life and God
18:05
of course wants goodness liberty justice
18:08
freedom
18:09
joy celebration in our country
18:13
example of him in this world and that's
18:16
why you need to be
18:17
very careful when you vote that's good
18:20
i i have never seen in my lifetime i
18:23
don't think it's ever happened in the
18:24
united states
18:25
where crowds of 20 30 40 50 people
18:30
are together chanting we love you
18:33
to donald trump i mean it was described
18:36
i think i was hearing it on
18:37
last night that on the first go-around
18:40
people came to trump's reality because
18:41
they liked what they were hearing but
18:43
they were curious they wanted to learn
18:45
and it was that that was beginning to be
18:47
a thing that they were really liking
18:48
this guy
18:50
this is not people coming for curiosity
18:52
this time this is people coming out of
18:54
absolute
18:55
love for this man yes what he's already
18:58
done for our country if you just look at
19:00
his
19:01
record he has kept the promises he gave
19:04
when he first ran
19:05
he kept all his promises and america i
19:08
think the end of beginning like i don't
19:09
know nine million new jobs in just a
19:12
couple years that was
19:13
long before even this fourth year uh
19:16
that he had already created new jobs
19:18
um made set up things so that we would
19:20
be protected
19:21
he honored our veterans and i have to
19:23
say this because one of the other biden
19:25
commercials saying
19:26
that all the money that's been raised
19:28
for veterans that he's that
19:30
trump will take it away and spend it on
19:32
wicked things
19:33
this is a commercial that biden has out
19:35
there that people are believing
19:37
don't believe lies people he on purpose
19:41
loves the veterans he loves those who
19:43
are the first responders the firemen the
19:44
policemen
19:45
he honors them all the time and
19:47
celebrates who they are and even those
19:49
who retired
19:50
he straightened out the veteran
19:52
hospitals were where some of them were
19:53
dying they weren't getting attention
19:55
he his heart is for them is for every
19:59
senior to be taken care of and and this
20:02
is his heart
20:03
but the other side is lying about these
20:06
things like i said before they were
20:07
accusing him of being for abortion
20:09
they're
20:09
accusing him now stealing money from the
20:11
vets when he's done giving all this
20:13
money he's not gonna do that at all
20:15
the other side doesn't even care if you
20:17
live as a senior
20:18
so you need to know the truth i only
20:20
give the truth i say what heart is
20:22
saying
20:23
and God always brings truth
20:26
so you're right 50 000
20:29
40 000 in just the last two days
20:32
in one rally 50 some thousand 40 some
20:36
thousand
20:37
he did four or five rallies just
20:39
yesterday
20:40
ended in miami at midnight and these
20:43
people were celebrating in the street
20:44
that he was still coming
20:46
they waited
20:50
they waited in every place he would just
20:52
fly from one place to the other
20:54
these people were celebrating that he is
20:57
bringing life that he wants
20:58
them and if you don't remember when he
21:00
was inaugurated the first time he said
21:02
i'm here to give your country back to
21:04
you the people
21:05
and he's serious about that well i'd say
21:09
you know i i also believe because of
21:11
this
21:12
he's probably the most prayed for
21:14
president in our life tonight
21:16
maybe ever because we i never have
21:18
prayed for a leader
21:19
like this one because i'm thinking lord
21:21
protect this man
21:22
give him wisdom and we have to continue
21:25
to do that even during the next four
21:26
years we've got to keep him covered
21:28
right
21:29
our prayers do continue to make a
21:30
difference do they our prayers make a
21:33
huge difference and let me tell you he's
21:35
actually got divine
21:36
protection there have been angels sent
21:38
from heaven warring angels to surround
21:40
him
21:41
his plane his home in miami all over in
21:44
dc when i was there i saw angels lining
21:46
every street in
21:47
washington dc they were there to protect
21:50
him
21:50
to protect his administration to protect
21:52
his family
21:54
it's because our prayers make a
21:56
difference so please
21:57
keep praying for his wisdom of God the
22:00
plan of God
22:01
and of course we're gonna we're gonna
22:03
pray for protection for him always and
22:05
blessings please
22:06
bless him he is his own money to do this
22:10
okay he doesn't even take a paycheck and
22:12
so you don't have to understand God show
22:14
someone who
22:15
loves this country and the people who do
22:18
love him because he's helped make their
22:20
lives and
22:20
i'm going to add one more thing because
22:22
we're talking about the elections
22:24
biden has adamantly stated all the stuff
22:26
that trump
22:27
worked hard for these last few years he
22:30
opened up the mining
22:31
and made it safer of course the fracking
22:33
which is getting oil and stuff
22:35
out of the very uh parts of the earth
22:37
the oil lines were open the gas lines
22:39
were open we need this energy so we can
22:42
be self-sufficient
22:43
biden has already declared he's going to
22:45
shut down every single one of them the
22:47
day
22:47
if he gets elected i'm shutting down the
22:49
money let me tell you these people were
22:51
not happy with them
22:52
i'm going to take away the gas lines i'm
22:54
going to take the oil away i'm crazy
22:56
coal mining away
22:58
that sounds like control to me that's
23:00
wickedness it's just
23:01
wickedness yeah it's just wickedness
23:04
it's it's like
23:05
it goes beyond just wanting to control
23:08
it's wanting to destroy people's
23:10
lives it's not even normal natural
23:12
thinking in every any natural citizen if
23:15
you ask them do you want that they're
23:16
all going to say no
23:17
we need the police we need the firemen
23:20
we need to rescue people and yet
23:22
that doesn't seem to be part of anyone
23:24
in his brain
23:26
uh is not even none of them are thinking
23:27
normal because they're sold
23:29
out to whatever it takes to get this
23:32
country and control it we're doing it
23:35
and so there is wickedness and i've met
23:37
normal people
23:38
not even christians who say do you not
23:40
realize how wicked the other side is and
23:43
when i'm very well aware of how wicked
23:45
they are
23:46
they don't want life they don't want
23:47
truth they certainly don't want God
23:49
they don't want us to have anything no
23:51
guns no rights
23:52
they want to control they want to hand
23:54
feed you but you won't have anything
23:56
they'll have control over everything you
23:58
have this is what socialism
24:00
is i lived when all that stuff started
24:03
going on
24:04
and when people were con very concerned
24:06
they thought russia would attack then
24:08
they thought the
24:09
terrorists would can come and take over
24:11
let me tell you they want to let them in
24:13
the left wants to let the terrorists
24:15
have rights and the democrats
24:18
democrats paid for all the riders and
24:21
the terrorists who got put in jail they
24:24
paid to get them out
24:26
this is true this is in this is this is
24:28
crazy they've already they've already
24:30
done that so all these people who are
24:32
causing havoc
24:33
rights burning hurting people they went
24:36
and paid their bail and got them out of
24:39
jail this is the democrats
24:41
so they're already trying to do it
24:43
they're already trying to work their
24:44
plan don't take
24:46
their lies don't believe any of the
24:48
commercials that biden is showing
24:50
they're all
24:50
lies and whenever you don't watch the
24:54
fake news
24:55
watch the local news and by the way on
24:57
election night
24:58
i believe if you go to kenneth
25:00
copeland's website he has his
25:02
own election night broadcast showing the
25:05
truth about all the things happening in
25:06
the states it's a wonderful delight to
25:09
see that someone else is standing up and
25:10
doing that
25:11
because the other side will keep lying
25:14
as long as they can
25:15
and i just got a really good um i got a
25:18
good alert coming into me this morning
25:20
from trump's people
25:22
that they are winning outrageously in
25:24
the swing states the voting
25:27
crazy in the swing states for trump so
25:30
if you think these people
25:32
having these 10 000 car mobile rallies
25:35
without even trump there
25:36
and many states and even in israel they
25:40
had their own motorcycle rally
25:42
in the in the in the jewish section for
25:45
trump
25:46
they the the world wants him to win a
25:49
lot of the world wants him to when they
25:50
know
25:51
that he is the person who can turn this
25:53
country around and not just that
25:55
they know he will help their countries
25:59
and when you when you we talked about on
26:01
and several
26:02
would not have seen that broadcast we
26:04
talked about when you go to vote
26:06
lay hands on that booth inside there
26:08
touch it or even if you're not supposed
26:10
to touch anything else
26:11
pray over this booth for the next people
26:14
that come that if anybody comes to Kat
26:16
uh disparaging vote they will change
26:20
every believer you carry the anointing
26:22
look it up in first
26:23
john 2 27 i'll speak that solely first
26:26
john 2 27 when you receive jesus christ
26:29
you receive a deposit of the anointing
26:31
it lives in you it's what christ
26:33
operated in
26:34
when the lady touched him of his garment
26:36
she was healed
26:37
it does something to darkness the
26:39
anointing
26:40
breaks the yolk every believer out there
26:42
knows that i see you
26:43
darkness so you are allowed to lay your
26:45
hands if you lean
26:47
on the thing like to fill it out take
26:49
the pen they give you say i release the
26:51
anointing
26:52
also on that whole little thing that you
26:53
can lean on to make sure you release the
26:55
anointing
26:56
it'll go into that whole thing and begin
26:58
to break the yoke of darkness over
27:00
everyone else who comes there
27:02
it's called a secret weapon and you have
27:05
it i have it steve has
27:07
it we need to start releasing it that's
27:10
good
27:11
has the alert showing you after the
27:13
election i'm talking about
27:15
weeks months a year or two is there
27:18
going to be
27:19
um the people many people on the left
27:22
that sort of have their blinders
27:24
the skills fall from their eyes and
27:25
realize what they were voting for what
27:27
what has he shown you about those who
27:29
may
27:30
come to their senses after the after the
27:32
fact i think that some will
27:34
that really just maybe hurt a few things
27:36
or they're influenced by their friends
27:38
to vote for that i think that it won't
27:41
take very long for them to see
27:43
what how america has been rebuilt and
27:47
the things a lot of the violence will
27:49
stop because
27:50
no one's going to put up with it at that
27:52
time and people have had
27:54
the other thing i need to add in all
27:55
this some people are having dreams of
27:57
cities burning
27:59
anarchy civil war in the streets that
28:01
will
28:02
not happen the enemy wants us to believe
28:06
that
28:07
sometimes God is showing you this is the
28:09
enemy's plans
28:11
right that doesn't mean you're supposed
28:12
to share it with everybody else
28:14
because sometimes that brings fear if
28:16
you have no way to interpret the dream
28:18
or you want to even understand it we
28:21
take authority
28:22
over it but God has clearly said to me
28:25
there will be
28:25
no civil war there'll be no world war
28:29
three that is not happening these are
28:31
his days to do great things in the earth
28:34
then you can yell at me although all you
28:36
want to do
28:37
i won't care what they say i know what
28:40
God has said and God has a plan for this
28:42
time
28:43
and what he's doing is showing you what
28:45
the other side believes
28:47
so you don't get caught in all that
28:48
stuff but in this time on the earth
28:51
freedom liberty justice and
28:53
righteousness is coming to our country
28:55
the truth is coming to our country there
28:58
will be people you never believed
29:01
this is after the election would ever
29:03
get saved
29:04
but many will and guess what they'll do
29:08
they'll be witnesses to what was already
29:10
going on
29:11
yeah this is a time for justice that
29:13
means the
29:14
the darkness will be exposed not just
29:17
spiritual darkness but the physical
29:19
plans of wicked man are going to fully
29:21
be exposed in this time
29:23
and when that happens the light gets
29:25
greater
29:26
we carry the light of God in us and the
29:29
bible says even when great darkness
29:30
comes on the earth that will never be
29:32
greater than the light or glory of God
29:34
you got to remember the part it will
29:35
never be greater than
29:38
God's light in us would be greater than
29:40
the other stuff going on
29:41
so you can look forward to you your
29:43
children your grandchildren your
29:44
great-grandchildren your
29:46
great-great-great-grandchildren
29:47
living in a an amazing place
29:51
there will be a place to come america
29:53
will be the place to come and find God
29:55
such a good word hey let me we have a
29:57
few minutes and let me let's do one fun
29:59
one
30:00
um because we talked about being
30:02
celebratory and
30:04
some people have written and commented
30:05
on that pink hair
30:07
and so i'm going to read you this
30:09
because you've talked about your pink
30:10
hair readily because the lord told you
30:11
to do that
30:12
which i'll ask you about but here's
30:14
here's the question says
30:16
God bless you i have learned so much
30:17
from listening to you you have answered
30:19
many questions for me
30:20
i have a small question since you have
30:22
pink hair can i assume God does not
30:25
mind if we color our hair and wear
30:27
makeup and jewelry in the bible
30:29
i re read that we should not wear
30:32
jewelry paint our faces or
30:33
our bodies or dye our hair i felt in my
30:36
heart that he was referring to something
30:37
different
30:38
than what i understand yes many people
30:42
well they'll they'll interpret sometimes
30:44
with head knowledge
30:46
most of the things in the bible were
30:48
said in a specific time on the earth
30:52
that those scriptures especially in
30:54
leviticus
30:55
are related to what was going on the
30:57
earth then in that time
30:59
and that time they were cutting designs
31:02
and images of satan on their bodies
31:05
they were taking parts of their body and
31:06
offering sacrifices on arnold's
31:09
um you know alters to these false Gods
31:12
they were
31:13
the the prostitutes i'll just say it the
31:14
prostitutes in those days
31:16
were painting their faces like
31:18
ridiculous to stand out
31:21
or they had gold things threaded through
31:23
the hair and stuff
31:24
so when it was talking about that those
31:26
days
31:27
that was going on even some of it up and
31:30
not nothing
31:30
necessarily cutting your body stuff but
31:32
even up into the times the disciples
31:34
there were some that were still doing
31:36
that
31:37
therefore God made regulations that you
31:40
should not do that
31:41
this is a different time we're living in
31:43
a different day and age
31:44
i i have God in my heart the father son
31:47
and holy spirit
31:48
and i represent heaven on this earth
31:52
that's why i'm sent to everybody here
31:54
God created the rainbow
31:57
okay it's okay the pink here doesn't
32:01
change this is what God said
32:02
it doesn't change who you are i'm taking
32:04
what's on the inside which is
32:06
celebration
32:07
and putting it on the outside so it can
32:10
clearly be seen
32:12
most people in heaven have highlights
32:14
put in by
32:15
light they will actually create a way on
32:17
the earth to do that on the earth down
32:19
here on the earth
32:20
and the whole thing about tattooing
32:22
yourself you have to understand the
32:23
bible says
32:24
God marks people he's marking a hundred
32:27
and forty four thousand with a specific
32:29
mark that you will see
32:31
on them he marked cain so people would
32:33
not kill him
32:35
he puts his mark on people when he said
32:38
do not mark yourself this
32:39
also is in leviticus do not mark
32:41
yourself with the marks of the dead
32:44
that's the whole scripture that's that
32:46
whole scripture
32:47
he was saying don't put marks on
32:49
yourself that represent satan
32:51
or hell or evil because in the beginning
32:54
that's what mostly people were putting
32:55
on themselves
32:57
and i have to say if you're young if
32:59
you're under a certain age and you live
33:01
at home you would certainly have to get
33:03
permission from your parents to do that
33:05
but God himself is now having different
33:08
images put on people
33:10
to represent him it's just a generation
33:13
wow now he had said is it true that
33:15
there were that
33:17
i don't know if we could elected him
33:19
specifically but
33:20
generally speaking beauty salons in
33:23
heaven where people get their hair
33:24
changed
33:26
well you know i can tell you from my own
33:28
experience that these people have a
33:30
gift i not you might hear myself
33:33
it would not look this good you may not
33:36
like the color but it certainly
33:38
is done well so there are people that
33:40
God gave gifts to do hair you probably
33:43
go get your hair cut or your hair done a
33:45
certain place
33:46
you probably don't do it yourself and if
33:48
you didn't have to you wouldn't
33:49
people have gifts to do that so if you
33:52
go home to heaven
33:53
and you're using the gift he put in you
33:56
what would they be doing there
33:58
they put diamond dust in people's hair
34:00
uh your hair can be long or
34:02
short it's whatever you want in heaven
34:04
that's the way heaven is
34:06
nobody does it this is a thing nobody
34:09
does it so they look better than anyone
34:10
else
34:11
and the reason why people have gemstones
34:14
applied
34:15
on their hands and they worship in the
34:16
throne room it reflects the rainbow of
34:19
God all over
34:20
so many people do in heaven they're
34:22
doing as a celebration of God
34:24
of jesus of holy spirit it's a whole
34:27
different life
34:28
selfishness and covetousness
34:32
and hate rejection uh
34:35
anger those don't even exist in heaven
34:38
it's not
34:38
in you because you're living in the
34:40
presence of God
34:42
your your best friend is jesus christ
34:44
you don't
34:45
have that in you to even do something
34:48
they would be against God or make
34:50
yourself
34:50
more important you are there to still
34:52
inspire people
34:54
and to make people love each other help
34:56
people love one another
34:58
people have all kinds of events people
35:00
want to help them do that so
35:02
that's heaven that's the culture of
35:04
heaven and of course we all know
35:06
scripture our father who is in heaven
35:08
holy is your name
35:09
your kingdom come that's heaven your
35:12
will be done
35:13
on this earth just like it is in heaven
35:15
in other words he wants us to live on
35:17
earth
35:18
free of all of that fear and lack and
35:21
hate and judging it's not in heaven he
35:25
would like the body of christ to be able
35:27
to live like that
35:28
wow loving you you have to spend time
35:31
with jesus christ he has to be your
35:33
number one
35:34
but this world will know us one day
35:37
by our love for each other that's the
35:39
body of christ the world will
35:41
know us by our love for each other so
35:42
that is still coming
35:45
wow well kat that's our time today
35:48

02:38
we're gonna have fun
02:39
tell the people Kat what you were
02:41
talking about the lions here you're in
02:43
jacksonville
02:44
florida yes i am talk about the lines
02:47
that
02:48
were out there today the lines have been
02:50
crazy all along
02:52
um even in the early voting it was the
02:54
same way
02:55
this is definitely a trump city and
02:58
people go wild every time it gets
03:00
anywhere near here
03:01
but we've been people been doing their
03:03
own mobile rallies even here in northern
03:05
city they've got
03:06
huge six-foot trump flags on their
03:08
vehicles and they're driving around
03:10
blowing their horns and everyone is
03:12
excited
03:13
but the the voting precinct that i will
03:16
be voting at once my mom is ready
03:19
um it's right down the street from here
03:21
and jen was going somewhere at 6
03:22
45 a.m this morning and the lines
03:26
were at the precinct outside in all the
03:29
way across the parking lot
03:30
down into the next whole block and the
03:32
next lot were people waiting to vote i
03:35
am positive for trump and it's been like
03:38
that wherever i drove today
03:40
all the lines were like that i'm telling
03:42
you make sure
03:43
people you vote vote vote today
03:48
and i do want to add something even and
03:51
we've learned this from experience
03:53
even if they say on the news this state
03:56
has gone
03:57
to buying or this states don't listen to
04:00
them
04:00
they don't really know the full thing of
04:02
that yet and i bet i remember
04:04
back when it was like gore and um
04:07
bush were running and they caught
04:09
florida for gore
04:11
and some people left the polls don't do
04:14
that you stay there
04:15
you get your vote in no matter what
04:17
because guess what when they recounted
04:19
votes in florida it did
04:21
cause bush to win yeah why aren't you
04:25
don't get out of line statements get
04:27
your vote in
04:28
even if they call it for trump how how
04:31
do we know that they wouldn't have to
04:33
have a recall or a recount so you got to
04:35
stay in line even if they called up for
04:36
trump and you're still alive
04:38
go vote and vote that's absolutely that
04:41
is absolutely necessary
04:43
now let me make a couple of
04:44
announcements i was going to do and i
04:46
forgot
04:46
uh i've written these things down john
04:48
some of you heard yesterday that johnny
04:50
in law was his word of the lord
04:52
that put Kat and i we've been friends
04:54
already in doing things together but he
04:56
said
04:56
he saw us doing 10 days in a row of the
04:59
elections and
05:00
we're going to end the 10th will be
05:01
tomorrow the day after the election
05:03
yeah and so i really want to shout out
05:05
to johnny and thank him he's a high
05:07
highly gifted prophet yeah sure and he
05:10
had a word that we published yesterday
05:12
be sure you go on
05:13
and read that word it's very important
05:15
and then he'll have some contact
05:16
information there i really encourage you
05:18
to support his ministry
05:19
and along that line i'm having julie uh
05:22
several times during the broadcast she
05:24
will be putting a note from me
05:26
because it will scroll up so people will
05:27
lose track and they'll have contact
05:29
information for he can donate
05:31
to Kats ministry or or where to get her
05:33
books revealing heaven
05:35
and and if anyone misses that tell them
05:37
how to get your
05:38
books first and then the tr
05:41
you have a ministry site and that's
05:43
probably too long to just
05:44
say on the air i'm just going to say it
05:46
real quick my
05:47
website is revealinghaving.com
05:51
if you know about my book it's actually
05:53
the same name as my book revealing
05:54
heaven.com is where you find out about
05:56
my events and you can buy a lot of the
05:58
products about heaven
06:00
like i don't do demons this is one of
06:03
our cups like here we make all kinds of
06:05
things that
06:06
that speak on behalf of heaven and God
06:09
so revealingheaven.com if you want
06:11
more of the uh the revelation you can go
06:15
to
06:15
KatKerr.com that's k-a-t-k-e-r-r
06:19
com that's that's that website is
06:21
totally different than revealing heaven
06:23
it gives you all kinds of truths and
06:25
revelation on how to live your life
06:27
and it's also the only place you can
06:30
actually go and give online to me
06:32
revealing heaven.com you can't do that
06:34
so whatever
06:35
we are blessed we're excited about this
06:37
election this is one of the most
06:39
important elections in
06:40
all of america to be really honored with
06:43
you
06:44
and so many people millions of people
06:46
are praying not just here but even
06:48
around the world
06:49
for for trump for this election
06:52
you can there's several people have
06:54
asked me this question
06:55
um and we could have hit it yesterday in
06:58
fact be sure you get yesterday's
07:00
yesterday's broadcast was awesome go
07:02
down on facebook and go to youtube with
07:04
some
07:04
youtube elijah's streams and you can get
07:06
it was very heavy content
07:08
all the important issues um people were
07:11
asking me
07:12
why do you keep telling why do other
07:14
people tell us we have to pray
07:16
this in and Kat's just saying God's
07:19
decided
07:20
how do those work together or do they
07:22
care how would you answer
07:24
of course they work together he needs
07:25
our words to be released in the earth
07:27
but this is the thing you can go back
07:29
and check it out in the old testament in
07:31
the new testament
07:32
when something was a divine time or it
07:36
was on God's timeline
07:37
that's a whole different time in the
07:40
book of acts it says
07:41
sometimes are only in the hand of God
07:44
himself that's the father
07:46
and no one else has authority not
07:48
authority but they not necessarily know
07:50
what's going to happen in those times
07:52
unless the father reveals it this is one
07:54
of those times go read in the book of
07:56
acts go search for it
07:58
but it does say some of these times are
07:59
only in the hand of the father
08:01
and this is a time he's assigned on this
08:03
earth to take america back
08:06
make an example for the rest of the
08:07
world to follow after to know God
08:10
and to do great things in the earth so
08:12
he has decided
08:14
and he's laying his hand on this country
08:16
but you
08:17
you do back it up with prayer while
08:19
you're voting
08:21
before you vote after you vote keep on
08:23
praying
08:24
there you go season which is a 24 season
08:27
24 year season of God but he does need
08:30
us and the way we respond
08:32
is by prayer and declaration declaring
08:35
is
08:35
as high levels of prayer i declare and
08:38
decree God will have his will
08:40
his way this day the trump
08:43
went he chose him he appointed him he
08:45
anointed him
08:46
he is going to make a difference in this
08:48
country that's still
08:49
prayer declaring and decreeing the bible
08:52
says
08:53
well you dare to declare God will match
08:56
that decree
08:57
and so it's that's another a way to get
08:59
an agreement with him
09:00
and a lot of people don't know that
09:01
either so i remember
09:03
this is like i think it was 30 years ago
09:06
a young prophetess young woman
09:08
prophesied over us it was when i was
09:10
first learning about
09:11
this uh the lights of this has existed
09:14
for 23 years but this is like 30 years
09:16
ago
09:16
and she said basically you stephen what
09:20
what you're called we didn't know about
09:22
the elijah's at the time
09:23
but she said if you will prophesy this
09:25
and that and she would name things
09:27
God will back your act no one was
09:29
preaching decrees back then
09:30
nobody was talking about decrees but she
09:33
was saying if you
09:34
and i thought wait a minute i'll
09:35
prophesy something and God will back
09:38
that up and so that's the same thing
09:40
that's the same
09:42
if you say something out in faith that
09:44
is the lord's will
09:45
he'll say it's hillary do the forest gum
09:47
thing you'll go okay
09:49
well i'll just do that you know it's
09:50
like it just comes along
09:52
and says he's my guy or she's my God
09:55
whatever you know and and then he'll
09:57
he'll cause it to happen i wanted to
10:00
mention that
10:01
some of you are watching from many
10:03
different countries today
10:04
thank you all that write in from
10:06
different countries
10:07
and you ask you tell us that you are
10:09
praying for our president
10:11
that means more than we can tell you we
10:14
don't get
10:14
very many opportunities to tell the
10:16
world thank you for praying
10:18
but that's amazing more than any time in
10:21
my lifetime people
10:22
are saying to me donald trump being
10:25
re-elected will help our nation
10:28
yes that's right the thing what is God
10:30
showing you anything about how the
10:31
nations are going to be blessed
10:33
the nations will be plus because when
10:35
God has
10:36
his choice in office and it's not just
10:39
for america that he's chosen trump
10:42
trump is a very international person he
10:44
understands big
10:46
business and that is so needed around
10:48
this world
10:49
some countries know nothing but war
10:52
and God actually said i will bait them
10:55
with big business to drop their weapons
10:57
and start
10:58
big business in their country so that
10:59
their lives will be better
11:01
and he chose trump to be able to do that
11:03
he's already done it in several
11:05
countries he's reached out to other
11:06
countries
11:07
he's waiting to go see more leaders in
11:09
other countries because
11:10
they want to shift their country into a
11:13
better way
11:14
of life and trump is very good at doing
11:16
that that's what he did in america and
11:18
he's going to do again
11:19
and so it's going to make a major
11:21
difference and God said i need those
11:23
leaders shifted
11:25
so he can then shape that nation for
11:27
himself
11:28
so this is about america today but it's
11:31
really about the rest of the world
11:34
and what God's plans are for many
11:36
different countries
11:37
and so he will be involved in that also
11:39
trump will be involved in that also
11:41
that's good i remember when i was
11:43
stunned when he went over and people
11:45
were just laughing at him
11:46
and scoring him as you know they went
11:48
over to north korea
11:50
and he began to talk to kim jong-un i
11:53
think is his name
11:54
began to tell him he needed to build
11:55
condos in this coastal town and
11:58
begin to build up his country and i was
12:00
thinking what he went over there to make
12:02
peace and then i
12:03
now this is really what you're saying
12:05
yeah he
12:06
he will help countries build businesses
12:08
so they don't have to do war anymore
12:10
they can start right that's exactly what
12:13
God's plan is to happen
12:15
i'm not saying the whole world will
12:17
change but there will be major lenience
12:18
that will shift that you never
12:20
expected to shift people reach out with
12:23
help okay he's not coming with war he
12:26
doesn't want war not really doesn't want
12:28
porn but he's not letting
12:29
evil run this earth anymore and God
12:32
doesn't like evil either because it
12:34
crushes it steals life away from people
12:36
the some countries even get rid of their
12:39
own people
12:39
and that is wrong even to God that is
12:42
wrong and so God
12:43
wants to shift he's got a whole new
12:46
platform called
12:46
shifting government leaders so he can
12:49
shape the nation
12:50
and trump is definitely one of those
12:52
people and he's the only
12:54
president that has literally walked
12:56
right into north korea
12:58
without all kinds of guards and army
13:01
around him
13:02
you know he actually looked over the
13:03
line and went in and shook his hand and
13:05
he was
13:06
serious about helping him in big
13:07
business and his and
13:09
in his heart was being shifted to do big
13:11
business and he got impressed
13:13
uh i'm talking about kim the the north
13:16
korean president
13:18
uh impressed with the olympics right
13:20
there in south korea and what it
13:22
produced for that country so
13:24
God really was touching him God by the
13:26
way we'll have one korea
13:28
and that will happen without a war or
13:30
without communism that's God's word for
13:32
korea do you have any sense of timing on
13:35
the reunification
13:40
when the koreas will reunite any sense
13:42
of timing on that
13:43
i it will not it's definitely going to
13:45
be probably over the next several years
13:47
because when God starts something like
13:49
that it's not something you can just
13:51
drop and leave on the wayside
13:53
i also know the royals are going to be
13:55
shifting in england
13:57
i have a lot maybe we can talk about
13:58
this another time
14:00
after the elections but britain is going
14:03
to be great britain is going to be doing
14:04
great things with with
14:06
america so don't just wipe them off the
14:08
list there's other countries too that
14:10
God's going to bring together to work
14:12
together
14:12
with america on different projects now
14:16
i want to talk for a minute you said a
14:18
couple broadcasts ago
14:20
you said it a couple of times that
14:22
there's some at least one or more
14:24
media companies that are going to go
14:26
down and
14:28
you know a few minutes ago i mentioned
14:29
uh a young prophetess 30 years ago this
14:31
same young prophetess 30 years ago
14:34
she was in the spirit she would go
14:36
almost at a trance and she would be you
14:38
know just hardly there but she would
14:40
begin to prophesy
14:41
and out of her mouth one day she said
14:44
i'm not going to say the name of the
14:45
company i won't say the name of the
14:46
company but she said da
14:48
da da da is coming down and i thought
14:51
whoa because it was the only thing
14:52
out there fox news did not exist at the
14:55
time so you can do that on subtraction
14:58
so tell me anything what kind of
15:01
uh how big of a change are we going to
15:04
expect as far as some media companies
15:06
losing their place
15:07
i can tell you it will happen within
15:09
this next four years
15:10
one of them will lose their place and
15:13
actually
15:14
a part of that will be because of the
15:16
mind
15:17
of the the leaders either the people who
15:20
own it
15:21
those who are at the top have allowed
15:23
themselves their own souls to be
15:25
compromised
15:27
that when trump wins and he will win it
15:29
will seem like
15:30
it's all over to them and they have
15:33
wasted all these years
15:35
really for what they were called to do
15:37
was they were called to do to give the
15:39
news in an
15:40
unbiased way and they'll compromise
15:44
their own mouths and what's in their
15:45
souls they can't even
15:47
they can't have they can't function
15:48
properly and what they were what they
15:50
established themselves to do because of
15:52
the hate and the corruption
15:54
and i'm talking about the corruption of
15:55
their own soul that they their business
15:57
will begin to go down
15:58
anyway advertising will go down oh
16:00
things are going to start going down
16:02
because of all their own projections of
16:04
what they said would happen
16:05
are not going to happen and they can't
16:08
let go
16:08
of that hate because it's in them it's
16:11
not going to bode well for them
16:13
and i'm sure that others will be
16:14
affected but there will be one that is a
16:16
major one that will no longer
16:18
exist and or someone will buy it out and
16:22
turn it into something else
16:24
that i'm removing the seat of authority
16:26
of some people
16:27
who are in big business and the seat of
16:29
authority
16:30
of those who are politically not just
16:32
incorrect but politically
16:34
uh defiled that he won't have them i
16:37
don't know if that means he'll just take
16:38
him off the earth which he's used that
16:40
term with me before
16:41
and that one of those a couple of people
16:43
was like castro and the other person who
16:45
was i can't remember her name
16:48
who's like the surgeon general on floor
16:49
or somebody somewhere
16:51
and they kept bashing and saying and
16:53
trump will never be
16:54
uh president in my lifetime and they
16:56
died she died
16:58
of saying that and i'm telling you
17:00
cannot touch God's anointed
17:02
and not not pay not pay some uh there's
17:06
going to be some kind of a
17:07
yeah i mean only it's like only God
17:09
knows when you've said
17:11
it the last time and he's had enough
17:13
there's a point
17:14
where God runs out of his mercy and
17:16
he'll say sometimes it's just
17:18
you're removed from the earth um other
17:20
times
17:22
you know they lose their salvation
17:24
because they didn't receive the lord
17:25
before they removed the earth i guess we
17:26
could put it that way but
17:28
what about uh has uh you know none of us
17:31
saw this stuff coming with trump
17:34
uh he's had three or four uh nominations
17:36
to the
17:37
for the nobel peace prize that the media
17:39
won't even talk about
17:40
and he's having all of these this
17:43
unprecedented
17:45
historic countries that are beginning to
17:47
to talk peace and have already made
17:49
peace with israel that's right
17:51
i mean i i don't even know how to ask
17:52
this question the question is how did he
17:54
do that but
17:56
obviously God anointed him but is he
17:59
just doing this on the flyer has he been
18:01
planning this stuff
18:02
in his heart for years what's your
18:03
thoughts are you talking about trump
18:05
trump yeah trump always has
18:09
because he's a great businessman and
18:11
really is he's really quite intelligent
18:13
although people don't give him that
18:15
he's quite intelligent and that's one of
18:17
the reasons why he himself sometimes are
18:19
shocked at the hate
18:20
and stuff because in his mind he's like
18:22
this is to help i'm here to help i'm
18:24
helping
18:25
make things better and when corruption's
18:28
not in you
18:29
it doesn't even come to your mind like i
18:31
don't have a corrupt mind i don't have a
18:33
compromised mind
18:35
i am not ignorant of things going on but
18:37
i'm innocent of them and trump is the
18:39
same way
18:40
he's not necessarily ignorant of all
18:42
that stuff but he's totally innocent of
18:43
being apart or being what they call him
18:46
but he won't stop at what God has put in
18:48
his heart and that is to help
18:50
and to build and to grow things and and
18:52
he is real serious
18:54
and when he saw opportunities when he
18:56
began to look around see opportunities
18:58
where he could help
18:59
he stepped out and contacted these other
19:01
leaders and said i
19:02
i can help you i have a plan i can help
19:05
you with and
19:06
and they didn't say no crazy i mean the
19:09
anointing is
19:10
it's like it's as if trump came out of
19:13
his shell or came out of the
19:14
the wisdom came out of him at the same
19:16
time scales fell from the
19:18
these leaders eyes so they could see an
19:20
opportunity
19:21
because they've never been able to see
19:23
it all these different republicans and
19:24
democratic presidents have made all
19:26
these promises
19:27
and had all of these conflicts of
19:30
peacemaking and it always
19:32
falls apart and while he was picking up
19:34
on
19:35
picking on trump mercilessly he was it
19:38
was like he didn't seem to mind because
19:39
he was over there
19:40
let them focus on that shiny object over
19:42
there because he was over there making
19:44
peace in israel it was crazy
19:45
right he was doing something no one had
19:47
done before and
19:48
that's the difference in being anointed
19:51
or you appoint yourself to do it
19:53
you really want to do something but one
19:55
God says you're it i'm
19:56
putting anointing on you it gives you
19:58
the ability or a gift to influence
20:02
now people have that gift but they use
20:04
it for the wrong reason or on the wrong
20:06
side but trump's not using it
20:08
incorrectly he's using it for the way
20:10
God designed it to be
20:11
and he picked an imperfect person i mean
20:14
i always
20:15
at winston churchill if you on if you
20:16
were around at the time you would know
20:18
he was probably one of the rudest
20:20
crudest people not
20:21
right uh in the world at that time but
20:24
he saved
20:25
england because he was bold he couldn't
20:27
he was fearless he couldn't be bought he
20:28
couldn't be
20:29
threatened and when when God has an
20:31
anointing on you
20:33
then that is what helps you to get in
20:35
those doors and get those things done
20:37
and trump is not going to give up on
20:39
this country
20:41
that's something has he has the lord
20:42
showing you anything as far as
20:44
i believe we've had conversations but i
20:46
can't remember specifics
20:48
as far as inventions and cures that are
20:51
now going to be able to be released
20:52
because of this next few years
20:54
has he showed stuff like that absolutely
20:57
yes he's had me talk about that for some
20:59
time
21:00
uh even before trump was running for
21:02
president
21:03
he did tell me that there'll be five uh
21:05
five new energy sources
21:07
that we don't even have right now and
21:09
they will come
21:11
probably within a time frame because
21:13
when a prophet says something it could
21:15
happen like within a few days
21:17
five years 10 years 15 years or 20 years
21:20
usually not beyond that unless God has
21:22
said this will happen 100 years from now
21:24
and God even does that
21:26
but this is something for our lifetime
21:28
that these
21:29
cures for diseases cancer will not exist
21:32
i really believe they've already found
21:34
the cure
21:34
they don't want people to know it and i
21:36
know that sounds harsh but
21:38
life is going right now that those who
21:40
want to keep things from us those who
21:42
don't want to are the ones who reveal it
21:45
and then put it in place and this is the
21:47
time right now because of all the
21:49
exposure we've had a lot of exposure of
21:51
the darkness of the corruption
21:53
uh that is out there very blatant
21:56
like satan gets to a place where he
21:58
doesn't care what he's saying anymore
22:00
he doesn't try to hide it and that's
22:01
what he's doing right now
22:03
and that he wants to take over and he
22:05
really thinks he has the power and satan
22:07
actually thinks he has the people to do
22:08
it
22:09
but he does not God's people are rising
22:12
up they're coming against the darkness
22:13
they don't want that kind of a life
22:15
they want a future in a home and they
22:17
want a family
22:18
and that's still the majority in this
22:21
country and so the other side will not
22:23
win
22:23
they don't even know they're being used
22:25
but they will not win but there's new
22:27
inventions coming
22:28
once we step into this continued season
22:31
of trump
22:32
and even the next years after that
22:35
it will increase it's going to begin to
22:37
increase trump's just going to push
22:39
through get a lot done
22:40
but those coming after him like pence
22:42
and others
22:43
great men of God will get things
22:46
done much faster because trump was here
22:49
because he did what God called him to do
22:52
and there will be inventions we never
22:53
even dreamed of having that will make
22:55
life
22:56
less expensive for us that will be
22:58
available to people everywhere
23:00
and so yeah God has got a big plan for
23:02
this season
23:03
and this is just another part of that of
23:05
a bulldozing things to move them out of
23:08
the way
23:08
building up things that need to be built
23:10
and providing things for
23:12
america that america needs to be able to
23:15
prosper
23:16
and travel and especially the body of
23:18
christ is going to open things up first
23:20
like never before
23:21
but also just for good businessmen have
23:24
integrity
23:25
so this is a great time to be alive on
23:27
the earth
23:28
and this is this is to clarify some of
23:30
the that will be watching this they're
23:32
waiting for the rapture and all that
23:33
any moment but you're saying we're
23:35
coming into a kingdom
23:37
age however that's defined where
23:40
where the inventions renaissance people
23:43
will be talking renaissance there will
23:44
be
23:45
i think it was bob jones one of those
23:46
said they'll even be anti-gravity
23:49
they're having flying car prototypes
23:51
right now that are that are
23:53
literally in the air there are so this
23:56
is a kingdom when what do you
23:58
is i think you said this a few years ago
24:00
we merged into the kingdom age is that
24:02
about right
24:03
yes and in 2012 we stepped off a
24:06
threshold of spiritual time
24:09
into a whole new time that God
24:11
continually talks about and he calls it
24:13
the kingdom age
24:14
jesus talked about the gospel of the
24:17
kingdom
24:18
that was a place to operate from that
24:20
was authority and dominion that we would
24:22
have
24:22
that was inventions and all kinds of
24:25
life-changing
24:26
the manifested sons and daughters
24:28
standing up literally speaking to the
24:30
land the sea in the air
24:31
i know bob also talked about that kind
24:33
of stuff the things would change
24:34
immediately
24:35
in those areas and especially taking
24:37
authority over destruction
24:39
even natural destruction on the earth
24:41
it's going to all
24:42
shift in this time that we're in so you
24:45
can see why God
24:46
can't and will not let go of the people
24:49
he wants in
24:50
office in these years setting it up for
24:53
the next 100 years whether people
24:55
believe it or not
24:56
roll up that rapture rug because your
24:58
kids your grandkids and your great
25:00
grandkids will be
25:01
ruling uh with their crown on because
25:03
the word says we're kings and priests
25:05
and two are God
25:06
those are spiritual levels of authority
25:09
and dominion he's not talking about
25:11
natural kings how important is that he
25:14
wrote it on himself i am the king of
25:16
kings of the spiritual kings
25:18
and the lord of lords those are
25:19
spiritual lords those are levels of
25:21
authority
25:22
we haven't even seen in the earth yet
25:23
but the people will be carrying it are
25:25
already here
25:27
wow let's do this in the last few
25:29
minutes let's let me get a couple
25:30
questions and people have sent some
25:32
questions and there's too many
25:33
to ask them all but i'm going to pick
25:35
the ones that seem to have the most
25:36
for everybody you talk now i'm going to
25:39
we're get we're about to approach the
25:40
christmas season i'm going to give you
25:42
two questions that are going to seem
25:44
completely unrelated but they're a
25:45
little bit related
25:47
you've seen chris a place where
25:49
christmas wasn't here i'm going to ask
25:50
you about that
25:51
and a completely seemingly unrelated
25:53
question is one of the ladies that asked
25:55
me about
25:56
christmas wanted to know
25:59
what about those people who committed
26:00
suicide do some of them go
26:02
to heaven and have you seen some of
26:04
those people in heaven even famous ones
26:07
for and she asked nothing big crosby uh
26:11
uh committed suicide but she said is has
26:13
she seen being crossboned
26:14
i'm just uh honoring her by asking the
26:17
question that doesn't mean you've seen
26:18
him but
26:19
i have seen him you have i have seen him
26:23
and
26:23
and God clearly defined when you
26:26
when you're a revelator God clearly on
26:29
purpose
26:29
defines things that are in his word
26:32
especially
26:33
to bring what his purpose was for
26:35
putting that scripture in there
26:38
revelation comes only from the heart of
26:40
God it does not come from
26:41
man and that's why people sometimes are
26:44
quite shocked at some of the things
26:46
because it reveals who God is and what
26:48
his purpose is
26:49
his word says it talks about taking your
26:52
own life it does talk about that
26:54
but God defined to me on purpose
26:57
one time i was going to travel somewhere
26:59
he said you will talk about the subject
27:01
of suicide now that wasn't on my list to
27:04
talk about it was in pennsylvania i
27:05
believe it was
27:06
he said but you will tell them my
27:08
interpretation of that
27:10
and he said first of all get the
27:11
dictionary out look up the word
27:13
suicide and i did and it says knowingly
27:16
willingly intelligently ending your own
27:19
life knowing exactly what you're doing
27:22
so what is happening to most people is
27:25
not that
27:26
they're ending their suffering which God
27:28
said the ending their suffering is
27:30
different
27:30
that they cannot bear the pain either
27:33
mental
27:34
emotional or physical that they're going
27:35
through they want to end the pain
27:37
they don't necessarily want to stop
27:39
living he doesn't call that suicide
27:41
and especially if they know him he's
27:43
certainly not concerned he's not going
27:45
to be unjust and send people to hell
27:48
let's say you were in an accident and
27:49
you were given medication
27:51
and it altered the way you thought and
27:53
that does happen actually in some of the
27:54
media
27:55
says it brings suicidal thoughts or
27:58
despair
27:59
it'll take you in there if you've been
28:00
mentally tortured or emotionally
28:03
tortured even physically
28:05
it caused great drama and even in
28:07
children sometimes will end their
28:09
suffering
28:10
not because they don't want to live God
28:13
does not
28:13
look at that as suicide it's called
28:15
ending your suffering
28:17
those people will go to heaven i saw
28:19
many people in heaven and when he was
28:21
teaching this he actually took me to
28:22
heaven and
28:23
showed me people that were there that
28:25
had ended their suffering
28:27
so you can take that or not take that
28:29
this is revelation from God
28:31
he said because you were standing for
28:33
your family members salvation
28:35
and i do know even well-known people
28:37
which i won't mention any of their names
28:39
uh one of them had a son that ended his
28:41
suffering and God on purpose took me to
28:43
heaven
28:44
but by the way he was getting messages
28:46
from christians all over it's too bad
28:48
your son is burning in hell which was
28:49
God was not happy about that
28:51
and this is the thing the world sent
28:53
this person i'm so sorry for your loss
28:56
but the christians were bashing him
28:58
saying his son was in hell
28:59
and God said i don't stand for that so
29:01
he took me and showed me this young man
29:03
in his father's mansion in heaven that
29:05
was being built and on it was a trophy
29:08
in the mantle that said satan zero
29:10
God won which means satan didn't get him
29:13
didn't get that young man
29:14
God did and so he said no one has the
29:17
right to choose this but me
29:19
that's what God was saying and he said
29:21
many people will be shocked and
29:22
surprised to see
29:23
family members that did make it to
29:25
heaven
29:26
because what they did was in their
29:29
suffering
29:30
and not he said now i tell you someone
29:32
who does commit suicide the terrorists
29:35
the terrorist bombers and people who on
29:37
purpose plot and play in their own life
29:39
to be given or taken
29:40
for destruction to somebody else that is
29:43
suicide they willingly knowingly
29:46
flew that plane into the towers on that
29:48
day
29:49
knowing they would all die that is real
29:52
suicide
29:53
but people who are happening in agony or
29:56
torment
29:57
and they end that suffering they see no
29:59
other way out
30:00
and that's not called suicide
30:05
about christmas really quick um of
30:08
course christmas would be celebrated in
30:10
heaven
30:11
why wouldn't it be nick lives there and
30:14
i'm talking to the one who was the
30:15
original
30:16
but they call santa claus today saint
30:18
nicholas it was really
30:20
the real person he was actually a
30:22
prophet i believe he was from turkey
30:25
and he stood up for the gospel when no
30:27
one else would
30:28
he actually used his staff for more than
30:30
leading the reindeer around
30:31
and he actually would take out um take
30:34
it out on some of these people who were
30:36
blaspheming jesus's name
30:38
in the town and he took them down
30:39
literally i mean he had like a fight
30:41
with them
30:42
he wasn't tolerating anyone speaking
30:44
against jesus christ and he was well
30:45
known in his area for
30:47
that type of a person but he also had a
30:50
great love for children those in need
30:52
he was a very wealthy person when he was
30:55
young his parents themselves were
30:57
extremely wealthy
30:58
and so when they passed he got he got
31:00
that money and he used it for good
31:02
so he was a a a prophet of God he was a
31:06
believer
31:07
in every sense of the word and yet he
31:09
literally did
31:10
have toys made he would deliver them to
31:12
the children at night
31:13
in the beginning outside their doors
31:15
till people were stealing them
31:17
then he had the parents hang stockings
31:19
and he would go in and put the toys in
31:21
the stockings so
31:22
this is his gift when you go to heaven
31:25
you will use that gift whether you're a
31:27
singer a designer
31:28
whether you uh i don't know have horses
31:30
at a range for people to ride
31:32
on you design rodeos you design
31:34
amusement parks
31:35
you will use that gift he put in you in
31:38
heaven to bless everybody
31:40
so it would be wrong for nicholas not to
31:43
have a toy shop
31:44
in heaven that he designed uh toys for
31:47
children that you could visit anytime
31:49
and God on purpose calls it christmas
31:52
town
31:53
that means christ that means the mass of
31:55
christ
31:56
that's why non-believers or the liberal
31:59
left
32:00
hate the word christmas they didn't want
32:02
to have it i remember one time they
32:03
would call them family trees they
32:05
wouldn't even call them christmas trees
32:06
because christ's name was in it
32:08
so stop bashing christmas people it's
32:11
the one time of the year God said that
32:12
people help others that they forgive
32:14
others it's a time for families to come
32:16
together
32:17
and it does exist and yes it snows there
32:20
all the time
32:20
oh wow i remember my friend bob jones
32:24
prophet bob jones went to be with the
32:25
lord i think it was 2014.
32:27
he used to say God's got a lot more on
32:29
his mind than a fat man
32:31
in a red suit so quit worrying about it
32:35
so people get really religious and and
32:38
they'll call it a pagan holiday and it's
32:40
not
32:44
you know if we go to disneyland and they
32:46
decorate the trees there outside we can
32:48
decorate trees you know
32:50
that was that you talked yesterday but
32:51
it was a whole different time period
32:53
back then where people said well you
32:54
know you brought trees in and you
32:56
worship them
32:57
people i've never seen anyone worship a
32:59
christmas tree in my whole life
33:00
i've never seen it either and actually
33:02
the lights on there are supposed to
33:04
represent the lights that were in the
33:05
sky on the day that christ was um
33:08
born that's what they actually supposed
33:10
to represent on the trees
33:12
God lit up the sky with lights
33:15
and one massive star on the day his son
33:18
was born
33:19
and they do actually celebrate in
33:22
christmas town in heaven the birth of
33:24
christ
33:25
and they have huge trees and he puts
33:27
little real stars
33:28
real stars on all these trees and they
33:31
sing to jesus christ
33:32
because he visits there often and just
33:34
so people who have narrow minds or don't
33:37
want to believe this
33:38
you can't discount what children see and
33:40
there was a little girl i didn't ever
33:42
meet in california she was six
33:44
her name is hiro and her dad wrote me
33:48
uh she never saw any of my stuff or
33:50
watch me but he wrote me
33:52
wanting to know if this was true he said
33:54
his little six-year-old girl woke up one
33:56
day and ran up to him and said daddy
33:58
i went to christmas village and they had
34:01
trees with stars that same
34:03
and they had presents everywhere and the
34:06
snow was blue and pink
34:08
and it was beautiful and and he he
34:10
didn't know what he didn't know what to
34:11
think about it he was so shocked
34:13
so he did know that he had found that
34:16
i've been to heaven he asked me i said
34:17
yes
34:18
she actually went to christmas she went
34:20
to christmas town
34:21
and that really exists in heaven and
34:23
when i went to california to speak
34:25
she actually made me a big candy cane
34:27
cookie to thank me
34:29
for confirming that what she had seen
34:31
was true so there's evidence from the
34:32
mouths of children
34:34
that this place exists in heaven a few
34:37
years ago i was
34:38
pondering all that the lord began to
34:39
show me another
34:41
even another interpretation that not
34:43
that this was the only one but jesus
34:45
was the light of the world who hung on a
34:48
tree
34:49
and below him the light shone down and
34:51
he gave gifts to men
34:53
that's right from his death so it's like
34:55
well it's they can't no wonder they
34:56
don't like christmas trees
34:57
even that even though it was probably
34:59
never meant for that it still speaks to
35:01
that
35:02
so it does that's amazing well any last
35:04
words
35:05
before we're kind of out of time for the
35:06
broadcast today any last words about
35:08
voting or anything else
35:09
make sure you get out and vote and stay
35:13
excited the whole proof for doing these
35:16
everyday things for you
35:17
is to put celebration in your heart when
35:20
your soul is so important because that's
35:22
what you will live that's what you will
35:24
talk about
35:25
don't talk about death and destruction
35:27
and everything going wrong
35:28
if you really believe that God has this
35:31
time set aside and honestly
35:33
there's no way in the world as someone
35:35
else could have put up with all the junk
35:37
that trump has put up with and still
35:38
putting up with unless it is a divine
35:41
thing
35:42
so i just want to encourage everybody to
35:44
really step out in faith

DAY 10, NOV. 4: Kat Kerr/Steve Shultz - Election Day +1!
by ElijahStreams Nov 4, 2020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JGP8NUiqok
or https://youtu.be/1JGP8NUiqok

01:35
well
01:36
good morning from beautiful oregon great
01:39
pacific northwest good to see you all i
01:41
bet we know there was at least a few
01:42
minutes ago there was 1500 of you
01:45
standing by yesterday we got up to 3 000
01:47
one time we think we'll talk that today
01:49
i know a lot of you are expecting this
01:51
anyway
01:52
you're gonna be all the more interested
01:54
since the the election is in sort of a
01:57
standby sort of a thing kat had
01:59
mentioned yesterday that the lord had
02:00
told her days ago
02:02
that the 10-day countdown would end the
02:04
day after the election that in other
02:06
words we would do 10 shows the last
02:08
show will be the day after the election
02:10
so without further ado let's bring
02:12
kat in here and here she is all smiles
02:16
Kat how are you this morning well
02:19
i was with God this morning so i
02:21
probably doing really great
02:23
well tell us about that anything you can
02:25
tell us
02:26
well i'm wearing what he told me to wear
02:28
what uh what i wear represents what he's
02:31
involved in and i'm actually wearing my
02:33
prophet's robe today
02:35
and i'm actually wearing the
02:36
constitution of the united states oh yes
02:39
you are
02:40
and i'm also wearing of course parts of
02:42
the american flag that represents thank
02:44
you and i got your red white and blue
02:46
here
02:46
my stars are here yes great well what do
02:50
you have to say
02:51
everything's a little bit in limbo what
02:53
what would you like to
02:54
i'm just going to give you the floor all
02:57
right
02:58
yeah the first thing he said to me was
02:59
when you see the ground begin to move
03:01
you'll know that the lies are about to
03:03
be exposed and i didn't say anything to
03:07
him i just let him speak when he's
03:08
saying something to me
03:09
he was not talking about an earthquake
03:12
per se as much as he was
03:13
a landslide and if you will remember one
03:16
of the things he had me say
03:18
was that trump would win by a landslide
03:20
now in hand's mind in their human mind
03:23
they already put together what they
03:24
think
03:25
that means right many times as we know
03:28
in the word or even just from
03:30
experience ourselves especially as a
03:32
prophet
03:33
that doesn't ever mean what me and
03:36
thinks it means
03:37
and if you will go and check out and see
03:39
how a landslide starts it starts with a
03:42
few stones usually the smaller ones
03:44
start first
03:45
and then that causes the land to move
03:47
beneath the rest of them
03:48
and then eventually nothing can stop
03:51
that landslide from taking place that is
03:53
actually what's going to happen
03:55
and there are many lies that have been
03:57
um
03:58
done many lies that have gone forth
04:00
about things from the left
04:02
and uh i'm not naming names God will
04:05
fully expose all this himself
04:08
um and it will start with a phone call
04:10
that was the other thing he kept saying
04:11
to me this morning
04:12
when you begin to feel the ground move
04:14
which means the landslide
04:16
of exposure is about to begin and then
04:19
he says it will all start with one phone
04:21
call
04:22
and i know how that works i know
04:23
actually what that does
04:25
mean that those who have been
04:26
perpetrating the lie
04:28
have been paid to commit lies or
04:30
stealing or
04:31
cheating will begin to get very nervous
04:34
they're actually already nervous and let
04:37
me tell you conviction is going to come
04:39
upon
04:39
some of them in the lower levels that's
04:42
what he meant about the landslide the
04:44
smaller rocks move first which pulls the
04:46
bigger ones down
04:48
and that's what he meant when he said
04:49
trump will win by a landslide so there's
04:51
there you go that's the difference
04:52
between revelation and what man in their
04:55
head
04:55
thinks that means no way this can be
04:59
stopped it absolutely will not be
05:01
stopped from happening
05:02
the great exposure would take place will
05:04
be again with the few small
05:06
of rocks moving that means people will
05:09
be screaming
05:10
and yelling and pointing fingers because
05:12
they were paid off
05:14
and when you use criminal activities to
05:16
do your work
05:17
or what you have got planned you're
05:19
making the big mistake right then
05:21
when you reach out to create a lie and
05:23
then live that lie
05:25
that lie is going to fall and it's going
05:27
to take the rest of them with them
05:28
that's exactly i don't know how long
05:31
this will take i'm not saying it will
05:32
take weeks at all
05:34
i'm just saying this is what God is
05:36
saying and that's why he had me put my
05:37
prophet's robe on
05:39
i'm speaking his words right now it will
05:41
begin when the ground begins to shake
05:43
when the rocks begin to move
05:45
when the lies begin to be exposed and
05:47
those who are the lower level begin to
05:49
yell
05:49
and point fingers the rocks will move
05:52
the bigger rocks will move and there'll
05:53
be a landslide of exposure
05:56
wow like God said if he said those words
05:58
to me that's what will happen and we'll
06:00
start with a phone call
06:01
and so you need to stay excited all of
06:03
you who hopefully still have celebration
06:05
in you
06:06
and yes i did actually expect all of
06:08
this to happen this happened
06:10
i was up till six in the morning i was
06:13
declaring things for God that he had me
06:15
declare again and as you know i was in
06:17
dc for a purpose
06:19
not just to do the broadcast and so God
06:21
has already got the groundwork laid for
06:23
this to happen
06:24
the glory has been released into many
06:27
places in dc
06:28
in hidden rooms in hidden places
06:31
even over documents they that they
06:34
signed
06:34
saying that they were agreeing to try to
06:37
steal this election
06:38
it's already that part's been done and
06:40
God is already ready for the exposure
06:43
it'll start with a phone call and i can
06:45
tell you you will be shocked to see
06:48
how much exposure comes from that but
06:50
trump will win
06:52
he will be president of the united
06:54
states he will sit in that office for
06:55
four more years
06:57
and God will have his way in this
06:59
country and many people
07:00
especially those who are wicked they
07:02
hate the word of the prophet a true
07:04
prophet because once you hear it with
07:06
your ears it will never
07:08
leave your soul and all those listening
07:10
if you are any of those who've been
07:12
doing this you better run
07:13
and make that phone call while you can
07:15
so that the rocks the big ones don't
07:18
fall on you
07:19
because that's usually what happens all
07:20
the heavy stuff falls on the lower ones
07:23
and that's exactly what the democratic
07:25
party and those who are working with
07:28
them
07:29
and that those who have been hired to
07:30
work with them
07:32
that is exactly what will happen and so
07:35
God is letting everyone know in this
07:36
moment
07:37
he has not changed his plans america
07:39
would be greater than before
07:41
he's going to do all the things he said
07:43
that he would do and no matter what
07:45
anyone else
07:46
is saying these are his words on this
07:49
day that he
07:50
himself asked for on the fourth which
07:53
represents
07:54
God's path the third is his plan
07:57
the fourth is his path and so worry on
08:00
this path
08:01
because the trump has said yes to him
08:03
all the body who prayed
08:05
and interceded we all said yes to him
08:08
the agreement is so great in the spirit
08:10
realm there is nothing the enemy can do
08:12
to stop this from happening
08:14
so sit back and watch act two of the
08:17
show
08:17
because the show has begun there will be
08:20
in acts 3 and 4
08:21
and when he's ready for that he'll let
08:23
you know but right now you're about to
08:25
see act two of the show
08:27
and we can just watch and see what
08:29
happens because it
08:30
will happen i also want to remind you
08:33
all
08:34
that even kim clement and other prophets
08:36
who've passed on to heaven are
08:38
celebrating right now in heaven they
08:40
know what is about to happen he knew
08:42
that
08:42
trump would be president and uh and i
08:45
always enjoyed listening to his words
08:47
because that was usually
08:48
exactly what God was saying to me and a
08:50
lot of people do that but those who were
08:52
saying
08:53
that it is the end and they're seeing
08:55
the very end which is probably several
08:57
hundred years from now
08:58
if not longer then you need to let
09:00
people know that you don't know when
09:02
that's going to happen
09:03
or your reputation will not look so good
09:06
that's good
09:06
one prophet to another if you don't have
09:09
a time frame and you don't know for sure
09:10
God's doing that right now
09:12
don't don't say it and so i would say
09:14
what he says
09:15
and i will show you what he showed me so
09:18
yes
09:18
the rocks are about to move which is the
09:20
beginning of that landslide and trump
09:23
will be president no matter what you
09:25
hear even over this day in this
09:27
night don't don't go from the path he
09:31
has you on
09:32
don't leave that place of celebration
09:34
because let me tell you we're about to
09:35
have a huge celebration
09:37
and i plan to enjoy it along with you
09:41
that is the word of God for this day
09:44
even
09:44
after november the 3rd and so we're just
09:47
going to go with his plan
09:48
and do his will his way and this is the
09:52
time as he said for great exposure
09:54
and the exposure will be a landslide
09:56
that's good now Kat i was this morning
09:58
drinking my wife came into the room
10:00
and i was i had been praying this
10:02
morning you know to process what was
10:04
happening and she said what are you
10:05
seeing
10:06
and i said without going into all the
10:07
pictures and how it meant
10:09
i i i'll word it like this
10:12
he's hovering he's hovering over this
10:16
you know like a spaceship would hover
10:18
over the land he's hurting like like the
10:20
holy spirit hovered over the
10:22
formless void and at one point he says
10:25
let there be light
10:27
so that's what the vision that i had in
10:29
men and it's like as
10:30
andreen said that's a word from the lord
10:32
because i'm saying even in my
10:34
saying it i'd say i wonder if that's
10:36
just my thoughts since he goes no that's
10:37
the word of the lord so
10:39
i mean i see him just hovering brooding
10:42
you know on the face of the teeth
10:43
getting ready to do that do you think he
10:45
just flicks a thing or that person makes
10:48
a phone call
10:48
does he do it on cue i think that it
10:51
will be made exactly when God wants that
10:54
phone call made
10:55
and i'm quite sure he's already uh
10:58
his presence is already being felt uh by
11:01
that person who will make the phone call
11:03
and once they commit their stuff to do
11:05
it it's going to start
11:07
everything and we'll be amazed and
11:09
shocked
11:10
but this is what God does with his
11:12
prophets in this day they will be
11:14
very detailed they will be very clear
11:16
there will not be any foggy moments in
11:18
their mind if they're sold out to him
11:20
and they're living holy
11:22
then what they say and what God has said
11:24
to them you will see it happen you begin
11:26
to see it happen
11:26
right away these days are acceleration
11:30
these are not the days of waiting 50
11:33
years or something
11:34
or 20 years or something we're in a key
11:37
time for God
11:38
right now and he's clearly saying what
11:40
he wants and he's been
11:42
saying that every single day you better
11:44
go back and re-listen to all these
11:46
broadcasts that were done because God
11:48
clearly spoke about what his plan was
11:50
and he is not changing his mind he's God
11:54
and i do agree because the clouds of
11:56
glory that were over washington dc when
11:58
i was there
11:59
and all the hosts of heaven that were
12:01
there i totally agree that
12:03
he is he is definitely over that entire
12:06
area right now
12:07
and he is it's just like you said when
12:10
in genesis um
12:11
one two when he said that his you know
12:14
the holy spirit was hovering over the
12:15
face of the deep in the dark it was
12:17
darkness on there
12:18
and he did say let there be light and
12:21
the light of God is about to shine
12:23
and when it shines on the darkness
12:25
everything
12:27
is exposed and then it will begin to
12:29
shine
12:30
on us and then from us so that is what
12:33
that light means the light you saw steve
12:36
means it's going to expose the darkness
12:37
then it will shine on
12:39
this area on this land and then it will
12:42
begin
12:42
a shine from us also so i'm excited
12:46
what do you think that's good i'm
12:48
excited about what God is saying
12:50
and i love it when he says key things
12:51
like when the ground begins to move
12:53
you know the exposure's about to happen
12:55
because it will be a landslide of
12:57
exposure
12:58
and he always clarifies himself in the
13:00
days that he is doing something
13:02
in this is not for another time
13:06
these words he just spoke are for this
13:08
time that you're living in and you're
13:10
breathing
13:10
right now and so again i would give a
13:14
a declaration to all those who were a
13:16
part of the line cheating and stealing
13:18
you better run as fast as you can to
13:20
tell the truth
13:22
before you get caught underneath that
13:24
yeah and what about
13:25
uh i noticed because i watched some of
13:28
ken copeland's uh
13:29
broadcast last night as you'd recommend
13:31
it was very very good
13:33
and there was a real positivity and they
13:36
just hung on to the word what about
13:38
people
13:39
and i you know there's a couple moments
13:41
where i had to catch myself up last
13:43
night and buoy myself up because
13:45
the news didn't look good what a what
13:48
about people who
13:50
blurred out of their mouth this is not
13:52
what we thought was going to happen this
13:54
is not what the prophet said when when
13:56
in reality
13:57
it's going to unfold is what should they
13:59
do
14:00
do they need to like their words they
14:02
need to strike they need to nullify the
14:04
words that they spoke that's very
14:06
important that you do that
14:07
nullify what you spoke that was not God
14:10
because then you are no longer in
14:12
agreement with him and even though you
14:14
will enjoy the benefits of what happens
14:16
as a believer your soul will be much
14:19
happier if you if you struck you
14:21
strike those words down that you
14:22
yourself spoke because you did it in
14:24
fear
14:25
and you don't want fear to get in you
14:26
fear always speaks
14:28
when God is going to do something great
14:30
and they try to they try
14:31
themselves spirits right it's a spirit
14:35
it tries to convince you that none of
14:36
that's going to happen
14:38
and then you begin to question
14:39
everything God is doing so you don't
14:41
want fear to attach itself to you
14:43
so you say i nullify those words that i
14:45
spoke of fear
14:47
i'm in agreement with God i'm trusting
14:49
him my
14:50
faith is out there what you get you get
14:52
by faith
14:53
you don't get anything by fear that's
14:56
true that's true
14:57
and now you know some of them i think it
14:58
was um well it was on kenneth copeland
15:00
last night
15:01
one of the speakers said it in a way i'd
15:04
never
15:05
quite heard it and i didn't know if i
15:06
could repeat it but basically we all
15:08
know the scripture that says he's not
15:09
given us a spirit of fear
15:11
and one i might have been the ceo of
15:13
kenneth copeland said
15:14
fear is a demon it's not an one of your
15:18
emotions
15:19
God didn't give you that it's a it's a
15:21
demon i thought you know i
15:22
never thought of it that way so when
15:24
they when you're getting rid of fear
15:25
you're not trying to get rid of your
15:26
emotion you're trying to get rid of
15:28
the demonic that's attacking you yeah
15:30
there is a person
15:32
it is it is a spirit
15:35
even the seven spirits of God just as a
15:37
side thing here
15:38
the seven spirits of God are not his
15:40
attributes or his character they are
15:42
literally seven spiritual beings that
15:44
serve him all the time that go on
15:46
special assignments for him
15:48
and people always like in their man's
15:51
mind understanding
15:52
they have another picture of that there
15:54
is a spirit of fear
15:55
there is a spirit of witchcraft these
15:58
are spiritual beings they are very high
16:00
level beings and satan's um
16:02
and his army and i would say to anybody
16:05
if you've been experienced
16:06
fear open your door and kick it out
16:10
do not give it permission to stay
16:12
evicted from your life
16:14
from your words and from your home and
16:17
then you ask
16:18
God to fill you full of joy and
16:20
celebration
16:22
and his presence because that's what we
16:24
need in these days
16:25
i am calling those things that be not as
16:29
though they were
16:30
that is a literal way you operate in the
16:32
spirit realm
16:33
those aren't just good words in the
16:34
bible they mean
16:36
something and they move something so
16:39
you have to be in that same place if you
16:42
want to reap the
16:43
full goodness of God by standing in that
16:47
place it says stand
16:49
for and so this is a place where we're
16:51
standing
16:52
and believing what God has said and
16:54
being excited that shows that you
16:57
believe it
16:58
and it's going to happen God's way and
17:01
for all those who
17:02
wish they said something later of course
17:04
even later if you haven't done it make
17:06
sure you loose
17:07
or nullify any words you spoke against
17:09
what God's plans were
17:11
he is taking back this country
17:14
and so it's going to happen and the
17:17
other side
17:18
if you don't like it better get saved
17:21
for all that you've spoken against God's
17:22
plan also
17:24
and some people may not survive this
17:28
you know i i have not that i have not
17:30
followed kenneth copeland that much of
17:31
the years just i was in different
17:33
streams
17:33
not for any reason it's just that i was
17:35
in different streams and
17:37
different speakers but i really enjoyed
17:39
him he's he's got to be 80 something
17:41
and he was saying that this was during
17:44
the time it was the most doubtful last
17:45
night
17:46
and he was saying listen we are God's
17:49
people we're going up this mountain it's
17:51
called mount nemo
17:52
and we're looking into the promised land
17:54
and we are
17:55
not getting down from this mountain
17:57
until this comes to pass and i can't
17:59
remember exactly
18:00
his words but i thought man that just
18:01
filled me and i thought this guy is
18:03
anointed
18:04
with this he's so unwanted his words are
18:06
anointed and he also
18:08
called trump as the winner he did that
18:11
the last time when no one else had
18:13
called on any other news source or
18:15
network
18:16
he actually calls it i'm just calling
18:17
him as a winner that's who God wants
18:19
i'm believing God's going to work his
18:21
way but let's just say
18:23
at the close of this evening for their
18:24
for their program
18:26
we're saying trump is the winner that's
18:28
good and that's it that's a different
18:30
teaching than most christians
18:32
are comfortable with and i think
18:33
probably because in the past there were
18:35
faith
18:35
teachers that got way up and i was
18:37
commenting to
18:38
dream last night i said kenneth copeland
18:40
was a seasoned
18:42
huge ministry 30 years ago when we lived
18:44
in we lived close to there
18:46
we lived in dallas texas real close to
18:48
his place i'd never been to one of his
18:50
meetings but
18:50
but he was a seasoned leader back then
18:53
he's survived
18:54
30 years yes all kinds of things and
18:58
ministers who fell in sin ministers who
19:01
fell with
19:02
money and all of that and here he is
19:04
just filled with
19:05
faith it's unbelievable and you know the
19:07
great thing is he's passed all that down
19:09
to his children
19:11
he was a wise person 20 years ago when
19:14
he began to give them
19:16
different positions in the ministry and
19:18
then allowing them to minister he was
19:19
preparing them
19:20
to step up when he goes home to heaven
19:23
he's a very wise leader and he
19:25
definitely lives a holy life and he
19:28
absolutely hears God
19:30
very clearly i've been after many of his
19:32
meetings in the past
19:33
and he actually has my book and he
19:36
learned
19:37
he he got that book as a gift and he
19:39
actually wrote me personally back and
19:41
said how much he loved it and enjoyed it
19:42
especially the
19:44
heaven and uh and and i i did send him
19:47
book number two so he has that too
19:49
and uh jesse de plaines also uh loved
19:52
the book what was that actually
19:54
sent it to many leaders in the body and
19:55
they all of them loved it
19:57
none of them said i don't want to
19:58
receive this they said they couldn't
20:00
wait to get there but kenneth copeland
20:02
has always been
20:04
in a way another person who guided me
20:06
into the truth of the word
20:08
he taught on faith he was a great faith
20:10
leader also
20:11
just like kenneth hagin and lester
20:13
sumrall
20:14
and uh and i'm sure some of those helped
20:16
to even mentor him i know his story need
20:18
to check out his story
20:20
he had to step out in faith from the
20:21
very beginning and now
20:23
he is still one of the largest groups
20:25
still out there
20:26
teaching the truth receiving revelation
20:29
and standing in faith
20:30
miracles after miracles have happened so
20:32
i totally would trust the words that he
20:35
spoke last night
20:36
and you're right the whole atmosphere
20:38
was there and i tried to find another
20:40
another network that was speaking and it
20:42
was there was no life in it there was no
20:44
line
20:45
and i turned it off after about five
20:46
minutes i'm like no i'm receiving all
20:48
that i watched and heard by the way
20:50
it's already up and uh starting i
20:52
believe at 10 p.m eastern standard time
20:55
he is back on the air right now so y'all
20:58
might want to go there when we're off
21:00
when we're off the air right here yeah
21:01
just google kenneth copeland ministry
21:03
you'll get a link and then pop in there
21:05
and says watch live click that
21:07
so it was interesting because i was i
21:09
was watching back and forth kenneth
21:11
copeland i'd watch
21:12
fox which was on my main news channel
21:14
then i'd watched a little bit of them
21:15
i want to know what everybody was saying
21:17
and but even on fox now doreen is very
21:20
discerning you knew my wife she's
21:22
um she's not what's the word she's
21:25
uh introvert that's the word i'm looking
21:27
for but
21:28
some a couple of the the conservatives
21:31
were expounding their wisdom last night
21:33
and she says i'm leaving the room
21:35
she just couldn't take it and she went
21:37
out and did dishes or something
21:39
she's a smart lady and i but i had this
21:41
i thought to myself i need to know what
21:43
they're saying
21:44
you see i i finally switched another
21:46
channel i said you can come back to me
21:51
this wasn't even like one of the fake
21:53
news networks that i was listening to
21:55
and i'm like man
21:56
they had no hope about what was
21:58
happening they had confusion there
22:00
they weren't sure if trump was going to
22:02
win or not win and then they started
22:04
saying some things that weren't nice
22:05
about him i'm not putting up with this i
22:07
loosed all their words from my soul
22:09
because it was already filled with what
22:11
God had to say to kenneth copeland and
22:13
what he had said to me
22:15
you can't receive both sides you can't
22:17
have darkness and light in you it turns
22:19
into gray
22:20
that's exactly what happened so make
22:22
sure you're filled with the light
22:24
and you have faith in you let the faith
22:27
be extended because when this happens
22:29
you will be so excited to know that your
22:32
God had a plan all along
22:34
and even though man doesn't always
22:35
understand what God
22:37
wants or what his plans are this is his
22:39
time to do things
22:41
his way on this earth and let me tell
22:43
you that phone call will happen
22:45
it's gonna be amazing not something that
22:47
will be hidden this will be shown
22:49
uh probably all over the internet when
22:51
it begins to happen and i'm telling you
22:53
he will win by a landslide
22:56
but the landslide is all the darkness is
22:58
about to be brushed away
23:00
fascinating that's as fast um let me ask
23:02
you a question you mentioned jesse
23:03
duplantis he's one that's been to heaven
23:05
i don't know how many times
23:06
you've literally been to heaven
23:07
thousands of times when you said you
23:09
were with the lord do you mean you went
23:11
to
23:11
you went to heaven or do you mean and
23:13
we're with the lord do you mean he
23:14
visited you
23:15
what does that mean when you say that in
23:18
my room
23:19
he walked into my room through the wall
23:22
wow
23:23
that's amazing now someone wrote to me
23:25
last night several people have
23:27
one in particular is that i prayed for
23:28
years and years for him to
23:30
visit me i prayed after that and i
23:32
prayed to go to heaven
23:33
and i heard you say i think i've heard
23:36
you say that you have you didn't really
23:38
appeal the lord to for these to start
23:40
other people perhaps have appealed but i
23:42
want to ask that question
23:44
this other one at the same time are
23:46
there hundreds of people getting caught
23:48
up every night
23:49
every day are there thousands of people
23:51
getting caught what what's your sense
23:53
of what God is doing as far as catching
23:55
people today that there are more and
23:57
more being caught up i don't know the
23:59
number that's being caught up
24:00
i know of myself probably maybe about a
24:03
hundred different ones that go
24:05
every now and then i'm not saying there
24:07
aren't others go i
24:08
actually was uh jesus christ came in
24:11
person and gave me a commission
24:13
they they didn't ask me if i wanted to
24:15
do this they told me
24:16
because i already gave permission for
24:18
them to do it they wanted you with me
24:20
and and trust me i was tested and i was
24:24
trained by the holy spirit for over 20
24:26
years
24:27
and then jesus walked through the wall
24:28
of my home they loved to do that they
24:30
walked through the wall of my home in
24:31
1996
24:32
and he said go sit down the father and i
24:34
are going to start taking you on tours
24:36
of heaven
24:36
we want to reveal heaven to the earth
24:38
like we never have before we're tired of
24:39
the myths and the mysteries and the lies
24:41
you go back i said that
24:42
15 years ago the same words because
24:44
that's what he said to me and
24:46
from that day they started catching me
24:47
up and showing me places in heaven
24:50
and then would explain what they were
24:51
they would take me to people's mansions
24:53
i would see people like
24:54
living in heaven i didn't know that they
24:56
would tell me who they were and what
24:58
they'd done on the earth and even things
25:00
i would hear them talking about what
25:02
they had done with their with their
25:03
family members as children and then God
25:05
would give me the phone number
25:06
this is God we're talking about he was a
25:09
phone number of the family
25:10
of the person i saw in heaven have me
25:12
call them and say would you like to know
25:15
what God showed me
25:16
wow it's been going it's too late to
25:18
tell me it doesn't happen
25:20
God gives a commission and a mantle
25:23
i'm a revelator that's what he calls me
25:26
and i don't get bashed a lot because
25:27
they don't know what that is and that
25:28
God did that on purpose
25:31
when i reveal things of God to the earth
25:34
and people
25:34
done that in the past john in the book
25:36
of john's
25:37
john 1 2 and 3 and and also in
25:40
revelations
25:41
john the revelator gave revelations of
25:43
heaven himself
25:45
so this isn't something new but God had
25:47
a season where he decided
25:49
i'm let people know what my home looks
25:50
like and what's waiting on people
25:52
and not just that but who he is who are
25:55
the fathers who the son is who holy
25:57
spirit is
25:58
uh we we have relationship with them if
26:01
you're born again
26:02
you're already part of that family and
26:05
so you need to open yourself up to
26:07
receive from him i
26:08
never make demands on him i actually
26:10
hardly ever ask him a question
26:12
when he walked through the wall i began
26:13
to burn i thought it was going to melt
26:16
and when when the ground begins to shake
26:18
i began to shake
26:19
inside because i knew it was justice
26:22
people
26:22
if you know if you want to know what can
26:24
i say look up to God and say
26:26
i want justice because we need justice
26:28
in this time
26:29
it's written on the steps of his throne
26:31
this is totally because america stands
26:34
for
26:35
justice liberty would you not bring
26:38
justice when
26:39
all of your intercessors you've been
26:41
praying by the masses
26:43
over these last few months and
26:44
especially this last two weeks
26:47
mass groups of people have been coming
26:48
together praying to God
26:50
why would he not answer exactly you know
26:53
that happened that was going on with
26:55
my i was watching about the middle of
26:56
the evening before there was a
26:58
good break and i was my i was beginning
27:01
to just
27:01
slip down watching too much news and all
27:04
of a sudden
27:05
faith came into me i can only say it
27:07
this way and i turned a dream
27:08
and i said God is not going to refuse to
27:11
answer the believer's prayers
27:13
not after all we prayed he is not going
27:15
to let biden be president
27:16
i was just like suddenly then the shift
27:19
was in me and i you know i can't
27:21
exactly claim credit for it i think God
27:23
said poor steve he's had enough
27:25
let's give him a little faith or
27:27
something
27:28
hey let me ask you a quick question one
27:30
last question because we're
27:32
running out of time but you mentioned
27:34
that God showed you people's mansions
27:35
that was the one question i wrote down
27:37
today that i wanted to ask you because
27:38
the lady said
27:39
could you have Kat tell us what the
27:42
americans look like and give us maybe
27:43
one or two
27:44
examples of mansions she's seen that are
27:46
different from one another are they
27:47
pretty different
27:48
from each other they are very different
27:50
because these mansions are designed just
27:53
for you
27:54
things that you love to do or even love
27:56
around you
27:57
colors you love but in a supernatural
28:00
way
28:01
he he creates these mansions and jesus
28:03
works with him to do
28:04
it and i've most of them were encounters
28:07
literally encounters i had where he
28:09
would catch me up
28:10
show me a specific person and walk me
28:13
through their mansion and one i
28:15
i won't forget it looked like this
28:17
person was living in a safari
28:19
he had what you would call wild animals
28:22
all over his grounds but they were
28:24
friends they were friends to this person
28:26
who had passed away
28:27
and uh and he actually was wearing the
28:30
garb
28:31
of what i would think of as like a an
28:33
african
28:34
king he was dressed just like that it
28:37
was a beautiful
28:38
robe and garb and stuff that he had on
28:40
and he was walking around the grounds
28:42
not showing me but i just got to jesus
28:45
took me and we found him so i could hear
28:47
his words what he talked about his
28:48
family and how much he loved them
28:50
and things that he he was so grateful to
28:52
God for that he had given him and is
28:54
even inside the decor
28:56
you don't know what crown molding is
28:57
until you go to heaven now everybody's
28:59
mansion is like that some are very what
29:01
i would call
29:02
very sci-fi-ish like very ultra
29:06
modern futuristic is the word that they
29:08
use really a futuristic mansion that was
29:10
all clear you'd step into this big
29:13
look like a tube at the bottom and you'd
29:15
say third floor and it would zip you up
29:17
there to the third floor you could see
29:19
all over heaven
29:20
you had a star cruiser for you to do
29:22
transport in you didn't even need a
29:24
license that ran on light
29:25
you're not going to never get detail
29:27
from it because God gave me the detail
29:29
so there's this african style of a
29:31
king's mansion on these beautiful
29:33
grounds i couldn't see the end of this
29:35
person's grounds by the way
29:37
and guess what you can have more than
29:39
one space
29:41
i say space really it's part of your
29:43
mansion he's got
29:44
doors that are surprises i saw suspended
29:47
in the air
29:48
and you're on your mansion grounds and
29:50
you step through the door it's another
29:52
mansion
29:52
say by the crystal sea in the middle of
29:55
the crystal sea
29:56
and the mountains of spices when he said
29:59
the place
30:00
your place has many different things
30:03
that you that he makes just for you
30:05
because he loves you
30:07
so i've seen sky mansions are called sky
30:10
mansions and they can be 200 feet up in
30:12
the sky of heaven
30:13
and and even bands of the rainbow coming
30:16
off
30:17
the throne will go through your sky go
30:19
through your home like clouds can be
30:21
engulfed in the glory of God
30:23
and they even have mobile mansions
30:26
somebody's going to love this
30:27
they have mobile mansion parks and yes
30:30
those mansions
30:31
fly those were all the people who ever
30:33
wanted
30:34
and never have one and it's yours and
30:36
you go out and load your family up in it
30:38
uh and you can go go wherever you want
30:40
to in heaven and they have places where
30:42
you can park on these high columns
30:45
no God is the creator the creator
30:50
he knows what you love he knows what you
30:52
gave your life maybe away to him and
30:54
never got to do certain things
30:56
he will create places in heaven that
30:58
look like the very places you always
30:59
wanted to go to
31:00
wow i remember that thing about the
31:03
lions and
31:04
whatever they were the wild animals
31:05
years ago i heard it or it was in your
31:07
book or something
31:08
and i thought man i wonder and of course
31:10
that makes
31:11
each person makes me wonder what does
31:12
God see that i want that even
31:14
i don't know that i want you know
31:16
because he knows whether we know
31:18
ourselves
31:20
that's right i told him that i would
31:22
like
31:23
this is just me running around but i
31:24
said you know i wasn't an athlete
31:26
here on this earth when i get into
31:28
heaven i want to be an athlete i want to
31:30
be one of the best ones
31:31
and he might just say that's silly you
31:33
won't really want that
31:34
but you know he'll give you that silly
31:37
steve he probably has already got that
31:38
prepared for you and by the way
31:42
they have sports in heaven because those
31:45
people have gifts
31:46
but every sport is played for one person
31:50
and the winner in any of these sports
31:52
are always jesus christ and i'm even
31:54
going to share this before we go
31:56
i was taken to a football game in heaven
31:58
and i know people most people let me
32:00
tell you 90 percent of the people are
32:01
happy i'm saying this
32:02
the legalistic minded who where do you
32:05
get to your mansion you're probably
32:06
faint
32:07
anyway he took me to this this football
32:09
game that somebody was playing these
32:11
teams people who were football players i
32:13
had a gift for playing it
32:14
but you can join in you can join in
32:16
these teams and play
32:17
but there were three scoreboards and
32:20
these teams
32:22
are so uh focused is a light word
32:26
to win these scores because when they
32:28
would score
32:30
it would go to their scoreboard that
32:31
team but then it would go up to the
32:33
jesus's
32:33
jesus had his own scoreboard and
32:35
everybody's points no matter who made
32:38
them they were trying to make more
32:39
points for jesus this is how they do
32:41
scores in heaven
32:42
they all went to jesus christ and so
32:45
it's a different way to play
32:46
but the intensity and excitement is
32:48
still there all the angels their
32:50
guardian angels are in the stands doing
32:52
the wave
32:53
it's crazy to think they have
32:56
real life yeah i mean you
32:59
get to do things you always desire to do
33:01
and never got to do there's i got to add
33:02
this
33:03
there's no defilement there is no
33:05
defilement there's no evil there's no
33:07
wickedness there's no coveting
33:09
there's no um there's none of that
33:11
there's no sexuality you don't need
33:14
people you're in love with jesus
33:15
remember uh there's no fear
33:17
whatsoever no fear exists in heaven no
33:20
evil no darkness
33:22
uh you can dive off of 200 foot high
33:24
waterfalls
33:25
all the way down and ride the waterfall
33:27
into the bottom where the part of the
33:28
river of life runs and just be engulfed
33:30
by his presence so
33:32
that's amazing i guess that's the time
33:36
for our broadcast but thank you so much
33:38
this was uh both word about the
33:40
elections or the poll whatever word call
33:42

33:47
lot of
33:48
notes and comments from people who said
33:50

01:38
hey
01:38
hello everybody from the great state of
01:40
oregon and the great pacific northwest
01:43
welcome to another show of elijah's
01:45
dreams sponsored by
01:47
elijah list that's uh doreen and i you
01:50
haven't met during so you have not seen
01:52
dream on camera yet
01:54
we both co-founded the elijah list
01:57
which as you see right there is elijah
01:59
list.com and
02:01
just streams which is a non-profit the
02:03
video aspect of what we're doing here
02:05
we are now celebrating year 23 of
02:07
bringing the voice of the prophets to
02:09
you and it's kind of our pleasure
02:11
very much a pleasure to bring some of
02:13
the best of the best back in the early
02:15
days of
02:15
um as april of 19 1997 we just
02:20
sent uh any word we could find that was
02:22
encouraging by anybody that was
02:23
breathing that's the way it was and
02:25
of course over the years we've gotten
02:26
better and better our discernment
02:28
and we've gotten more and more uh great
02:31
context of actual prophets who are
02:33
received all over the world
02:35
as prophets and prophetic voices for
02:38
those of you that may not know the
02:39
difference
02:40
um the prophet would be considered
02:42
summoned as the office of the prophet
02:44
there's five-fold
02:45
apostle apostles prophets pastors
02:48
teachers and evangelists
02:50
and many people in the as i grew up were
02:52
saying well we need pastors
02:54
we need evangelists we need teachers but
02:57
that apostle and prophet that was done
02:59
away they never offered even
03:02
a tiny bit of proof they just said it
03:04
was done away with and i
03:05
accept that as a truth until i actually
03:08
started reading the word and i said
03:09
where is it
03:10
done away with so about 1988 by the way
03:13
is when the prophetic movement
03:16
let's say the modern day prophetic
03:17
movement started in 88
03:19
and from that point to this you've seen
03:22
more and more profits and now there's
03:24
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
03:25
them
03:26
so well we're going to bring kevin here
03:28
in just a moment
03:29
um what do i seem like there was
03:31
something else i wanted to uh
03:33
be sure and put your questions for next
03:35
time Kat will be here every wednesday
03:38
put your questions about heaven where
03:40
we're not doing that much of
03:41
what does Kat think about this theology
03:43
or that doctrine
03:45
right now we're having Kat talk about
03:46
heaven after we do the elections
03:49
after we talk about the elections in an
03:50
update then we'll ask her questions
03:53
some people are trying to get her to
03:54
explain pre-trib mid-trip post him and
03:56
we're not kind of doing that with Kat
03:58
we're talking right now about heaven
04:00
it's not that she doesn't know all that
04:02
stuff it's just that's not our
04:04
our intended wheelhouse it's not that
04:06
she couldn't do that but
04:08
all right well without further ado then
04:10
let's bring kat Kerr on
04:12
and here she comes hey kat how are you
04:15
i'm always great thanks how about you
04:17

04:19
number four
04:20
of daily shows we first couple of weeks
04:23
started
04:24
10 days before the election actually
04:26
nine days before the election and you
04:27
did those 10 days
04:29
including the day after and now we're in
04:30
week four and
04:33
i would have never predicted that we
04:35
would be going this long
04:37
doing daily shows talking about the
04:39
election
04:40
uh there's a prophet i respect who says
04:42
we're going to be
04:43
uh contending he and i don't know if he
04:45
used that word attending he said we're
04:47
going to be
04:48
at this until january 18. has the lord
04:52
given you any dates
04:54
you're not the one that said that it's
04:55
lord giving any days no he said that we
04:58
will do this weekly thing
04:59
until trump is until his inauguration
05:03
okay i don't know what that is i don't i
05:06
don't even know in my head
05:07
knowledge because you know i'm and head
05:09
knowledge
05:10
but i just know that that the father
05:12
said until he is inaugurated not just
05:14
declared as president until he's
05:16
inaugurated
05:17
we will be doing this weekly thing and
05:19
after that we might continue to do some
05:21
stuff
05:21
every at least once a month we talked
05:23
about that
05:24
that might be more about heaven after
05:26
all the other stuff happens but
05:28
there are so many powerful things
05:30
happening right now so i don't know if
05:32
you want me to just go
05:33
yeah just jump in Kat and tell us what's
05:35
on your heart while we're jumping first
05:37
of all let's let's uh trump say hello
05:39
there he is i love it hello everybody
05:42
yes
05:42
yes yes i have the presidency do you
05:44
have the one that talks do you have the
05:46
one that speaks
05:48
right the here
05:52
in washington d.c
06:03
yeah go ahead and share what's on your
06:06
heart
06:06
well you know ever since he said back on
06:09
november the 4th see i do remember
06:12
on november the 4th when God said
06:15
his peace about all that would be
06:18
happening you know back then
06:20
uh nobody quite was sure about things
06:22
because of course they had stopped
06:24
counting which we all know why they
06:26
stopped counting on the third it was so
06:28
they could slip in all the
06:29
lies and the false ballots and uh change
06:33
things that would shift everything over
06:35
to the other person's side
06:38
abide inside by the way i do have
06:40
something to say
06:41
to him well if he's listening but i know
06:44
he's got
06:45
probably on there that are his spies or
06:47
whatever you want to call them
06:50
and i do know that he has announced he
06:52
is choosing his cabinet
06:54
and the holy spirit said say this the
06:57
only cabinet he will have is the one he
06:59
keeps his cereal in
07:03
he didn't say that it made me laugh when
07:06
he actually said that jimmy
07:08
and then i said oh well then i guess
07:10
he's gonna have a lot of fruits nuts and
07:12
flakes in there right
07:14
hey goodwin listen the holy spirit's not
07:17
done the holy spirit's name in heaven is
07:19
the drama king
07:20
because he loves drama he loves humor
07:23
and after i said there'll be fruits nuts
07:25
and places and he said yeah
07:26
there's probably even a fruit loop one
07:28
or two fruit lips
07:30
you know i almost today i i have a tie
07:33
you can't see because you can't see
07:35
us we can see you but i have a tie
07:37
that's looney tunes
07:39
so cartoon character i almost wore it
07:41
today
07:42
i'll wear it at some point you know and
07:44
i was going to say because people think
07:45
we're looney tunes that we're saying
07:47
trump is going to be
07:48
has been actually re-elected so
07:51
oh he is so still president people even
07:54
in
07:55
even in you know right now as we speak
07:57
he is still our president
07:59
don't try to pack his bags um however
08:03
there may be other people around this
08:06
country packing bags to escape to the
08:08
airport
08:09
i keep telling people because i keep
08:10
hearing the holy spirit say keep your
08:12
eye on the airport
08:13
to see who might show up there to leave
08:16
not the country and that will be biden
08:18
but i'm saying there will be others as
08:20
this avalanche
08:22
of exposure of fraud federal
08:25
crimes are being committed and they have
08:27
the evidence
08:28
people whether you want to hear that or
08:31
not or whether you're celebrating right
08:32
now they totally have the evidence
08:34
right now that proves that trump won
08:38
on that day he already had won and then
08:41
in the middle of the night and in early
08:43
morning which by the way i'm always up
08:45
at that time
08:46
the holy spirit said to me they're just
08:48
shutting down to stop counting so they
08:50
can get all the faults
08:52
balancing and they can do criminal
08:53
activity when no one is looking he
08:55
actually said that so guess what heaven
08:57
knew all that
08:58
was going to be but you've heard me say
09:00
before
09:01
God is literally using this time to
09:04
expose
09:05
career crime corruption in our
09:08
government and in other places in
09:10
high places in other places that he will
09:13
deal with that justice will come
09:16
if you can't say anything else say thank
09:18
you God justice is here because it
09:20
is only here it's not coming it is here
09:24
and so yes they do have enough evidence
09:26
and it's already being recorded
09:28
and they have people's uh witness and
09:30
testimonies who
09:32
actually were involved in some of the
09:33
stuff so they're in a fantasy
09:36
land if anyone's in fantasyland it's the
09:38
democrats
09:39
and i mean leadership and i mean those
09:41
people who think let's pick his cabinet
09:44
with the cereal in it let's go ahead and
09:46
you know pick who's going to be in there
09:48
with him
09:48
and every person you would never want to
09:51
be in any kind of a
09:52
uh uh you know part of the hierarchy in
09:55
an
09:55
administration that's who the other
09:58
side's picking that's who he's picking
10:00
corrupted and defiled people and God
10:03
is against that kind of stuff it isn't
10:06
that he
10:06
hates the democrats God loves everybody
10:09
but he knows who's going to choose his
10:11
plan and he's not
10:12
and this is actually they're trying to
10:14
choose their own plan in God's time
10:16
there you go never gonna work the other
10:19
thing that i've been kept aware of are
10:21
how many
10:21
earthquakes have been happening in our
10:24
country just in our country
10:26
now most of these are low level
10:29
they're less than like two you know a
10:31
two then you're not going to really know
10:32
much about there's been a lot of 1.5s
10:35
and 0.5
10:36
but they've had them actually in some of
10:38
the various states
10:39
where those swing states were where
10:41
they've done a lot of the stealing of
10:43
the votes and changing um
10:45
of the electoral stuff i mean it's gone
10:48
so it's so deep and so far reaching but
10:51
i do know that they have the evidence
10:53
they need
10:54
but there are so many earthquakes and
10:55
they are still going on
10:57
there was a really shift even in our
10:59
ground in the earth
11:00
itself when God said a shift was coming
11:03
he's had me say that for about two years
11:05
i didn't know he meant this of course
11:07
until he told me
11:08
but there's a lot of shifting going on
11:10
in the very
11:11
uh spirit realm in the ground in the air
11:14
that God himself is involved in that you
11:16
can't see but trust me he knows what's
11:19
happening
11:19
and he's lining us up those who will
11:22
follow his plan who want life and wants
11:24
justice liberty and freedom
11:26
he is aligning us up to be in charge
11:30
to have places of authority to have some
11:32
of the biggest
11:33
businesses the most prosperous places
11:36
even the wealth is being
11:37
reshifted around so i'm just telling you
11:40
this is a time to celebrate and he
11:42
God has never stopped saying that and i
11:44
will not stop saying it either and you
11:46
will
11:47
see it happen that trump is president
11:50
now not in 2024 people get that out of
11:54
your head you think God needs
11:56
some help God's not changing his
11:58
timeline
11:59
trump will be president for the next
12:00
four years in the white house
12:02
and he's not waiting for a cleaner guy's
12:05
after saying well let's wait for 2024
12:07
because it'll be a cleaner deal by then
12:09
no no he's
12:11
he in fact if if trump had been elected
12:13
if they had not stopped counting votes
12:15
God knew they were gonna
12:16
uh stop counting votes and he let it all
12:19
happen because it was all part of this
12:21
plan
12:21
if trump had just been quickly reelected
12:25
we would think we had done so well
12:27
praying and God got in
12:28
and all of that corruption would have
12:30
just gone underground
12:31
right never have been brought to the
12:33
surface and people have to pay the price
12:36
for all kinds of evil deeds done in
12:38
darkness and God's saying
12:40
it's time right for this to come to the
12:41
surface you're right and the reason for
12:44
the great exposure and then when you
12:47
hear the word exposure that means
12:48
something's going to be uncovered
12:50
a God reveals the good things but he
12:53
exposes the wicked the bad
12:55
the defiled and because God is setting
12:58
up a
12:59
platform for the next 100 years there
13:03
you go
13:04
i don't mind prophesying that far into
13:06
the future because i've already been
13:07
there
13:08
and it doesn't matter what you think
13:09
about that either i'm a prophet when God
13:11
says and shows me he takes me
13:13
in person to these places and shows me
13:16
he doesn't ever talk to me in symbolism
13:18
he never has from the time i was a
13:20
little girl
13:21
he always would show me exactly what he
13:23
meant and so it's
13:24
necessary to have each of these four
13:27
years with the person God needs
13:29
in the white house he said i will be in
13:31
the white house
13:32
in 2016 he said i'll be there for 24
13:35
years
13:36
welcomed with open arms to shift things
13:39
in this country to shape this
13:41
nation for God's purposes that doesn't
13:44
mean we'll just be one big religious
13:46
tent somewhere that means we will
13:48
prosper in every single area of those
13:50
seven mountains
13:51
yeah you need to check out these people
13:53
you need to check out johnny emlow and
13:55
lance they both talk about the seven
13:56
mountains
13:58
these are people you can trust that are
14:00
very viable that love God that know
14:03
that trump has been God's choice so he
14:05
needs trump now
14:06
in 2016. he needs him in 2020
14:10
pence will sit in 20 uh you know he'll
14:12
be the next one after
14:13
trump for eight years and whoever trump
14:16
uh has
14:17
raised up under him and pence together
14:20
whoever they know or pence will pick for
14:23
his vice president
14:25
will be president without a break
14:28
people no vacations in there for the
14:31
next
14:31
eight years after pence will be uh he
14:34
will be present for eight years and God
14:36
in those 24 years that he
14:38
needs for that platform to free us of
14:41
anything that would hinder the body of
14:43
christ
14:44
creativity new inventions and let me
14:47
tell you i'm wearing today
14:48
my nasa shirt there it is the space
14:52
force people and God wants space i tell
14:55
you why he wants space to be
14:57
uh he wants you to go check wants us to
14:59
go check it out
15:00
we are the first ones another first in
15:03
in the world
15:04
do you actually have a part of our
15:06
military called the space
15:07
command the space force he wants us to
15:10
go out there and look because one of the
15:11
greatest fuels
15:12
we will ever have in this world will
15:15
come from space
15:17
so we have to go we have to go out there
15:19
and explore wow so you're saying there's
15:21
a fuel
15:22
yet to be discovered that will be
15:24
discovered in space not on the earth
15:26
not on the earth it'll be the way it's
15:29
captured
15:29
that's how God speaks to me in terms of
15:32
how they're going to do that
15:34
they will capture it in space it would
15:36
be brought to the earth
15:38
uh through i'm not quite sure because
15:40
you know my head knowledge is limited
15:42
and God likes to pick kids to tell
15:44
things to because they won't back up
15:46
they won't give up they won't change
15:48
what is said to them
15:50
and that's why he likes to pick someone
15:52
who's like a child and so
15:54
i remember everything he says so he said
15:57
to me
15:58
the new one of the newest fuels will be
16:00
something that will cost us
16:02
almost nothing so our energy source
16:06
seriously that will run everything in
16:08
our homes guess this
16:10
in our cars in remote places for the
16:13
first time we better pull this energy
16:15
down
16:16
and run whole communities and whole of
16:18
villages and things like that
16:20
all over this world so that's why he
16:22
needs the right people and
16:24
trump even builds up to that because
16:26
he's the one who called this
16:28
card and said we're going to have a
16:31
space
16:31
force we will keep the exploration going
16:34
if he had not
16:35
done that then that part that is
16:37
necessary in order for us to discover
16:39
this new energy source it wouldn't have
16:42
happened
16:42
so you have to see God's perspective he
16:45
sees way out into the future because
16:47
he's already been there
16:48
and that's how he works with me so we
16:50
are having new inventions that he would
16:52
not allow because they would have been
16:54
corrupted and abused people
16:56
so that's why he's clearing all this up
16:59
and showing
17:00
us uh that there can be a a time on this
17:03
earth
17:04
will be not not wars won't stop
17:07
but they will be minimized because gov
17:10
people governing these other countries
17:11
will actually not want to war
17:14
yeah can't there's a lot not just on the
17:17
left this can be some
17:18
people on the right who don't serve God
17:20
not everybody on the
17:21
right are are believers there's a lot of
17:24
in my life i've never heard about so
17:26
much occult practice witchcraft
17:28
occultism actual people talking about
17:31
going to these meetings where they would
17:33
do occult things
17:34
some of that happened from the left uh
17:36
not this you know the one before
17:38
the election before i think with hillary
17:40
there were there were emails that got
17:42
released
17:42
publicly has God showed you anything
17:45
that's going to happen to tap
17:47
down this occult practice during the
17:49
season
17:50
it absolutely is going to change because
17:53
when people begin to see
17:55
the power and the presence of the living
17:58
God
17:59
it will expose deception deception is
18:02
one of the greatest things that satan
18:04
uses we might as well go to him
18:06
he's the head of that whole side over
18:08
there and uh
18:09
anything that's with the occult it traps
18:12
you he's after your soul
18:14
he doesn't want to just control you some
18:15
people like the power they feel when
18:17
they're operating in that way
18:19
but let me tell you what they're selling
18:20
out their self and maybe even their
18:22
family
18:23
so you don't want to get caught in any
18:25
of those practices and witchcraft will
18:26
be a real legit
18:28
thing one day that will be taught in
18:30
colleges this is how crazy it will get
18:32
they will have to become civilized it's
18:35
the
18:36
is the word that the holy spirit uses
18:38
some of these things that we think of as
18:39
being horrific you know and that we want
18:41
to touch it
18:42
they'll actually have to become sort of
18:44
civilized not won't change who's behind
18:46
all of it but in order for it to not
18:48
look evil and dark
18:49
they will be shifting even that on their
18:51
side that it's a good thing as
18:53
crazy as that sounds it will never be a
18:56
good thing
18:57
to practice witchcraft or voodoo uh any
19:00
of the new wave stuff anything
19:02
that's out there that connects it to a
19:04
other part of the spirit realm that's
19:06
evil
19:07
that doesn't change but the way they
19:09
portray it is going to change
19:11
because no one will want the blatant
19:14
out there like you're talking about and
19:16
the thing is is
19:17
people in in government offices and
19:19
businesses
19:20
will actually have on staff prophets
19:23
or seers that will already be aware of
19:26
their stuff coming against them and it
19:28
will be stopped because of that
19:30
as far as that part of the culture is i
19:33
do know that the major
19:35
senior intercessors or and or prophetic
19:38
people
19:39
will be hired on staff and secular
19:42
companies
19:43
i've already been approached before
19:44
about that and i already knew God said
19:45
it would happen i'm not going to do that
19:47
by the way
19:48
i'm not saying it's not God that you do
19:50
that if he tells you to but
19:52
many people will be serious after seeing
19:55
the evil and the darkness and the
19:56
wickedness right now
19:58
that's being hidden they won't want
19:59
people around them not
20:01
psychics or mediums okay those belong to
20:04
the other side
20:05
God doesn't use psychic mediums he used
20:08
prophets
20:09
providence he uses seers he uses us
20:12
intercessors
20:13
to bring down his thoughts and his ways
20:15
into this world and into our lives
20:17
but there is there's a major shift it's
20:20
not just let's expose all the darkness
20:22
and then bring justice it's what begins
20:24
to happen after that
20:25
will be exciting for those who know
20:27
christ and if you don't i would advise
20:30
you strongly to seek him
20:34
out because you don't want to get caught
20:36
in some of the other stuff that will be
20:37
happening
20:38
down the way uh but it will be more
20:41
apparent
20:42
who's in the light and who's with the
20:44
darkness so God is definitely erasing
20:46
the grey
20:46
area the great area that's always been
20:49
in our country is that there is no bond
20:51
and that part won't be be believed any
20:54
longer
20:55
in just a little while people will know
20:56
what is right what is God
20:58
and what is the darkness and which they
21:00
want now the prophets um
21:02
i can see a time coming you know God
21:05
spoke to i was at jacob
21:07
and and said you know have these sheep
21:10
you know
21:11
look at these spotted sheep while
21:13
they're mating i don't have the story
21:15
down i wasn't prepared
21:16
to talk about it and then they that his
21:18
whole
21:19
herd became the most prosperous herd and
21:22
and he outdid his father-in-law laban
21:24
so our prophets are going to do that
21:26
kind of thing in the future where
21:27
they're going to tell businessmen this
21:28
is what you need to do
21:30
absolutely yes and i already know that
21:32
i'm not going to mention any names i
21:34
mean
21:34
that's actually been going on for a
21:36
while with these people who are really
21:38
wise people who decided in business they
21:42
didn't want to side
21:44
with the sin and the darkness and some
21:46
of these are when i say
21:48
secular secular usually means not a
21:51
christian
21:51
not a faith thing but just sound minds
21:54
and they're wise because it says those
21:56
who stand in the council of the ungodly
21:59
will not flourish and will not prosper
22:01
those who stand in the council of the
22:03
godly
22:03
will and so there are people who
22:06
actually kind of know what's in the
22:07
bible or they know
22:08
people and that's been happening because
22:11
there are some businesses that have
22:12
their own
22:13
intercessors that come in and pray over
22:15
their business and meet with them every
22:17
now and then and even
22:18
fly places to do this that is God's plan
22:22
that's not selling your gift that's
22:23
God's plan to bring his plan
22:26
into the business world into the
22:28
government into the medical field into
22:30
education
22:31
you'll begin to see it everywhere it
22:32
will be very
22:34
the the only bit what i can use is
22:36
popular to know a christian
22:38
or be a friend or christian and so
22:41
that's how this how far the shift is
22:43
taking which is
22:43
why he needs to remove the ungodly
22:48
from having control in the government
22:50
because the government makes our laws
22:52
they make our rules and make our
22:53
regulations
22:55
and as long as the enemy's involved in
22:57
that you will see them
22:58
slip further into the darkness but that
23:00
is not what is happening now
23:02
that's why the left has no
23:06
chance to win yeah that's so good well
23:08
that's
23:09
based on our time let's jump into some
23:11
questions about heaven are you ready for
23:12
that
23:13
i have one more thing go ahead
23:15
absolutely
23:17
i have a guest right here in my studio
23:22
she is can you see mama
23:26
she's right there a little closer there
23:29
there you go we got it now hello we want
23:32
her
23:33
i mean she's lived almost 90 years on
23:36
this earth
23:38
she had 15 children everybody she's got
23:41
a hundred and some family members
23:43
she has a lot of wisdom and
23:45
understanding and she knows
23:48
what is good and what is not good when
23:50
it's right when it's not right
23:51
and i would like for her to encourage uh
23:54
people who are like
23:55
seniors they can still have a life don't
23:58
put yourself in a box and think you
24:00
don't matter
24:01
uh God has a plan for them too i didn't
24:03
say that part
24:04
but i just want my mom to say hello and
24:06
encourage people to not give
24:08
up there you go mama right up there
24:13
um the one main thing and i can't
24:16
remember when we started this
24:18
but it's been a number of years ago that
24:21
we
24:21
stopped watching the news
24:25
or the newspaper reading it
24:28
and i'm an avid reader so
24:32
uh we stopped reading that and listening
24:34
because
24:35
it didn't seem like it was anything good
24:37
that's right
24:38
and i had to cut back on some of my
24:41
magazines that i read
24:42
because they were the same so
24:45
we were looking for different things
24:47
that we could i could read
24:49
and everything else so uh i have a
24:53
huge library thousands of books
24:56
and she reads thousands of books my
25:00
particular
25:01
thing that i love is history yeah and
25:04
i love reading the history historical
25:06
things
25:07
of our country and the different nations
25:10
that came here to settle
25:11
and where they settle and how they live
25:13
to pioneer this land
25:15
and i'm amazed i'm amazed
25:19
it's our tenacity there are so many
25:21
things that you can do
25:22
and i'm especially blessed because God
25:25
has given me 20 20 vision
25:27
wow so i and i also
25:30
am able to uh be a speed reader
25:34
and retain it wow so
25:37
but i claim the mind of christ every day
25:40
just about
25:42
and i've continued to pray over my eyes
25:44
and my hearing
25:45
i have no problem with hearing
25:50
so they should not be in fear right now
25:52
they should not be in fear
25:54
but they should keep their mind active
25:56
yes
25:57
you can do this by reading and there are
26:00
good programs on the tv
26:01
i'm not an avid tv watcher
26:04
i just i'm not i'd rather have a book
26:07
but if they want to watch tv there are
26:09
good programs to watch
26:11
don't get hooked on this fear campaign
26:14
they've got it
26:16
if you look through this day after days
26:19
the
26:19
wonder the fake news people she's
26:21
talking about
26:23
and let me tell you what we've got the
26:25
best
26:26
president there is anybody yeah that's
26:29
not true
26:31
and you need to be holding this man up
26:33
in prayer yes
26:35
strength good help for his frame of mind
26:38
and i
26:39
i can't see any change in that he's so
26:42
upbeat
26:44
just just pray for the good things that
26:47
need to be happening
26:48
that's right don't dwell on you've been
26:51
hearing
26:53
so that's the way i stay positive in
26:56
this thing
26:58
well i can tell i can tell man i was
27:00
ready to have you
27:01
slowly give sort of a 90 year old speech
27:05
and you know you're just another no
27:07
wonder can't work at gutter energy
27:09
you're amazing yes well thank you you
27:12
know thank you so much for that
27:13
encouragement
27:14
you know i'm 65 and i used to think 65
27:17
was old but uh
27:18
it's not
27:30
thank you so much God bless you thank
27:33
you have an amazing day
27:35
that was so good thank you Kat that's a
27:37
that was a really nice surprise
27:39
well let's talk about heaven for a
27:41
minute a few minutes we got 15 minutes
27:43
baby
27:44
uh for those of you who are just
27:45
watching for the first time kat has been
27:46
to heaven
27:47
you said you stopped counting that about
27:48
a thousand times i think and that was
27:50
years ago
27:51
for 20 years so to recap let me just for
27:54
those that
27:54
um a a visit to heaven can look like
27:58
this you said once
27:59
you reached up to get something at the
28:01
grocery store by the time you
28:03
brought it back down you had been to
28:04
heaven and back and how long had you
28:07
been to heaven
28:08
how long did it seem like you were in
28:09
heaven between that
28:11
i think the hardest thing to try to
28:13
describe to people is that there is no
28:15
time in heaven
28:16
that doesn't mean there aren't events or
28:18
activities
28:20
all kinds of things going on it's just
28:22
that um there's not like clocks or
28:25
calendars they don't count things by the
28:27
minutes they're they you you have
28:29
encounters like an encounter if you were
28:31
caught up to heaven
28:32
and they took you to see two or three
28:34
places well i don't know how much time
28:37
actually would go by on the earth here
28:39
because it's like there's no time so
28:41
literally
28:42
when you're taken from here and you're
28:43
there that that
28:45
takes less than a second and then
28:47
however long
28:48
you're there it's like tom time's not
28:51
counted here
28:52
because literally it would be seconds
28:54
that i was out of my body and my
28:56
spiritual body was caught up to heaven
28:58
nobody knew that i was there
29:00
but i would see two or three places they
29:03
would take me to 10 different places and
29:05
i would see details what what goes on in
29:07
this place why was it made
29:09
or who was it made for uh what can we do
29:12
there
29:12
what did the colors look like the
29:14
clothing look like what does the food
29:15
taste like
29:17
um uh people getting together with their
29:19
family members or friends or
29:21
meeting the apostles or the prophets so
29:24
there's so much activity going on
29:26
but it's not counted like we do on this
29:29
earth it's just you're already kind of
29:30
in eternity there
29:32
so it's it's fantastic and so i also
29:35
retain
29:35
everything that i saw or heard and the
29:38
whole purpose he did that was so i could
29:40
share
29:40
i never went for myself in other words i
29:43
never was taken to see any of my own
29:45
stuff i've never seen my mansion
29:47
i haven't seen anything around in the
29:48
area he didn't talk to me about
29:50
my stuff or me it was always what what
29:53
life was like there how heaven operated
29:56
that's good now um i keep getting lots
30:00
of questions you talked about our bodies
30:01
the other day and i've got three or four
30:03
i'm just going to combine them into one
30:04
question
30:05
okay because everyone wants to know
30:06
about our bodies okay so you had said
30:09
when we're there we we uh speak like um
30:13
i mean we can be we can play football we
30:15
can play games we can do this
30:17
so we can hug we can feel each other's
30:18
hugs and so someone wrote
30:21
the two questions and it might have been
30:22
by the same person not sure
30:24
one said if um uh if God's
30:27
so concerned about giving us a new body
30:30
what does he think about cremation
30:31
if if we're going to have a resurrection
30:33
then someone else said or the same
30:35
person
30:36
if there's going to be a resurrection so
30:37
that we have new bodies
30:39
why why do we even need that if we can
30:41
already do what we what we're doing now
30:43
when we go to heaven if we can already
30:45
play football and hug each other
30:46
why do we even need a new body well
30:50
heaven is
30:51
only and i want to stress that heaven is
30:53
only a spiritual
30:54
world with your natural eyes you
30:57
wouldn't be able to see it because the
30:58
spirit realm
31:00
although it is everywhere this physical
31:02
realm is a
31:03
temporary realm he made this
31:06
this this earth this physical earth he
31:09
made the
31:10
the cosmos out there that you can see
31:12
that whatever we can see with their eyes
31:13
through telescopes they're visiting
31:15
spaceships
31:16
that's the physical realm and it is
31:19
wrapped around
31:20
part of the spiritual realm so that we
31:22
with our physical bodies while we're
31:24
living on the earth could do things
31:26
explore things
31:27
experience things but God on the new
31:30
earth
31:31
it will be physical realm and spiritual
31:33
realm together
31:34
as one world and so even
31:38
heaven itself i know people are going to
31:40
be shocked
31:41
is temporary instead he'll make a new
31:43
heaven and he'll make a new
31:44
earth and you know i need the new earth
31:47
is it won't be just God's house God's
31:49
house
31:50
is the world called heaven out in the
31:51
spirit realm you experience
31:53
adventure excitement fun of the splendor
31:57
of the all that never changes where
31:59
wherever God jesus is you're going to
32:00
always experience that
32:02
but on his timeline he has his own
32:04
purposes
32:05
he made this earth right now
32:08
so you could have a physical body and it
32:11
clearly
32:11
says in the bible that um that this is a
32:15
temporal place for right now
32:17
this is temporary it also says you will
32:20
get your body back because i promise you
32:23
the part that
32:24
sleeps is your body and let me tell you
32:27
if it's dust
32:28
in a jar God has assured me he can put
32:32
every part back together
32:34
so on the day the dead and christ shall
32:35
rise that is your body no matter where
32:38
the
32:38
molecules and the cells are whether you
32:41
died an explosion if you were eaten by a
32:43
shark i'm not making
32:44
i'm making these if you will burn up in
32:46
a fire that doesn't mean you won't have
32:48
your body and the crazy thing about the
32:50
cremation let me take you back to
32:52
leviticus all the way back to leviticus
32:54
when it says do not allow yourself to be
32:56
passed through the fire
32:57
they were taking parts of their body off
33:00
back then and burning them on
33:01
false altars to false Gods and you
33:05
didn't want that to happen you cannot do
33:08
that
33:08
and or they would give family members to
33:10
be burnt on these altars to false Gods
33:12
to evil uh wicked demons and stuff like
33:15
that
33:15
so in leviticus he said that you should
33:17
not allow yourself to be passed through
33:18
the fire
33:19
that doesn't mean you cannot be cremated
33:22
it's
33:23
cheaper you're going to get that same
33:25
body back but you have to remember what
33:27
the bible says
33:28
this mortal body the one you're in
33:32
the one who's in all the caskets and all
33:34
the graveyards
33:36
if they're believers they get that body
33:38
back it says in the day that then christ
33:40
shall rise
33:41
that means your spiritual body your man
33:44
will come down
33:45
on the day God chooses your physical
33:47
body will be resurrected and it will be
33:49
joined together in spirit and it will be
33:52
guess what immortal it says
33:55
mortality will take on immortality see
33:58
your body that you have now
33:59
one day will be immortal which means it
34:02
can never age
34:03
never get sick it can never sin now this
34:06
is at the end
34:07
at the end at the end when God chooses
34:10
for that to happen like we can't choose
34:12
when the rapture happens
34:13
we can't choose when the dead and christ
34:15
shall rise we can't choose when the new
34:17
earth is made
34:18
that is on the father's timeline but i
34:21
will assure you from what he has showed
34:23
me and taken me and showed me
34:25
you get your body back and he knows
34:27
where every part and piece
34:29
is this is what he's told me i made it
34:31
the first time
34:32
i'll make it again and as i said on the
34:35
day the dead in christ your bodies that
34:37
are sleeping
34:39
they will come out of the grave or out
34:41
of the urns wherever those are
34:43
and he will bring that body back
34:45
together and join it with your spirit
34:47
man
34:48
okay and you will be immortal at that
34:51
time your body will look amazing
34:53
never age never get sick it can never
34:56
get injured
34:57
so what is our future it's called
34:59
immortality if you belong to christ
35:02
don't be concerned so much about that
35:04
but yes it is
35:05
okay with God if you get cremated
35:08
it takes less space it costs less money
35:11
you know this is what i've heard
35:12
people in heaven say i'm not jimmy but
35:15
i've heard
35:16
him say glad i was cremated and then
35:17
waste all those tens of thousands of
35:19
dollars
35:19
i don't need that money
35:21
[Laughter]
35:24
need the money don't spend by the way i
35:27
don't feel
35:28
a pressure didn't have to spend 25 50
35:31
000 70 000 uh dollars on some funeral so
35:35
you have a big show to send them off the
35:37
show
35:38
is in heaven where they're going
35:41
you can't take them there they're
35:44
partying their shows in
35:45
heaven don't try to make a show on the
35:47
earth let people
35:48
you know let them say goodbye if they
35:50
want to and and make it an
35:52
enjoyable time remember all the funny
35:55
things that you did with your friend or
35:56
your family member who's
35:58
passed away because they watched their
36:00
services
36:02
yeah that's good i remember years and
36:04
years ago my uncle i went i was a
36:06
teenager then
36:08
and there was chris he had been a pastor
36:10
but they
36:11
they buried him in a nice felt velvet
36:14
covered pine box it wasn't very
36:17
expensive
36:17
it was very plain but it was it was you
36:20
know
36:21
dignified i remember the criticism and i
36:23
kept and i remember thinking
36:25
i couldn't figure out how do i feel do i
36:27
feel good that they were
36:29
wise and didn't spend all that money or
36:30
should they have shown him respect but
36:32
you know now
36:33
the years later i'm going well wait a
36:34
minute he was having a party in heaven
36:37
while working
36:38
how he is
36:41
nobody could afford to buy or even make
36:43
on this earth eating things and the most
36:45
delicious stuff
36:47
being with friends and family and the
36:49
lord and the father
36:51
having the time of their life you really
36:54
begin to live
36:55
when you move to heaven that's good
36:58
that's good okay here's a question
37:00
um if someone is walking away i'm just
37:03
gonna admit this is my question because
37:05
every i usually try to throw one on my
37:07
this one's mine so what if someone you
37:10
love is walking away
37:11
from the lord and they're just starting
37:14
to walk away
37:14
does God alert among angels and
37:19
the holy spirit always knows does God
37:22
alert your loved ones or a praying
37:24
grandma in heaven
37:25
that there's an issue on earth within
37:27
with her grandson and she prays
37:29
or does that do those loved ones never
37:32
know about someone
37:33
needing prayer right now on earth
37:36
everyone in heaven knows when their
37:38
family member gets saved God would never
37:40
keep that from them they don't
37:42
necessarily know the tragedies you know
37:44
they
37:44
they see the wonderful moments in your
37:47
life
37:48
but i'm telling you if they prayed for
37:51
you
37:52
before they moved to heaven like your
37:55
mother your grandmother your
37:56
great-grandmother
37:57
if they prayed over you then those
38:00
prayers remain they actually will circle
38:02
around you and they will go
38:04
wherever you are and holy spirit is
38:06
always on the watch for that moment
38:09
to impress with them about christ their
38:12
angels already know sir their angels
38:15
already declaring they're moving
38:16
in different ways it's hard to explain
38:18
how that happens
38:20
but God will make sure if they're being
38:22
declared over especially
38:24
for family members for their salvation
38:26
he will make sure even at that moment of
38:28
death he will be able to present himself
38:31
to them
38:32
because he would be he would be unjust
38:34
if he didn't
38:35
that's not saying every person whoever
38:37
was on the earth will go to heaven i'm
38:38
not saying that
38:40
because you do receive christ to get
38:42
into heaven
38:43
but prayer is so powerful and the thing
38:46
is this don't try to drag your family
38:48
member that doesn't mean you can't
38:50
presume and want to pray with them let
38:51
them know that you love them
38:55
you cannot validate their sin in other
38:56
words you can't agree with it you can't
38:58
say oh that's okay
39:00
you always let them know excuse me
39:05
you always let them know that you're
39:06
standing for their salvation
39:08
that they can come to you for prayer but
39:11
absolutely they get a big target on them
39:13
by the holy spirit
39:15
and they will pursue them so they're not
39:18
going to escape being pursued by the
39:20
presence of God by holy spirit
39:23
by their angels in heaven their family
39:25
members just know they declare over you
39:27
when they get there
39:28
they're declaring all the time they will
39:30
become a powerful witness and testimony
39:32
to the saving power of jesus christ
39:34
they will declare that i've heard them
39:36
say that over portals in heaven over
39:38
their family members
39:39
so hew here on the earth i know that you
39:42
are primary and important to be here to
39:44
declare over them but they're not the
39:46
only
39:47
voices that are being heard
39:51
and have a declaring also you're
39:52
agreeing with heaven because your family
39:54
members in heaven
39:55
are also praying over that person they
39:58
are okay
39:59
and then these days there'll be so many
40:01
things that people say well
40:02
things can't change when the presence of
40:05
the living God
40:06
begins to invade here either with
40:08
baptism and fire
40:10
or the glory glory going around the
40:12
earth these are key things that that
40:15
have not really happened
40:16
yet these are events still to happen in
40:19
probably our decade or close to it
40:22
and one of the reasons another reason
40:23
why God is setting up the earth for
40:24
things there's things coming you have
40:26
no idea what that presence
40:29
feels like it is powerful it is
40:32
captivating
40:33
and the love of God because he carried
40:36
you before you came to this earth
40:38
he is your real father and his heart is
40:41
for you so that's so good
40:46
let's do this one last question um just
40:48
take a couple minutes on this because
40:49
we're a little bit over time now but i
40:51
want
40:51
several people have asked and you
40:53
answered this a few shows ago but we
40:55
always have new people watching
40:57
what do we eat in heaven and i'd like
40:58
you to add in
41:00
what jesus likes to eat because that
41:03
will give people a clue
41:04
because jesus doesn't need to eat nobody
41:07
in heaven needs to eat actually
41:09
they do it because they enjoy it okay
41:12
so what do we eat what does jesus like
41:14
to eat
41:15
jesus loves sweets
41:17
[Laughter]
41:19
i knew you're gonna say that because
41:20
you've heard you say it before he does
41:23
and he actually
41:24
loved him when he was on the earth and
41:25
the holy spirit was the one who
41:27
showed me that he said look at what his
41:30
cousin ate because you remember jesus
41:31
had a family people he had brothers
41:34
and sisters uh his mom was here his
41:38
joseph who watched over him and raised
41:39
him up to be a master carpenter
41:42
um was here so he lived with people
41:45
he went to weddings he loved to go to
41:47
weddings jesus loved weddings because
41:49
they would have dance you know how they
41:51
all the jewish dances if you don't know
41:52
what they just go look some up online
41:54
uh usually only the men danced it was a
41:57
a
41:58
fun thing that they did but they had
42:00
sweets
42:01
right they had flowers at weddings and
42:04
they danced those are three
42:06
three of jesus's favorite things
42:10
he loves flowers his own personal
42:12
mansion is in
42:13
acres of these eight to twelve foot
42:15
flowers that sing and worship him all
42:17
the time
42:18
that's why he's called the rose of
42:19
sharon the lily of the valley it was the
42:22
garden
42:22
tomb people it was the garden of eden on
42:25
the earth the garden tomb
42:27
he he loves flowers and so he loves the
42:29
aroma of them even though he made them
42:31
he still loves them so he loves flowers
42:33
he loves singing
42:35
he loves dance and he loves sweets and
42:38
the thing about food in heaven is you
42:39
can have
42:40
you say what you want and it appears
42:42
this is true
42:43
everybody visits you at your mansion
42:45
they have 50 table settings or a hundred
42:48
your guests your friends come in they
42:50
say what they want it appears on the
42:51
tables they eat it all it tastes
42:53
real because it's real but it's made out
42:56
of light it's absorbed in your body
42:58
there's no waste in heaven so food is
43:01
even better there
43:02
you don't have to worry about being
43:03
lactose intolerant or not having sugar
43:06
having sugar is not bad and someone said
43:10
i i have this is not my question but
43:12
someone says
43:13
man i just love chicken that's my thing
43:15
i love chicken
43:16
what are they gonna do in heaven well
43:19
the chickens
43:20
are like creatures they talk to you
43:22
[Laughter]
43:24
all the creatures they don't call them
43:26
animals in heaven they were called
43:28
animals on the earth but the creatures
43:31
in heaven all have personalities
43:32
including your pets and they talk to you
43:34
so nobody's gonna hunt
43:36
they don't hunt them to kill them in
43:38
heaven God that God wouldn't kill
43:40
his creatures in heaven they are
43:43
made out of light all of the food
43:47
no matter what kind of meat they have
43:49
pizza they have roast they do have
43:51
chicken
43:52
they have all kinds of food up there to
43:54
eat they have donuts they have desserts
43:56
everywhere
43:57
but it's made out of light although you
43:59
can hold it's not like your ham would
44:00
pass through it okay it's like this
44:02
cup you know you have an ice cream cone
44:04
in heaven it's a real cone but heavens
44:07
cone
44:07
heaven's ice cream you taste it when you
44:09
eat it it's delicious
44:11
there's no weight gain no food allergies
44:13
it's one of the things that make heaven
44:15
heaven what do you think the marriage
44:18
supper
44:18
i love it that they call it the supper
44:20
the marriage supper of the lamb
44:23
there are tables already laid in heaven
44:25
they've been
44:26
putting these tables everywhere all over
44:28
in heaven
44:29
and they're filled with the most amazing
44:32
delicious things to eat so whatever you
44:34
like to eat i'm pretty sure it's going
44:36
to be there but it but it's not like on
44:38
the earth it just tastes better
44:41
is something something and it doesn't
44:44
decay
44:45
so it never goes bad and you don't gain
44:47
weight because it's
44:48
light food your spirit man
44:52
your spiritual body is actually made out
44:54
of light light is a substance and having
44:56
your mansions are made out of light all
44:58
of heaven is made out of light
45:00
God is light it's a building it's a
45:03
building material in heaven light is so
45:06
so yeah well let me remind people
45:09
to jot your questions down we go through
45:11
the comments looking for your questions
45:13
for the next show ask questions about
45:15
heaven
45:16
and how God and you can ask questions on
45:20
what God does on earth from heaven
45:21
whatever that kind of thing but uh
45:23
some people ask theological questions
45:25
and we're not trying to
45:27
to make doctrines or explain pre-trib
45:30
mid-tripod we're not we don't do th
45:32
that's not our goal we're here to talk
45:33
about heaven itself
45:35
you can't Kat does say it's time to roll
45:37
up your rapture rug just because that's
45:39
a long ways off so
45:40
it doesn't matter whether you're
45:42
pre-trib mid trip or post trip
45:44
it's not going to affect your life
45:46
anyone listening to this
45:47
is that true it's not going to affect
45:48
your life during this lifetime
45:50
it is not it is not it is of quite a
45:53
ways away
45:55
you this is what jesus said himself
45:57
until we turn
45:59
you occupy you know what that means
46:02
be busy take authority in the spirit
46:05
realm
46:05
we were given dominion over the earth to
46:08
speak to the land the sea the air
46:10
it has been given to us i know that the
46:12
the the earth and the
46:14
all of the glory it belongs to christ
46:16
i'm not saying that so this is why we
46:18
don't get into theological questions
46:20
i know jesus i know why he
46:23
came here why the father wanted us to
46:26
have these physical bodies why not just
46:28
say a little spiritual being because
46:29
then you'd never step into your destiny
46:31
become what he wants okay
46:33
but you who are alive right now it is
46:36
not your job to declare when the rapture
46:38
is coming let people think there's no
46:40
time left on the earth when the greatest
46:42
things
46:43
of course we know God making us making
46:45
the earth christ dying christ
46:47
resurrecting
46:48
those are the greatest things but other
46:50
than that why did he
46:52
make us he's not going to make you
46:55
especially
46:56
this country he didn't make this country
46:57
to be here for a few hundred years
46:59
this country will become major and by
47:01
the way i will let you know this
47:02
personally from God
47:04
um america is not babylon you might
47:07
think sometimes this is not the great
47:11
city that will fall
47:12
this is not the this is not babylon
47:15
this is not where all the evil of the
47:17
evil on the earth will be
47:18
that most of that stuff it talks about
47:20
in the tribulation will happen for those
47:22
who think it won't
47:23
guess what the rapture will happen the
47:25
tribulation will happen it is
47:27
70 years that's all the time the enemy
47:29
gets
47:30
then after that is a thousand year reign
47:32
that's going to happen people say that's
47:34
not happening
47:35
christ will sit on the throne in
47:37
jerusalem for 1 000
47:39
years and then even after that when
47:41
satan's loose from the bottomless pit
47:43
here's some theology for you i know my
47:45
bible
47:46
then he will go on deceiving the natural
47:48
people who were on the earth admitted to
47:50
the tribulation that
47:52
didn't didn't take the mark of the beast
47:55
here's the big picture okay God's got a
47:57
timeline
47:58
he said satan gets seven short years
48:01
to be in charge and even half of those
48:04
will be deception
48:05
only three and a half years will all the
48:07
evil and wickedness you find the
48:09
horrific things that will happen
48:10
you won't be here
48:14
so you focus on right now what God's
48:17
doing uh something so
48:18
amazing and beautiful in this earth but
48:20
the things he said in the bible i would
48:22
tell you people who want to take them
48:24
out i warn you
48:26
do not remove things from the bible that
48:28
God wants there
48:29
he needs these things to happen and they
48:32
will happen whether you want them to
48:34
or not but you are chosen in a special
48:36
time in the kingdom age when the kingdom
48:39
we will operate in that spiritual
48:41
kingdom on this earth and people see
48:43
things change rapidly
48:45
darkness will be pushed back and crushed
48:47
down because even that won't be gone
48:49
until the earth isn't here anymore okay
48:52
so you your theological understanding of
48:55
head knowledge
48:56
makes sure you get revelation from God
48:59
that's so good
49:00
they're not in your lifetime let those
49:02
who will be here will be much more
49:04
powerful in the spirit
49:05
and so i want to encourage you you run
49:08
your race you be who he made you to be
49:10
don't try to be someone else because you
49:12
have greatness
49:14
in you that's good Kat thank you so so
49:17
so much for another one remember
49:19
Kat's gonna be here every wednesday if
49:21
something were to of an important that
49:23
God gave her some revelation that needed
49:24
to get out we would put her on a second
49:26
show of the day whatever
49:27
so don't worry about missing it and if

and uh i i i just hope that this will be
01:55
a time of great thanksgiving if i look
01:56
back on this year
01:58
there is a great deal to be thankful for
02:00
so
02:01
um yes it's been a tough year in the
02:03
pandemic and all that but
02:05
we are the children of God and we the
02:08
word says we have to rejoice in the lord
02:10
always and again
02:11
i say rejoice so this is a time of
02:13
rejoicing it's always a time of
02:14
rejoicing so
02:16
well listen we got a lot of content to
02:18
cover so i'm not going to give any more
02:20
announcements uh be sure to text your
02:22
friends other than that let's bring on
02:24
Kat Kerr here and
02:27
there she is magically hey kat how are
02:29
you hi i'm always great thanks
02:32
i've been looking forward to this you
02:34
know if
02:36
if my questions about heaven accumulate
02:38
very much more
02:39
i'm gonna have to uh do you twice a week
02:42
but we're getting lots of questions
02:43
about
02:44
we'll get to that sooner we may not
02:45
cover the uh elections quite as long
02:48
uh although if we have the content to do
02:50
so we absolutely will
02:52
but we've been doing about half the
02:54
elections and half of
02:56
uh questions about heaven so
02:59
let's see how it goes today and whatever
03:01
the lord will so
03:02
yeah let me just let me just introduce
03:05
my question
03:06
and then i'm going to turn it over to
03:07
you just before i went on the air
03:09
someone told us that people were
03:11
saying or asking hasn't
03:16
the hasn't trump and even his people
03:19
begin to concede the election
03:21
what do you have to say about that
03:23
absolutely not
03:26
i hear from him on a regular basis
03:27
there's no way he's conceding
03:30
he has a very hard evidence
03:33
and you have to understand just because
03:35
you start with the lower courts
03:37
right now they're in the lower courts uh
03:39
giving evidence
03:40
and then it goes automatically to the
03:42
higher court which is where he needs to
03:44
go that's what he's waiting on this what
03:46
he wants
03:47
there's so much evidence and i don't
03:49
know how people are going to escape
03:50
going to prison
03:51
and this is what the holy spirit said to
03:53
me the only transition
03:55
that will happen in the democratic party
03:57
is probably them transitioning to go to
03:59
jail
04:00
wow now i'm not proceeding no one's
04:03
going to concede in that
04:04
they know that they've already had a
04:06
victory they have the evidence to prove
04:08
that they're not conceding everybody
04:10
hang on
04:16
um so don't be concerned about that
04:18
let's go to the next thing
04:20
so so someone asked me um
04:23
there was someone that wrote and they
04:24
were offended and i i it's too we need
04:26
to be careful
04:27
how we say it things that we say but
04:30
um i'm gonna ask two questions at the
04:32
same time is it is it not true
04:35
that God sits in heaven and laughs at
04:37
his enemies even in scorn he scorns his
04:39
enemies
04:40
and at the same question i'm going to
04:42
say you mentioned that God
04:44
gave you a clip about biden and it was a
04:47
scoring
04:48
thing he was saying the only the only
04:50
cabinet biden is going to form is the
04:52
is the cabinet that he puts a cereal in
04:55
and someone was offended because they
04:56
basically they want
04:58
God to act like a christian
05:01
and then we put it that way in other
05:02
words God doesn't worship
05:04
himself he he he is who he is we worship
05:09
him
05:10
that's right he's he doesn't have to act
05:14
unscorpical if his enemies are coming
05:16
against him
05:17
so talk about that for a minute does he
05:19
scorn
05:20
at his enemy actually God was talking to
05:23
me about that this morning
05:24
this must be really something that he
05:25
wants to say although they think it's
05:27
something they want to say
05:29
God does have his own opinions
05:32
and his thoughts and let me tell you
05:34
what he says in his bible
05:36
we should walk in his ways and
05:39
we should have his thoughts that's
05:41
actually what the bible says
05:43
so if you want what is correct is what
05:45
he thinks
05:46
and it's the way he operates and let me
05:49
tell you he is holy
05:50
he is powerful and there's things that
05:52
he gets involved in
05:53
times on the earth and he's not letting
05:55
go of it and this is one of those things
05:58
he made his choice for a reason you
06:01
don't understand that reason
06:02
well then you need to just accept it as
06:04
what God is saying
06:06
that was the holy spirit that told me
06:08
that by the way the holy spirit is the
06:10
drama king and yes he did say that
06:12
the only cabinet biden will ever have
06:14
i'll repeat it for you this is from the
06:15
holy spirit the only cabinet biden will
06:17
ever have
06:17
is the one he keeps his cereal in and
06:20
filled with nuts fruit and flakes
06:25
to the holy spirit the father did say
06:27
this however
06:29
verbally through me in colorado this is
06:32
what he said before the election
06:34
why would you choose a villain for your
06:36
president
06:37
when i have already sent you a superhero
06:39
named trump
06:41
and God did not change his mind and you
06:43
know why
06:44
he knows the thoughts and intents of
06:46
both sides hearts okay
06:48
we can say it's a republican democrat we
06:51
can say it's the light in the darkness
06:52
we can say it's good and it's evil you
06:53
say whatever you want to
06:54
there's a line drawn and the left does
06:57
not
06:58
stand for life that means they stand for
07:01
death
07:02
God does not want people running this
07:04
country that stand for
07:05
death when he's a God of life that sends
07:08
life to this world
07:09
so yes he does he he actually has been
07:11
scornful
07:12
several times in the bible if he wanted
07:14
to he could take their breath away
07:16
and i think he's being very gracious by
07:19
not doing that
07:20
and in my own personal thoughts but i
07:22
will tell you i only say what he says
07:25
and i will only tell you what he has
07:27
shown me that is to come trump will
07:30
absolutely sit in that white house now
07:33
as president for the next four years
07:35
i remember that uh they will be held
07:38
accountable for all their crimes
07:40
i remember that jesus on the earth he
07:42
said they told him what herod was saying
07:45
and he said tell that fox yes today i'm
07:48
hearing it tomorrow
07:49
and then the third day i don't have it
07:52
fully memorized
07:54
even jesus who never came other than
07:57
this time against
07:58
um secular authorities just put it that
08:01
way
08:01
well accepted he also said your invited
08:05
sepulcher is full of dead man's bones
08:08
and that was the hierarchy and the
08:10
religious
08:11
and in the jewish religion at that time
08:13
that was his statement to them
08:14
you're white as sepulchers that means
08:16
they're dead people okay you're dead
08:18
you're dead in your belief you're dead
08:19
in the way you live your life
08:21
so jesus had a righteous that was his
08:23
righteousness coming out
08:25
he did give his opinion of what he
08:27
thought as the son of the living God
08:30
and they don't like people who sin who
08:32
hate who want to kill who want to
08:33
control
08:34
they don't side with that yes christ
08:37
died for their sins
08:38
they obviously have not chosen the path
08:41
that God has laid up for us is to to
08:43
prosper to be in health
08:45
to live right righteously and to help
08:48
him bring hope
08:49
but not control that's good um now
08:53
let me hit the other side of this so for
08:55
those and this woman may be watching who
08:57
wrote that question and
08:58
it was an honest question she didn't
09:00
really like that you know you called the
09:02
holy spirit the joy he she said durham a
09:04
queen but
09:05
he said drama king um
09:08
God has a personality jesus has a
09:11
personality
09:12
the holy spirit has a person and they
09:14
all have temperaments and personalities
09:15
we are made in his likeness
09:17
we have personalities of our own God's
09:20
ways are part are part of his
09:22
temperament
09:23
personality value systems so
09:26
this is the way God can be God revealed
09:30
to you
09:30
that part of the holy spirit's
09:33
personality
09:34
his temperament is that he loves drama
09:37
is that right
09:37
it does if you've ever been baptized in
09:40
the holy spirit which i never mind
09:42
talking about what do you think drama
09:44
is your language has changed your
09:46
reactions have changed
09:48
even the way you live begins to change
09:50
we've had people on the day
09:52
that when they got baptized in the holy
09:53
spirit they would spin they would twirl
09:55
they would roll on the floor this is a
09:57
reaction of
09:59
that power of holy spirit invading you
10:01
when you ask him
10:02
into your life it brings power it brings
10:05
you get revelation on things to come
10:07
it's it's it's a powerful experience and
10:10
he loves
10:10
not just drama here he loves the dramas
10:14
he loves art dance he loves music
10:18
that's why they call him now you may
10:20
think in your head what you think drama
10:21
is on the earth i'm talking about in
10:23
heaven
10:24
but yes he meets things he shakes things
10:27
uh he shows things sometimes people
10:29
don't expect
10:30
but yes that is exactly how he feels
10:32
about
10:33
people usurping their authority and
10:36
taking control when they have no control
10:38
he doesn't like it and that is exactly
10:41
what the left is trying to do
10:43
they're trying to improve they won and
10:44
they're already planting their cabin
10:46
they're picking their people
10:47
it won't happen it's just not going to
10:49
happen they're making it up
10:51
they hope will believe it because they
10:53
know they can control you by what they
10:54
say
10:55
if you believe it don't repeat it
10:58
and don't receive whatever they are
11:00
saying is happening
11:01
because the truth is this trump has
11:03
already won
11:04
and he's got the evidence to prove it
11:07
that's good
11:08
now kat we talked about uh even
11:11
the scornful attitude that the lord has
11:14
for his enemies
11:16
and what they're doing is this possible
11:20
does God scorn some of the things that
11:23
like what he said about biden
11:25
and at the same time does God love by me
11:28
he loves everybody because every single
11:30
person who ever lived on this earth came
11:32
from him he carried us all inside of
11:36
himself as little spirits that's where a
11:38
little spirit man lived in him
11:40
of course if he did not love us he would
11:43
have
11:43
never sent his son to suffer
11:47
to die to drink that cup of every evil
11:49
wicked deed that could possibly happen
11:51
and nail that sin to the cross he would
11:54
have never done it if he didn't love
11:55
people
11:56
but there's times he can use some people
11:58
that sometimes he can't use them at all
12:00
sometimes he they just need mercy so
12:02
they don't die and go to hell
12:04
because let me tell you God does have a
12:07
window of time when he's doing
12:08
something on the earth that he can wait
12:10
for you to come alongside
12:12
or you just pay consequences i'm not
12:14
saying he brings the confluences you
12:16
create them yourself
12:17
by choosing the wrong thing no choosing
12:20
of life no choosing of hope no future
12:23
um no fairness okay no righteousness
12:26
God can't use them because that's the
12:29
way they're living it doesn't mean he
12:31
doesn't
12:31
love them he'll love people all the way
12:33
to hell trust me
12:35
because you don't have a will and
12:36
they're choosing with their will what
12:38
they want
12:39
it's not what God needs in this world
12:41
because he's making a change for the
12:43
next 100 years
12:44
this isn't just an election this has to
12:47
do with the next 20 years
12:48
in the white house and then the next 100
12:51
after that
12:52
so God's made his choices and he wants
12:55
his will his way
12:56
concerning all of this and so what the
12:58
others chose when they
13:00
did corruption and crime they will pay
13:03
for that
13:04
uh their salves they will have justice
13:05
we will have justice over all that
13:08
that's really good and now all all of
13:10
the prophetic voices that i keep
13:12
checking with them
13:13
i don't say are you sure you believe i
13:15
don't mean it like that i mean i just
13:16
stay in touch
13:18
let them know what they're saying and
13:20
people need to know that the prophetic
13:21
voices we've had on here
13:23
not one of them has said i'm retracting
13:25
i'm thinking twice about this
13:27
this is looking bad no no one says that
13:30
there's a unified voice so i'll just ask
13:32
you point blank have you for a moment
13:35
doubted since november three
13:37
that trump would be re-elected you're
13:39
not talking to me are you
13:40
yeah i'm i'm i'm asking you have you for
13:43
even a moment
13:44
doubted i never doubted it in 2015 when
13:49
he told me the first time and caught me
13:50
up to heaven and showed me trump in the
13:52
white house for
13:53
eight years eight years in a row he will
13:56
be sitting in that white house
13:58
i never doubted i never doubted anything
14:00
that was going on i knew stuff was being
14:01
i knew the indict that they shut down on
14:03
the third
14:04
that they were going to cheat i knew the
14:06
holy spirit they're going to stick false
14:07
ballots they're going to steal ballots
14:09
he would tell me what was going to
14:10
happen
14:10
that is exactly what has happened and
14:13
then you
14:14
you told me i hope this is not talking
14:16
out of school you see like because i
14:17
asked you recently
14:19
how do you know this or how did God show
14:21
you tell you this and you said God
14:23
didn't tell me this
14:25
he took me and showed me this is that
14:27
what
14:28
is that how you got this revelation yes
14:30
that's how he's been dealing with me
14:32
he's always shown me things not to this
14:35
level
14:36
when i was even a little girl i could
14:38
see the spirit realm i knew the
14:39
operations going on in the spirit realm
14:41
i got born again at age four so i've
14:44
been saved 60 some years i forget how
14:46
old i'm because i'm planning to be
14:47
timeless just so add that one more thing
14:49
to your list
14:50
you should be declaring that for
14:51
yourself but let me tell you he takes me
14:55
in the future and shows me what is going
14:58
on
14:58
i've seen clearly 50 years into the
15:01
future and he
15:02
has a reason why he needs trump then
15:05
pence then whoever pence picks his
15:06
vice president he needs these 24 years
15:11
because he will be allowed in the white
15:13
house and it will change
15:15
america so much so no he's not changing
15:18
his mind
15:19
God won't holy spirit won't jesus won't
15:21
all of heaven is
15:22
focused but they're celebrating you know
15:25
why they've seen the beginning to the
15:26
end and the end of the beginning
15:28
they already know what's going to happen
15:30
that's so good all right well you ready
15:32
for some questions about heaven
15:34
yes i am um so those of you who may be
15:37
new
15:38
or new ish ken has been to heaven way
15:41
more than a thousand times you said you
15:42
stopped counting at a thousand
15:44
there are and i think one time recently
15:46
you said you know
15:47
you personally know of about 100 people
15:50
who have gone
15:51
to heaven i know several people uh
15:54
besides you i probably if you counted
15:56
them there's seven or eight people i
15:57
know who
15:57
who have visits to heaven so let's talk
16:01
about heaven
16:02
and i'm gonna start okay i'm gonna start
16:04
with a question from my son-in-law
16:06
okay he's a little bit new to some of
16:08
this stuff and he i see
16:10
i asked my daughter if she had any
16:11
questions she said ben has two questions
16:14
so
16:14
this is for ben i love ben he's a
16:17
nutcase but he's great he
16:19
teach my daughter so good and he's
16:21
probably the best father i've ever seen
16:23
on the planet earth
16:24
he loves his kids so much his two boys
16:27
here's his question
16:28
and we've heard this question before but
16:29
let's do but from time to time we're
16:31
going to have to do it again
16:32
he said um
16:37
ben's question about heaven uh where do
16:39
a husband and wife on earth have a
16:41
special relationship
16:44
in heaven with each other that's
16:46
question one and two is not related to
16:48
that but he wants to know
16:50
if if when you're in heaven can you see
16:53
earth
16:54
i don't know if he means can you see the
16:55
planet earth he probably means
16:57
can you see your loved ones on earth or
16:59
see what's going on on earth
17:01
so maybe i'll just throw that open for
17:03
both of those questions
17:05
all right um when you die
17:08
the word says that you are no longer
17:11
married
17:11
so that's that's clue number one you go
17:14
home
17:15
not as it's not that you don't remember
17:17
of course you're going to remember you
17:19
were married
17:20
you do have a very close friendship with
17:22
the one that you're the
17:23
your husband or wife will have close
17:24
relationships you
17:26
literally live live right next door each
17:28
other sometimes because everybody has
17:29
their own mansion
17:30
you come home as the father
17:33
son or daughter so once it says you it
17:37
says until death do you part you even
17:39
say it in your marriage vows
17:40
that's not because God is unkindness
17:42
because there's only one
17:44
bridegroom in all of heaven his name is
17:47
jesus christ
17:49
and so that should give you a clue and
17:51
probably maybe two years ago
17:52
the father caught me up and actually
17:54
showed me why he says that no one can be
17:57
married in heaven
17:58
and why he said that because of the
18:00
purpose of his son
18:02
is going to have a wedding with all of
18:04
us
18:05
and we are bride of christ male female
18:08
all of us are the bride of christ
18:10
you have to get out of your head it's
18:11
not like here on the earth
18:13
you'll be set aside special for him
18:15
because he redeemed you he died for you
18:18
and so you go home though as father son
18:22
and his daughter and you each get
18:24
whatever your mansion is going to be
18:25
built around the passion you have the
18:27
gift you have
18:28
and so that's why he gives you one that
18:30
doesn't mean you don't see each other
18:31
you remember who your sons are your
18:33
daughters you remember your family
18:35
lineage
18:36
and of course you're close to them but
18:38
no one in heaven will be married you can
18:41
visit each other all the time and no
18:43
one's going to really care
18:45
about the other because everyone in
18:47
heaven
18:48
is very much in love with jesus christ
18:51
he's the number one for everyone in
18:53
heaven and um
18:54
you'll never regret giving yourself to
18:56
him your
18:57
your life will be filled with adventure
18:59
excitement uh
19:00
joy celebration awe and splendor and
19:03
wonder
19:04
and everybody's so happy they're there
19:07
so that's good both questions i'm good
19:10
that's so good so if someone's had
19:12
uh more than one spouse's three or four
19:14
spouses
19:16
um and maybe they were all great or
19:17
maybe they weren't you're still gonna be
19:19
if they make it to heaven you're all
19:21
gonna be friends but there's not going
19:23
to be jealousy
19:24
or insecure jealousy does not
19:27
exist in heaven you're thinking in your
19:29
flesh
19:30
in this flesh body you have all kinds of
19:33
emotions and stuff
19:34
you can be influenced by the enemy by
19:36
negative people
19:38
no one gets offended there's no fear
19:41
there's no anger
19:42
there's there's no coveting there's
19:44
absolutely no jealousy okay
19:46
absolutely none so you don't have those
19:49
because they don't exist in the
19:50
atmosphere of heaven
19:52
you're living in your spiritual body
19:54
it's a literal body
19:56
in a literal world where you enjoy
19:58
things touch play
19:59
run enjoy your mansion and everything
20:02
but
20:02
none of those things exist because
20:04
you're living in the very
20:06
presence of the one who made you heaven
20:08
is consumed
20:10
you still have wonder like i said
20:11
adventure and excitement
20:13
but no one is ever jealous nobody ever
20:16
gets
20:16
upset or angry isn't that amazing that's
20:19
why
20:20
it's called heaven that's good so
20:23
let's say ben's grandparents are in
20:25
heaven can they see him
20:28
yes they can see him God made places on
20:30
purpose i've been to those places
20:32
several times i even have a
20:35
um a sketch of one in my first book
20:37
they're called
20:38
they're actually called portals and
20:40
people go into these beautiful buildings
20:43
and in the floor of this place you walk
20:45
up steps and literally look over a
20:46
balcony railing there's a huge opening
20:49
when you look down you see your family
20:50
members as close as the ceiling of their
20:53
home
20:54
i will however let you know this you
20:56
seen you see no
20:57
sufferings no agonies you don't see that
21:01
part of stuff going on
21:03
what you will see is any celebrations
21:05
any babies being born any marriages
21:08
any accomplishments even in the natural
21:10
if you get like rewarded at work if you
21:12
get a new position
21:14
um if you've done something amazing for
21:16
God and God
21:17
has spoken rewards or blessings over you
21:20
no one in heaven misses any of that and
21:22
on your own birthday
21:24
they go to these places and look down
21:26
and they actually sing happy birthday to
21:27
you
21:28
i love that and then they go and get a
21:30
gift for you and they put it in your
21:32
mansion
21:33
so every year you're apart you will
21:36
literally have that many gifts in your
21:38
mansion to open from all of your family
21:40
members and friends
21:41
wow that's really good okay now this
21:43
one's mine for ben he doesn't know i'm
21:45
gonna ask this
21:46
okay ben is a what i this is my turn for
21:50
him
21:50
he's an adrenaline junkie he'll ride on
21:53
two wheels on an atv
21:54
on a hillside he does all things
21:57
dangerous
21:58
and loves it and she teaches his
22:00
children to do that
22:02
does he get to do stuff like that in
22:03
heaven he
22:05
is going to love heaven
22:08
[Laughter]
22:09
then have extreme sports in heaven and
22:12
this is the best part
22:13
no helmets required and that's exactly
22:16
how jesus
22:17
and i've actually seen i've actually was
22:19
taken to a football game i'm sure
22:21
you know people find some way to blast
22:22
this where do you go there you're gonna
22:24
find out it doesn't bother me that you
22:26
say things against us
22:27
because these people have a gift
22:30
athletes who are good
22:31
okay i'm not saying there won't be
22:33
something that might not be good
22:34
whether you're recording artists if
22:36
you're a dancer like boy and stuff like
22:38
that
22:39
if you're a creator of movies that
22:41
produces something and you're doing the
22:42
good stuff
22:43
uh that is the gift and people know
22:46
people who are gifted they want to hear
22:48
them they want to see them be near them
22:51
you have a gift he probably has a
22:52
passion and a gift to do the extreme
22:54
sports
22:55
yes places all over heaven God made for
22:58
that
22:58
happen you can ride up these trail bikes
23:02
on roads of light that go uh and
23:04
crazy the places that they take you
23:06
there no one can get hurt
23:08
injured or die in heaven so it can be
23:12
about as extreme as you want to by the
23:14
way all these sports or other things
23:16
if they're scoreboards where a score is
23:18
kept jesus
23:20
christ gets all the points this is the
23:22
way it's a form of worship for him
23:24
because they're using their gift they
23:26
did it here on the earth and even if you
23:28
didn't get to you use it in heaven
23:29
so let's say in this football game
23:31
there's two different teams
23:33
i will say this their guardian angels
23:35
are in the stands
23:36
cheering them on this is you're going to
23:38
love having i'm telling you
23:39
and so as they play the sport that when
23:42
the when one side gets the ball over
23:44
whatever they do i don't play football
23:45
they get a score on their scoreboard but
23:48
once it goes to theirs it goes up to
23:50
jesus
23:51
they will be more passionate and
23:54
probably more
23:55
focused to win because they're winning
23:58
for him
23:59
and whoever gets creates more points
24:02
for jesus that team gets to carry jesus
24:06
across the field i gotta ask this your
24:08
your son
24:10
i'm sorry your husband bing we call him
24:12
captain bing
24:13
uh he loves to fish
24:17
yeah you don't like fish at all no i
24:19
don't okay
24:20
so you love to fish and that is like the
24:23
favorite pastime of all you can ever
24:25
think about
24:27
what about heaven do you get the fish
24:30
the difference in heaven is this
24:32
i will always say this no animals lives
24:35
are given to feed you in heaven it isn't
24:38
necessary uh the food is made out of
24:40
light every bit of it is made out of
24:42
light
24:43
and you can go fishing there's even a
24:45
way to go hunting but you do by
24:47
capturing photos of the of whatever
24:49
you're hunting
24:50
and you can win unless they get you
24:52
first
24:54
fish can pull my husband into the
24:56
crystal sea first
24:59
it's an epic battle they don't use
25:01
really
25:02
yeah they don't use a hook to catch this
25:04
fish but if he can
25:06
ever get the fish in the boat i would
25:08
like to be there when that happens one
25:09
day
25:10
because normally it's the other way
25:11
around these the creatures other
25:13
creatures have personalities
25:15
and they're very good if you go to a
25:17
rodeo and think you're going to ride
25:19
that horse honey
25:20
it's been there for a long time and
25:22
rarely will you ever be able to win
25:24
on any bowl or horse in heaven or or you
25:27
can
25:28
eventually do it probably i don't know
25:30
how often you'd have to try to do it but
25:32
you won't get hurt or injured no broken
25:34
bones nothing wrong with you
25:36
the people want to do these type of
25:38
things and yes i'm sure my husband will
25:40
fish
25:40
and i always say that peter will be his
25:42
best friend because that's where peter
25:44
is in heaven
25:45
peter is always fishing really
25:49
yes i think he's still trying to catch
25:51
something
25:54
that's so good well that means there's
25:56
golf there's all these
25:57
pastimes i had to ask this this is i was
26:00
thinking about this before the show
26:02
are there places like disneyland
26:05
on earth well how do i say this are
26:07
there places like disneyland in heaven
26:10
because we invented them on earth or did
26:12
we invent them on earth
26:14
because there were places like that in
26:15
heaven we invented them on earth because
26:18
there were places like that in
26:20
heaven this is why and i can tell you
26:23
this is
26:24
why when paul was caught up in saul he
26:26
couldn't even
26:27
speak about it because he knew people in
26:29
his day would probably tar and feather
26:31
him if he ever mentioned what he saw
26:33
there's things beyond your imagination
26:35
even as much as we know and understand
26:38
now in the earth if you want to talk
26:40
about technology it's beyond your
26:42
imagination
26:43
the things that you can do in heaven
26:45
that you could never do here
26:47
but paul actually saw some of those
26:48
places like if paul saw an amusement
26:50
park
26:51
number one he wouldn't really know how
26:52
to explain would you describe that
26:55
today so he wouldn't say anything he
26:58
wouldn't say anything about being in the
26:59
third heaven
27:00
and i know a lot of other people have
27:02
been caught up that didn't want to say
27:03
anything about what they saw
27:05
i went if he asked you to speak about it
27:08
then you need to really speak about it
27:09
but i was taken to an amusement park and
27:12
it's just crazy the roller coasters
27:14
go on the track they go off the track
27:16
around the sky
27:17
under the crystal sea and come back up
27:19
this is what i meant you don't have to
27:21
worry about breathing the water or not
27:23
being able to breathe at all
27:24
it's heaven so yes they've always had
27:27
many things in heaven before we ever had
27:29
them on the earth and
27:30
witty ideas and inventions are sat down
27:32
even says so in the bible
27:34
every every good and perfect gift comes
27:36
down from the father of
27:37
lights the father of lights that was you
27:39
and him okay
27:41
your little spirit man is made out of
27:42
light and so he's always sending them
27:45
we just now are going to be some brand
27:47
new ones we never have before
27:49
so yes it is actually important to have
27:52
fun
27:52
now having fun is a night you can have
27:56
fun
27:56
but i don't embrace anything that even
27:58
looks like witchcraft has
28:00
images uh there are no good witches in
28:03
the earth i'll give you that for free
28:05
God clearly spoke against them even back
28:07
in jesus's day
28:08
and then none of them were good but that
28:11
is something that will be coming to the
28:12
earth eventually
28:13
that you can have good witchcraft and
28:15
practice it don't ever do it don't have
28:17
a part
28:17
a part of it it says have nothing to do
28:19
with a necromancer
28:21
if you go look that work it means
28:22
witchcraft wow
28:24
but you can have fun you definitely need
28:26
to have fun you need to laugh
28:28
especially together as a family but even
28:30
you yourself the best thing you can do
28:32
in the midst
28:33
of a trial is open your mouth and
28:36
laugh at the enemy because our life is
28:39
in the hand of our God
28:41
and people i already know some of this
28:43
is happening already
28:44
people are getting the most extravagant
28:46
things given to them
28:47
and in a degree they never thought
28:49
possible even right now
28:51
in this time because God sets a table
28:55
that table is extravagance it's full
28:58
provision it's more than you expected
29:00
and he does it in the midst of
29:01
everything going on around you
29:03
so i'm going to tell you you need to
29:05
expect and say i will receive
29:07
suddenlies i will receive the goodness
29:09
of God instead of thinking about all the
29:11
negative stuff going on
29:13
say what God would say that's so good
29:16
okay that's good boy this is so good
29:18
this is very meaty this is very good
29:20
i'm encouraged as well okay this one i
29:23
thought maybe someone was joking
29:25
or or it was a crazy question then i
29:28
realized it's a serious question
29:30
um they're asking a jewish question and
29:33
then i looked and said well sure enough
29:35
it is a jewish name
29:36
but it says have you any time have
29:39
anytime seen
29:40
anything related to israel or anything
29:42
jewish in heaven
29:44
did you see any jews there i would love
29:46
to know about that
29:48
i have seen jews there and i can tell
29:50
you this they're still God's chosen
29:52
people we
29:53
are grafted in there's a lot of people
29:54
that say that doesn't matter anymore
29:57
that is not so i actually have you and
30:00
me too
30:00
but in order to answer that question
30:04
the most powerful thing one of the most
30:05
powerful things God showed me was i
30:08
begin to see
30:09
what you would call the star of david or
30:11
the star of israel
30:12
it's on their flag you know the
30:14
six-pointed star
30:16
everywhere well guess what it's in
30:18
heaven everywhere
30:20
and i would start to tell people God and
30:22
he does he loves the jewish people he
30:24
loves them
30:24
they were the very first people
30:28
on the earth ever that represented God
30:33
even jesus came God called him he made a
30:36
covenant with abraham
30:38
that was a powerful covenant and we're
30:40
grafted into that too
30:41
so it's not like we're over here and
30:43
they're over here
30:45
we're actually going to be one one day
30:47
and actually God said this is what i
30:49
think about them
30:50
and he caught me up to heaven to show me
30:52
that jewish star
30:53
and he said this actually is called the
30:56
jewish race star
30:58
but actually it's my own personal
31:01
sign well so it started in heaven it was
31:04
invented in heaven
31:06
it was always been in heaven so God said
31:07
when i chose the people to represent me
31:09
in the earth
31:11
what sign or symbol this is how he
31:13
explained it to me
31:15
what sign or symbol would i give them if
31:17
they're representing me
31:19
most of the time i'm someone that i
31:21
can't answer God in my mind i will
31:24
and i would in my mind i said of course
31:26
it would be yours
31:28
and so he showed me he took that that
31:30
that six point star in front of me
31:32
took it apart he said this represents
31:35
the three points father son and holy
31:36
spirit
31:37
this represents body soul and spirit
31:40
represents
31:41
mankind and when i put them together
31:44
that is my
31:44
dream so if you think God did not love
31:47
you and he gave that symbol his own
31:50
personal symbol
31:51
to the jewish people because they
31:53
represented him in the earth
31:54
it's it's still it's it's an honored
31:57
symbol in heaven because it represents
31:58
the father
31:59
but i actually have seen jews that
32:01
received christ even at their very death
32:04
receive jesus christ as their savior and
32:06
so i could tell you
32:08
they have a pretty good probably 90.9
32:12
chance of ending up in heaven especially
32:15
if they're
32:16
orthodox to you and even though it's
32:19
hard to keep his ways
32:20
worship him him for God you still have
32:22
to receive christ
32:24
you're not doing that even if it's at
32:26
the moment or almost the moment of your
32:27
death
32:28
sometimes he'll present himself to them
32:30
and say do you want me now
32:32
and he does that to many people actually
32:34
yeah not just the jews but you did tell
32:36
me once that
32:37
he appeared before orthodox rabbis or in
32:39
with
32:40
two between life and death right those
32:43
that's he did
32:44
moments that's really good yes and
32:46
actually i'll just take maybe two
32:48
minutes to tell
32:49
you go ahead quick side of the story
32:51
there was this precious jewish young man
32:54
who he was an orthodox jew he kept God's
32:56
ways you know that he talked about in
32:57
the old testament
32:58
he was very faithful in doing that and
33:01
so did his parents before him
33:04
and i have to say that about the jewish
33:05
race those who are orthodox they
33:07
they don't break what they believe God
33:10
wants
33:10
they don't compromise in their lives
33:12
they stay very true to God
33:14
and that's the way they live their life
33:16
so they died and they passed on
33:18
and he had friends christian friends who
33:20
said we hope your parents receive christ
33:22
because we'd hate to think of them being
33:24
in hell
33:24
which unfortunately is what a lot of
33:27
christians say to people when they
33:28
haven't been there to see
33:30
and so this young man sort of crying out
33:32
to God himself
33:33
and saying would you really put my
33:36
parents in hell
33:37
they loved you with with no end to their
33:40
love
33:41
they gave they helped others you know
33:44
they were so
33:44
faithful to you would you do that
33:47
and two nights later jesus christ
33:49
appeared to this young man in his room
33:52
and he said why would i be unjust
33:56
to ignore the fact that they had such
33:58
love
33:59
for for righteousness in the holiness of
34:01
God himself
34:03
how could i ignore that he said your
34:05
parents are in heaven because i
34:06
met with them right before that moment
34:08
of death and offered myself to them and
34:10
they received me and the guy fell on the
34:12
floor
34:13
just wailing and crying wow christ had
34:16
such a love for those
34:18
who were pursuing you know what they
34:20
know to be right
34:21
he he took the time and so he told him
34:24
and then he of course received christ
34:26
himself in that moment
34:27
so you know don't ever say unless God
34:31
showed you somebody
34:32
that wasn't in heaven to show that you
34:34
in hell i've seen okay i've seen hitler
34:36
and help people he's there
34:37
i've seen several people in hell yeah he
34:39
didn't want forgiveness he didn't care
34:41
he want he wanted to kill steal and
34:42
destroy and control
34:44
no that's where he's on the meat hook in
34:45
heaven he's one of the most tormented
34:47
people in all of hell because
34:49
satan will promise people he still does
34:51
today
34:52
i will give you money power wealth does
34:54
that sound like what he said to jesus
34:56
if you take me and receive me and i do
34:58
all these evil things for me
34:59
when you die i'll set you up in the
35:01
kingdom no he doesn't
35:03
he loves nobody but God on the other
35:06
hand
35:07
loves you even while you're yet sinners
35:09
you have every chance and i'm praying
35:11
that everybody has someone declaring
35:13
don't stop declaring over your family
35:14
members
35:15
or those who you love like a family
35:17
member that they will receive cries
35:19
that's wow that's that's amazing now
35:21
i've heard you answer this several times
35:23
but we have
35:24
lots and lots of people coming on new
35:26
every single broadcast
35:28
this woman said i miscarried my baby
35:30
what can i expect when i get to heaven
35:33
you can expect to have that very same
35:36
baby given back to you
35:38
um every single baby and i know there's
35:40
even people who don't believe this or
35:42
they preach against this every baby
35:44
when God sends them it's their spiritual
35:47
body
35:48
that has the soul in it okay
35:51
and number one they never stop existing
35:54
you never stop existing
35:56
you're an eternal being right now if
35:58
you're a believer one day you'll become
36:00
immortal which means you can't sin you
36:02
can't die
36:03
but everyone has an eternal that means
36:05
you'll live forever
36:07
that's why it's important to choose
36:08
where you go okay
36:10
you want to go there so those babies who
36:13
never did anything wrong to anybody
36:15
they're innocent whether their life is
36:18
taken in abortion or they miscarried
36:20
them
36:21
and didn't make it their own guardian
36:24
angel
36:24
which is sent to them at the time of
36:26
conception this is how God does it so
36:28
life does begin at conception
36:30
when that happens that means the father
36:33
has sent with the holy spirit that
36:34
little baby spirit and he knits it
36:36
together
36:37
in the [ __ ] he attaches your
36:39
that little spirit man to
36:41
that little God of flesh we can't make a
36:44
spirit
36:44
okay we can't do that God has to and so
36:47
when he does that life begins so their
36:49
angel
36:50
or angels are waiting for them outside
36:52
this mother i see pregnant women all the
36:53
time
36:54
with angels around them and some of
36:56
those are that babies shot
36:57
the bagel's angel so when they pass the
37:00
angel takes them
37:01
they're aware of what happened to them
37:03
they know who the parents are
37:05
if they were aborted they forgive that
37:08
family member they forgive them
37:09
completely whoever performed the
37:11
abortion
37:12
and they even receive christ as their
37:14
savior because they love him
37:16
he heals any little hurts or wounds from
37:18
them
37:20
and they become very happy if the child
37:22
is miscarried
37:24
they were already loved words of love
37:26
were already spoken to them
37:27
but they also their own guardian angel
37:29
will carry them up to heaven
37:31
they live in these beautiful places
37:33
unless there's a family member already
37:35
there like a mother or a grandmother
37:37
then they can get the little baby and
37:39
raise it until you get there
37:41
but none of them are forgotten i've seen
37:43
millions
37:44
of little babies in heaven that are
37:47
cared for the angels rock them and
37:49
breathe the breath of God on them
37:51
they have places where they go and play
37:53
uh like the birds come in and take them
37:55
for rides you gotta remember they can't
37:57
get lost either
37:58
they have little play ponds that he
38:00
builds just for them to play and some of
38:01
them are
38:02
very tiny and in my book you'll see a
38:05
picture of an
38:06
angel holding six little babies in his
38:09
hand that's how old
38:12
and so um i'm working on my third book
38:14
don't ask me for it yeah
38:16
yeah well by the way speaking of that uh
38:18
Kat's books
38:19
are called revealing heaven and and go
38:22
to revealingheaven.com is where you can
38:24
get those books is that right
38:26
yeah so you got to get those i've read
38:28
them and my
38:29
my perspective of having changed
38:31
dramatically
38:33
and i said this is cruz before i was
38:36
um i went on a cruise that you were on
38:39
uh
38:40
but i and but that before that i'd gone
38:42
on a cruise and got these books on
38:44
heaven
38:44
and i read about them because my wife
38:46
had had a miscarriage
38:48
and we sat there and read this these
38:49
things that you just said and both of us
38:51
had tears streaming down our eyes
38:53
because no one had ever told this that
38:55
that they will be in heaven no one had
38:57
ever told us that we named
38:58
uh we didn't know if it was him or her
39:01
boy or a girl
39:02
and so we picked a name that would work
39:04
either way
39:06
and um so you had said that before and
39:08
named your baby
39:10
talk about naming your baby what like
39:12
you said before it's very important
39:14
because even though these little babies
39:15
are all in heaven the angels give them
39:17
nicknames so it's not like they're
39:19
it's not like they're nameless or
39:20
anything they're cared for their love
39:22
they get played with
39:23
the angels give them a nickname i know
39:25
somebody who miscarried a baby
39:27
and they've never even mentioned
39:28
anything to me about it but i was taken
39:30
to heaven and shown this little baby
39:32
girl
39:32
and the angels named her precious i
39:34
actually got to see her
39:36
she was precious and they still call her
39:38
precious to this day
39:40
that's her and they put her little name
39:42
over they live in this
39:43
beautiful nurseries don't look like a
39:45
building a sterile building
39:47
they look more like beautiful glorified
39:50
like a beehive shaped thing
39:52
and the creatures come in and visit and
39:53
play with them they have this niche
39:55
built into the wall one day i may have
39:58
something i can show you of that it's a
40:00
beautiful niche with the most gorgeous
40:02
fabrics that are alive and
40:04
these fabrics have the life of God in
40:06
them and i know they gave the baby
40:08
that's their own little place that has
40:09
their name over it
40:10
they mainly climb up and down the
40:12
blankets and they have livingston
40:14
coming out to sing to them they climb up
40:16
and down on the flowers they're babies
40:18
and and so they they play and enjoy
40:20
their life the reason why it's important
40:22
to name your baby if you say i'm
40:24
choosing to name my baby God
40:26
and if you want it to have a girl's name
40:28
if it's a girl pick a girl's name and a
40:29
boy's name or you can pick one that
40:31
could be either
40:32
the father sends for that little baby
40:35
and their angel the guardian angel that
40:37
was with him on the brings them into the
40:39
throne room
40:40
they sit on the father's lap or in his
40:42
hands
40:43
and he tells this baby your parents just
40:46
name you
40:47
wow this will forever be your name
40:50
and one day you get to see them when
40:52
they come home to heaven
40:54
is so excited they laugh they jump up
40:57
and down they play
40:58
they go listen they go back to the
41:00
nursery and that
41:01
that beautiful niche they got they
41:04
changed the name on that niche to the
41:06
name that you put
41:08
that's wonderful that's fantastic that's
41:10
amazing
41:11
well for the father loves to name things
41:14
so he is totally for you naming
41:16
your baby that's really good let's i
41:19
guess we have time for one more question
41:21
um who are the cloud of witnesses
41:25
are they all believers or as i see in
41:28
scripture does it seem to be those that
41:30
walked in faith or this
41:32
incredible faith who are the great crowd
41:33
of witnesses the cloud of witnesses are
41:36
all people who have moved to heaven
41:40
live there and the cloud of witnesses
41:41
could include
41:43
your family members especially if
41:45
something's going on
41:47
for instance this is a good example i
41:48
love examples heidi baker
41:50
had built a center here in florida
41:53
downstate
41:54
and i think it was for teaching people
41:56
to do revival
41:58
or something similar to that she had a
42:01
um
42:02
these classes that went for several
42:03
weeks and people could come then they
42:04
would
42:05
on the graduation night and i saw this
42:08
photograph myself
42:10
they had the cloud of witnesses appear
42:12
in the air in in this building
42:14
like a purple cloud you could literally
42:17
see
42:18
faces in the cloud and someone who was
42:21
there
42:21
sent this picture to me and when i when
42:24
i
42:25
winded and looked at it you literally
42:26
could see faces of people i didn't know
42:28
all these
42:28
people but you could see them in this
42:31
watching so the cloud everybody thinks
42:33
well that's up above in heaven
42:34
some watch from heaven sometimes he
42:36
brings that cloud down here
42:39
usually in the air of the building or
42:41
outside so they can went to something
42:43
powerful this was a powerful thing that
42:45
heidi was doing
42:47
and so they these people who were
42:48
probably a part of some of the members
42:50
that were there
42:51
some of their family members probably
42:52
wanted to come and see or jesus could be
42:54
in that cloud sometimes
42:56
and so it when it talks about i know in
42:58
hebrews 12 1 right the great cloud of
43:00
witnesses
43:02
and so you never know who's watching you
43:04
but if it's something you're doing it
43:06
could be something insignificant like
43:07
you have paid
43:08
for this whole one center say you're
43:10
paying for them to have turkey dinners
43:13
and you think well this is nice of no
43:15
heaven would come and watch that they
43:17
would watch out of your goodness and
43:19
your own giving
43:20
how these hungry people were fed
43:23
so nothing's insignificant to God but
43:25
they definitely sometimes come down and
43:27
they're watching usually
43:29
when someone's getting married and
43:30
things like that like my one daughter's
43:32
about to be married
43:33
i'm sure my father will probably be in a
43:35
cloud of witnesses and my grandmother
43:37
and her grandmother
43:39
i'm sure that they'll be there to watch
43:40
and witness that's why it's called
43:42
witness
43:42
guess what that means they can see
43:44
something they hear it and
43:47
so that's very significant that we do it
43:49
says get every weight out of your way
43:51
that you can run your race because this
43:52
clown
43:53
of witnesses from heaven are watching
43:55
our lives
43:57
that's so good Kat that's amazing that
44:00
you know every time i learn
44:01
new things i've heard a lot of these
44:03
before but every time there's a there's
44:05
half of them
44:06
i'd like man i didn't quite know it that
44:09
way so
44:09
be sure you all as you are watching this
44:12
either on the replay or live
44:13
type some questions we're accumulating
44:15
them they're backing up a little bit we
44:17
try to ask the questions that seem to
44:19
mean
44:19
the most for the most people unless i
44:22
slip one in there for my son-in-law
44:24
i wanted to add real quick i think if
44:26
you google heidi baker cloud of
44:28
witnesses you may able to
44:29
actually see that photograph oh that's
44:32
great that's amazing
44:33
well kat thank you so much unless
44:36
anything changes we'll see you a week
44:37
from today on wednesday
44:39
be sure and let your people know write
44:41
your questions down
44:42

44:44

so much to cover today
02:10
let's go ahead and bring kat on in here
02:13
there she is
02:14
how are you kat i'm great really excited
02:17
about everything of course
02:19
what God behind the you were just at
02:22
hank cunaman's church how was that
02:24
it was so powerful there were so many
02:27
angels present
02:28
is it was just absolutely crazy but
02:31
it was the air was filled with such
02:33
intense excitement
02:35
and i have to say for those of you who
02:37
know about the dream that hank had
02:39
of me um you can go look that up
02:42
i'm sure that it's on his website lord
02:44
of hosts is the name of his church
02:46
but he had this dream of me eating cake
02:49
and laughing when the announcement was
02:51
made that biden had won this was
02:53
this was not unreal thing that happened
02:55
this was a dream hank had
02:57
and there was more to it than that but
02:59
because i was eating cake
03:01
in that dream he actually had cake
03:03
brought up on the platform it was crazy
03:06
fun did everybody listen to cake and
03:08
celebrate
03:09
and so yeah it was a great time together
03:11
they got a lot of revelation i
03:13
thoroughly enjoyed
03:14
watching a couple operate in authority
03:18
through jesus christ commanding the host
03:21
not tolerating the darkness uh in any of
03:23
them or anyplace around them
03:25
it was a very powerful time wow that's
03:28
so good
03:28
well kat let's jump in then because you
03:30
talked about the elections and
03:32
the elections that are still in progress
03:35
or we should say
03:36
trump has won but he now is is in
03:39
the process of reclaiming what he's won
03:42
tell us where you're at with that i'll
03:44
just the floor is yours
03:46
well i will let you know right now that
03:48
as
03:49
was said that the whistleblowers would
03:52
start coming forward it started with one
03:54
phone call which happened a little a
03:55
while ago
03:56
but major whistleblowers who really know
03:59
what went on behind the scenes about all
04:01
that stuff the fraud and everything
04:03
um have just come forward just i think
04:05
this was just the other day
04:07
and it is shocking to find out what
04:10
actually was going on but these people
04:11
are valid people
04:13
uh i can't name the government agency
04:16
that we all know about that but it's
04:20
definitely
04:20
i don't want to give too much away
04:22
because they're still presenting this
04:23
stuff before the courts
04:24
they're getting subpoenas they're
04:26
getting all the stuff uh it's just
04:28
wild of things that have happened in the
04:30
different states with the elections but
04:31
you need to know this for sure
04:33
there is a recount going on and they
04:35
just ordered a recount for new york how
04:38
about that
04:39
really the whole state yeah they've done
04:41
it in pennsylvania i think they did it
04:43
in ohio
04:44
and they're only counting valid votes
04:47
vote about
04:48
valid ballots they're not counting the
04:50
ones that were created or made up or
04:54
brought in undercover i think they even
04:56
found 300 and some thousand
04:58
trump ballots that were hidden i mean
05:01
they just found these this just happened
05:03
so trust me there are things going on
05:05
you don't know about just stick in there
05:07
and celebrate with God in the victory
05:09
that we're about to all experience
05:11
so yes things are going on behind the
05:13
scenes you don't know about and i'm sure
05:15
certainly absolutely the news media will
05:17
not tell you about this but yes
05:19
things are in process and is there
05:22
something to the fact that
05:24
that trump is purposely
05:27
stringing this out so that more things
05:30
come to light is
05:31
i think it was johnny endless said
05:33
something about that is that your sense
05:35
as well
05:36
oh absolutely he is and this is the
05:38
thing that happens when things like this
05:40
begin to happen
05:41
and things begin to get exposed all
05:43
those who were apart
05:45
who don't want to take a great fall
05:46
they're all going to start to come
05:48
forward that's why the landslide will be
05:50
great of the exposure because of those
05:52
who
05:53
did it are going to be telling on the
05:55
others
05:56
which is what was all talked about on
05:58
november the 4th
05:59
and so yes we did know this stuff was
06:01
going on and yes
06:03
trump is totally still receiving people
06:06
coming in and talking about things so
06:07
yes
06:08
he's not concerned he absolutely
06:11
will not concede when he knows he has
06:14
already
06:14
won so don't give in stay strong
06:18
and like God said eat cake and celebrate
06:21
that's so good
06:22
and for those of you watching especially
06:23
if you're just not new today
06:25
or recently we had a whole group of
06:27
prophets who we've had on
06:29
and to the last one they have stood firm
06:31
everyone has said i know what i've seen
06:33
i know what God showed me
06:35
trump is going to serve about the next
06:37
four years not 20 24
06:39
the next four years so we're all in on
06:43
it aren't we
06:44
yes and actually you know that makes it
06:46
so dangerous against hell when the
06:49
prophets begin to come together in
06:51
agreement
06:51
that's a whole new thing it is than any
06:55
or others many others i know the body is
06:57
coming into agreement also which is
06:58
powerful but when the prophets who hear
07:00
God
07:01
know God begin to come into agreement
07:03
the enemy begins to tremble
07:07
that's so good so good is that you know
07:09
last night i was praying and
07:10
i God was highlighting some specific
07:13
almost celebrity type people and i had
07:16
i was praying in two different ways
07:18
first i was praying exposing
07:21
he gave me the name of this particular
07:22
man expose
07:24
him i'm not talking about biden but i'm
07:26
just talking about another person
07:28
and then i i just said revealed his and
07:31
the term nakedness came
07:32
he revealed his nakedness to him and
07:35
then
07:36
after i was saying show no
07:39
mercy then i began to feel like i needed
07:42
to pray for mercy so i said
07:44
this i'm contradicting myself but in
07:46
your
07:47
wrath remember mercy that's the
07:49
scripture
07:50
yeah wrath remember mercy so i then
07:53
began to pray for
07:54
mercy for some of those being caught up
07:56
in this yes
07:57
and God actually asked me to pray uh
08:01
probably more decidedly for all those
08:04
who've been caught up
08:05
who were just everyday people that were
08:07
caught up into deception and therefore
08:09
voted for no life because that's what
08:12
your vote was for life or not for life
08:15
and he said please pray for those who
08:17
have been
08:18
eating up the deception and be involved
08:20
in the deception
08:21
that they don't want to take their own
08:23
life because you have to understand
08:25
deception get you so
08:26
uh brings confusion it brings a lot of
08:29
fear
08:30
and when they have been told by the
08:32
other side if this doesn't happen if we
08:34
don't win your life is over there is no
08:36
life there'll be no existence
08:38
which we know is all wise because we
08:40
know that what our president stands for
08:43
is prosperity
08:44
health wholeness restoration celebration
08:48
and that's what he wants a better
08:50
america so the other side doesn't want
08:52
that they want to control everybody
08:54
but there will be many who go through
08:55
that so please do remember in your
08:57
prayers
08:57
pray for those who were caught up into
09:00
deception
09:02
only going by what somebody said to them
09:04
or what the fake news if they
09:05
swallowed that and they followed after
09:08
that they need a lot of prayer so that
09:10
their eyes be opened
09:11
understand so that they can be free when
09:14
this all comes out and
09:15
trump sits as a president still that
09:18
they can actually celebrate that moment
09:20
yeah that'd be good i i just think
09:22
there's something you know that
09:24
i think it was when God spoke to solomon
09:28
it was in a dream basically but said
09:30
because you have not asked for the death
09:32
of your enemies
09:33
i'm going to do all these things for you
09:35
and prosper you
09:36
but he because solomon you know he was
09:39
the king he could have asked for his
09:40
God to just wipe out and God does not
09:43
like it when we seek the death or we
09:45
speak
09:47
a punishment that is so severe that even
09:50
he would not do that so
09:52
right so i think there's there's a point
09:53
to remember to pray for mercy and at the
09:55
same time exposure
09:57
so it's got to all happen at the same
09:58
time yeah we can ask for God to curse
10:01
anybody the bible even says he's not
10:03
ever going to do that
10:05
and that's part of what is so wrong with
10:07
some of the things that people make
10:08
statements about
10:09
we want justice and that's the proper
10:11
word God said use the word justice
10:13
because he is bringing justice it's
10:15
going to happen
10:16
and we celebrate over justice for us and
10:19
those who
10:21
have done things unknowingly without
10:23
full understanding of it we do ask for
10:25
mercy for those but there are some
10:28
that God if they want death and want to
10:30
bring death he said
10:31
don't ask for mercy for those people and
10:34
so we have to put it in his hands
10:36
of course we don't like ourselves we're
10:37
not going to curse anybody we're going
10:39
to stay strong with what God wants for
10:41
us for those who run after life and they
10:42
want a family they have a family and
10:44
they want to have a real life here
10:47
in our country then we need to vote for
10:49
those who promote that and that's their
10:51
platform
10:52
and that would be true that's so good
10:55
well listen listen
10:56
that's we that we got the update on the
10:58
elections are you ready for some
10:59
questions about heaven
11:00
oh sure yes so let me do this let me
11:03
tell people
11:04
now there's a lot of people joining us
11:05
every single episode we have
11:07
probably tens of thousands of new people
11:10
and so we keep getting the same
11:11
questions over and over
11:12
and people say please ask Kat please ask
11:15
me this is not realizing
11:16
she's answered before so i'm going to
11:18
ask this this one time
11:20
four questions that are repeat questions
11:22
we're going to catalog it
11:24
so please bear with us for these four
11:26
questions then i'll ask for new
11:27
questions that we haven't asked
11:28
and that way when people sign up
11:30
tomorrow and say please ask kat
11:32
we can say go to this link and there
11:35
will be your answer so
11:37
that's good so the first question that
11:39
everybody asked the most problem is what
11:41
about
11:42
marriage i was married here what about
11:43
my wife especially if they've only had
11:45
one spouse
11:46
um and and one wrote because he
11:50
thought you said last week that we
11:51
wouldn't care and i think you meant
11:53
we wouldn't care whether we were married
11:55
or not he he thought he said well i want
11:58
to at least know that i'll be really
12:00
good friends or
12:02
with my wife can we be good friends
12:05
in heaven because we were married i'll
12:07
make it short i'll make it short
12:09
i'm going to use scripture the bible
12:12
says that you will not be mirrored you
12:14
will be as the angels
12:15
are in heaven they aren't married that
12:18
doesn't mean you won't have a friendship
12:20
a really close friendship with the one
12:22
the one that you were married to you
12:23
always have a special
12:25
um affection i have to say when i met
12:28
when i said you won't miss it i meant
12:30
the
12:30
physical desire and you know in the
12:34
course of marriage there are physical
12:35
desires that are normal to us but in
12:37
heaven
12:38
in your spiritual body those desires
12:40
aren't there the care
12:42
uh the great affection you have oh yes
12:44
you'll do things all over heaven
12:45
together and this is the best part
12:47
they'll be like your very best friend
12:49
that's not replacing jesus everyone in
12:52
heaven is just
12:53
wild about jesus christ because he's the
12:55
bridegroom remember
12:57
we're all the bride that means we're the
12:58
closest thing that will be
13:00
to him will be the bride and christ
13:03
and that's what marriage represents
13:05
actually is uh
13:06
the two becoming one so in heaven we'll
13:09
all be one with christ in a spiritual
13:11
way but that love is
13:13
higher than a physical love but yeah
13:16
your family will live right near you you
13:18
remember
13:18
that your sons your daughters your
13:20
cousins your uncle
13:22
your parents you remember that and so
13:24
yes you do fun things together a lot you
13:27
go on tours and do things all over you
13:28
visit each other or just stay with each
13:30
other even that's okay to do that
13:32
and so uh don't be concerned about
13:35
losing
13:36
anything okay so
13:40
different but beautiful so you will
13:42
never forget
13:44
oh that's so good thank you ken that's
13:45
awesome okay you got that one and we got
13:48
it on tape now
13:49
okay so uh the next one is also one of
13:52
the most common questions is
13:53
what about my pets do my pets go to
13:55
heaven
13:58
yes and again i have to mention the
14:00
scripture it just helps people to
14:01
understand that
14:03
in the bible when God told noah to put
14:06
all the animals on the ark he said put
14:08
every one of them on the ark that has a
14:09
spirit of life
14:10
in them that is your spirit man okay
14:13
when God breathed the spirit of life
14:15
into adam
14:16
he actually was breathing his little
14:18
spirit man from himself from God
14:20
into adam so there are your pets have
14:23
they have a spirit person a spirit
14:26
animal is
14:26
same thing same path they have a
14:28
spiritual body and they have a soul
14:30
your soul is what you make decisions
14:32
with what i like what i don't like what
14:34
emotion i'm going to display
14:35
where you know yourself if you've got
14:37
pets they have a lot of emotions so yes
14:39
when they die your own guardian angel
14:42
takes their spiritual your spiritual
14:44
your pet spiritual body
14:45
carries it up to heaven and puts it in
14:47
your mansion so yes they're going to be
14:49
there
14:49
except they'll talk
14:52
i remember you saying that they actually
14:54
can talk when we get to heaven we'll be
14:56
conversing with our pets yes absolutely
14:59
and they talked in the garden of eden
15:00
or eve would have been over the snake
15:03
talking so
15:04
that's restored to them so yes look
15:06
forward to that be nice to your pet
15:10
that's good okay this i'm going to blend
15:12
these two together and i think
15:14
people are asking about is there a
15:16
covent cure coming
15:17
people are kind and freaking out this is
15:19
probably the most common question
15:21
please ask Kat about the vaccine and
15:24
some of them are afraid to take the mark
15:25
of the beast they don't want the vaccine
15:27
other people are afraid to get sick
15:29
other people are afraid that the
15:30
government is getting control
15:31
so what do you have to say about covet
15:34
and taking the vaccine
15:35
or not taking the vaccine and those kind
15:38
of things
15:39
okay again i'm gonna just repeat what
15:41
God said
15:42
it is a virus a virus comes and goes
15:45
i know it affects others more highly
15:47
than other you know some people
15:49
um i know young people almost never are
15:52
affected by it and there's a whole age
15:53
group
15:54
that's almost never affected by it
15:55
actually 90 of america has not
15:58
been affected by that you need to
15:59
understand that they make it sound like
16:01
that everyone everywhere has had it
16:04
and some doctors are writing down
16:05
anything it doesn't matter what it is
16:07
you come in with they'll they're writing
16:08
it down that it's a virus therefore that
16:10
gets recorded as being part of it
16:12
but i would say this about the about the
16:15
vaccine
16:16
i myself am not choosing to take that
16:18
number one i don't need it
16:20
i don't feel like i anita at all and i
16:22
think that as a personal choice i think
16:24
they should always leave it a personal
16:25
choice at this point
16:27
according to trump it is a personal
16:29
choice now if your governor wants to
16:31
push it especially the ones controlling
16:33
things
16:34
i can't promise what they're going to
16:36
say
16:37
they've been doing a test mark a pretty
16:39
thorough test mark on different age
16:41
groups and so far no one has died
16:43
from taking it so i also want to
16:45
encourage you with that they've had
16:47
some of the best of the best people
16:49
designing and developing this
16:51
not from china i have to add that
16:53
there's no way that we're getting any of
16:55
that or any part of it is not coming
16:57
from china which actually developed the
16:59
whole thing
17:00
on purpose you need to know it was done
17:01
on purpose so anyway i would say that's
17:04
your own personal choice what gives you
17:06
peace is what you pick
17:08
but i haven't heard of anyone so far
17:10
have taken any of that
17:12
that has died from taking it so i can't
17:15
say the
17:15
death threat to anyone who takes it it
17:18
absolutely is not the mark of the beast
17:21
and you know you you probably weren't
17:23
around back in the day
17:24
when the flu was everywhere like crazy
17:27
um let's see what else there was all
17:29
kinds of these i'm talking about
17:31
diseases now i'm not talking about a
17:32
virus
17:33
but back in the day when people had all
17:35
different types of diseases
17:37
and a cure came for that disease
17:40
and even her kids now most of them you
17:42
can take a vaccination when your child
17:44
is a certain age
17:45
that stops them from having like polio
17:48
and um
17:49
i can't remember typhoid fever
17:52
chickenpox uh things that well
17:54
were a lot more serious those things
17:56
were so much more serious
17:58
than the virus is i'm not telling you to
18:00
ignore it and i think if people use
18:02
normal everyday
18:04
uh you know cautions precautions and
18:06
stuff
18:07
i think that we're all going to be okay
18:09
i really believe
18:10
God tells me this is what he says it's
18:12
gonna pass and i think that probably
18:15
means to God
18:16
it will no longer exist on the earth the
18:18
enemy
18:19
satan wants to use that virus but
18:21
fearing people
18:22
to keep them away from everybody else
18:24
and i know this
18:25
also that in the past before this thing
18:28
came everybody had friends they had
18:30
family get togethers they love one
18:32
another your love for each other is so
18:34
important so however you can do that
18:37
give a hug to your family i'm totally
18:40
against
18:40
people wearing masks in their own home
18:43
unless they had maybe a
18:44
a very aged senior that wouldn't be my
18:46
mom by the way she was here
18:48
not listening that's not my mom and
18:50
she's almost 90. she's extremely healthy
18:53
she does go out with us she does things
18:54
she wears her mask and she's very happy
18:56
she gets to go out
18:58
but as far as the vaccine goes it's not
19:00
the mark of the beast there is
19:01
no mark of the beast i know there's
19:03
people writing books again probably
19:05
writing one about this
19:06
about the virus being the mark of the
19:08
beast the mark of the beast is not for
19:10
now
19:12
uh not at all it's probably several
19:13
hundred years maybe into the future i
19:16
can't
19:16
really tell those exact dates i know God
19:18
showed me a hundred years into the
19:20
future
19:20
and it was not had even not had the mark
19:23
of the beast antichrist one on the earth
19:24
at that time
19:26
you focus on running your race right now
19:28
for what God has
19:29
now and you make the choice do i want to
19:32
take this do i not want to take this
19:34
i'm sure many people will take it like i
19:36
said all the tests i've had so far
19:38
they've not had any real negative
19:40
reactions to it at all
19:41
that's good that's good well good okay
19:44
let me ask you this
19:45
this is a combination of a of a repeat
19:47
question in a
19:49
in a nuanced uh new question about it
19:52
regarding our mansions in heaven
19:54
you said it puts our you know our pets
19:57
are brought up to our mansion
19:58
so are are our mansions already
20:01
existing and are they pre-made for us
20:04
now are they being made and the second
20:07
question i'll let you ask
20:08
at the same time is people are several
20:11
have asked me what about
20:12
when there's the new heaven and new
20:14
earth does our mansion in heaven get
20:16
moved to the new earth or what okay
20:20
that's a great question i love new ones
20:23
let's go back to the
20:24
let's go back to the first one your
20:26
mansion is being worked on
20:28
from the time you are born they start
20:32
working on that thing it is so
20:34
detailed and it's designed around your
20:37
gift not your spiritual gift your
20:39
natural gift
20:40
whether you're an athlete whether you
20:42
like the arts whether you like to do
20:44
uh building or design or i could name
20:47
any kind of thing out there that people
20:48
absolutely
20:49
love and they're gifted in that thing
20:51
your mansion is being designed around
20:53
that powerful gift so people can come
20:55
to your place to enjoy either
20:58
maybe you sing maybe concerts or
21:02
maybe doing design or even things like
21:05
like um antique car shows or rodeos or
21:08
um theme parks you know all that stuff's
21:12
in heaven because people have
21:13
gifts that's their gift and so you don't
21:16
go to a separate place like i don't have
21:17
a job to go to in heaven to use my gift
21:19
it's all designed in part
21:21
for instance i knew a a dance um
21:25
a dance instructor who actually was one
21:27
of our daughters first dance dr
21:29
she was had one of the first christian
21:30
companies the father's company
21:33
in our city and when she passed i was
21:35
taken up and shown her mansion as part
21:37
of her mansion she has studios where she
21:40
teaches dance
21:41
she's really she has a big exhibition
21:44
place where people can come and see
21:45
dance uh beautiful dance nothing
21:48
defiling
21:49
when you i know in your natural mind
21:51
sometimes you think that what about this
21:52
what about that
21:53
there's nothing defiling in anything
21:55
that happens in heaven so her
21:56
whole property which was huge i mean
21:59
this place i think probably sat like 10
22:01
000 people
22:02
and yet it was part of her own mansion
22:04
she had other parts of it that she lived
22:06
in and due to the things then
22:07
i've seen the same thing for people who
22:09
who raised horses for people to go on
22:12
rides up in the mountain spices and
22:13
things
22:14
they had a ranch with a thousand horses
22:16
and they had all these barns to keep
22:18
them in
22:18
and beautiful things for people to enjoy
22:20
to go there and all that was part of
22:22
what God
22:23
put in them the reason why he didn't
22:25
take your gift away is because he
22:27
designed it for you to use in heaven to
22:28
make everybody
22:29
happy excited and bless them
22:32
that's okay and then what about what i
22:35
need
22:35
is when your mansion's done you are
22:38
going home
22:39
there you go he times it exactly so that
22:42
when you pass
22:43
now if it's a child for whatever reason
22:44
doesn't doesn't make it through
22:46
then they are taken to if their
22:47
grandparents are there or great
22:49
grandparents are there they go stay with
22:50
them
22:51
so they're not left alone somewhere he
22:52
made me add that so but your man just
22:55
when it's done you go somewhere you know
22:57
it's interesting because someone asked a
22:59
question that was on my list for today
23:01
if i could get to it but now that you've
23:03
just opened that door so the question is
23:06
you said i've heard you say before when
23:07
your mansion's done you're going home
23:10
yeah and the question came to me how do
23:12
i know if
23:13
this death in my family was
23:16
the enemy took this life or it was my
23:20
time to go
23:21
and that's kind of related because you
23:22
said when when the mansion is done
23:26
you go so how does that all work
23:29
most of the time that is somebody who
23:30
would already have been an
23:32
adult like we all know the story of
23:34
marissa it's written
23:36
in my one of my books revealing heaven
23:37
she was 13 when she
23:39
passed away but her whole purpose
23:42
to be on the earth was to love young
23:44
people for God but when she was caught
23:46
up to heaven
23:47
she was staying at her mother's mansion
23:50
that was being designed and she lived
23:51
with her great grandfather so she would
23:53
go back and forth those places
23:55
she lived actually with a great
23:57
grandfather but would visit her mom's
23:59
mansion she would actually put things in
24:00
her mom's mansion her mom is still here
24:02
so God knew the day she had to come home
24:05
because
24:06
she was chosen to be the youth leader
24:08
over all the youth in heaven and it was
24:10
their time to begin to
24:12
practice their part in the mirror supper
24:14
of the lamb which is still years away
24:17
but they wanted to start so she was
24:18
caught up at age 13 to be a youth leader
24:21
in heaven
24:21
so there's many different dynamics to
24:24
why do they go
24:25
when do they go if you know they're in
24:27
heaven you need to celebrate i know that
24:29
you miss them
24:30
really especially if they're young but
24:32
they're living in the life
24:34
and the joy and the celebration of God
24:36
they're with
24:37
other friends and family members they're
24:39
not going to be alone
24:40
but normally if you reach the path of
24:43
what they would call like
24:44
18 21 and you pass from here you're
24:48
going to your own mansion in heaven
24:50
and again you won't ever be alone there
24:52
you have all kinds of friends and family
24:54
coming by
24:55
so he doesn't design a child's mansion
24:58
to be finished
24:59
uh it's still being worked on it's like
25:01
he didn't all of a sudden finish it and
25:02
then stick a three-year-old in there all
25:04
right
25:05
they have uh friends that stay with so
25:07
their mansion will continue to be
25:09
completed
25:10
until they are at a point where they can
25:13
eventually probably go there it may even
25:15
be after you get to heaven that they
25:17
actually get their own mansions
25:22
if you're oh the new earth okay you're
25:24
not going to care about that
25:26
he said you knew heaven a new heavens
25:28
and a new earth
25:30
there's a clue what's here now
25:34
oh God moved to heaven you leave it all
25:36
behind anyway right
25:38
when you come and get your body back you
25:41
won't even then be
25:42
living on this earth this earth will one
25:45
day be replaced people struggle with
25:47
that
25:48
God the maker of everything will make a
25:50
new earth it will be our home
25:52
heaven is his home this is our home but
25:54
one day he'll make one big enough to
25:56
hold
25:56
all of us and it will be our home and
25:58
you will love whatever's there whether
26:00
he
26:01
moves your own mansion there or makes
26:03
you brand new ones you're going to
26:05
celebrate that's good that's good now
26:08
i've got
26:08
several questions that people want to
26:10
know if they get to be buddies
26:12
friends with their guardian angel
26:15
and once they're going to have another
26:17
guardian angel maybe he has
26:19
30 different assignments or 50
26:22
you know so they want to know if they
26:24
can be special friends with their own
26:26
guardian angel or how that works
26:28
if you know you actually have a you're
26:31
you have a main guardian angel you
26:33
always have one that's the closest to
26:35
you
26:35
that covers you watches over you
26:37
depending on your assignment that God
26:39
has given you on the earth you may have
26:41
five you may have ten
26:43
guardian angels but there's always going
26:44
to be one that is sent
26:46
at the time of your conception that
26:48
angel is waiting outside the mother
26:50
for that baby and to be presented into
26:53
the earth
26:54
and from that time the angels with you
26:56
your entire life
26:58
and yes you do get to know that angel in
27:00
heaven you don't have to worry about
27:01
worshiping angels in heaven you're in
27:02
heaven
27:03
okay nobody's gonna worship angels in
27:05
heaven you will get to know the one who
27:06
watched over you and you actually get to
27:08
go see
27:09
this little individual movies of your
27:11
own life lived over
27:13
minus all sin if you've been forgiven
27:15
but all the funny
27:16
silly things you did and also all the
27:18
times
27:19
that angel rescued your life you will
27:22
find that out when you get to heaven so
27:24
there's many exciting things
27:26
besides living in a mansion you will get
27:28
to know your guardian angel when you get
27:30
to heaven
27:31
now lady wrote and said you know she
27:34
understands that when you have a
27:36
miscarriage
27:37
that that baby goes to be with the the
27:39
lord
27:40
and the abortions as well but she said
27:43
i've had five miscarriages
27:44
did God keep putting that same spirit
27:47
back in
27:48
or and therefore there was only one or
27:50
do i have five children in heaven
27:52
waiting for me that is a very
27:55
wise question that very few people
27:58
actually ever asked
28:00
and um sometimes
28:04
depending on who that is that God's
28:06
sending from himself
28:08
if he needs that child on this earth at
28:12
a specific time some people are going to
28:13
freak out over this just get over it
28:16
God God and he's done in the past if
28:19
there's somebody i know somebody that
28:20
that happened to
28:21
that he sent their child to be here
28:24
during a specific time this was just a
28:25
few years ago
28:27
and uh and in the baby miscarriage and
28:29
God
28:30
sent this is what he does he will take
28:32
that little spirit
28:33
because it's usually really early on
28:35
he'll take that little spirit
28:36
and uh and put him back inside himself
28:39
and then
28:40
when the parents try again sometimes he
28:42
will put it back a second time because
28:44
he just seen
28:45
them here and uh but most of the time
28:48
you've
28:49
really miscarried if you're miscarried
28:50
five times normally you have five
28:52
children in heaven
28:54
and i guess we'll all find that out when
28:55
you get sure that's good now i
28:58
you know i like the new questions
28:59
because you know
29:01
the the old ones we keep repeating it
29:03
but that those were great questions
29:05
let me ask you another one here um
29:08
someone wanted to know
29:09
and wrote today or yesterday he said i
29:11
want to know
29:14
when Kat goes to be with the lord he
29:16
wants to know about that different
29:17
father son and holy spirit are they
29:19
different personalities different voices
29:20
different
29:21
looks and is God chatting
29:25
does he like to sit and chat with her or
29:27
is he all business
29:28
is he strictly business and the lord
29:31
jesus is chad
29:32
tell me how tell me what you can tell me
29:35
tell us what you can tell us
29:36
personalities because they do have
29:38
different personalities now they're
29:39
images that's a different thing
29:41
they absolutely have different
29:43
personalities and i want to start with
29:44
the holy spirit
29:45
the holy spirit loves drama he loves the
29:48
arts
29:49
he's extremely creative he's a poet
29:51
sometimes if you prophesy or something
29:53
it'll be in poetry form
29:55
and holy spirit has that that
29:57
personality he's exciting he's
29:59
adventurous
30:00
and and uh and he's uh he knows
30:03
everything of course because he also is
30:05
God he's the third member of the trinity
30:07
so that's the side of him i see a lot i
30:09
probably hear him more than the others
30:11
just because holy spirit
30:12
really inside of me when you ask him to
30:14
indwell you he really is in there okay
30:17
and you you get a lot more understanding
30:20
and revelation when the holy spirit is
30:22
in you then when he walks alongside of
30:23
you when you're born again he comes here
30:25
and walks alongside of you that's what
30:27
the bible says but when you ask him to
30:28
indwell you he moves in
30:30
you become the temple the holy spirit
30:32
that means that's his abode
30:33
now holy spirit has unlimited layers
30:36
this is his image
30:37
it look they all look like him they're
30:39
all him but when you ask
30:41
him uh will you please indwell me he
30:43
takes a layer of himself and sends it to
30:45
live in you
30:46
he still has himself it's just that's
30:48
why he knows everything everywhere
30:50
the father is a father he's the most
30:54
kind
30:55
loving member of the trinity even jesus
30:58
himself said there's
30:59
none really good or the greatest of all
31:02
is the father he even talks about that
31:04
himself
31:05
and so i would say kindness just comes
31:07
from
31:08
the waves of love and yes he wants to
31:11
talk to us but he
31:12
talks to us like children and when you
31:15
were a tiny little thing in him he
31:16
actually even then hold you in his hand
31:18
he'd sing over you he'd talk to you he'd
31:20
say funny stories
31:22
um that's the father's personality
31:24
although
31:26
he is still all God and he is holy but
31:29
jesus christ
31:30
and people that he is of course kind and
31:32
loving but look at his personality when
31:34
he's on the earth
31:35
he's in his glorified body he is the
31:37
ruler of the three of them
31:39
he is the king uh so here's a kind and
31:43
loving father who carried all of us who
31:45
knows the most about
31:46
us then here's his son right here who
31:48
came who
31:49
who dealt with death itself who wiped up
31:52
hell
31:52
and stripped things off of satan he's
31:55
the lord of hosts over all the army in
31:57
heaven i'm talking about jesus christ
31:58
the ruler the
32:00
king but flames of fire in his eyes and
32:02
people still
32:03
love to run after him in heaven to be
32:05
with him but he is definitely the ruler
32:07
so they have different personalities and
32:09
usually whatever it is they want to talk
32:11
to me about like if it's about dominion
32:12
or authority that's going to be jesus
32:14
christ
32:15
if it's about exciting fun things to
32:17
event and things that the great things
32:18
like celebrations or moves of God on the
32:20
earth that's holy spirit
32:22
really the father really catches me up
32:25
more than the others to show me himself
32:27
his heart
32:28
his ways his thoughts his purposes for
32:32
each and every one of us how much he
32:33
loves us and has great plans for us and
32:36
so much so he made a way for us to come
32:39
back to him in other words when we're on
32:41
this earth we're born everyone's born in
32:43
this fallen earth and of course there's
32:45
sin involved in our lives or
32:47
or darkness involved in somehow not
32:49
saying you absolutely went after that
32:51
but just living in this atmosphere and
32:53
with people who are not godly
32:55
you're affected by it so when you
32:56
receive christ
32:58
his sacrifice on the cross it wipes all
33:02
of that
33:02
out of you and you're as righteous
33:06
you have a way back to the father
33:07
actually the viewer of the father
33:09
and so that they each have a purpose of
33:12
each separate purpose but they can still
33:14
step inside of each other and be
33:16
one and so the father
33:19
the kind loving but he can't tolerate
33:22
hate or evil that's why he kicked satan
33:25
out and the one-third of the angels who
33:27
fell he didn't want darkness in heaven
33:29
he didn't want anything about it there
33:31
so that's why they were all kicked out
33:33
but but he loves everyone in this earth
33:36
even the left even all those doing
33:37
things that they shouldn't be doing he
33:39
does love them
33:40
but that's why he sent his son they need
33:42
to know his son and they would change
33:45
that's so good well now you had you talk
33:48
about that our loved ones
33:50
can sometimes look through portals in
33:51
heaven i can't remember if you called it
33:54
something other than a portal but where
33:56
they're able to look down and see things
33:57
like weddings
33:59
and births and special things but my so
34:01
my question is
34:03
and you can add anything to that the
34:04
question someone wrote
34:06
to me is they said since that can happen
34:10
and they can see the good can i i guess
34:13
this woman wanna know can i say to my
34:15
loved one my mom
34:16
for instance i love you so much mom i'll
34:19
see you soon
34:20
or is that or is that or is there no you
34:23
can't do it
34:24
acceptable to do that um people do it
34:27
anyway
34:28
um people if you're buried traditionally
34:30
like in a cemetery or something i
34:32
can't tell you the number of people that
34:34
i've talked to that are gone
34:36
and some people like to make benches
34:38
next to where they were buried knowing
34:39
their loved ones would want to come
34:41
it's not you're not worshiping them okay
34:44
it's not like the day of them where
34:45
everybody's you're not bringing food for
34:46
them to eat you're not
34:48
you're not piling treasures up you
34:51
missed that person and
34:52
loved them you had a a soul tie with
34:55
that person
34:56
it is absolutely i even tell people look
34:58
up and say hello
35:00
and on your birthday on your birthday
35:03
they will be
35:04
and they call these places the portal
35:06
and in my book book one you can see one
35:08
of those
35:09
probably online uh at one of my websites
35:13
revealingheaven.com
35:14
you probably can see uh one of those
35:17
places that i was actually in
35:19
where people come in this beautiful
35:20
beautiful building and they walk up a
35:22
stairway and look over that balcony they
35:24
can see you right where you are
35:26
like like as close as your ceiling like
35:29
there's a portal right now open over me
35:31
and uh
35:32
sometimes i'll every now and then i'll
35:34
see my dad up there or someone else i
35:35
know up there
35:36
uh i don't worship them either but i
35:38
will just usually
35:39
throughout the day or when my dad had a
35:42
special day he said
35:43
dad i just want you know i love you and
35:46
carrying on the things that you started
35:48
i have i love people for you i help you
35:49
i know
35:50
that he knows that already but it's
35:52
certainly okay to say hello i miss you i
35:54
love you i'll see you again
35:56
maybe you know your family members
35:57
riding the roller coaster hey i know
35:59
you're writing them
36:00
up there because those people people
36:01
love those things
36:03
and the thing about having an
36:04
understanding about heaven it
36:06
helps you on the earth to realize it is
36:09
a literal place and a place that one day
36:12
you will be together with your family
36:14
and these memories here of struggles
36:17
or hard times you went through they will
36:20
become like
36:20
dust okay and because you'll be living
36:23
in eternity at that time your family
36:25
members don't want you to remember
36:27
let's say they were really sick or in
36:29
bad shape they don't want you to think
36:30
about that they want to remember the
36:32
times the happy times and by the way
36:34
they're whole
36:35
right now yeah i mean i i have said
36:41
because i didn't know if i could address
36:43
my father who went to be with the lord
36:45
30 years ago but he had been an abusive
36:47
father and then he found the lord
36:50
but i have said to the lord would you be
36:52
willing to go and tell my father i
36:53
forgive him
36:55
but i hear i'm hearing you say i
36:57
probably can say dad i forgive you
36:59
yes absolutely you can say that you can
37:02
you can say dad i forgive you i'm so
37:04
excited you're there with jesus
37:06
i'm so blessed that we'll be in eternity
37:08
together
37:09
wow because let me tell your family
37:11
members in heaven are saying hey jesus
37:13
can you give a gift
37:14
see they're doing that i will even say i
37:17
mean i have a couple of my siblings that
37:19
passed on to heaven i'll say jesus
37:20
why don't you go give my brother a gift
37:23
tell him i love him and give him a gift
37:26
and jesus will do that but see they do
37:28
that in heaven and they'll go to heaven
37:30
to a jesus they'll go jesus i know that
37:32
my my sister needs a new car who's this
37:34
falling apart
37:35
would you please make sure she gets a
37:37
really good car
37:39
and then you end up getting one you're
37:41
not even sure why it happened
37:42
probably your family member asking jesus
37:45
wow that's really good
37:46
well that's that brings me into our last
37:48
question we're looking at the time here
37:50
but when you get to heaven and this one
37:52
has been asked several times
37:54
people have calculated they're probably
37:56
going to be billions of us with the lord
37:59
we're all eternity and how are we how am
38:01
i going to get to know jesus personally
38:03
when there's billions of us
38:05
uh talk about your ability to make
38:07
personal connection with the
38:09
with the lord whenever you want to or
38:11
only
38:12
from time to time or however that works
38:15
i'm so
38:15
i'm pretty sure it's whenever you want
38:18
to one of the things you get with your
38:20
mansion
38:21
because if you didn't know this already
38:23
jesus
38:24
adores flowers he thinks besides
38:27
us it's one of the greatest things he
38:28
made he loves flowers
38:30
he was called the lily of the valley the
38:32
rose of sharon he was uh
38:34
was the garden of eden that he created
38:36
to put adam in him
38:37
it was a garden tomb he was buried in he
38:41
loves flowers and so um
38:43
uh absolutely people would actually in
38:46
heaven they bring flowers up and even on
38:48
on the throne room step so he still has
38:49
things that he loves and that
38:51
that are favorites to him so i'm trying
38:53
to remember what the question was
38:55
well basically when he can if he can be
38:57
everywhere at once
38:59
here and he can be everywhere once all
39:02
the more
39:02
in heaven and anyway the secret garden
39:06
you get next to your mountain ninja he
39:08
gives
39:08
he personally gives you a key to that
39:10
garden it's yours
39:11
anytime you want to be with him one of
39:13
the ways you can is you go in the garden
39:15
and he comes
39:16
really every time he comes and you're
39:18
right he can be
39:19
because even now he can be everywhere
39:23
all the same time
39:24
uh he can do the same thing in heaven no
39:27
one's left out but there are times when
39:28
he is
39:29
like in a group of people or walking
39:31
through heaven especially people who
39:33
just newly arrived he will go right
39:35
through the people who are
39:36
part like the red sea and they already
39:38
know what's going to happen you go right
39:39
up to that brand new person
39:41
and personally welcome them to heaven
39:44
and then he steps inside them and turns
39:47
around
39:47
and looks through your eyes and you feel
39:50
so different about everyone who is in
39:53
heaven
39:54
you love everybody in heaven because
39:55
you're looking through and learning his
39:57
own eyes
39:58
and then he steps out you're never the
40:00
same so yes
40:01
you can develop a greater closer
40:03
relationship with jesus christ
40:05
when you get to heaven with the father
40:07
the same thing there's ways you can be
40:09
alone with him even holy spirit
40:11
and so he's they're not going to
40:13
separate they're not so high
40:14
up that you can't be with them their
40:17
whole desire
40:18
is to be with you that's so so so good
40:21
okay man we could talk for a couple more
40:23
hours like we did that time on the
40:24
cruise
40:25
we went for four hours i think with all
40:27
these questions but
40:28
thank you so much i think we're
40:30
scheduled definitely next wednesday but
40:33
if we get we get you
40:34
before then we may try for that too but
40:36
whatever works out but
40:38
i encourage you all to write new
40:40
questions that have not been asked and
40:42
put them there we'll try and
40:43
find ones that the most people are
40:45
asking and then we'll ask Kat
40:47
not always once a while there's one
40:49
that's so good i just have to ask you
40:50
know
40:51
one lady i'll just ask this is like this
40:54
one wasn't
40:54
a question that everybody was asking it
40:57
was a question that this lady wanted to
40:59
know
41:00
is snow different colors in case there
41:02
we go taffy colors no
41:03
different colors of snow in heaven
41:06
yes absolutely one of the things that is
41:09
very different about heaven is because
41:11
the father
41:12
the rainbow flows from him ways of it go
41:16
all over heaven sometimes they'll pass
41:18
through your own mansion and everything
41:19
in there
41:20
turns the colors of the rainbow but
41:22
there is a place in heaven
41:24
called christmas town why is it there
41:27
because nicholas who actually was a real
41:30
person who lived on the earth
41:32
who gave gifts to children i believe he
41:34
lived in turkey he was actually a
41:35
prophet in his day that defended the
41:37
name of jesus christ
41:39
and that's what he did just for fun and
41:42
so that was his gift remember
41:44
so christmas time because he grew up and
41:46
nick lived in the snow we love that
41:48
whole area so there's a place in heaven
41:49
that it snows
41:50
all the time you can't frost by it you
41:53
can't you know
41:53
but of course the temperature is totally
41:55
different it's cold
41:56
but you're not freezing there is snow
41:59
and yes there's different places that
42:00
have
42:01
rainbow snow or blue snow green
42:04
and kids love to make snowballs and
42:06
thumb they still do all that they can
42:08
ice skate they go for
42:09
for sleigh rides and this is the thing
42:12
that's a little bit different
42:13
everything in heaven is alive even the
42:15
buildings
42:16
in the river and the trees but the snow
42:20
is alive so about heaven and creativity
42:24
in life
42:25
what you build out of that snow like a
42:27
snowman it would come to life
42:31
and so heaven is the most amazing
42:34
beautiful place
42:35
that God has ever made and it's for us
42:38
to enjoy when we go there
42:40
thank you wow that's amazing this is
42:42
really rich today
42:43
i can learn a lot of new stuff today so
42:46
Kat thank you so much God bless you for
42:48
taking the time just tell us about
42:51
heaven you know somebody have gone
42:53
and they come back and say well it's too
42:54
personal i don't want to share it and
42:55
i'm thinking well
42:56
thank God Kat came to share because
42:59

43:02

43:04

questions about heaven so

without further ado let's bring kat in
02:25
here and here she is how are you doing
02:28
kat
02:29
hi i'm great that's good some people
02:31
have made me
02:32
know uh we can see you but you cannot
02:35
see us so once in a while if i'm
02:37
inserting your question i might
02:39
accidentally interrupt you because you
02:40
can't see me open my
02:41
mouth so yeah i hope you're fine
02:45
i want to ask well let's ask about the
02:47
election and then we'll get right into
02:49
the questions
02:50
um however long what kind of things is
02:52
the lord showing you about the election
02:56
well you know the one thing i have
02:57
learned about God
02:59
is that when he makes a decision about
03:01
something and of course we all know he's
03:02
been from the beginning to the end in
03:04
the end
03:05
to the beginning he has been through all
03:07
of this already he's seen all this he
03:09
knows what's going to happen
03:11
and so when he speaks directly about
03:13
certain specific
03:15
times or events or or things going on
03:19
that's very powerful that he has blessed
03:21
us to let us know this is what will
03:23
happen
03:24
these are my plans regardless of what
03:26
you see or what you hear
03:28
this is what's going to happen and he
03:30
has clearly said over
03:32
and over again that trump would win
03:35
now uh in this time he will sit as
03:38
president
03:39
for the next four years he never changed
03:41
that and yet here comes the virus you
03:44
know here comes this
03:45
vaccine thing that everybody's talking
03:47
about here comes the left
03:49
it looks like they're winning like you
03:50
know a house on fire
03:53
when all along of course we know what
03:54
they did and so does
03:56
most people already know that there was
03:57
cheating and fraud done and all that
04:00
and God also said on november 4th
04:04
he said these words before any of this
04:06
stuff happened that we knew about it
04:08
he said that when the ground begins to
04:11
shake
04:13
the great landslide will begin which
04:15
will be exposure of the fraud the lying
04:18
the cheating the stealing
04:20
in the election and he said it will be
04:23
done
04:24
and justice will be given so that
04:27
doesn't mean
04:28
no one's going to get away with it it
04:30
doesn't mean no matter what they have
04:31
paid they probably paid hundreds of
04:32
billions of dollars
04:34
out of money from these rich wealthy
04:36
people who who hate God and hate most
04:38
people
04:39
so that the left would win they all knew
04:42
this
04:42
those who were involved in they know
04:44
what they did but they're acting like
04:46
nothing happened because they're hoping
04:47
we'll give up well guess what we
04:49
aren't giving up and neither is God he
04:52
clearly said
04:53
to you you believers out there this is
04:56
gonna be okay
04:57
trump is gonna win and they will all be
05:00
exposed and the exposure is
05:02
crazy right now it has not stopped
05:05
they are coming up and they have more
05:07
places that had cameras
05:09
that showed people bringing suitcases in
05:12
the post office i don't know which one
05:14
uh when they shut down and said no more
05:17
counting tonight they slid them out they
05:18
already had them prepared
05:20
these were fake ballots made up for for
05:23
biden
05:24
and they also at that time stole some
05:27
that were actually trump's
05:28
and they did this undercover they
05:31
thought
05:32
they didn't know that they were already
05:33
being filmed and not only that
05:35
people in these places who worked in
05:37
these places have already
05:39
whistleblowers are coming up from
05:41
everywhere because they know
05:43
even though the the head of the left
05:45
because the head of the democrats are
05:47
ignoring what's going on or they're
05:49
hoping it won't really happen
05:50
but the people who were involved in
05:53
doing some of the crimes are not coming
05:55
forward and confessing
05:57
so they already have all this let me
05:59
tell you there's things going on that's
06:00
so shocking
06:01
they haven't told anybody yet but they
06:03
have the evidence so you are not here
06:05
to be filled with fear about anything
06:09
if you're a believer God did not give
06:11
you a spirit of fear
06:14
so why are you afraid but he has given
06:17
you listen to this
06:18
spirit of what is the first thing power
06:21
did you know you have power over all the
06:23
plans of the enemy and all the darkness
06:25
around you
06:26
use you do not tolerate that stuff you
06:29
don't tolerate fear
06:30
or confusion or any of it you kick it
06:33
out of your soul kick it out of your
06:34
home
06:35
this is a time for celebration because
06:37
if the God of heaven on earth
06:38
saying this is what will happen and he
06:40
said before it was known
06:43
you can take that to the bank no matter
06:45
what you've gone through what you think
06:47
you're gonna go through
06:48
don't let your mind run wild with the
06:50
thoughts of the enemy
06:51
or any of the other lies that are still
06:53
being put out there
06:54
and let me just add this the vaccine
06:56
will not kill you
06:58
and God just added he said tell him it
07:00
won't kill him because it's going to
07:02
take
07:02
like i don't want to take that but the
07:04
fear
07:05
is still come to the end means running
07:07
wild we just had a call from somebody
07:09
saying
07:10
i don't want to take that vaccine it's
07:11
going to kill me there's going to be
07:13
trackers in it they can trace wherever i
07:15
go my dna will change
07:16
none of that is true the people who
07:20
adamantly are trying to work on a
07:22
good vaccine are not people from china
07:26
they're not people that want to have our
07:28
destruction
07:30
they sincerely want to help us and it's
07:33
already been tested by hundreds and
07:35
hundreds of people
07:36
so i would say this if it is your choice
07:38
to take it take it
07:40
i don't need it i don't want it okay but
07:42
i can just tell you this
07:44
they're afraid that the whole the whole
07:45
world's going to go to nothing
07:47
and everyone will be destroyed i went
07:49
okay
07:50
so God's plan is to make us great in
07:53
this day have those some of the best
07:54
inventions
07:55
ever given we're going to be accelerated
07:58
in this country to be examples of God
08:00
and life with God and so these are
08:03
powerful amazing days
08:05
we haven't even started manifesting
08:07
we're not even doing the works alone the
08:09
greater works
08:10
and yet in this time frame of the next
08:12
24 years that God has got powerful plans
08:15
to set us up guess what
08:17
for the next 100 years so you're not all
08:19
gonna go die
08:20
run go live in the hills to escape
08:22
something horrific
08:24
these are the days of his son's power
08:27
and you need to say that anytime a
08:29
thought comes you say no
08:31
i'm not tolerating thoughts from the
08:32
enemy these are great days to be alive
08:34
these are the days of his son power
08:36
these are not the days of his wrath
08:38
and so you're in God's hands so you have
08:41
no more fear there that's my statement
08:43
about me
08:44
there you go that's awesome victory
08:47
rally
08:48
trump is planning a victory rally i
08:50
won't tell you any more about that
08:52
well he was doing something in atlanta
08:54
is that today or
08:55
is trump going to atlanta it was one of
08:58
those places
08:59
will be there first and then trump will
09:01
join i'm not sure what point people join
09:04
but i believe pence is already there and
09:07
uh i'm
09:08
just saying you you will be so delighted
09:10
these really are days and i would just
09:12
say what God says
09:13
celebrate and eat cake right there
09:15
there's your tradition
09:17
today celebrate and eat cake people
09:21
that's good that's very good well let's
09:23
jump into some questions about
09:24
heaven for those of you that are brand
09:26
new Kat has been to heaven you said
09:29
you stopped counting it a thousand times
09:31
i asked you off camera today
09:33
me this is the only question i prepared
09:35
you for the rest of them you don't know
09:36
what's coming
09:37
i said people keep asking me how often
09:41
you go to heaven and use your answer
09:42
surprise don't
09:44
tell people what you just told me yeah
09:47
it's
09:47
a lifestyle because he chose i have a
09:50
commission he
09:51
literally in person gave me a commission
09:53
jesus christ did
09:55
to go on tours of heaven whenever he and
09:57
the father
09:58
felt like doing it so that i could share
10:00
it with you
10:01
all on the earth to give you hope to
10:04
give you joy
10:05
that death would have no sting that you
10:07
actually will know about the place that
10:08
your loved ones have gone and are living
10:10
with
10:10
having a real life there and so at any
10:13
moment
10:14
there is no time in the spirit realm so
10:17
he could take me ten times a day
10:19
and it would be like here but he could
10:21
show me many different things
10:23
and that includes taking me back to the
10:25
past or into the future
10:27
or in heaven right now with everything
10:29
that's going on sometimes just to show
10:30
me what they're doing in heaven
10:32
but many times is to see from heaven's
10:35
viewpoint what God is doing on the earth
10:38
and so there is no time frame anymore it
10:40
used to be
10:41
in the beginning he would take me at
10:42
least once a week then it was several
10:44
days a week then i got where he was
10:46
taking me all the time and then
10:47
sometimes in the day sometimes at night
10:50
i don't dream so i never go in a dream i
10:52
don't have visions i have encounters
10:55
that's in real time
10:57
actually in heaven or him here on the
10:59
earth
11:00
and i'm a revelator that's what he calls
11:02
me that i have a commission to reveal
11:04
heaven to earth
11:06
well ken are you sometimes in
11:08
conversation with somebody
11:09
and you're gone and you come back and
11:11
finish the the sentence
11:13
is it can it happen that fast it has
11:15
happened it's actually happened with me
11:17
sitting on the front row and
11:18
some church somewhere waiting to speak
11:20
and he'll catch me right up
11:22
uh and show me things in heaven and then
11:25
put me right back
11:26
right back on my body and then i'll get
11:28
up there and share
11:29
what just happened to me so it has
11:32
happened it has happened before
11:34
that's good well i have a bunch you
11:37
can't see it but there's a lot of things
11:39
here there's there's a lot
11:40
and i try to ask questions that people
11:44
are asking the most times that have not
11:46
been added but some of them are
11:48
are even i would use the term cute
11:51
because i'm going to ask you about
11:52
clothing in heaven
11:53
that's the one sun that happens to be on
11:56
the top of my list here
11:58
and a bunch of people keep asking what
12:00
do we wear some of them are asking do we
12:02
wear
12:02
period clothing do people wear their
12:04
1800s clothing do people wear their
12:06
native american clothing
12:08
and then this 12 year old caitlyn wants
12:09
to know can i wear
12:11
sweatpants in heaven
12:15
there you go um i will let you know
12:18
that's all about comfort girl i
12:19
understand that i love to be comfortable
12:22
most of the stuff i wear
12:23
not you know not on the platform or not
12:26
in front of the camera
12:28
i love baggy warm fuzzy things so i
12:31
understand about the sweatpants and i'm
12:33
sure somewhere in heaven
12:35
they have them because i do know this it
12:38
sounds crazy i've seen people in blue
12:40
jeans heaven has their own brand of blue
12:42
jeans so we're not going to get rid of
12:43
those
12:45
people and tunic tops and pants most of
12:47
them match
12:48
beautifully some have designs some have
12:51
things this sounds
12:52
wild doesn't it some have music coming
12:55
from them
12:55
uh some of them change colors because
12:58
somebody can't make up their mind what
12:59
color they want to wear
13:01
and that's the truth two minutes for
13:03
those people can't do that so
13:05
every kind of time the one thing that's
13:08
not there
13:09
is okay number one you're not going to
13:10
be naked scratch it off the list because
13:13
yes i've had people having that no this
13:15
is not the garden of eden okay
13:17
people like ride roller coasters that
13:20
would be very uncomfortable
13:22
because you're in a your spiritual body
13:23
but it's a literal body in a spiritual
13:25
world
13:26
and it would be very uncomfortable to do
13:28
some of the things that we get to do
13:30
there
13:30
if you had no clothing on so no nobody
13:33
runs around like that you know
13:35
um like i said it's not the garden of
13:37
eden and they have
13:38
you have in your mansion you have a room
13:41
probably maybe two thousand square foot
13:43
room
13:44
that has your apparel in it and all the
13:47
assessments and all the stuff that goes
13:49
with that
13:50
everybody has a staff in heaven that's
13:52
one of the reasons why i
13:53
really i have five yeah i have like five
13:56
here that i've got you know used for
13:57
different
13:57
things uh most of the people in the old
14:00
testament always had a staff now i think
14:02
it was that a necessity in the new
14:03
testament
14:04
a lot of people use them when they even
14:06
go hiking or walking now
14:08
but i use mine for spiritual reasons not
14:10
sometimes when i'm declared for
14:12
something like if it's ruling and
14:13
raining i have one as a crown
14:15
on it if it's something like just uh
14:17
coming against the enemy
14:19
i have something else for that if it's
14:20
declaring and decreeing things and new
14:22
regions
14:23
so get a step get a step okay let me
14:26
stop
14:27
talking while you're taking that drink
14:30
it was interesting because this morning
14:31
in prayer
14:32
i was talking to the lord and i i said
14:35
lord i'm sorry
14:36
to the father because you've been really
14:38
painting a picture of a loving father
14:39
and i'm saying father
14:40
do you use sometimes blue jeans in
14:43
heaven and he started laughing
14:45
and he said i've appeared many times in
14:47
blue jeans on this earth
14:49
does that sound about right it does it
14:52
does so there's many things
14:53
there's also beautiful things like they
14:55
have huge events where everybody
14:57
you just like a king you know uh or
15:00
well just for this just for the sake of
15:02
it i will say a queen
15:04
they don't really have queens in heaven
15:06
we're kings lords and priests
15:08
and that's another female but you'd wear
15:11
things
15:11
that are so beautiful beyond description
15:14
and a lot of these have gemstones that
15:16
came from the heart of the father
15:18
himself
15:20
gifts in heaven and he puts them like on
15:22
your robe your robe of righteousness so
15:25
everybody's always running around in
15:26
heaven to see who's wearing what
15:28
that doesn't take away from the holiness
15:30
of the awe of God
15:32
he wants us to be like little children
15:34
and he gets excited
15:35
when we get excited not just in heaven
15:38
but even on the earth that's so good
15:40
kat and then they're actually on my list
15:42
these are quite in random order
15:44
people keep trying to get triangulate on
15:48
your answer because you've shown them
15:49
100 years in the future and they're
15:51
saying some prophets are talking about
15:53
times are wrapping up and they're they
15:55
keep quoting matthew 24
15:57
which says this generation will not pass
16:00
they connect it to israel
16:01
and they're saying therefore it has to
16:02
be this generation and that's only
16:04
already been a generation and you have
16:06
that same matthew and this is just me
16:08
talking about that same matthew 24 says
16:10
this gospel of the kingdom must be
16:12
preached in the whole
16:13
earth and then the end will come
16:16
how do why do they look at that other
16:18
part
16:19
because number ones people just want it
16:22
to be over
16:23
and they want to escape and yet God has
16:26
a timeline and i can tell you we've got
16:28
quite a bit of time left on that
16:29
timeline
16:30
but he actually gave me um
16:33
revelation on that scripture it also
16:36
talks about that stuff in mark 16
16:39
when the disciples are asking him when
16:41
he said you know these different things
16:42
will be happening they say well when
16:44
will the
16:44
end come when will we know when the end
16:45
will come
16:47
and that's when he gives that you know
16:49
that famous word that says there'll be
16:51
wars and rumors of wars
16:53
and uh uh you know the people will rise
16:56
against the other
16:58
land against land and i'm trying to
17:00
remember the other thing it said
17:02
oh kingdom against kingdom right
17:05
and then he goes on to say all these
17:07
other things and he says but the end is
17:09
not yet even he
17:10
told the disciples the end is not yet
17:13
but that scripture that says
17:14
this generation that word
17:18
generation that says this generation
17:20
shall not pass away into all these
17:22
things be fulfilled i know about that
17:24
scripture and he said to me
17:26
that word generation is the key that
17:29
word generation in that scripture means
17:31
a group and type of people it doesn't
17:34
mean
17:35
a time span but everybody looks at a
17:38
word in our natural
17:39
head you think you've got that figured
17:41
out well that means 20 years that means
17:43
30 years
17:44
no no there's different things he says
17:47
throughout the bible that you would
17:48
think mean
17:49
one thing like the violent take by force
17:52
that doesn't mean you're being violent
17:54
that doesn't mean that
17:56
the word suffers means more than one
17:58
thing in the bible the word suffers
17:59
could mean suffering but also means
18:02
um uh suffer the little children to come
18:05
unto me
18:07
come unto me call them to come unto me
18:10
so you see what i mean the same thing
18:11
with generation the word generation can
18:14
mean a grouping type of people
18:16
it can mean a time span
18:19
or it can mean an age it's actually
18:21
sometimes that gender or generation
18:23
means an age
18:24
a group and type of people or just the
18:26
regular time span that you would call
18:28
a generation but that one in that
18:30
scripture
18:31
this generation this group and type of
18:34
people
18:35
uh will be here on their weather on the
18:38
earth
18:38
the end cannot happen and let me tell
18:41
you the more powerful we become in him
18:44
as these generations go by
18:48
we need to get that place where we speak
18:50
to the mountain and it jumps into the
18:52
sea
18:52
we need to get to the place we speak to
18:54
the land the sea in the air and it gets
18:56
healed
18:57
those are the manifested sons and
18:59
daughters they're just
19:00
now and i mean just now about to to
19:03
begin to appear on the earth
19:05
and i say that because people will know
19:06
and see these things that they'll be
19:08
doing it'd be
19:08
wild beyond your imagination the
19:11
authority that God has given us but when
19:13
we step
19:14
into that it depends on our lifestyle it
19:17
depends on our relationship
19:19
with the father with the son and holy
19:21
spirit some people are called and
19:23
appointed to do that
19:24
so he's not ending this world before God
19:27
he's not ending this world before it's
19:29
done
19:30
and even even after the whole
19:31
tribulation by the way that is
19:33
seven years i will say that again it is
19:35
seven year time span not in your
19:37
lifespan
19:38
no one alive unless God keeps you here
19:41
will be here you'll already be in heaven
19:44
and until
19:45
we the body that's operating such power
19:47
and authority pushing back
19:49
darkness and and ruling and reigning the
19:52
spirit realm
19:53
until we are removed the antichrist
19:56
can not appear why nobody would need him
20:00
nobody would want him the reason he gets
20:03
to appear is because there's great
20:04
devastation at that time in the
20:05
tribulation
20:07
and there is no one to rescue the people
20:09
at that time
20:10
and i firmly believe that the body of
20:12
christ
20:13
will not be on the earth when that
20:15
happens unless there's people who get
20:17
saved during that time and so your
20:20
your your assignment anyone who's
20:22
hearing this
20:23
your assignment is not to plan the end
20:26
your assignment is to take dominion use
20:29
the authority christ gave you
20:31
help to shift things in these nations
20:33
and be great for God
20:35
he didn't call you for that he didn't
20:37
call you to be here during the
20:39
tribulation or the perilous times
20:41
because the day of his son's power has
20:43
to happen
20:44
the manifested sons and daughters have
20:46
to happen the wealth of the wicked has
20:48
to be given to the justin the righteous
20:51
all these things have to happen and it's
20:53
going to take generations for all this
20:54
to work itself out
20:56
that's good so don't be afraid of
20:59
anything
21:00
you're here on the earth for now
21:04
because this is an important time it's a
21:06
great time
21:07
it is a time to celebrate that's good
21:10
well i have this next question in my
21:12
stack here is a question about women
21:14
it's not really about heaven
21:16
but i thought i would go ahead and ask
21:17
it because i've never heard you address
21:19
it
21:19
that i know of because i'm a woman who
21:22
grew up in leadership but after marriage
21:24
and attending church we currently go to
21:26
there seems to be no place for women in
21:27
leadership or the five folk
21:29
is there insight from Kat about how to
21:31
understand apostle paul's teaching about
21:33
women
21:33
authority and leadership within the body
21:35
of christ i would appreciate it
21:38
yeah well i always love to be asked the
21:40
one
21:41
question there's people that say that i
21:43
have no right to speak on a platform or
21:45
say anything on a platform and i go well
21:47
number one you do not understand the
21:49
scripture that says women should remain
21:52
silent in the church
21:54
many times again because of head
21:56
knowledge for man
21:57
i i live by revelation what the father
21:59
says and shows me is what i speak about
22:02
and one of the scriptures he gave me was
22:04
that scripture where paul was saying
22:06
those things well back in the day when
22:09
paul was here okay in the temple
22:12
the women were always made to sit in the
22:15
very back and i know
22:16
orthodox jews and they all confirmed
22:18
this they sat way in the back
22:21
not up front only the men were allowed
22:23
to sit up in front
22:24
in and they still uh the men of course
22:28
have the say
22:28
even now in the jewish household it's
22:31
just the way
22:32
it was ordered by them and uh and so
22:35
what would happen was
22:37
the priest who was speaking that day in
22:39
the
22:40
temple the the women couldn't hear them
22:42
they were
22:43
way in the back with all these children
22:45
they didn't have children's church back
22:46
then people
22:48
and so they would yell to their husbands
22:50
this is actually what they did
22:51
jaime what did he say and then you do
22:55
30 40 women yelling that won't you say i
22:57
can't hear him could he say something
22:59
louder
23:00
and so that is why paul said women
23:02
should remain
23:03
silent in the church it was about the
23:06
culture of the day
23:08
it was not God saying from heaven women
23:11
have no right to say anything
23:13
he wasn't saying that so man took
23:16
that saying what was said to spoken
23:19
about the women
23:21
and turned it into a law
23:24
okay that is not true that is not what
23:26
that meant it was talking about the
23:27
culture of the day and many times if you
23:29
would check out the culture
23:31
even in some of these scriptures in the
23:32
old testament like things in leviticus
23:34
that were said and other things
23:36
you would realize that is addressing the
23:38
culture of that day
23:40
so they wanted the women to be quiet and
23:43
they say speak to your husband
23:44
after you get back home that should have
23:47
given you a clue they weren't up there
23:48
trying to take the microphone
23:50
and say anything they were trying to
23:51
find out what the priest was saying
23:53
that their husbands could hear and so
23:56
that changes the whole outlook on that
23:58
one thing
23:59
that people have used to beat women up
24:02
over the head
24:03
and yet you look at how powerful the
24:06
women were in jesus day there were more
24:08
women that followed him
24:09
and ministered around him all the time i
24:13
know he had his 12 disciples i'm not
24:14
saying that they're not important
24:16
but you know what the women did all the
24:18
supplying of things and helping and did
24:20
that type of thing
24:21
and yet jesus said the best place to
24:23
have isn't necessarily serving anything
24:25
is to sit at his feet and listen
24:28
so mostly women can't have authority
24:32
and yet God says we women and men
24:35
are kings and priests unto unto their
24:38
God
24:40
i think as uh at least as many prophets
24:43
or providences if you will
24:45
uh are in our stream the elijah streams
24:48
elijah list
24:50
and so it's not an issue with us but
24:52
this woman's talking about what her
24:54
church they have
24:54
they seem to have no place do you
24:56
recommend for women they say well my
24:58
church doesn't allow anything like that
24:59
do you recommend
25:00
a change or what do you say to somebody
25:03
like that
25:04
tell people this if God sent you there
25:06
if he's
25:07
if you if you heard him say to you i am
25:10
sending you to let's just say for
25:12
instance i'm sending you to the leesburg
25:14
assembly
25:15
you will go there and serve and you will
25:17
love people
25:18
and you'll have a position like maybe an
25:21
intercession or something like that
25:23
and i'll have you there for a season now
25:25
if God just sent you there
25:28
you may have difficult things
25:29
understanding just keep praying and
25:31
interceding because eventually he will
25:32
put you
25:33
where you can really grow and prosper
25:36
and use your gifts
25:37
some churches are still stuck in the
25:40
idea
25:41
that women don't have gifts to offer
25:43
except for maybe children's church or
25:45
maybe praying
25:46
and yet there's some of the great in the
25:48
body and the spirit some of the greatest
25:50
most powerful
25:51
leaders we've had in the spirit so i
25:53
would i would say this if he didn't send
25:55
you there and you chose there
25:57
then pray and ask for a place look just
25:59
check them out make sure that they're
26:01
you know not
26:02
freely sinning because that does happen
26:04
in a lot of places now
26:05
and they actually preach that find the
26:07
place that preaches the whole council of
26:09
God lets you use your gift
26:11
recognizes that God has put something in
26:14
you that can be used and given
26:16
but also make sure that you're willing
26:18
to be
26:19
under authority before you can be in
26:22
authority that's good we all have and
26:24
men have to do that too man we have to
26:26
be under authority
26:28
before we're in authority as well so
26:30
it's not like a special requirement for
26:32
women we had to all
26:33
be under authority you know and God
26:35
can't trust any of us
26:36
if we had not first sat under authority
26:38
it's just the way it is
26:40
and some people think well my gift is so
26:42
good i'm gonna go bless them at this
26:44
church with my powerful gift
26:46
and they want to get up and prophesy
26:47
over people and everything i've had
26:49
this has happened trust me and the
26:51
pastor would come and say i'm sorry but
26:53
at this time we don't really know you we
26:54
don't know your heart so
26:56
we'll let you work over here for a while
26:58
and you can just be under and we'll
26:59
observe you and see how you do
27:01
and then the twist come we'll probably
27:03
extend that to you and some will
27:05
walk out the door and say i'm sorry my
27:08
gift is too important
27:11
well you know it doesn't take he doesn't
27:14
take your free will
27:15
i mean you can do do whatever you choose
27:18
you have to be willing to pay the
27:19
consequence
27:21
if God didn't say you know i'm i'm
27:23
releasing you or something i'm
27:25
i'm not one that ever tells people you
27:27
can't leave
27:28
but you should know if if you have peace
27:30
from the lord to leave it's not just the
27:32
act of the will uh okay
27:35
here's a question that's come up a
27:36
couple of times even on the same day
27:38
somebody was writing about being single
27:41
and they're asking about
27:43
is there a special let me just read it
27:45
are there any blessings in heaven for
27:47
those who are single and to remain
27:48
virgins before they went to heaven i
27:50
have a lot of godly friends all in their
27:52
50s
27:52
we are all in that category so i was
27:54
curious i feel singles are really
27:56
forgotten and marginalized
27:59
in quote unquote church today but i
28:00
don't think they were historically
28:02
marginalized what would you say about
28:04
that
28:06
i guess it's a question if there's a
28:08
blessing in heaven for that
28:10
i don't know that there's a blessing
28:12
unless God
28:13
asked you to remain that way i think
28:16
that's your voice
28:17
and if that gives you peace and that's
28:19
where God's got you
28:21
this is it you have a lot more time to
28:23
spend with jesus
28:24
i'm telling you i always thought my
28:26
whole life i wouldn't marry
28:28
i just wanted to be alone with jesus and
28:30
he laughed every time i said that so i'm
28:32
just going to tell you if
28:33
he's if he laughs at you that means
28:35
maybe you're not on the right track
28:37
but he adamantly would ignore it every
28:40
time i said you know i helped to raise
28:41
12 of my siblings that and
28:43
when i when i grew up i'm just going to
28:44
have a really a really nice apartment
28:46
with me father son and holy spirit i'm
28:48
going to work in big business and
28:50
those were my plans and half of those
28:52
plans were Gods but God would laugh
28:54
every time i said those words and and
28:56
then finally came the day when he said
28:58
no you are marrying
28:59
this person i have chosen for you before
29:02
i sent you
29:03
and i need holy seed in the earth so
29:06
you're marrying
29:08
and even though it wasn't a burden but
29:11
be open to what God is saying and there
29:13
are some that he has reserved to just
29:15
give themselves to him
29:17
but as far as it being uh like a special
29:19
gift for remaining celibate i don't know
29:21
if that exists in heaven
29:23
i know this you gonna care about any
29:26
kind of rewards a special thing anything
29:28
you are so undone about being in the
29:30
presence of the father and jesus christ
29:33
and holy spirit
29:34
you'll be like a kid you'd be so excited
29:36
about being there
29:37
but you won't escape getting rewarded i
29:40
can tell you what God says even in this
29:42
day
29:43
for all those who've been faithful and
29:45
stood in the gap
29:46
and not given up and well you know it's
29:48
okay if you fall down just get back
29:50
up don't give up God says this to you
29:53
you've gone too far
29:55
you can't go back it's too late
29:58
to escape and great
30:02
that word is for everyone a believer
30:05
let's see how
30:05
um people let's see how do i want to ask
30:07
this um
30:09
i'm going to put it combined a couple of
30:11
questions into one question because
30:13
there's several have asked it so rather
30:15
than read one
30:16
they're asking if somebody barely made
30:18
it to heaven by the skin of their teeth
30:20
he is expression i like the thief on the
30:22
cross at the last possible second
30:25
when they were on their deathbed they
30:26
received christ they went to heaven
30:28
do they receive less rewards do they
30:30
have a lesser of a mansion
30:32
and they're wanting to just know about
30:33
that
30:35
i i will address one thing first as i
30:38
just said
30:39
there are people that get out of
30:42
transports
30:43
when you arrive to heaven you're taking
30:45
in a transport many different ways
30:47
sometimes just a delight for you
30:48
sometimes christ picks you up in his own
30:50
chariot
30:51
sometimes you go in these little old
30:53
looking biplanes or you going like
30:55
rocket ships because
30:56
God knows you would love to have that
30:58
experience but when you get out there's
31:00
a place you disembark
31:02
that's outside the gate it's a beautiful
31:04
place and people
31:05
literally saw them get out and kiss the
31:07
ground and i'm not making that
31:09
up i am not saying that there are some
31:12
that kiss the ground of heaven because
31:13
they go everything
31:15
i really my mother you know thank God i
31:19
made that choice
31:20
at that very second so there's always
31:23
people like that but
31:24
no matter what you end up with and there
31:26
will be people so highly honored like
31:29
intercessors who prayed in their closet
31:31
four moves of God
31:32
you know gave things help people
31:34
everyday their life gave their own food
31:35
away and stuff like that
31:37
uh and that happened a lot in the past
31:39
right now it's more about giving part of
31:41
your life
31:42
like words of hope and stuff like that
31:44
it's more like that's important
31:46
to say things to encourage people and
31:48
give them hope but
31:50
it is true that your rewards won't be
31:52
the same
31:53
they couldn't be now i do know that he
31:56
gives the same
31:57
love no one is kept from being at the
31:59
throne of God and i've heard people say
32:01
before
32:03
i've heard people say oh you're kept in
32:05
dog pens you get little hobbles
32:07
no one's allowed i've heard them
32:10
now it's not saying that happened that's
32:12
what they believe right right there's
32:14
levels you have to go through before you
32:15
can even approach God that is not
32:18
so if you receive christ
32:21
no matter how rotten you were in your
32:23
life you receive christ you get in those
32:25
gates you're in heaven
32:27
you may see the father any time you want
32:29
to you are still concerned with this
32:30
passion is love
32:32
you are delighted everywhere you go in
32:34
heaven because people really love you
32:35
and care about you
32:37
but i actually was taken and shown this
32:39
one person
32:40
my sister-in-law who works with me i saw
32:43
her ex-husband
32:45
as he died i saw he i by the way my
32:47
brother and
32:48
my sister-in-law prayed with him right
32:50
before he died he received christ
32:52
right at the last moment and i saw him
32:55
in heaven and
32:56
his mansion was this huge a beautiful
33:00
beautiful a frame like four stories high
33:03
right on the crystal sea where the
33:04
forest are
33:06
and uh i didn't know anything about him
33:08
and he was like fishing
33:10
i saw this dog that was like speckled
33:12
color and i heard him call that dog
33:14
pepper
33:15
this person didn't see me so i saw all
33:17
these details about this
33:18
life he he was so overwhelmed and
33:21
overjoyed with the love of God that he
33:24
gave him such a place now let me you can
33:27
imagine some mansions for people who
33:29
really serve God or love people
33:31
it could be the size of new york city
33:33
one
33:34
mansion wow so this person of course
33:37
didn't get something that was
33:39
like a king or whatever but they were
33:41
grateful they were filled with joy
33:43
that God blessed them and they loved it
33:45
and i found out later
33:47
from from from margaret that he loved to
33:50
fish
33:50
that he had a pet dog named pepper so
33:53
how about that
33:54
i didn't know that and so i was
33:55
explaining what he looked like the
33:57
things i heard him saying about
33:59
uh thank God people were praying for me
34:01
thank God that for the blood of christ
34:03
that i am here
34:04
so but it is true the more that you
34:06
don't
34:07
work to get to heaven but what you do
34:10
with him in your life you are
34:11
absolutely getting rewarded uh you will
34:15
get rewarded
34:16
and uh but everyone has access to jesus
34:19
christ
34:19
everyone has access to the father and
34:22
the holy spirit is just
34:23
everywhere in heaven that's so good
34:26
well here's a question maybe this one
34:28
and one more question for today
34:29
a couple people have asked this so i'm
34:32
going to kind of paraphrase both of them
34:33
well here's
34:34
what about barren women although i work
34:36
with children and it's a comfort
34:38
due to circumstances i was unable to
34:40
adopt the children i always hoped for
34:42
my husband and i have been married for
34:44
many years and have tried with doctor's
34:45
health to have children
34:46
i have believed for healing but it never
34:49
happened the grief is so deep on many
34:51
levels those who have lost babies
34:53
have them waiting for them in heaven but
34:55
i have no babies waiting for me
34:57
i feel forgotten and then she goes on to
34:59
say and another one asks
35:00
and they're kind of they're blending
35:02
them together they want to know if God
35:03
would allow them to go to heaven
35:05
and adopt one of the babies that didn't
35:07
have parents coming or raised one of the
35:09
babies
35:09
that's an interesting question i never
35:11
heard it even asked
35:14
there is absolutely a place in heaven
35:17
and i was taken there and they call it
35:19
the reserve
35:21
and it's millions of babies you can go
35:24
there you
35:25
absolutely can adopt one in heaven
35:28
really like it's your own yes you can do
35:31
that and God
35:32
because there's some unfortunately in
35:35
some nations there are some
35:36
that the the the adults just don't make
35:40
it
35:40
for what they believed there they never
35:42
had an encounter
35:44
with uh with even the gospel that's why
35:46
it's so important
35:47
why he says until it's preaching to all
35:49
the earth the end will not come i
35:51
understand that
35:52
because there are people especially from
35:53
the past times now
35:55
a baby could have been aborted or
35:58
whatever like
35:58
50 100 years ago on the earth
36:02
but those little babies would still be
36:03
little babies
36:05
and so he has this beautiful place all
36:07
the babies play and they laugh they know
36:09
one day
36:10
that they will have a parent because you
36:11
have to remember they're aware
36:13
that they didn't have a parent when they
36:15
got there they knew that their parents
36:17
weren't going to come
36:18
but there's no grief in heaven so yes if
36:20
you want eight
36:23
you get my blessing i'm going to choose
36:25
how those ain't when you get there
36:28
it's absolutely possible for you to to
36:30
have babies and children to adopt them
36:33
in heaven
36:35
wow okay well let me ask this uh let's
36:38
do this last one this is a little bit
36:39
for fun i have no idea how you would
36:41
answer this
36:42
i kind of suspect that i do but we
36:44
talked about your pets
36:46
going to heaven and adam's going to have
36:47
it i think uh so one person want to know
36:49
if there's
36:50
dinosaurs in heaven because they go and
36:52
the other person wants to know
36:54
what if what about those animals that
36:57
were sacrificed for their food and for
36:58
the sake
36:59
do they get to go to heaven those same
37:01
animals
37:03
now how about that that is another
37:05
person who's really hearing holy spirit
37:08
so um and i could include several
37:11
different instances like
37:12
especially those but uh i'll just add
37:15
this for free i know you're talking
37:17
about
37:17
food animals that are killed for you to
37:19
have food on the earth right now
37:21
what about them another instance is
37:24
those who were sacrificed at the temple
37:26
uh and back in the day you know when the
37:28
jews did that
37:29
when they did the sacrifices what about
37:31
them they were innocent
37:32
and those all of them are in heaven
37:36
all of them are in heaven and i i found
37:39
this out just a while back but i didn't
37:41
really tell people
37:44
that all those animals that you've been
37:46
eating they all
37:47
do have uh they all all those creatures
37:50
have a soul
37:51
they have a spirit they all went to
37:53
heaven it was like they were
37:55
of maybe against their will being given
37:58
their life for us to have a sustenance
38:00
on the earth
38:01
and so yes they do go to heaven and
38:03
sometimes i
38:04
feel like they go to your mansion if
38:07
there was one whole animal that probably
38:08
gave its life for you
38:10
and you ate that i keep telling people
38:13
you're going to be
38:14
surprised how many cows and chickens and
38:17
other
38:18
things it's funny to laugh but
38:21
this is gonna have a lot of turkeys and
38:23
chickens in my place
38:25
there'll be a lot of turkeys roaming
38:27
around i didn't think about the turkey
38:28
that's funny
38:29
that's that one's really fun so um
38:31
anyway
38:33
um not the only that's good well okay
38:36
well let me ask one last one here um uh
38:39
there was a
38:40
man he wrote you don't have to use the
38:42
turkey thing because everybody has a
38:43
turkey you know or whatever
38:45
so get ready to have it there's a
38:47
christmas song that goes
38:49
there's that christmas song that goes
38:50
everybody knows that turkey and i always
38:52
think
38:53
i know a few turkeys and some mistletoe
38:58
sorry
39:04
okay now this person this one actually
39:06
is a pretty serious question
39:07
and we'll end on that and hopefully i
39:09
don't know how you would answer this
39:10
because
39:12
he was uh compassionate but you could
39:14
tell he was
39:15
having a desperately hard time for
39:17
decades with this issue
39:19
of being encouraged so he was sort of
39:22
like incorrigible he was uh
39:24
he could not find a way to be encouraged
39:26
if he got to heaven
39:28
and so loved ones and he found out when
39:29
he got there that some loved ones didn't
39:31
make it
39:32
and they went to hell he said i cannot
39:34
fathom
39:35
how i could enjoy heaven knowing that
39:38
they went to hell
39:39
do you have anything on that i
39:42
absolutely do
39:43
have something on that and it's all
39:45
about their will
39:47
uh on the earth your whole focus is
39:52
normally as a believer to get your
39:54
family members born again to get them
39:56
into heaven and
39:57
they probably had many many many many
39:59
many many many
40:01
chances to receive christ the thing is
40:05
this that i tell people that if you
40:07
prayed for them if you prayed
40:09
God i pray that they will come to know
40:11
you that they'll be in heaven with me
40:12
God
40:13
uh that you you know it says in the
40:15
bible that you shall eat the fruit of
40:17
your lips it says if you
40:18
say something believe in your heart um
40:21
and don't doubt that it shall come to
40:22
pass
40:23
there's several scriptures that are
40:25
really decorations for standing that
40:28
this is what happens at the very moment
40:30
of their death jesus christ
40:32
will present himself to them or he would
40:34
be unjust for all the words you declared
40:37
over them
40:38
and a lot of them will be there if you
40:40
prayed for them
40:41
so you we have prom we have a promise
40:44
given to us by God
40:46
because we serve him we love him we
40:48
belong to christ we do have promises for
40:50
us
40:50
and our family and loved ones but the
40:53
other thing is this
40:54
if you absolutely knew when you got
40:56
there number one
40:58
your focus in your life in heaven is
41:01
definitely jesus christ all of your
41:03
family members even though you love them
41:05
you will not
41:06
have the same kind of love that you have
41:08
for christ so i know you don't
41:09
understand that
41:10
unless you were there which is why most
41:12
people when they get there don't want to
41:14
come back it's not they don't love you
41:16
is that that passion they have for him
41:19
is so great he is their life
41:22
he becomes their life although you have
41:24
all of having to do things christ
41:26
is is it in heaven the other thing you
41:29
have a
41:30
great understanding of is that they
41:33
had a choice it wasn't like they didn't
41:36
get a choice
41:37
and you understand the acts of
41:39
somebody's will
41:40
unfortunately most people when you get
41:42
to heaven you understand that that grief
41:44
isn't there there is no
41:47
grief in heaven and again i will jump to
41:50
another scripture because people always
41:52
say well what about this one that talks
41:53
about the tears
41:56
when when he will wipe away the tears
41:58
now that's about the judgment seat of
42:00
christ
42:00
no one's asked me yet that is not about
42:03
you'll be
42:03
sad and devastated that family members
42:05
aren't there that grief
42:07
is consumed up in christ's love you're
42:10
not going to mope around heaven
42:12
suffering in agony and grief because
42:15
somebody didn't make it
42:17
and there will come a point in your own
42:19
existence
42:21
when he said he will wipe away all tears
42:23
and the former things will be remembered
42:25
no more
42:26
at that point in heaven you will not
42:29
remember them
42:30
and i know you might think that's harsh
42:32
it's just the way God designed it
42:34
but by this time you will have been so
42:36
consumed by
42:37
understanding the father his just his
42:40
mercy and his grace but there will come
42:43
a point that you won't remember those
42:45
people who didn't make it
42:46
and that's God's mercy for you but when
42:49
you first get there i'm sure that
42:50
there'll be times
42:52
where they might come to your mind but
42:53
right there along with those thoughts
42:55
are the comfort and the joy of the lord
42:58
so i know
42:59
in your human understanding and in this
43:01
physical heart
43:03
i understand what you're saying but you
43:05
don't understand
43:06
about being there and how different it
43:09
is with the love of God there so
43:11
you need to be comforted now you will
43:13
not be in torment
43:15
nor in grief over over anything when you
43:17
get to heaven
43:18
but keep praying that's good that's
43:21
really good
43:22
and i i think we'll need to be hearing
43:24
over the years
43:26
more and more teaching that we should be
43:27
praying our loved ones into heaven now
43:30
absolutely yeah because God like you
43:33
said God would be unjust
43:34
if he didn't make every attempt to
43:36
answer that prayer
43:38
you know do not let this person be lost
43:40
we pray that for our kids
43:41
you know to be saved in christ we
43:43
believe they all are but you know
43:45
uh even if they walk away we're not
43:47
gonna just quit praying
43:48
even if they were to walk away we keep
43:50
declaring and decreeing that they would
43:52
be with the lord that's right
43:54
no matter what they say to you now they
43:56
may be adamant about not caring they
43:58
don't want God they hate him they can
44:00
say all they want to they're still being
44:01
influenced by the enemy
44:02
that doesn't mean that God won't find a
44:05
way to get to them and this is the
44:06
greatest part you may not even know they
44:08
did it before they pass
44:10
when you get there and that's one of the
44:12
first things jesus told me that people
44:13
some will be shocked to see that their
44:15
family member made it
44:17
although they were the ones who stood in
44:19
the gap and prayed for them
44:21
and therefore jesus won't be unjust you
44:24
must
44:24
remember he has the keys we'll talk
44:26
about that another time
44:28
of hell death in the grave and what our
44:30
words say and how we make a stand
44:33
makes a big difference your faith and
44:36
your in your belief for that and
44:38
trusting God for that
44:40
most all of your family members probably
44:42
all of them will get to heaven as long
44:44
as you've declared over them
44:45
now when you declare them like father i
44:47
declare that they'll come to know jesus
44:49
christ
44:50
i declare that they will be with me in
44:52
eternity and they will become the living
44:54
testimony of the saving power of jesus
44:58
christ i declare that
45:00
in jesus name amen that right there is
45:02
one of the things the holy spirit taught
45:04
me to say
45:05
over my own loved ones you have to
45:08
really mean it when you say that
45:09
but then he said then you can't go
45:11
around talking bad about them
45:13
so if you've done that make sure you
45:16
nullify all the words you spoke
45:18
seriously say i choose my will to
45:19
nullify all the negative words
45:21
even though they write judgmental
45:23
critical words i will not have those
45:24
words remain that i spoke against my
45:26
family member
45:28
because i'm making a stand for their
45:29
salvation
45:31
so good wow this is good i know a lot of

02:18
all be sure to subscribe to our youtube
02:20
youtube channel we like youtube we like
02:22
what they do for us
02:24
but we also know that uh they could
02:27
squash this at any time and decide that
02:29
we're not living up to their
02:30
expectations they can take us off the
02:32
air so
02:33
if that should happen uh go to elijah
02:36
list.com
02:37
the there's there's the button right
02:38
there go to elijah.com you should do
02:41
that anyway and subscribe to the elijah
02:43

02:45
so that we can always contact you if the
02:48
channel changes or if we have to go on
02:49
another network
02:50
um beyond that going to elijah you may
02:53
some of you may or may not remember this
02:55
but
02:55
if we were to get kicked off for any
02:57
reason at all hopefully we won't
03:00
go to rumble rumble.com r-u-m-b-l-e like
03:03
a bumblebee
03:04
only to rumble so
03:07
all right well without further ado let's
03:09
bring Kat Kerr  here
03:11
and here she is hey kat how are you i'm
03:14
doing great thanks
03:16
you're looking chipper there in
03:18
jacksonville florida
03:19
right and this is your home studio is
03:22
that right
03:23
yes it is and the weather is beautiful
03:25
outside
03:26
that's good it's not too bad out here
03:28
too it's a little nippy in the northwest
03:30
but
03:30
the sun is partially up so well Kat
03:33
let's jump right in
03:34
we'll do some things as it relates to
03:36
the election and we'll talk about that
03:37
for a few minutes and get an update
03:39
and after that we'll go back into more
03:41
questions about heaven but
03:43
this is uh some people think this is a
03:44
very important critical
03:47
uh drop dead deadline type date
03:51
where the electoral college meets and
03:54
votes what are your thoughts on that
03:55
whole thing happening today
03:57
of course because we live in a physical
04:00
world that has its own government and
04:02
the way things are run in our country
04:05
they're going to follow that you know of
04:07
course as being normal
04:09
but we have something added to our lives
04:12
we have the
04:13
supernatural added to our lives because
04:16
there may be the supreme court but we
04:18
actually believe in and know the supreme
04:20
God and
04:21
he's going to have his way in this in
04:23
this time and in this election
04:25
so of course we will see what they come
04:27
up with and of course it's always
04:29
wise to pray that God's will be done and
04:31
that you know the holy spirit move upon
04:33
that whole bunch
04:34
which you know he can do that's what he
04:36
does best
04:37
and so i i'm excited to see what you
04:40
come up with but i'm more excited about
04:41
what God is saying
04:43
and i know there's days and processes we
04:45
have to have but God goes beyond that
04:47
and he
04:48
always has in the bible in the old
04:50
testament in the new testament and even
04:52
today
04:53
he does things that changes everything
04:56
whatever that's going to be i will
04:59
assure everybody no matter what the
05:01
outcome
05:02
of that electoral vote God is still
05:05
saying to me
05:06
trump will sit in the white house for
05:07
the next four years
05:09
and of course he is never wrong i do
05:12
want to say that i
05:13
admire everyone the moral majority here
05:16
in america that has stood for what is
05:18
right
05:19
who want justice liberty and freedom and
05:21
you have been showing up
05:23
it has just been crazy that tens of
05:26
thousands probably hundreds of thousands
05:28
of people
05:29
that have been flooding washington dc to
05:31
make a stand for trump
05:33
and not just there but in many states
05:35
across our nation and this is even
05:37
wilder
05:38
there have been meetings and groups and
05:40
rallies and
05:41
other countries who aren't even
05:43
americans who are rallying for our
05:46
president
05:47
many of them are praying and declaring
05:48
over over america
05:50
God will have his way and that is
05:52
exactly what will happen so we'll see
05:54
what happens
05:55
and you know i know people have already
05:56
made comments well you know they've
05:58
already thrown such and sex out of court
05:59
that doesn't matter to God
06:01
i can tell you right now this is his
06:03
time on earth
06:05
beginning a divine decade and he's going
06:07
to put in that office
06:09
and it will be also it is the will of
06:11
the people the people
06:13
we the people are standing up and saying
06:16
what they want and i'm
06:17
actually blessed that they're doing it
06:19
denominations for the first time in
06:22
existence of this world are coming
06:24
together
06:24
laying down the differences the body of
06:27
christ is joining together
06:28
to rally around our president and of
06:31
course what america stands for God made
06:34
this country
06:35
and he's still involved in this country
06:37
so we'll just see
06:38
that's what i always say that's my
06:40
statement yeah that sounds good now
06:42
God says i go what God says and what he
06:44
has shown
06:46
and many of you also understand this is
06:48
a time
06:49
to not move what you believe for stand
06:52
and stand therefore and see the hand of
06:54
our God
06:55
now one of the most common see people
06:58
have talked about
06:59
the lazarus was dead story the abraham
07:02
and
07:02
his son isaac story the the esther
07:06
and mordecai story but the single most
07:08
common one that i've been seeing
07:09
both in this format that we're in the
07:11
video format and in written form
07:13
is people keep talking about coming up
07:15
against the red sea
07:17
and the red sea the only way out is the
07:19
red sea has to part
07:20
are you getting that kind of revelation
07:22
too oh absolutely
07:24
actually God has taken me back and show
07:27
me exactly when that happened
07:29
and if you look at what was coming
07:31
against the jews
07:32
okay for the first time they were
07:34
tasting freedom remember that
07:36
they had been let go pharaoh had decided
07:38
to let them go
07:39
so they were already leaving in freedom
07:42
and taking great wealth with
07:44
them as they went and they were all
07:46
excited here they are marching right and
07:48
here's moses God's
07:49
man of the hour and he's got his staff
07:52
and here they come up against the red
07:53
sea
07:54
well that was enough right just to see
07:56
the red sea right there okay they can't
07:58
swim across you can't
08:00
get several million people by the way is
08:02
how many were crossing with him
08:04
that how is that even possible to do
08:06
that and then behind them all of a
08:09
sudden pharaohs change his mind
08:10
here comes the army here comes the
08:13
pharaoh's army
08:14
coming at me and they are determined
08:16
that they're either going to get them
08:17
back or wipe them out
08:19
this is they've already got this
08:20
obstacle they got the one in front of
08:21
them the red sea
08:22
and then here they got pharaoh's army
08:24
chasing them and yet
08:26
when moses stepped out and they stayed
08:29
in faith when he stepped out with that
08:30
staff
08:31
that red sea parted even beyond the time
08:35
they thought when there was no
08:37
time left this is what you got to
08:38
remember there was no time left to do
08:41
anything
08:41
not in the natural so here i'm at here
08:44
comes the supernatural hand of God move
08:47
that red sea parted and they walked
08:49
across on
08:50
dry land people it wasn't mucky there
08:53
was
08:54
no water the walls of water actually
08:56
stood up by their self
08:58
they're all trying to figure out in
08:59
their head how this could happen it was
09:00
God
09:01
and so here they are now rejoicing
09:04
here's victory for them they're crossing
09:06
over on the dry land and here comes
09:08
pharaoh's army
09:10
not giving up so here it comes again you
09:12
see
09:13
the enemy will try to stop you and put
09:15
fear in you all along the time that
09:17
you're standing
09:18
to see the hand of God move to have that
09:21
victory and justice that we want they
09:23
want
09:23
they wanted it to and all of a sudden
09:27
the last one gets across and again the
09:30
hand of God moves and here comes the
09:32
water
09:32
crashing down on the entire egyptian
09:35
army
09:36
they're all drowned there's no way they
09:38
can do any harm to them
09:39
and of course it's never a good thing
09:42
that people have to give their lives or
09:43
die
09:44
but wicked people to pursuing to take
09:47
them back or to kill them
09:49
their heart was to destroy or retrieve
09:51
them and so they're the ones who lost
09:54
the darkness lost here's the light
09:57
here's the darkness
09:59
they stood and waited on God he moved
10:02
his hand they got across he moved his
10:04
hand
10:05
and he did away with their enemy so i
10:07
can tell you this
10:08
is exactly where we're at the same kind
10:11
of scenario
10:12
and they rejoiced and celebrated that
10:14
God their God had delivered them
10:16
and i can tell you in the end of all of
10:19
this it's so important to pray to
10:21
believe to care
10:22
to declare and rejoice you must have
10:25
victory
10:26
in you that's called faith before you
10:28
see it happen but
10:29
we will see the hand of God moving all
10:32
of this and in the end
10:33
we will have victory trump will sit in
10:36
the white house for four years like
10:38
moses got across
10:39
and the people all got across with him
10:42
we will have
10:43
justice in this entire situation so stay
10:46
excited everybody
10:48
that's good now Kat i've had a couple
10:50
people that are not among our prophets i
10:52
have many prophetic brands and prophets
10:54
and
10:55
and i sit on the acp roundtable and all
10:58
that so i'm not talking about any of
10:59
that but there was a
11:00
a couple of gentlemen that i knew years
11:02
ago and i looked at their sites just out
11:04
of curiosity
11:05
if i was a strong like you Kat i
11:07
probably would say i don't even care
11:08
what they say
11:09
but i did look and i noticed that the
11:12
accusations that's flying
11:14
um if i can put it that way and i don't
11:16
want to give it too much airplay but
11:17
just
11:18
they're saying you guys are all trying
11:20
to make trump
11:22
a messiah you're worshiping him like God
11:25
you're trying to say he's your spiritual
11:27
leader
11:27
how would you respond to that claim
11:31
i would say this God is the one who
11:34
chose him
11:36
above all the odds that were against him
11:39
to ever be
11:40
chosen as a republican representative to
11:42
run for president
11:44
okay from the beginning the enemy our
11:47
enemy is satan but he uses people he
11:49
uses people who are either deceived
11:52
or just um or are actually just consumed
11:55
by him
11:56
to get his way and from the beginning
11:58
he's tried to stop trump from being
12:00
there
12:01
but God has been with him and many of
12:03
the prophets know he was not just chosen
12:05
he was anointed and appointed by God
12:08
to be president for eight years in this
12:11
country
12:12
so that God could turn this country
12:14
around
12:15
and in every way trump has never said he
12:17
was their spiritual leader
12:19
he himself honors God and he's even made
12:23
the statement i am not God and i'm not
12:25
getting into that
12:26
so he looks up and he says to God i am
12:29
definitely not you
12:30
so he knows he's not God we know he's
12:33
not
12:33
but God he bonded our hearts together
12:37
to stand behind someone who's never in
12:39
the history of our country
12:41
been so uh uh you know slammed and
12:44
bashed and falsely accused
12:47
and shredded over and over again with
12:50
with the whole left being against him
12:52
the media
12:53
obviously has been against him and now
12:56
others have joined that whole group
12:57
don't ever join the side of darkness
13:00
they will lose and so he has bonded our
13:04
hearts to people but when he said they'd
13:05
love him
13:06
they never said they were worshiping him
13:08
people when they
13:09
find someone who's going to help to
13:11
rescue them in this natural realm
13:14
we need a leader who is strong who can't
13:17
be bought
13:18
who can't have fear put in them cannot
13:20
be controlled
13:21
and that's actually why God chose him as
13:24
a great business person who would turn
13:26
our economy around strengthen our army
13:28
our military honor those who deserve to
13:30
be honored
13:31
care about every single group he loves
13:34
america this is what God says he's an
13:36
all-american boy
13:38
who's all for america and so
13:41
clearly God has chosen him he put up
13:43
with all that stuff for the last four
13:44
years and yet is still
13:45
willing to go forward with the plan he
13:48
has to make
13:50
greater than before and God wants that
13:53
so nobody's worshiping him we do honor
13:56
his position
13:57
which a lot of integrity and honor has
13:59
been lost in the democratic party they
14:02
chose that their integrity is just about
14:04
shot and i'm telling you they do
14:06
anything
14:07
lie cheating steal i don't mind saying
14:08
that because they do it and this is the
14:10
thing
14:10
we all know it the american people
14:14
we the people know what happened
14:17
they can't hide it they can't lie about
14:19
it which makes us
14:20
love president trump even more that's
14:23
called honor
14:24
in case you know what that was that's
14:26
really really good
14:28
well that's very very good now we will
14:30
have you back on a wednesday
14:32
uh of course we have a q a in a minute
14:34
here
14:35
but we'll have you back on so for those
14:37
of you that wonder what what's the rest
14:39
of the week i think
14:40
tomorrow we'll have stephen uh springer
14:42
and he's got some had some good
14:44
revelatory dreams that some of us have
14:46
even been praying into
14:47
Kat will be back in on wednesday and i
14:49
can't remember at the moment
14:50
i think jeff johnson's back on thursday
14:53
and i can't remember who's gonna pray so
14:54
these are great
14:55
great great people and by the way one
14:57
last thing i
14:58
our own breaking christian news i saw
15:00
the headline today i didn't get a chance
15:02
to read the article yet
15:03
it said that uh the president melania
15:05
trump
15:06
gave a christmas message this morning
15:08
and thanked God for sending his son
15:10
jesus here
15:11
so that that's he's not our spiritual
15:14
leader
15:14
but he is a spiritually minded president
15:17
yes he doesn't love God he's a kind of
15:19
maybe we might even say he's a baby
15:21
christian but you know
15:23
i i love baby christians you know their
15:25
their their
15:26
faith is simple it's not complex that's
15:29
right
15:29
and we don't have all the religious
15:31
trappings with baby exactly i was going
15:33
to say he has no religious baggage
15:35
people
15:37
that's so good well let's jump into some
15:39
questions about heaven for those of you
15:40
who may be new Kat's been to heaven more
15:42
than a thousand times
15:43
probably several thousand several people
15:45
you know the apostle paul was caught up
15:47
to the third heaven the scholars do
15:48
believe it was him he was talking about
15:50
and i now know nine or ten people who
15:53
got caught up to heaven fairly regularly
15:55
i think kat is probably the one that i
15:57
know who goes the most often
15:59
but she's agreed to answer questions
16:01
about heaven and lord's shown her many
16:03
things over the last at least 20 years
16:05
right Kat
16:05
yes yes so here's the first one from 11
16:09
year old i'm going to give you two gig
16:11
and you told me once that she loved
16:14
questions from you know
16:15
teens and pre-teen kids here's one she
16:18
wants to know if she can play video
16:20
games in heaven
16:21
and she wants to know if the if there
16:24
are billions of people in heaven
16:26
how will she find her friends well
16:29
i'll answer the last one first when
16:32
when is your time to go and to me it's
16:35
always a celebration
16:37
when family members have died of mine i
16:39
have had a party and celebrated
16:41
because i know that's what they're doing
16:43
in heaven they will be waiting on her
16:45
that's how she will find her friends
16:47
they'll be waiting on you
16:49
your family members are waiting at the
16:50
gate your friends are waiting at the
16:52
gate no matter
16:53
how long it's been since you've seen
16:54
them so that's one of her first answers
16:57
the other one is this our God is the
17:00
greatest
17:01
creative being in existence he
17:04
loves to create that's where all
17:07
inventions it says every
17:08
it says all the witty ideas they come
17:10
from heaven
17:11
they're sent down to this earth they go
17:13
into the mind of man and whoever grabs
17:16
that
17:16
invention or idea and they put it out
17:19
there first
17:20
and they're the ones who have it and you
17:22
better be ready for a flood of those to
17:23
happen right after all this mess is over
17:26
and trump has been inaugurated i will
17:28
tell you this the ideas and inventions
17:30
will
17:30
multiply and increase and things we've
17:33
never seen before in the earth
17:35
so God's a creative God he makes fun
17:38
places in heaven
17:39
there's profound places in heaven
17:41
there's awe and splendor
17:43
and wonder in heaven you're overdone by
17:46
the presence of God
17:47
is with you everywhere you go you can
17:49
actually go and see the father
17:51
see the son or even see holy spirit when
17:53
you get to heaven
17:54
you're not kept from any of them okay if
17:57
you were counted righteous
17:59
and you are taken to heaven and that's
18:01
where you're going to live
18:02
you have access to him but the things
18:04
you don't expect
18:06
are the fun and adventure that's in
18:08
heaven
18:09
why would he not create them he can make
18:11
anything that he wants to
18:13
and as i just said the amusement parks
18:16
and all the fun things on the earth
18:17
those ideas came from heaven
18:19
now whatever who gets that they could
18:21
put defilement in it they could do
18:23
things in those
18:23
even in the movies hello there's movies
18:25
in heaven
18:26
where do you think that came from God
18:28
loves to tell stories
18:30
except those movies don't have to be
18:32
rated there's nothing defiling
18:35
in them there's no profane language but
18:37
the most adventurous exciting things
18:38
you've ever seen
18:40
but the other things they do have an
18:41
amusement park where the roller coaster
18:43
goes
18:44
up and leaps off the track goes across
18:46
the sky
18:47
it goes under the crystal sea so there's
18:50
a lot of adventure and there are whole
18:52
lands
18:53
now we're not the person who said that
18:55
is disneyland
18:56
we have different we name places on the
18:58
earth you know why God names places in
19:00
heaven
19:01
there's a passionate paradise where you
19:03
find out about the love of God
19:05
and the worship there is so phenomenal
19:07
but there's cartoon
19:09
village where you can go into this place
19:11
in heaven and become a cartoon
19:14
i hope i'm tweaking your head and
19:16
there's a place called
19:17
there's video land where you create
19:20
exciting
19:21
adventurous videos and then you get to
19:23
be in the video
19:24
you and your friends are going to be in
19:25
that video so not only can she watch
19:28
decent fun exciting intense amazing
19:31
videos
19:32
she can write them and be in them so all
19:34
of that just to tell you that
19:36
that there's God is not limited to his
19:38
creativity
19:39
and when he takes you home to heaven
19:41
whatever your gift is
19:43
whether it's like a builder a designer a
19:46
worshiper
19:47
an artist or maybe you have rodeos or
19:50
you have antique car shows all of that
19:53
is in heaven that's good always tells me
19:56
it's 50 50
19:58
50 profound and awe you get so undone
20:02
you just feel like you're just going to
20:03
become one
20:05
with God and you fall in love with him
20:08
you fall in love with his son you fall
20:09
in love with heaven
20:11
it's your home it says your citizenship
20:14
is in heaven and no one regrets
20:17
who lives there ever going there wow
20:21
now um okay boy this
20:24
i'm going to jump towards another
20:26
question that i have in this stack here
20:27
i got a big stack here
20:29
uh one of them i'm going to jump off on
20:32
this from this
20:33
because you want to know about video
20:34
games and someone wanted to know i
20:37
said i'm a programmer well they use
20:40
programmers in heaven
20:41
and you kind of almost touched on that
20:44
just now
20:46
they your gift is going to be used in
20:48
heaven okay but it will all
20:49
whatever it's used in uh because you
20:53
live on this natural earth and you
20:55
have your natural mind you're using
20:56
right now you have to understand that
20:59
God can make and create
21:00
amazing things without any darkness
21:03
involved in it
21:04
if your gift is a programmer i promise
21:07
you
21:07
you will have your home mansion and all
21:09
your property will be designed around
21:11
your ability to program
21:12
it's just that what you call software
21:16
is something that's actually alive and i
21:19
know that
21:20
you to receive that but there's ways and
21:22
things they can do in heaven you could
21:24
never do on this earth you don't need
21:28
wi-fi
21:29
you don't need i forgot what even you
21:31
call some things you don't need solar
21:33
energy
21:34
you don't need electricity you don't
21:36
need any of that
21:37
to design and create amazing things and
21:39
because there is so much
21:41
it's beyond technology i don't have a
21:43
name for it
21:44
but young can do things just like that
21:47
and use that gift
21:48
because that's why he made you that's so
21:50
so so good
21:52
um okay now i'm gonna uh on today i'm
21:54
gonna only ask
21:55
and ask one repeat question and then the
21:58
rest of them are new questions
22:00
this one keeps being asked with the new
22:01
people that joined they haven't heard
22:03
you answer this
22:04
and it's been asked about 30 different
22:06
ways so one of them today was
22:09
i know a person that was a friend of
22:11
mine and he accepted the lord and then
22:13
he lost his
22:14
mind and he ended up committing suicide
22:17
is it possible he's in heaven or what
22:19
about other people
22:20
who committed suicide i'm going to let
22:22
you answer that question again
22:24
you know that answer is so important to
22:27
the father he actually came to me when i
22:30
was going to be writing my second book
22:32
and he said i have to show you this so
22:34
that you have
22:35
a revelation and a great understanding
22:39
of it
22:40
and he said what if people are
22:41
experiencing on the earth
22:43
isn't always suicide although their life
22:46
ends
22:47
he said go first he had me go to the
22:49
dictionary and sometimes he'll do that
22:51
just go get the dictionary and look up
22:52
the word suicide
22:54
and you see what the what that meaning
22:56
is and
22:57
actually the dictionary says suicide is
23:00
knowingly willingly in your right
23:04
mind taking your own life
23:08
and God said what people are actually
23:10
doing is not
23:11
ending their life they're wanting to end
23:14
their suffering
23:15
and he said that is not suicide he said
23:17
if they're out of their mind if they
23:19
have no control of their
23:20
emotions other physical abilities
23:23
of their mental abilities if they can't
23:25
in their own mind
23:27
see anything but ending that suffering
23:30
then when they do that that's not
23:32
suicide that doesn't even go along with
23:34
the term suicide
23:36
or the actual meaning of it they're not
23:38
knowingly willingly intelligently doing
23:40
anything
23:41
they're not in the right mind they have
23:43
no control or they are
23:45
suffering in agony whether it's mental
23:47
emotional or physical suffering beyond
23:49
reason and cannot handle it
23:51
they want to be with jesus and so
23:54
they're ending their suffering they love
23:55
their family they don't want to stop
23:57
living they just can't stop that and he
23:59
was very adamant he explained exactly
24:02
how to talk about it
24:04
and then after he did that he sent me
24:05
guess what to pennsylvania
24:07
was the first place that that revelation
24:09
was released
24:10
and several people in there had just
24:13
lost their loved ones for the same
24:14
reason and they were laughing and crying
24:16
at the same time God said i would be
24:19
unjust if i sent them to hell
24:23
when they had not committed suicide a
24:26
suicide
24:27
bomber this is what he said a terrorist
24:29
or a suicide bomber terrorist
24:31
that is suicide they're in the right
24:34
mind
24:34
they willingly knowingly are going to
24:37
end their life
24:38
on purpose and many times it's to hurt
24:40
somebody he said that's
24:41
suicide these other people are ending
24:44
their suffering
24:45
and yes i will receive them in heaven
24:48
and then he took me to heaven and showed
24:49
me three
24:50
he never stops with just a simple
24:51
explanation with me i'm a detailed
24:54
person so he gives me detail
24:55
then he took me ahead hold on excuse me
24:57
i gotta have a drink
25:01
been chasing and yelling at having fun
25:03
for my grandkids
25:06
and a lot of them so it was a lot of fun
25:08
anyway so he wanted to make sure i
25:10
understood
25:12
so he would tell me about a certain
25:13
person and he would show me them in the
25:15
spirit
25:16
then he took me to heaven and showed me
25:17
where they were living what they were
25:19
doing
25:20
things they were saying about the family
25:21
members on earth how they
25:23
they they really hoped that their family
25:25
knew that they were in heaven
25:26
and that God had been just and kind them
25:30
one was the son of a well-known person i
25:33
won't mention anybody's names
25:35
but he had been in mental torment
25:38
for months until he could no longer bear
25:42
it
25:42
and he was even a strong christian but
25:44
if you've never been in that place of
25:46
despair
25:47
and you need to know this just because
25:50
if you get upset and you don't do
25:52
anything about
25:52
getting rid of that you can go into
25:55
oppression
25:56
don't let oppression get a hold of you
25:58
and in this day there's a lot of it
26:00
oppression if not dealt with goes into
26:03
depression
26:04
if that is not dealt with it goes into
26:06
despair
26:07
and despair is what happens what people
26:09
experience right before they
26:11
they take their life if at any of those
26:14
times that people can understand if they
26:16
lose those thoughts from their soul they
26:19
choose to lose it in jesus name
26:21
and we've done this with people they
26:23
never took their life it was gone like
26:25
it never happened
26:26
so God does have a way he wants us to
26:29
live on this earth and be happy
26:31
but those who do take their life because
26:33
of the suffering
26:35
this young man went to heaven God came
26:38
took him to heaven
26:40
and it was taken through his parents
26:42
different mansions and shown pictures on
26:44
the wall of siblings that hadn't been
26:46
born yet
26:48
as them captured for the first time i
26:50
saw that
26:51
i saw where his family's uh mansions
26:54
were built they were built in the
26:56
mountain of spices which is at the foot
26:57
of these
26:58
massive mountains you go up and it
27:01
changes it's like fall
27:02
all the time but the leaves never fall
27:04
off it's a beautiful place to go and see
27:06
things
27:07
and now i knew nothing nothing about
27:10
this person other than that he had taken
27:12
his
27:13
life and this was one of the ones God
27:15
used to
27:16
show me that he was just and on the
27:19
mantle
27:21
of this young man's mansion it said
27:24
satan zero
27:25
God won and what he was saying with that
27:29
was
27:29
God was just he knew he was a believer
27:31
he knew he was under torment that he
27:33
could no longer
27:34
handle or deal with it and then he just
27:36
wanted to end his suffering
27:38
but he was living in heaven i saw things
27:40
he was doing things that his family they
27:42
would do altogether
27:44
but he was doing this wonderful
27:45
beautiful things in heaven i was able to
27:47
deliver that message to his parents
27:49
they were set free from grief
27:52
unimaginable grief
27:53
and they could actually celebrate that
27:55
he was living in heaven and that God had
27:57
been just
27:58
and the other two situations were very
28:00
similar but he was wanting to get
28:02
he even had me put it in my second book
28:04
it's in my second book of second volume
28:06
of revealing heaven
28:07
he said this will be one of the most
28:09
important chapters
28:11
in is how to understand and separate in
28:15
your mind
28:16
what is suicide what is not and how just
28:19
and faithful God is
28:21
oh good so good well this next question
28:24
i was surprised how many times
28:26
this has been asked especially this last
28:28
week for some reason there maybe there's
28:30
something
28:31
in the spirit realm where people are
28:32
dealing with this but the question
28:34
is not that different from what we're
28:36
talking about except they said what
28:37
about
28:38
a person who was born mentally impaired
28:40
or who became
28:41
mentally impaired or who became
28:44
medically
28:45
impaired who could not necessarily even
28:48
process the way you and i would
28:50
to say would you like to receive christ
28:52
maybe they wouldn't even understand what
28:54
it means
28:54
to have a savior receive christ and
28:56
they're wanting to know how does God
28:58
deal with that
28:59
how do they get to heaven and not go to
29:01
the other place
29:03
well there's one scripture a lot of
29:05
people either never see in the bible
29:08
or they just go read and go past it
29:09
there's many you just read and go past
29:11
it because you don't understand
29:12
it but in the book of romans there is
29:14
actually a scripture
29:16
i think somebody was asking a question
29:18
of the disciples or somebody i don't
29:19
remember who asked the question
29:21
but God said i make myself known
29:24
to every person
29:26
[Music]
29:28
in their spirit there's an understanding
29:31
even people who will claim to be
29:33
atheists let me tell you if you're in a
29:34
plane going down the first thing they
29:36
scream is
29:39
that jesus happening literally they were
29:41
yelling out to jesus and these are
29:43
people who before
29:44
have been just you know abusing his name
29:47
and just
29:47
bashing him and they thought the plane
29:50
was crashing they began to scream out
29:52
loud to jesus and i actually was able to
29:55
i took authority over the whole thing it
29:56
was just a wild thing
29:58
uh demons were trying to kill me because
30:00
i was going to a place to unseat
30:02
principalities
30:03
and let me tell you satan doesn't want
30:04
you to mess with the stuff but God was
30:06
sending me on that assignment you have
30:08
to understand that was an assignment
30:09
from God
30:10
it didn't work the plane didn't crash
30:13
but when we landed people began to
30:16
huddle together and say do you realize
30:19
if it wasn't for God they heard me
30:22
yelling
30:23
that we could have died could you
30:25
understand our life would have been over
30:27
and these were people who didn't even
30:28
know him who all of a sudden
30:30
wanted to know him it does say in the
30:33
book of romans i make myself known to
30:36
every man
30:37
i do know when people are born with
30:39
those um
30:41
handicaps whatever you want to call them
30:44
that after a
30:45
moment listen to this after a moment of
30:47
death
30:49
jesus christ comes in person and you can
30:51
bash me and accuse me it doesn't bother
30:53
you wasting your time
30:54
okay i've already been there seeing it
30:57
it's too late to say i know how just and
31:00
merciful our God is
31:01
because they didn't have the chance
31:05
God gives every one probably many times
31:09
the many chances
31:10
to accept his son and because they never
31:12
were in a place to do that
31:14
your spirit man is perfect your spirit
31:16
man
31:17
is not handicapped that might sound
31:19
crazy living inside your physical body
31:21
if you're a handicap
31:22
if you're if you're blind you can't hear
31:25
in in your
31:26
spiritual body it hears it sees
31:29
they've even had some blind people be
31:31
able to see through the spiritual eyes
31:32
and see when there was no sight in the
31:34
physical eyes
31:35
so your spirit means perfect so when
31:37
somebody passes no matter how sick
31:40
how what what sort of a situation
31:44
they're in
31:45
is is like their bodies depleting or
31:48
whatever it's doing
31:49
it's dying it's in a horrible situation
31:51
when they
31:52
die that spirit man steps out perfect
31:56
and jesus comes to get you and so but he
31:59
does meet with them
32:00
at that moment of death as they step out
32:02
of their spirit of their physical body
32:04
he will come right then to ask them if
32:07
he they want to receive him
32:09
so they will get a chance every person
32:12
gets a chance yeah kat since i've known
32:16
you
32:16
my my whole thinking process has changed
32:19
i'm gonna
32:19
try it on like this uh see what you
32:22
think about this
32:22
when i was raised in a very fundamental
32:25
religious background
32:27
my picture of the father of God i didn't
32:29
see him as father i saw him as God
32:32
and i saw him as looking for every
32:34
technicality to
32:36
to keep me from heaven every
32:39
possible way that could that i could
32:41
fail the test he was watching for those
32:43
so he could
32:44
you know i wouldn't have told you he's
32:45
really doing that but that's what my
32:47
theology was teaching
32:48
what i'm seeing now at least it's this
32:50
is my language it's not scripture
32:53
it seems to me like i was looking for a
32:55
technicality
32:57
that he gets to take you to heaven it
32:59
seems like if you ever received the lord
33:02
if you've ever asked him in your heart
33:04
if you if you wanted to but you couldn't
33:07
how would you respond to that is he
33:08
looking for ways to get you saved
33:11
he absolutely is always as the spirit of
33:14
God just
33:15
just flowed all over me and like i feel
33:18
like
33:18
electricity on me right now because
33:22
God loves it you said that he loves
33:24
people see him that way
33:26
he is doing every single thing possible
33:30
even in the spirit realm even
33:32
supernaturally he'll send the right
33:34
people across your path
33:35
many times he's rescued people and kept
33:38
them from death so they would have
33:40
another chance
33:42
not just to not die but to complete
33:44
their destiny he sent everyone here with
33:46
a purpose
33:47
and it was never a bad purpose he
33:49
doesn't make people evil
33:51
he doesn't want harm he is not involved
33:53
in violence and he despises
33:55
violence he doesn't want violence and so
33:58
of course
33:59
in every way and there's promises in the
34:01
word and that was
34:02
why he was willing to send his son he
34:06
knew that he had to have that sacrifice
34:08
where people could go and accept a
34:10
cleansing of all the sins
34:11
wiped out of them completely when you
34:13
receive christ it wipes it all away
34:16
it doesn't hide it it's like you never
34:19
did it
34:20
because God isn't willing for sin to be
34:22
in heaven
34:23
what is in your soul your soul stays
34:26
with you when your spirit man steps out
34:28
of that body your soul's in you your
34:29
body decays your body gets cremated or
34:32
your body goes in the ground which by
34:34
the way it will be resurrected one day
34:36
you're going to get your body back
34:38
it'll look a whole lot better i holy
34:40
spirit says give it to them for free
34:42
they need to understand that
34:43
you may not like yourself if you don't
34:46
like yourself that's not God speaking to
34:48
you it is the enemy trying to convince
34:50
you that you have no
34:51
value or worth that is the biggest lie
34:54
hell even in this moment of the great
34:56
division and separation
34:58
God loves everybody but he gives us a
35:01
choice
35:02
he lets us choose but even beyond our
35:05
choice he will do everything
35:07
possible that he can as God to get you
35:10
into heaven his word says he desires
35:12
that none should perish
35:15
he desires that the vilest sinner be
35:17
free
35:18
from that sin so nobody can point
35:21
fingers at God and say he doesn't care
35:23
he's an unjust God
35:25
if he was unjust he would have never
35:27
sent his son
35:28
and evan is watching everything
35:32
but you were right steve God does
35:33
everything possible
35:35
if you have strong family members
35:37
believers praying for your salvation he
35:40
also will meet you at that very time of
35:42
death to ask you that same question
35:44
if you ask God things and don't doubt in
35:46
your heart that they will come to pass
35:48
but you believe it will come it will
35:49
come to pass so don't stop praying for
35:51
your family members for your really
35:53
close friends
35:54
he has the keys to hell death in the
35:56
grave
35:57
and he will do it whatever he possibly
36:00
can
36:01
there are still some people believe it
36:03
or not
36:04
they don't want to go they just don't
36:06
they their souls corrupted this is not
36:08
somebody
36:09
who maybe couldn't have responded these
36:10
are people who willingly knowingly
36:13
choose satan and his plan and don't want
36:15
God
36:16
he'll even try to win them but sometimes
36:19
that doesn't happen but most of the time
36:22
you'll be surprised to see your family
36:24
members
36:25
and your dear friends in heaven because
36:27
God does love us
36:28
that's so good so good Kat no let me ask
36:31
you this because it keeps being asked
36:34
over and over and i
36:34
don't think i've ever asked you on
36:36
camera because
36:38
to me it seemed like okay everyone knows
36:40
the answer to that it's so obvious but
36:41
it keeps being asked
36:43
so it's not obvious people are saying
36:45
when i go to heaven
36:46
can i have a young body that's not fat
36:50
or old or and i'm thinking don't they
36:52
know that so i'm gonna just let you and
36:54
the other what questions asked
36:56
similar along that same line as they say
36:57
when a child goes to heaven
36:59
does he stay in child or does he grow up
37:01
in heaven so those two things about our
37:03
age and our body and our
37:05
our appearances let's talk about that
37:07
for a second i know one time i did a
37:09
survey
37:10
when i was doing my first book we we did
37:12
we sent out 400 surveys and it was the
37:14
same question
37:15
if you could ask God one question about
37:18
heaven or eternity what would it be
37:20
and i mean we sent them to bars we sent
37:22
them into prisons we sent them into
37:24
um like um all every kind of religion we
37:28
would send some to each of those we
37:29
actually did personal
37:30
interviews and surveys with people when
37:33
we got all 400 back they were split up
37:35
into three groups
37:36
and that people think that's crazy the
37:39
number one group of course was
37:41
will i be known will i be near my family
37:43
will people know who i
37:44
am the second one was will my pets go to
37:48
heaven
37:49
out of all 400 one-third of those
37:53
wanted to know that and the other one
37:55
was
37:56
how can i win someone to christ that
37:59
doesn't know christ what do i do
38:01
to help get them into heaven so it was
38:04
about relationships they wanted to know
38:06
uh in that relationship what do i
38:08
experience when i die
38:09
is that painful do i go to weird places
38:12
is it going to be scary
38:14
and because there is people don't have
38:16
knowledge of that that's why God has
38:18
people
38:18
catches them up so they can tell people
38:20
when you die
38:21
your physical body continues to grow in
38:24
this natural
38:25
world time goes by and heaven there is
38:29
no time
38:29
you're living in eternity when you get
38:31
to heaven nothing
38:33
ages it even says that in the bible
38:35
nothing ages
38:36
there's no mold there's no military
38:39
there's no
38:40
aging in heaven of anything not even you
38:44
so when you die if you're let's say over
38:47
the age of 20 whatever
38:48
now most people look like they're in
38:50
their 20s in your spirit in your spirit
38:52
man
38:52
when you pass if you're like 99 your
38:55
great-grandma looks 20 years old when
38:58
she steps out of that physical mind her
38:59
spiritual body
39:01
um as she remembers you she still knows
39:03
you
39:04
she's it's so excited knowing that she's
39:06
going to be moving to heaven there is
39:08
absolutely no fear
39:10
there may be fear up to that moment of
39:11
people not knowing but the minute they
39:13
step
39:14
their spiritual body steps up there's a
39:15
guardian angel waiting to take them
39:18
the fear is gone and there's peace yes
39:21
but there's joy
39:22
unimaginable joy and excitement when a
39:25
baby
39:26
passes so your answer to you is you will
39:28
not look oh nobody looks old
39:30
you look beautiful your hair all of you
39:32
will look beautiful and amazing
39:34
in heaven when a baby passes
39:37
whether it's aborted or miscarried all
39:40
babies go to heaven
39:41
no matter what some religions believe
39:43
God sent them
39:45
and he takes them back to heaven they
39:47
stay in beautiful amazing places until
39:49
their family members get there
39:51
those babies already know even if they
39:53
were like maybe a month
39:55
into the pregnancy and they miscarry
39:58
that is a real baby and it has a little
40:01
baby's spirit
40:02
body and it can laugh play understands
40:05
it knows who his parents are and can't
40:07
wait to stand
40:08
and wait till its parents get to heaven
40:10
and so that baby
40:12
most of the time will stay very young
40:15
in other words 60 years could pass from
40:18
the time
40:18
somebody miscarried and they get home to
40:20
heaven they get a baby
40:22
given their very baby that they lost
40:24
that wow
40:25
the same baby is given back to them and
40:27
it grows very very slowly in heaven you
40:29
get to see its gifts develop
40:31
um you don't have to teach how to read
40:34
or write
40:35
or or sing or dance that already knows
40:36
how to do all that
40:38
so you get your babies back if you had
40:40
eight miscarriages you probably have
40:42
eight babies waiting on you
40:44
and this is what God said if the mother
40:46
of the baby pictures that baby
40:49
as a baby it will be a baby if it looks
40:51
like it's a toddler it will be a toddler
40:54
and so it has a lot to do with what the
40:56
mother desires
40:57
uh when they get there but and i've seen
40:59
people go home to heaven and they had
41:01
miscarried children
41:02
i saw them like three or four years old
41:04
sitting on the steps of their mansion
41:06
waiting on them to come home and
41:09
be together so your children are not
41:12
lost
41:13
they are not in pain they're living in
41:16
the most
41:16
amazing beautiful place where God
41:20
is jesus the angels help to take care of
41:22
them and your family members get there
41:24
they automatically go
41:25
to be with them until you get home
41:28
that's so good
41:29
well we have time for one more question
41:30
i could do and then we'll do more on
41:32
this on wednesday
41:33
as well so here's the question um
41:36
a person is going through life and they
41:38
do kindness is here they show kindness
41:41
to a person on the street
41:42
they long forget about those things are
41:45
there are there rewards in heaven for
41:47
specific things
41:48
that you've even forgotten that you've
41:50
done
41:52
God is a rewarder of all the kindnesses
41:55
and the love you have shown
41:57
sometimes it's a smile literally a smile
42:00
can change the not just the mood of a
42:03
person but the way that they're feeling
42:05
inside maybe they're having a bad day
42:06
maybe they're in fear maybe they're not
42:08
feeling well
42:10
or maybe they're just afraid and yet you
42:12
show a kindness like um
42:14
hi uh i just want you to know that God
42:16
loves you or hello are you having a good
42:18
day or just how about hello do you need
42:20
help
42:21
and just to act kind of acne you're
42:24
getting rewarded for that if you've
42:25
fed hungry people there's no way you
42:28
will escape
42:29
i don't care if it was 60 years ago 70
42:32
years ago
42:33
my dad lived his whole life showing
42:35
kindness to everybody even his
42:37
enemies he loved them we fed
42:40
so many people and and we help people
42:42
find homes i mean we moved them in
42:45
here's a family with all these kids
42:47
right and he moved people
42:48
in for a while we helped them find a job
42:50
we helped them find their family members
42:52
we prayed with them to be healed this
42:54
was my life growing up
42:56
to love people no matter what color
42:58
their skin was no matter where they were
43:00
what the situation in life was
43:02
we love and care for people that is the
43:04
heart of God
43:06
and let me tell you my dad has a huge
43:09
reward in heaven
43:10
and i'm sure he's happy that he's got
43:13
these rewards
43:14
but i promise you he is probably sharing
43:16
them with
43:17
people and yes every kind
43:21
act especially he he writes it down he
43:24
has a book of remembrance and they're
43:25
actually
43:26
written down so your little grandma who
43:28
probably nobody ever knew
43:30
prayed in three moves of God fed the
43:32
neighborhood
43:33
probably has some of the biggest
43:35
mansions in heaven so you cannot escape
43:38
being blessed and rewarded in heaven
43:40
that's so good
43:41
so good well kat that's our time my
43:44
goodness we could go for two hours
43:45
not get bored on this but uh we've got
43:47
more questions feel free to send more
43:49
questions and we probably have a hundred
43:51
so that we're catching up on but send
43:53
questions in that you have
43:55
below you do it on facebook do it on
43:57
youtube
43:58
i get some sent to me by email but
44:00
they'll get to me one way or the other
44:02
and we'll try to get through the ones
44:03
and we're trying to ask the questions
44:05
that most people are trying to get
44:07
answered
44:08
um some of the specific things will say
44:10
have you seen this person or that person
44:12
probably not going to be asked because
44:14
everyone's not asking that but
44:15
you did say Kat one time we'll do an
44:18
episode
44:18
about the people you've seen in heaven
44:22
many people i mean from oh gosh well
44:24
i've seen
44:25
people like queen esther king david i've
44:28
seen the disciples i've seen the
44:29
prophets
44:30
like met them and and actually have been
44:34

44:34
a couple of their mansions i know what
44:36
they're doing right now in heaven i've
44:37
seen many people
44:38
like from the past like you would say
44:41
maybe from the 20s or 30s i've seen
44:44

44:47
seen all kinds of people from around the
44:49
world that were known some that weren't

03:37
the Kat Kerr day
03:38
happy wednesday with kat Kerr let's
03:40
bring on Kat right now
03:43
and the engineer is asleep
03:50
you're doing okay can you hear me why
03:52
yeah i could i didn't hear what you said
03:54
for a second
03:56
how are you doing today i'm doing great
03:59
i was just kind of listening to God for
04:01
a moment so that kind of blocks everyone
04:03
else out oh
04:04
that's okay you can you can block me out
04:06
any time for that
04:08
well um so here we are wednesday two
04:11
days before christmas
04:13
we always start talking about the
04:15
election which is currently in progress
04:17
yeah tell us anything you want to tell
04:19
us about the elections
04:21
before we do heaven's talk oh yes well
04:25
God is still laughing and that's a good
04:27
sign when he the way he's laughing now
04:29
because he knows what his plans are
04:32
i can only continue to tell people to
04:34
celebrate
04:36
there are waves of celebration about to
04:38
hit our country
04:40
and it will either make people very
04:41
happy or they may be convicted about
04:44
some things in their life that's just
04:45
the way it happens when God begins to
04:48
invade a place and i can tell you what
04:50
they are planning inauguration for
04:53
president trump regardless of what the
04:54
other side is saying
04:56
um and so God's plans are four more
05:00
years
05:00
you've heard me say that i won't change
05:02
that he's not changing it people
05:04
don't think in your human mind it hasn't
05:07
happened yet so i guess it's not going
05:08
to
05:09
that's not how God thinks i can let you
05:12
know this country is going to be
05:14
changing for the greater and for the
05:16
better and so are
05:18
all of your lives you should be excited
05:21
right now that you're alive and
05:22
experiencing
05:24
what God is doing in the midst of all of
05:27
us
05:27
and so thinking the platform you've
05:30
heard me say that also
05:32
because unless God changes what he says
05:34
to me i just have to say what he says
05:37
that's good for any time of expectation
05:40
and new things coming there will be
05:42
things changing
05:43
obviously because of stuff we've gone
05:45
through but they'll be for the better
05:48
but one thing that won't change that God
05:50
is always running for america
05:52
is justice liberty and freedom and a lot
05:55
of righteousness
05:56
that's good that's so good Kat well you
05:59
know and
05:59
and i know you don't watch the news very
06:01
much on purpose i know several prophetic
06:03
people who are that way the guy just
06:05
says don't watch the news
06:06
it doesn't mean you never hear about the
06:08
news because i'm sure you you know the
06:10
certain amount of current events
06:12
but as one who doesn't watch the news
06:14
someone
06:15
surely told you gee that thing didn't
06:17
pass with the supreme court in texas and
06:19
now
06:20
he's is at the end of his pathways
06:23
uh to the presidency and what how does
06:25
that affect you if someone says
06:28
he either has no more pathways or they
06:30
don't see another pathway how does that
06:32
mean you have
06:32
God's path everybody God's path is not
06:36
man's and
06:37
it's okay to try everything you can
06:39
according to the rules the guidelines
06:42
what we've always done
06:43
but God has a path of his own
06:46
and when we're in a time of him doing
06:49
something in the earth
06:51
it will be done differently
06:54
and that doesn't mean you lose hope
06:56
don't ever step back
06:58
don't stop saying what God says we have
07:01
great victory headed our way
07:04
and it will be so tremendous he let me
07:06
experience a wave of that i got so
07:08
undone
07:09
i wanted to run out in the streets and
07:10
just shout
07:12
so there's one pathway you are not
07:14
considering that's always been in the
07:16
bible when God would do something it was
07:17
always something no one ever considered
07:20
could or would happen and that's right
07:23
that's exactly what he's going to do
07:25
and you may wake up shocked one morning
07:28
or before you go to bed
07:29
shocked and stunned at how rapidly
07:32
things
07:32
change direction when God puts his hand
07:36
on something
07:37
that's so good okay i receive it we
07:39
receive it that's really good
07:41
very encouraging okay are you ready to
07:43
talk about
07:44
some questions for heaven about heaven
07:46
oh yes definitely
07:48
always now everyone now as you those of
07:51
you who have been watching be sure you
07:52
get the old ones you know
07:54
it's easy to find all the ones with kat
07:55
Kerr on it because she's got that same
07:58
pink hair on all the videos so if you go
08:00
to the youtube channel
08:01
you see all the ones with the pink hair
08:02
and you get all the questions some of
08:03
you are asking
08:04
the same questions that have been
08:06
answered sometimes twice or more than
08:09
that and you're saying i'm desperate for
08:11
this answer
08:11
those answers are there so be sure and
08:15
and go and watch the old videos we're
08:17
trying to ask
08:18
questions that the most people need
08:20
answers for if that's too specific
08:23
and we do put a few specific ones on
08:25
there that are that
08:26
are almost personal in nature but
08:29
they're the kind of personal questions
08:31
that would answer a lot of things for
08:33
people so
08:33
yeah having said that Kat the first one
08:35
is and i'm going to do two from this
08:37
gentleman
08:38
um he said you talked on on one of your
08:41
videos about ezekiel 28 the ancient
08:43
paths
08:44
and he said you read from the version
08:46
that was the closest
08:47
he wanted to know which version you were
08:49
reading from if you you remember
08:51
which version of the bible i i have
08:53
several versions of the bible that i
08:55
read i don't read every one of them um
08:58
of course some people make you know you
09:01
always
09:02
uh will get some kind of rebukes or just
09:04
rejoicing
09:06
no matter which way it goes i'm not
09:08
going to change okay i'm you're not
09:10
going to change me so you can either
09:11
accept it and receive it or
09:13
just go your way and find what you want
09:15
to find
09:16
but i love the scofield bible it's one
09:19
of the few bibles it talks about time
09:23
time before man was made
09:27
you might want to check it out it's a
09:28
very very old bible and i have it's
09:31
about
09:31
this thick people because of the stuff
09:34
that's in it a lot of revelation was put
09:37
in there by scofield
09:39
and it's one of the few things it talks
09:40
about like i said they'll talk about the
09:42
earth when you turn the light out
09:44
the first time and then the second time
09:47
um verse two between one and two what
09:50
happened it talks about that
09:52
in the scofield bible a lot of things so
09:54
i can tell you i love scofield
09:57
and i inherited that from somebody i
09:59
also
10:00
love the everyday bible which was made i
10:03
think before the amplified was around
10:05
it's been around for a while also and of
10:08
course
10:08
i read the king james it's some things
10:11
that should not have been changed
10:13
in some of the new versions of the bible
10:16
and they
10:16
they just didn't change them and i for
10:18
instance there are unicorns in heaven
10:20
i've seen them many times
10:22
and it's mentioned nine times when i say
10:25
in the bible look in the king james
10:26
bible
10:27
i think it's psalms 92 and psalms 29 i
10:30
think that's two of the places and uh
10:32
why is that important because God that's
10:34
what he rides if he rides he rides his
10:36
unicorn
10:37
and there they weren't they're not on
10:40
the earth now of course not
10:42
and some people would call it a
10:43
rhinoceros there's many different things
10:45
that people change because they thought
10:47
they just got it wrong okay way back one
10:50
so i do like
10:51
i will read the amplified of course that
10:53
blesses everybody
10:54
i don't read a lot of the brand new
10:56
brand new versions of the bible because
10:58
they just took some things out
11:00
and make sure it has the whole council
11:02
of God when you go to buy a bible
11:04
and if nothing else get one that's got
11:06
several versions in there the niv
11:09
the uh i know they won't put the
11:10
scofield and there's too old
11:12
um and the amplified the king james i
11:15
know those are always good standbys
11:17
um but you know what i think we'll get
11:19
it really right when a revelation just
11:21
begins to flood this earth revelation
11:23
reveals the word of God
11:25
the things of God God himself heaven
11:28
itself
11:29
eternity and so you don't want to miss
11:31
out on revelation we may have to write a
11:33
revelation bible
11:35
and that would mean every revelation i
11:37
ever got and the scripture that it
11:39
reveals we may have to do that one day
11:41
just to make it to be made known well
11:44
that's good
11:45
now you know you brought up the unicorn
11:47
and i'm going to jump ahead to a
11:48
question because you touched on it
11:50
and i don't know the answer to this does
11:52
does the unicorn have wings because
11:54
people several people are asking me do
11:57
horses in heaven have wings and can they
12:00
do people ride on them or does everybody
12:02
have or can i have a horse with
12:04
wings what are your thoughts
12:07
you can have any color of horse you want
12:09
whether it's rainbow colored whether
12:11
it's
12:11
platinum i mean there's every kind of
12:14
color you have to understand the rainbow
12:16
comes from the father
12:18
he and his son they made everything uh
12:20
there's
12:21
trees that are teal i mean there's
12:23
things you you'd be so shocked and
12:24
delighted to see in heaven
12:26
you can have as many horses as you think
12:28
you can take care of now when i say take
12:30
care of that means
12:32
you know you don't have to necessarily
12:33
feed them so they can live you don't
12:35
even have to clean them
12:36
they don't get dirty in heaven if you're
12:38
going to have a ranch where people can
12:39
come and ride then you'll probably get a
12:41
thousand or more you can ride horses
12:43
that fly
12:44
okay and some have wings and some don't
12:46
have wings they don't need wings to fly
12:48
and so in your natural mind because
12:51
you've never
12:52
seen these things it's hard to conceive
12:54
them but you must understand
12:56
that heaven is filled with splendor
12:58
wonder beauty
13:00
mysteries revealed and uh the truth is
13:03
everywhere in heaven
13:05
and just like hair color this is heaven
13:07
culture on my head that's exactly where
13:09
it is i didn't choose this
13:11
God asked me literally to have pink
13:13
highlights in my hair so i would stand
13:16
out
13:16
and people could hear about heaven how
13:18
beautiful wonderful it is he does not
13:20
care if your hair has color in it
13:22
that doesn't change what's inside of you
13:25
and the holy spirit
13:26
said to me all we did was take what was
13:28
inside the joy
13:30
the pleasure of God celebration and we
13:32
put it on your head
13:34
so you need to understand that you can
13:36
breathe under the crystal sea
13:38
you ride through the sky on your worship
13:41
or on light beams you travel around
13:43
heaven you step into a light kiosk and
13:45
it takes you
13:46
to the other side of heaven like faster
13:48
than a second
13:49
so there's ways to travel ways to to do
13:52
things in heaven that just don't on this
13:53
earth
13:55
but the more you get it gets you excited
13:58
the possibilities on earth
14:02
as it is in heaven he says that to me
14:04
all the time
14:05
there's changes coming where the cars
14:07
yes they will fly one day probably
14:09
before you die
14:11
and uh we will ride on rails of light
14:13
like for a train
14:15
not on tracks like metal tracks you
14:17
cannot understand how great
14:19
the inventions that i haven't even been
14:21
here yet it's not going to
14:23
end which is why God is keeping his
14:26
hands
14:27
and his plans for america oh good
14:30
now you jumped ahead again i started to
14:32
go i'm going to
14:34
keep track of that travel one because i
14:35
did have several people
14:37
i was going to ask you about they said
14:38
well how do we travel do we just fly
14:40
do we just appear where we want to be do
14:42
we take
14:44
vehicles i can imagine people who love
14:46
race cars would want to take a race car
14:48
people like helicopters like me would
14:50
want to take a helicopter but on the
14:51
other hand if i could fly maybe i would
14:53
just do that so talk about travel a
14:54
little bit more
14:57
there's so many different ways to be
14:58
transported and i know
15:00
a lot of the things you've seen like a
15:02
star trek's a good example
15:04
i remember back in the 70s you know when
15:07
it first started i was undone
15:09
because i always wanted to be an
15:11
astronaut some people don't know that
15:12
about me
15:13
and in the 60s that was the first time
15:15
the possibility came that's when man
15:17
walked on the moon for the first time
15:20
uh and those things about space
15:22
exploration were just starting back then
15:24
and being a senior in high school my
15:27
plan was to be an astronaut they weren't
15:29
taking women back then
15:30
but i always wanted to see the unknown
15:34
now i'm not talking about the spirit
15:36
realm because i've seen the spirit realm
15:37
all around me the whole time growing up
15:40
and there's ways to travel there too
15:42
but yes you can step into a place in
15:45
your own mansion i don't know if i've
15:46
ever talked about this
15:47
everyone has like an open portal in your
15:50
mansion in heaven
15:52
when you step and you say where you want
15:54
to go and instantly you're there so yes
15:56
you can do that in heaven you can ride
15:59
almost any kind of transport
16:01
when you get your mansions depending on
16:03
where they are built in heaven the
16:04
valley of the
16:05
the falls you know or if it's in the
16:08
mountain of spices or if it's in
16:09
where the sky mansions are mansions
16:12
built on top of the crystal sea
16:14
under the crystal sea and the rain
16:16
forest i can just keep going on and on
16:18
about places so your transport might be
16:20
a little bit different personally
16:23
that you have now i know in the sky
16:24
mansions you get a star
16:26
cruiser it runs on light there's no kind
16:29
of fuel
16:30
like they have on the earth they don't
16:32
use coal they don't use
16:34
like even solar energy they don't use
16:36
any kind of um
16:38
gasoline or anything like that it's all
16:41
frequencies or light that operate
16:43
whatever you
16:44
you fly or drive i mean you can do all
16:46
kinds of ways to get around in heaven
16:48
they even have group things uh
16:50
transports where you can go
16:52
they even have something called mm's
16:55
which i thought was quite delightful uh
16:57
we were taken off at an airport one
16:58
place and i don't remember where it was
17:00
but it had this tower that came up and
17:02
had like a big bubble
17:04
on the top and the holy spirit says to
17:06
me well i'm looking out the window oh
17:08
that looks like an mm
17:10
and yes he talks to me on time and i
17:12
said m m he goes that's the mobile
17:14
mansion
17:16
the rvs you have on earth
17:20
no rv yes you do it in heaven
17:23
only you fly them they have sky parks in
17:26
the sky
17:27
that's when you you park your scot your
17:29
mm
17:30
and then you just come on down you know
17:32
walking through the air down to the
17:33
ground
17:34
or you have a little transport you get
17:36
on something like a bubble
17:38
something i don't know what some things
17:39
are called um kids traveling bubbles
17:42
all over heaven they step on the
17:43
pedestal a big bubble forms around
17:46
i mean you could be three and do this
17:48
okay you're not going to get lost a lot
17:49
of groups of kids do that
17:50
you see their little bubbles going
17:52
around heaven in the sky when they get
17:54
where they want they get closer to the
17:55
pop the bubble and that's how they get
17:58
out
17:58
so you can ride dinosaurs in heaven
18:01
they're not good
18:02
with vicious or or mean you can go to
18:05
a place where all the children play and
18:08
the merry grounds are
18:09
living animals that you ride on how
18:12
about that no pole stuxes and plastic
18:14
thing
18:15
uh it's so different in heaven you can
18:18
just
18:19
like i said you can shout glory to God
18:22
and a bridge comes a rainbow bridge
18:24
comes out of your mouth over the crystal
18:26
sea
18:27
and you can walk over there now
18:29
obviously you could just fly but people
18:30
have many different
18:32
ways they transport around heaven and
18:34
they choose what they want to do at the
18:36
moment
18:37
and so it's delighted it's a beautiful
18:40
place none of your family members
18:42
are sad they're not upset with you
18:44
they're so in love with jesus christ
18:47
if anybody can go somewhere with him
18:48
that's the greatest pleasure they get to
18:50
do he has his own mansion he deserves it
18:53
and he has all kinds of events in his
18:56
own mansion
18:57
and when you first come home to heaven
18:59
he'll invite everybody you ever wanted
19:00
to know like the disciples of prophets
19:02
but you're the one who is brought there
19:04
to meet all of them so
19:06
all kinds of ways well that's going to
19:08
happen jumping again
19:10
to another question i was going to hit
19:11
later anyway and then i'm going to come
19:12
back to question number two
19:14
so here's the question our
19:17
everybody has all these friends and
19:20
relatives family members and new friends
19:22
and acquaintances and who knows what
19:24
other kind of associations or clubs or
19:26
organizations but
19:27
how does how does it the person wants to
19:30
ask this question we wanted to know
19:32
are there compromises what if the whole
19:34
group says i want to
19:35
half the group wants to go to amusement
19:36
park and say well i'd rather go there
19:38
they want to know if there's such a
19:40
thing as
19:41
a you know sin free compromise where
19:44
people
19:45
go ahead and don't do their thing and do
19:47
something with someone else because
19:48
someone wants to do
19:49
nobody really nobody's everybody's
19:52
perfectly
19:53
fine with whatever you decide um if
19:56
there's somebody new who's come home to
19:57
heaven and you haven't seen anything
20:00
some of them will show up and say oh we
20:01
want to take you to see this
20:03
we know that you would love it you want
20:04
to go there and then their friends find
20:06
out and everybody just joined so it's
20:08
not like
20:09
there's no arguments let's say that
20:11
there's no arguing
20:12
no coveting no jealousy uh nobody gets
20:16
nobody gets angry so this is what they
20:18
do if they say let's say there's a group
20:20
and they're going to decide on something
20:22
you'll do both there's no
20:25
time limit there's no time in heaven you
20:28
can go enjoy
20:29
let's go on a big ship across the
20:30
crystal sea and sing with the whales and
20:33
the sharks you know
20:34
glory to God and we can go hunt for
20:37
treasure
20:37
with um i'm gonna really get you now um
20:41
henry morgan on his island in heaven and
20:43
whether you know
20:44
henry morgan the pirate yes
20:48
he's not called a pirate anymore in
20:50
heaven but he
20:51
you know that was his gift right buried
20:53
treasure he has an
20:54
island that's his own and people can
20:56
ride this huge sail ship
20:58
no skull ball no skull and bones okay uh
21:01
you ride over there and you get a map
21:04
it's a spiritual
21:05
map so the treasure could be elevated it
21:07
could be hidden in places you wouldn't
21:08
know
21:09
your whole family goes and when you get
21:11
the treasure you get a prize
21:13
it's a good thing but in let's see henry
21:16
morgan was determined
21:19
that people would know he received jesus
21:21
christ he put it in his
21:22
last will and testament
21:25
that he would be living in heaven when
21:27
he died so he's there
21:30
that's fantastic you know we are going
21:32
to do a whole show on on uh
21:34
all the people that you've known or at
21:35
least a lot more uh okay back to
21:37
question number two if you can believe
21:39
that we
21:39
we're about seven questions in and
21:41
here's question number two
21:43
this this gentleman had um he gave me
21:46
four pages single space there's no way i
21:47
can even summarize it except to say
21:50
except to say almost 40 years ago
21:53
he fell in love starting with uh
21:56
sort of like a teen challenge he was a
21:58
counselor they fell in love they were
21:59
going to get married
22:00
and she ended up with cancer and before
22:02
they were to be married
22:04
long story she died and he knows it went
22:06
to heaven so here's his question
22:10
someone told him that he and he want he
22:12
felt to believe it but he wants to know
22:14
if it's possible
22:16
someone told him way back then that this
22:18
wonderful
22:20
person who was to be his fiance or was
22:22
his fiancee
22:23
uh then became his guardian angel and he
22:26
wants to know that
22:27
is that possible and question number two
22:30
he wants to know
22:31
he's picturing this big mansion that he
22:34
would get he's a believer
22:36
he's seeing himself as all alone
22:40
in this mansion and feeling lonely so
22:45
you do not have a chance in heaven
22:49
nowhere to ever be alone
22:52
i think you look for a loan sometimes
22:55
just
22:56
confusing quiet but you're never alone
22:59
people want to know you even if they
23:01
never met you you'll have visitors all
23:03
the time to your mansion
23:05
and um okay you're the girl
23:08
the person that you had loved God
23:11
wouldn't do that to us
23:12
okay hello uh there are angels those are
23:16
spiritual beings
23:18
we are physical human beings we came
23:22
from inside God
23:23
the angels he spoken created them we
23:26
have different
23:27
lives given to us different requirements
23:30
that they follow
23:31
they're never married in heaven they
23:34
don't have to be married and some of you
23:36
may say they're the lucky ones
23:38
but you know what but God sends him an
23:40
assignment with an
23:41
angel who has a different personality
23:43
some are serious
23:44
about being holy and living that way and
23:46
some are actual comedians
23:48
angels and what he does is he sends them
23:50
together so it rubs them just like
23:54
but she would not be your guardian angel
23:56
because when we go home to heaven
23:58
the the body of christ we'll be using
24:01
the gift
24:02
like let's just say that she was a
24:04
designer or she created jewelry
24:07
or she wanted to be a florist and that's
24:10
the passion
24:11
so when we go home to heaven our entire
24:14
mansion
24:15
is designed around the gift he put in us
24:18
and those gifts are without repentance
24:20
that means that's how heaven operates
24:22
that's why there's so much to do
24:24
is when someone else comes home we all
24:26
enjoy that gift
24:28
let's just say maybe they teach dance
24:30
they do beautiful dancing ballet and
24:32
stuff
24:33
they would have as part of their mansion
24:35
a huge studio maybe a hundred students
24:37
teaching them
24:38
a performance stage to have huge
24:41
performances where people could come and
24:42
watch and enjoy it
24:44
so he would not make that person a
24:46
guardian angel
24:47
if somebody wanted to be a florist and
24:49
all they ever wanted to do was grow
24:50
flowers my grandfather is in heaven
24:53
and he grows flowers that sing they
24:55
change colors
24:57
he lived in the arizona desert but grew
24:59
the best roses he possibly could now he
25:01
was in secret service as a
25:03
job that's not what he does in heaven
25:06
but the passion he had for that
25:08
is what his whole his whole mansion and
25:11
all his grounds are designed around
25:14
being a florist and they design these
25:16
six foot flower arrangements they put
25:18
them in your mansion to welcome you home
25:20
they sing welcome home to you
25:22
why would he take him and make him a
25:24
guardian angel
25:25
your own guardian angel you had on this
25:29
earth when you
25:29
lived on this earth will become almost
25:32
like a friend and you get to know them
25:34
you'll do stuff together you're not
25:35
going to ever worship them nobody
25:37
worships anybody but jesus the father
25:39
and the holy spirit
25:40
so your own guardian angel uh
25:43
has always been your guardian angel but
25:45
he won't assign
25:47
someone to you um he won't assign
25:49
someone you love this move to heaven to
25:51
watch over you now
25:52
that guardian angel that you were
25:54
assigned when you were conceived
25:56
is still with you they actually take you
25:58
home to heaven when you go home to
26:00
heaven
26:00
now your loved ones whether you were
26:03
ever married or not if they love you
26:04
they'll declare over you
26:05
they'll ask jesus to give you gifts and
26:08
things that you need
26:09
uh they declare over your family members
26:11
to know jesus christ
26:13
for you to step into the the desire in
26:16
the future
26:17
and the call in your life he has here
26:19
for your earth you're saying
26:21
you're saying they're in heaven now
26:22
declaring now
26:24
for these things yes yeah okay good
26:27
all right uh good so i've heard this is
26:30
the question i've heard there are sounds
26:31
in heaven we've never
26:32
heard nor experienced in worship is do
26:35
you have anything
26:36
you can describe i don't know how you
26:38
describe a sound we never heard
26:40
what does sound like their music or
26:43
worship
26:44
well i would tell you one of the things
26:46
that's different about in heaven
26:48
especially with the angels in the father
26:52
the father has layers in his voice
26:55
you know the bible says that he sounds
26:58
like many thunders
26:59
or many waters because people who were
27:02
caught way back then didn't know how to
27:04
explain that they didn't know
27:06
that um they had layers in their voices
27:09
so when the father says something it
27:10
sounds like maybe a thousand people
27:12
saying something
27:14
um if angels sing in choirs in heaven
27:17
and stuff like that and i know the
27:18
worship angels
27:20
the ones that were under satan were
27:21
kicked out with him the 130 God were
27:23
worship angels
27:24
that's why satan hates it when we
27:26
worship because we replace them and he
27:29
doesn't like that
27:30
but an angel sings and i've heard
27:32
recordings if you go to
27:34
um if jen was in america i think it's
27:37
jason
27:37
upton and he has i think it's the album
27:41
called
27:41
fly and on that album
27:44
you literally can hear a real angel
27:48
singing and responds to the worship that
27:51
jason was doing
27:53
um to God and you hear this angel begin
27:55
to sing with him and it sounds like
27:57
many but it's one angel you i tell you
27:59
the presence of God gets all over you
28:01
so worship is different because it's not
28:04
just
28:04
a sound it's the way that the that the
28:07
songs are released
28:09
some are released from the wings of
28:11
different creatures
28:12
sound uh the forest things they have
28:15
their own voice the flower thing
28:16
my own voice it sounds different than
28:18
ours they sing different songs
28:20
this is the thing the father is a
28:23
songwriter
28:25
it says things in the bible it says he
28:27
sings
28:28
over us and so he has his own songs
28:32
that have never been heard on the earth
28:34
before and when you come home to heaven
28:35
if you're someone who
28:36
sings for him he will give you this
28:39
treasure box and you will see the song
28:43
come out of this treasure box like a
28:44
garment and it will begin to wind itself
28:46
around you at the throne
28:48
and that garment will sing one of the
28:50
father's
28:51
songs everywhere you go in heaven this
28:54
is one of the rewards you get that
28:56
there's no way on the earth you can even
28:57
conceive of this happening
28:59
you see music in heaven you don't just
29:02
hear it or feel it now this one comes to
29:05
me right now i'm just going to ask this
29:07
for myself
29:08
on earth from time to time when the
29:10
anointing will hit i will have tears of
29:12
joy
29:13
or tears of emotions that's all towards
29:15
God
29:16
are there that kind of tears in heaven
29:18
or are there no tears
29:19
can you have joyous tears you have to i
29:22
always go back to the word
29:23
okay when it says that he will wipe away
29:26
the tears
29:27
that means you will never cry again that
29:29
is at the very
29:31
end of the bible that's where it says
29:34
you know the former things will remember
29:35
no more he'll wipe away your tears
29:39
people cry from joy of who they simply
29:42
tell you you won't be able to help but
29:44
cry
29:44
it is a happy cry it is a joyous cry
29:48
when you see family members you haven't
29:50
seen in yours you can't help but
29:51
grab them and hug them and you weep with
29:53
joy
29:54
so that yes part of our expression he
29:57
doesn't take that away
30:00
sadness or regrets you know or
30:03
maybe rejection you don't cry over
30:06
things like that it's always like a
30:08
celebration
30:08
cry so good okay this one keeps me asked
30:12
are there different rankings of
30:15
importance
30:16
among the saints in heaven or some
30:18
people have a higher rank
30:20
i guess there's they're trying to find
30:21
words to declare you know are some
30:23
people
30:25
higher higher of higher honor or higher
30:28
rank
30:28
in heaven there would have to be
30:32
because of what they gave of their life
30:35
the rewards are different now
30:37
everybody's so happy to be in heaven
30:39
let's just say
30:40
somebody got saved on their deathbed
30:42
well they wouldn't have a whole lot of
30:44
reward
30:45
if they got saved right before they died
30:47
but they still have a beautiful place to
30:48
live
30:49
they are so happy they're there they're
30:51
happy for everybody no matter how great
30:53
their mansion is no matter what kind of
30:55
beautiful rewards are
30:56
inside they understand
30:59
that this person gave their life for
31:02
things i'm not necessarily mean they
31:03
died like a were shot with a gun
31:05
to save somebody i'm talking about their
31:08
serving that they did it says to be the
31:10
greatest of all you must be the servant
31:11
of all
31:12
even though he now calls us sons and
31:15
daughters and
31:15
not servants uh a let's say a missionary
31:19
he went to the mission field for
31:21
20 30 years and and gave up all the
31:24
luxuries and what we would call just
31:26
even
31:26
um ordinary things that you need
31:30
to take the gospel to love people to
31:32
help people my grandmother did that
31:34
she has a great mansion in heaven and
31:37
when i've seen her mention
31:38
it is beautiful and i'm so happy but you
31:41
know what she's a
31:42
humble person you know what she's glad
31:44
she has a big one she can have a lot of
31:45
people
31:46
over to celebrate so yes
31:49
when you do something kind for somebody
31:52
and you love people or you give
31:54
something maybe to feed somebody or
31:56
something
31:57
the father takes gemstones these are
32:00
uh these are stones of revelation the
32:03
stones of fire are inside the father
32:07
when you get born again he takes a stone
32:08
of fire and puts it in your spirit man
32:10
that's what gives it
32:11
light but when you do things for him on
32:14
the earth your robe
32:16
of righteousness some of them look like
32:19
they could hang in a gallery because he
32:20
will gather these
32:21
gems from himself and as you do these
32:24
things throughout your life he applies
32:26
them to your robe
32:28
these are so so beautiful you couldn't
32:30
even afford to buy one if you could on
32:32
the earth
32:33
and you walk down the streets of gold
32:35
and people run up and go what did you do
32:37
with your life did you feed people did
32:41
you take them into
32:42
did you help lonely people did you pray
32:45
for people
32:46
and you didn't even have to say anything
32:47
because people realized they gave their
32:50
life or something
32:51
of course their mansion is going to have
32:53
more i love the one song i don't know
32:55
who sings it but about um
32:56
where you said what you said would
32:59
having to build your manager or
33:00
something it's i can't remember the name
33:02
of the group
33:03
but uh that God's gonna reward you and
33:06
you can't escape but
33:07
no one on this earth may know you but if
33:09
you've fed the same person
33:11
or even some of the creatures he cares
33:13
about them too not more than people
33:15
but if you had a heart of kindness even
33:18
if you were a gruff person maybe you
33:19
didn't say much nice to people but you
33:21
still were helping
33:23
or giving uh you have great reward in
33:26
heaven
33:26
you know you don't have to be billy
33:28
graham you don't have to be oral robbers
33:31
you don't have to be mother teresa
33:33
it's what kindness you show to others
33:36
is that's true reward let me
33:39
forget your family you gotta love your
33:41
family even if they're not not
33:43
yeah yeah you know that just has created
33:46
a new question to me and i've talked
33:47
about my mother now my mother
33:49
uh she's a believer she'll be with the
33:51
lord when she passes she's 86
33:54
she believes and i've mentioned this
33:56
before she believes i'm lost
33:58
her theology is wrong she doesn't
33:59
believe in this stuff but now let me
34:02
because of her theology she has a very
34:07
strict picture of God he's
34:10
he's exacting i mean she wouldn't
34:12
necessarily describe that in her own
34:13
words but she would say
34:15
yes God loves us all but he's got these
34:17
absolute requirements
34:18
so she's had a lot of unhappiness but
34:20
amidst all that unhappiness
34:23
she pours her life out for prisoners
34:27
for the sick for the less than i learned
34:30
a lot about how to
34:31
the love people less than my station to
34:34
my mom
34:35
talk about that what's her reward going
34:37
to be like
34:38
she will have a great reward in heaven
34:40
she's one of those
34:41
type of people i said that they may not
34:44
necessarily be nice to everybody per se
34:47
or treat you maybe what you think people
34:50
should treat
34:51
it's it's what comes from her heart she
34:54
obviously
34:54
cares because you know what she is
34:56
loving for God
34:58
she's loving those people for God what
35:00
she will do steve
35:02
is one day if not now
35:05
then in heaven she will run to you and
35:08
tell you
35:09
she realized that she probably could
35:11
have loved you more
35:13
but she's so proud of what you did for
35:15
God and she's so grateful that you
35:16
didn't give up
35:18
and turn away from what he called you do
35:20
they they get
35:21
so happy when they go to heaven in the
35:23
realization like wow i missed it about
35:25
that
35:26
but they don't feel like regret like
35:28
sadness from it
35:29
but what they will do is they'll declare
35:31
over you continually that God
35:33
presence increase that the gifts he gave
35:36
you
35:36
increase that you get to do signs and
35:39
wonders as a manifested son or daughter
35:42
of God
35:43
they want they want you to be known as
35:46
someone who knows God
35:48
who loves God and is right on the path
35:51
he wants you to be honest
35:53
that's just good news that's such good
35:55
news i know that's going to help a lot
35:56
of other people too but it sure helped
35:58
me
35:58
well okay this one keeps being asked
36:01
everyone so many people want to know
36:02
what language we speak in heaven i guess
36:04
i can't remember if i asked you this
36:06
before i said english is it spanish does
36:08
everyone speak their own language and
36:09
everybody just hears
36:10
it as if it's their language they've
36:13
asked it about
36:14
every way from sunday trying to get the
36:16
answer to that
36:17
well i'll take you back to the bible
36:19
again it says in the bible every
36:22
tongue there's a language tribe
36:25
a nation is represented in heaven that
36:27
means there's people from
36:28
all those places around the world they
36:31
spoke different languages they probably
36:33
dress different than they probably even
36:34
live
36:35
differently but in heaven it'll be like
36:37
your friends
36:38
it really will be and no matter what
36:41
language they choose to speak
36:43
okay they don't lose the language that
36:46
was part of their tongue or tribe or
36:47
that
36:48
wouldn't be true the bible wouldn't be
36:49
true they can speak their natural
36:51
language
36:52
everyone understands it everyone you
36:54
don't have to have interpreters in
36:55
heaven
36:56
the one language that is kept mysterious
37:00
i don't want to say secret is mysterious
37:02
is the
37:03
is the the language of angels they have
37:06
their own
37:06
and i'm sure that if it's some time in
37:09
heaven that might change maybe when we
37:11
all
37:11
are on the new earth or something but
37:13
there are times i hear
37:15
angels having discussions that i don't
37:17
understand them
37:18
and then they might turn to me and say
37:20
something right in heaven
37:22
and i know they speaking to me in
37:24
english so the angels know every
37:26
language on the earth
37:28
but they have their own it even says
37:30
that in the bible
37:31
so and the related questions because it
37:33
was asking
37:34
next to this one is when we you know you
37:37
said people can
37:38
our loved ones can look down and see the
37:40
good things that God doesn't show them
37:42
the painful thing
37:44
you know weddings and important things
37:46
but they want to know when you speak in
37:48
tongues on the earth
37:50
can your loved ones sometimes understand
37:52
what you're saying in heaven i don't
37:54
even know if you know the answer to that
37:55
but
37:56
i think because uh tongues is
37:59
not necessarily um it's well it would be
38:03
a mystery to people
38:04
down here but i have even been present
38:06
in movies when
38:07
movies not movies
38:10
meanings i've been present in meetings
38:14
and i heard people speak in tongues and
38:17
someone else in the meeting
38:18
who wasn't interpreting that now you
38:20
know that's a biblical thing
38:22
to pray in tongues in the day how did
38:24
anybody got up and just spoke for God
38:26
as a prophet but they would say they
38:29
would speak in tongues and there'd
38:30
always be one or two in the meeting they
38:31
would give an interpretation of those
38:33
tongues and that's how a lot of people
38:35
heard from God many years ago and some
38:37
places still do that
38:38
but i've been present when somebody next
38:41
to me
38:42
knew a language like a foreign language
38:44
and
38:45
somebody was speaking in tongues and
38:46
they knew everything they said because
38:47
that was a language they already knew
38:50
so i'm sure in heaven when people hear
38:52
people praying in tongues that's not a
38:54
language of angels
38:56
probably everybody in heaven knows
38:57
exactly what's being said but the one
38:59
who
38:59
doesn't the one who does not know what
39:02
tongues are
39:03
is the devil the devil cannot understand
39:06
it it bypasses his mind
39:08
he can't get an interpretation on that
39:10
that's why it's a
39:11
powerful thing to have as a peer
39:12
language when you pray a perfect prayer
39:15
you pray in tongues you say i'm praying
39:16
about my brother who's
39:18
who's maybe caught up in witchcraft or
39:20
something or i'm praying for my brothers
39:21
in the army and they're all under attack
39:23
you begin to pray in tongues God knows
39:25
exactly
39:26
what that is he can send angels out to
39:28
assistant or
39:30
take care or deal with that but the
39:31
devil does not have a clue what you're
39:34
saying
39:34
which is why another reason why the
39:36
devil doesn't want you to be even
39:37
have any association with the holy
39:39
spirit and that whole thing is speaking
39:41
oh go ahead you start to say something
39:42
else go ahead well i was just
39:44
gonna say so speaking in tongues is an
39:47
outward
39:48
it's really an outward witness that you
39:51
have received holy spirit in your life
39:53
however i do know people who invited
39:55
holy spirit sincerely and passionately
39:58
but didn't have the speaking in tongues
40:00
for some time but
40:02
he moved in i'm telling you and they
40:04
could actually prophesy and say things
40:06
to people so
40:07
back in the day you would get almost
40:09
beat up at a church
40:11
all throughout yeah you'd be there for
40:13
three hours praying just to force you to
40:15
you know if you're not praying in
40:16
tongues you don't have it
40:18
if it's something sincerely you ask for
40:20
he's not going to say
40:21
no that holy spirit if you invite him to
40:24
indwell you
40:25
it's powerful because he's not walking
40:28
along here when you're born again he
40:29
walks alongside you the bible says
40:33
well he moves from here in here and you
40:35
become
40:36
a temple of the holy spirit so holy
40:38
spirit is a third member of the trinity
40:41
he brings power in your life and
40:42
boldness in your life
40:44
and you have a language that the enemy
40:47
cannot understand
40:49
i had a he was like the head elder of a
40:52
church um
40:53
in dallas texas this is like 30 years
40:55
ago
40:56
and he may speak in tongues now at that
40:58
time he didn't but he could prophesy the
41:01
the mail out of you he knew exactly what
41:03
that was going on he'd read your mail
41:05
to use that expression so he very likely
41:08
could have received his prayer language
41:10
after that i just at that time
41:11
he didn't and it was corrected my
41:14
theology just a little bit
41:16
that you can still prophesy you know so
41:19
anyway okay next one
41:21
and i think i understand where this
41:22
person's coming from
41:25
i don't think they mean with sadness but
41:26
the question is do our deceased loved
41:28
ones others
41:29
who are with the lord do they miss
41:32
us i and i don't know what this person
41:34
meant by i'm sure they don't mean oh i'm
41:37
so
41:37
miserable without them but do they miss
41:39
us how would you answer that
41:41
i think they probably mean do they ever
41:44
think about me
41:46
do they ever think about me anymore am i
41:48
just like
41:49
gone out of their life so i'm not i'm
41:52
not there's something invisible
41:54
of course that never happens one of the
41:57
first things they want to do when they
41:58
leave the stone room is they go to these
42:00
beautiful places called the portal you
42:01
go
42:02
up these steps they can see you as
42:03
closest to ceiling in your home
42:06
and sometimes you feel the presence you
42:08
might smell their clone or perfume
42:10
if they bake brownies all the time you
42:12
might smell brownies that usually is a
42:14
sign that they're actually listening or
42:17
declaring over you
42:18
but um people love you more
42:22
when they get to heaven than they did on
42:24
the earth
42:25
so no um they're not ignoring you
42:28
they're not so happy up there that
42:30
they're not aware that you
42:33
still live on the earth and you're not
42:35
close to them and i think because you're
42:37
not right here
42:39
if they're a family member you you
42:41
actually create a soul tie
42:42
between people that you have close
42:44
relationships with so when they're gone
42:47
that's normal to miss them and yeah they
42:49
wished you that you were there
42:51
because they want to show you all the
42:52
wonderful things there but it's not
42:54
not like being sad yeah that's good okay
42:57
a couple more quick ones we're
42:59
we're quickly out of time but uh this
43:01
could be i've always
43:02
actually wanted to know this and i've
43:04
heard every
43:06
possible theory so i'm going to ask you
43:08
maybe you don't
43:09
can this question can Kat ask
43:12
Kat who melchizedek was who was
43:15
melchizedek
43:16
really some say he was christ some say
43:18
he was an angel
43:19
what do you say i'm gonna tell you the
43:22
truth
43:22
okay i'll take that i've seen
43:25
melchizedek
43:27
and melchizedek is different from
43:31
many other beings in heaven now we all
43:33
know father son and holy spirit they
43:35
have
43:35
always existed the trinity has always
43:38
existed
43:39
what you may not know is melchizedek
43:42
is not someone who lived on the earth
43:44
and died and went to heaven
43:46
he was assigned to the earth for a while
43:48
or he could not have met
43:50
abraham right he also had flesh
43:53
he had flesh that wasn't like our human
43:56
flesh but he had flesh on him
43:58
and he made God made a whole tribe of
44:00
angels they're called watcher angels
44:02
that
44:03
God put flesh on them melchizedek's
44:06
eternal position is to be the father's
44:09
personal high priest that is his
44:13
position
44:14
and he also when he was on the earth was
44:16
known as the king of salem
44:19
and it says this about melchizedek he
44:22
had no father no mother
44:24
no beginning nor end this is literally
44:26
what the bible says about melchizedek
44:29
because he he's he's from heaven he's
44:31
always been with the father
44:32
he's always served the father he
44:36
has flesh on him because that's just the
44:38
way he's always been
44:40
and he is a king and actually
44:43
some people can take one saying in the
44:45
bible and make
44:46
a syllabus trying in their own natural
44:49
mind
44:50
to understand that and they talk a lot
44:52
about it says in the bible
44:54
jesus was made after the order of
44:57
melchizedek
44:58
and people come up with all these really
45:01
big
45:01
long words to describe what that means
45:04
this is what it means the word that was
45:07
the word's name before he was jesus
45:09
christ
45:10
the word had flesh put on him remember
45:12
it said that in the bible
45:13
the word became flesh there's one of the
45:16
signs
45:16
of melchizedek he was the king of the
45:19
jews there's another sign
45:22
jesus is our personal high priest
45:25
there's revelation on the word of God
45:27
so jesus was a high priest he had slash
45:30
it was put on him he was the king of the
45:33
jews so that's
45:34
king priest and flesh that is the order
45:37
of melchizedek
45:38
that's why all the angels who were made
45:41
in that tribe
45:42
had flesh put on them they had high
45:44
positions in heaven they were at one
45:46
time sent to the earth to help
45:48
educate man and some of them left the
45:50
bounds they were put in to come here
45:53
but melchizedek is God's personal high
45:55
priest
45:56
before the jewish nation was formed
45:59
because remember abraham had something
46:00
to do that before the jews became a
46:02
thing
46:04
he sent melchizedek to the earth to
46:07
collect ties
46:08
why because something was uh was
46:12
not i don't want to say ordered but it
46:14
was a protocol
46:15
to approach God for something
46:16
melchizedek represented God
46:19
in the earth there was no one else to
46:21
speak for him
46:22
not in a position that was from heaven
46:25
so that's what melchizedek did
46:29
abraham paid ties to him how could he
46:31
see him if he didn't have flesh
46:33
so that's what melchizedek still does he
46:36
is the father's personal high priest
46:39
and he always will be and i i'm i'm
46:42
hearing a question people are going to
46:44
ask and they're going to say
46:45
God the father always was and it sounds
46:47
like you're saying that kissing always
46:49
was because if the father always went
46:50
because it always was but God is of
46:53
course
46:54
one billion percent sinless
46:57
so do you mean i'm going to put it in my
46:59
language do you mean
47:01
melchizedek was his personal assistant
47:03
or do you mean he was a priest and if he
47:05
was a priest what does the priest do
47:07
to a sinless God i don't people are
47:09
gonna say well what does he need a
47:10
priest for
47:11
he was his high priest he would he would
47:14
light
47:14
some of the the things there in the
47:17
throne there are lamps not just the
47:19
seven
47:20
lamps representing the seven spirits of
47:22
God are actually seven
47:23
spiritual beings people they're not just
47:26
lamps that are burning it's not just
47:28
God's attributes or his character's
47:31
characteristics God himself has those
47:34
that
47:34
serve him the seven spirits of God serve
47:37
the father
47:38
melchizedek is a priest a probably a
47:41
very high priest in heaven
47:43
probably the highest priest there is
47:44
besides jesus and he serves the father
47:47
in the throne room that's what he does
47:48
if the father
47:49
sends him on an assignment to the year
47:51
for something he'll still send him
47:53
but he is his personal hype he worships
47:55
him okay all the time but his heart is
47:58
open what the father needs for him to do
48:01
he does that that's what a priest does
48:04
okay
48:05
good okay last question boy the time
48:07
just zips by
48:08
all right since you mentioned the jewish
48:11
uh
48:12
king of the jews the question has come
48:15
up several times
48:16
now today
48:19
are any jewish holidays celebrated in
48:22
heaven
48:22
ever and i'm going to add to that
48:25
and are any holidays of any kind either
48:28
known or unknown
48:30
celebrated in heaven oh they have
48:33
different events
48:35
that they have i would have to say uh i
48:38
can't use the word time
48:39
because i've learned in heaven you don't
48:40
even say the word time okay
48:42
events are some are already set in place
48:47
uh like they have special events when
48:49
somebody knew come home from heaven
48:51
and then they have some for different
48:53
things happening in heaven they have
48:55
events
48:56
they do absolutely um
48:59
practice the feast of tabernacles i know
49:01
i was there one time when they were
49:03
doing that
49:04
it's still a practice in heaven that be
49:05
not every feast is practiced not every
49:08
jewish
49:09
feast and i know people go well that's a
49:11
jewish tradition it was something the
49:13
father had
49:14
the father chose the jewish people to
49:18
represent him
49:19
the father gave the jewish people his
49:22
own
49:22
personal sign and symbol which is the
49:24
star people call it the star of david
49:27
that symbol is all over heaven it's on
49:29
these angels that are in the throne room
49:31
that worship
49:32
God it's on the throne room wall because
49:34
that is the father's personal sign and
49:36
symbol
49:37
it's something that represents him in
49:38
heaven and so when God
49:40
chose a people he didn't have anyone
49:43
here before when he chose a people to
49:45
represent him
49:46
he gave them his own personal sign and
49:49
symbol
49:50
and that signing symbol represents one
49:53
thing if you take that star and you take
49:56
it apart let's say here's a here's a
49:58
triangle
49:59
and here's one this one would represent
50:01
father son and holy spirit this one will
50:03
represent body soul and spirit
50:06
this represents mankind when you put
50:09
them together which he did right in
50:11
front of me in the throne room he said
50:12
this is
50:13
my dream it is us and man
50:16
forever as one and so for the first time
50:19
when he had the jewish
50:20
people represent him and he gave them
50:23
decrees and stuff that they had to
50:25
follow
50:26
in order to be counted righteous to
50:29
call them uh call God their God
50:32
and talk about the father uh that he had
50:35
their
50:35
guidelines they had to live by leviticus
50:37
is full of them
50:39
so anyway that's what that is it was his
50:41
he gave it to the people who would
50:43
represent him in the earth and yes
50:44
there's still precious
50:45
people to him and um so that's what that
50:48
is so
50:49
um your question is
50:53
yeah very much so and and you did say
50:55
one time that there is a christmas town
50:57
but you also have clarified over and
50:59
over there's no time so it's not like
51:01
the time goes around and it's time to
51:03
celebrate christmas
51:04
but anytime you want to go to christmas
51:05
town yeah celebrating that event
51:08
all the time all the time and one of the
51:10
reasons it's there
51:12
is because nicholas is there we could
51:14
get in all that
51:15
christmas is coming up i would
51:17
definitely do a broadcast
51:19
about that um on my facebook on
51:21
christmas day
51:22
but yes they celebrate the birth of
51:25
christ in christmas town okay
51:27
and how do they do they put stars on all
51:29
the trees
51:30
represent the star of bethlehem are on
51:32
all the trees in christmas town
51:34
it's the one place that snows all the
51:37
time
51:38
in christmas town but nicholas had a
51:40
gift back i think it was in the 4th
51:42
century
51:43
i think he was from turkey and he took
51:46
his own money and wealth he also
51:48
had a high position i think he was a
51:50
bishop
51:51
and he would tear up people with his
51:54
staff
51:55
if they defamed the name of christ
51:58
and they touched his sovereignty and his
52:01
holiness
52:02
they answered to saint nicholas okay he
52:05
wouldn't stand for anyone saying that
52:07
jesus christ was just a man he couldn't
52:09
stand that and yet in his heart he had
52:11
kindness for children
52:13
and he lived in the cold climate so
52:15
there's christmas town in heaven by the
52:18
way christmas means christ's mass is
52:20
still about
52:20
christ that's why that word's in there
52:22
don't go legalistic on me and
52:25
you know you're going to find out when
52:26
you get there anyway and so it's a place
52:28
you go
52:28
gifts are given to everybody jesus
52:30
spends a lot of time there designing
52:32
toys because guess what nick does nick
52:35
makes them he gives them out to all the
52:36
children who come to visit there people
52:38
go sleigh rides
52:40
you can go skiing because that's
52:43
something that you do if you were on the
52:45
earth and there was snow you're not
52:46
going to freeze to death
52:47
but it's it's a little bit colder there
52:49
than other places so
52:50
christmas town does exist and so does um
52:55
there's a place called wipeout where
52:56
it's like summer all the time and people
52:58
surf on 100 foot waves
53:00
and it's you know God has a way he
53:03
designed heaven
53:04
and he took his some four of his
53:06
favorite places
53:08
he said i took a shadow of them and put
53:10
them on the earth as a season
53:12
that's why we have the four seasons so
53:16
good Kat i wish we could keep going but
53:18
this is a longer one even than normal
53:20
but i wanted to get some more questions
53:21
in
53:22
so i would really want to encourage all
53:23
of you watching there's all those go to
53:25
youtube
53:26
go to elijah's streams on youtube and
53:29
you can see all of Kat's videos he's
53:31
made
53:31
every single one of them talk about
53:32
heaven they're all all
53:34
in the last month and a half whatever
53:36
it's been we've been talking about first
53:37
the election then we go mostly about
53:39
heaven
53:40
so i hope you enjoyed it can't remind
53:42
people how they can get to your two
53:44
websites or your two two places well
53:46
revealing heaven.com is about the
53:49
corporation i have uh we have a
53:51
commission from God
53:52
to reveal and create heaven on earth and
53:55
that's where our story is
53:57
you'll find all kinds of revelation we
53:59
have all kinds of products that
54:00
represent heaven on the earth
54:02
and i always show this to people this is
54:04
for example uh the holy spirit gave us a
54:06
way to talk against the darkness but not
54:09
bash people
54:10
and he said to create this it says i
54:12
don't do demons
54:14
and that makes it very there's a
54:15
lightning bolt that meant they were
54:16
kicked out of heaven right that's when
54:18
lucifer was kicked out of heaven and so
54:21
the holy spirit
54:22
designed this to represent when people
54:24
see it that means you don't partner with
54:26
the darkness that means you're not
54:27
tolerating or participating with satan
54:29
in any way whatsoever
54:31
and so that's the things that we create
54:33
things that you can hang on your walls
54:35
or things you can listen to
54:37
um we're putting more and more out a lot
54:39
more probably apparel will come up this
54:41
next year
54:43
and so whatever we put out there will
54:45
represent heaven uh being on this earth
54:48
and that's revealingheaven.com if you
54:50
want to get more spiritual revelation
54:52
you can go to KatKerr.com
54:54
which is a website that God had me he
54:57
said it's a spiritual platform where he
54:59
can freely speak about anything he wants
55:01
to
55:01
there's a lot of things that you can
55:03
watch and listen to and learn how to
55:05
live heaven culture on the earth
55:07
and it's the only place i always say
55:10
this i will
55:11
not send you things asking for money
55:14
uh there's other uh facebooks that are
55:16
not mine they're
55:17
called Kat Kerr and they'll probably
55:19
ask people to be
55:20
i don't even know how you do that that
55:22
to follow i guess
55:23
and then to give money for certain
55:25
things that's not real let's do that
55:28
calm if you want to give online that's
55:30
how you do it
55:31
not even on revealing heaven that's
55:33
where you can purchase things
55:35
but i did that God did that as a safety
55:37
measure so
55:39
people would know if you see a site let
55:42
us know you know
55:43
let us know email us and say you found
55:45
one and we're always having
55:47
the fake ones put down because we don't
55:49
want them asking for money
55:51
when it's not us usually they probably
55:52
keep it for themselves so
55:54
KatKerr.com and revealingheaven.com
55:58
and a public facebook page and a public
56:00
youtube page is what i ask
56:02
the public facebook is the the word the
56:04
the
56:05
theKatKerr it's got a blue check mark
56:07
you know that's her
56:08
because that means it's verifying so theKatKerr
those are the third
56:12

56:14
reminder that there's about 20 of us
56:15

01:39
oregon
01:41
i'm feeling much better today thank you
01:42
all for those of you who prayed for me
01:44
yesterday i was
01:45
quite under the weather probably should
01:47
have canceled but i didn't want to
01:48
cancel those
01:49
you know nate and christy but thank you
01:51
for those of you who prayed me
01:53
through it i appreciate it very much so
01:56
we are
01:56
in year 30 a year i'm sorry you're 23 of
02:00
bringing the voice of the prophets to
02:01
you
02:02
and we want you to be sure and let me
02:04
see if i can point
02:05
subscribe to the alliance list there if
02:08
you have not already so that if anything
02:10
happens we can email you and let you
02:12
know what's going on
02:13
also we send out daily uh emails
02:16
365 days a year we send out emails of
02:19
prophetic revelations so this is the tv
02:21
portion
02:22
of things we also have the written
02:24
portion which is if you subscribe there
02:26
you get that as well also be sure and
02:29
subscribe to the youtube channel if you
02:32
have not
02:33
um i think there's three different
02:35
buttons there's a subscribe button
02:36
there's a notification button and
02:38
there's another one i keep forgetting
02:39
that
02:40
what it's called but there's three
02:41
different ones it shows you at the
02:42
beginning of each broadcast it kind of
02:44
does walk you through that
02:45
but if for any reason we were to get
02:48
booted off
02:49
youtube we will go to rumble so remember
02:52
that
02:52
r-u-m-b-l-e like bumblebee only it's
02:55
rumble
02:56
and that's where we will go next if for
02:59
some reason they could
03:00
kick us off we hope they won't do that
03:02
we like youtube but
03:04
sometimes they kick people off so all
03:07
right without further ado let's bring in
03:08
kat Kerr here i know you all are looking
03:10
forward to her
03:12
coming here she is hey kat hi
03:15
how are you good to see you today yeah
03:18
it's great it's always great to share
03:20
with people so i'm excited
03:21
that's so good now you're slightly off
03:23
center but it probably doesn't matter
03:24
they can oh there you go that
03:26
that works good like that so perfect so
03:29
Kat we're we're at election time
03:33
we're in the middle of election the
03:34
election has not been decided yet
03:37
tell us anything you want to tell us
03:39
about the election before we get into
03:41
questions about heaven
03:43
well um the father spoke to me yesterday
03:46
and he of course is still saying trump's
03:49
winning
03:50
and you can't look at the normal way
03:52
things would
03:53
happen because we're talking about God
03:55
we're not talking about men or their
03:57
mindset or even their normal i guess
04:00
procedures they go through
04:02
so i am not moved by what the electoral
04:04
vote said i am not even moved by what
04:06
happens
04:07
in georgia uh when they have to do that
04:10
i'm moved by what God says and i do
04:14
want to say something because he's very
04:15
adamant about us making a stand
04:18
and keeping that stand and i know some
04:20
people have already backed up
04:22
you know what you can't just give up or
04:24
back up because things don't go
04:25
the way you thought they should this is
04:29
this issue with man and always has been
04:31
with God
04:32
when they think it's not going right the
04:35
way they thought it should
04:36
they think either God forgot he changed
04:39
his mind or maybe he wasn't sure about
04:41
what he
04:42
said i mean i know
04:45
it is i've laughed all day long a lot
04:47
about and God
04:48
actually is laughing but you need to
04:51
know he is making a list
04:53
he loves lists he has many books he
04:55
writes in but he told me to
04:56
say this he's taking note of who steps
05:00
back
05:01
especially in the christian leadership
05:04
especially
05:06
wow sobering well you know he has said
05:08
adamantly that he's setting us up
05:10
for the next 100 years between these 10
05:13
year
05:13
decades these two decades 20 30 and 30
05:17
20 40 he's doing some very major
05:21
changes to set us up to manifest and
05:25
demonstrate
05:26
supernatural signs and wonders and
05:28
during these 20 years will be some of
05:30
the greatest creativity and ideas and
05:32
with the ideas we've ever seen
05:34
God is not concerned with what the other
05:36
side is saying
05:37
he is still saying trump will sit in
05:39
that white house he purposed it back in
05:41
2015
05:43
was when he told me that would happen
05:45
and he said it would be for eight years
05:46
and he said i haven't changed my mind i
05:48
don't know why people are acting like i
05:50
have now this is from God himself
05:52
he said but i am making notes about
05:54
those who step back
05:56
who say they speak for me and those who
05:59
don't want to make a stand and believe
06:01
and trust me for what i have said
06:03
especially if they heard God say
06:05
trump would win he's not changed his
06:07
mind
06:08
something's supernatural it will
06:10
definitely be a suddenly
06:11
that he will do although it's okay to go
06:14
through the process he's not against the
06:16
process
06:17
or the normal procedures but he has said
06:20
since the 4th of november that the great
06:23
fraud would be exposed
06:25
and excuse me and justice would come
06:29
so guess what no matter what anyone
06:31
thinks or anyone's decided it's going to
06:34
happen
06:35
and so he is taking notes of those
06:37
especially in the body of christ in the
06:40
ministry and the leadership you better
06:42
pay attention
06:43
because God is serious whoever doesn't
06:46
step back
06:47
they will have the greatest time of
06:49
celebration of anyone else because they
06:51
stood
06:52
with him in this time trusting him no
06:55
matter what
06:56
happens they know what God has said will
06:58
happen
06:59
and when you obey and when you make that
07:02
stand and you
07:03
don't step back and you stay excited
07:06
great blessings and a broader
07:09
stronger platform will be given you to
07:11
speak for him
07:13
but but those who do not
07:16
stay and keep their stay in and they
07:18
back up and not do they just back
07:20
up they try to get others to agree with
07:22
them that the other side is one
07:24
he said they won't have a voice to speak
07:28
you know decades especially God has
07:30
always
07:31
bragged on scripture brags on abraham we
07:34
called the father of faith because he
07:36
believed
07:37
that even if he had to follow through
07:40
and and slay his son which God told him
07:43
to
07:44
do he knew God would if it need be God
07:47
would raise him from the dead
07:49
that's why he puts it all the way up to
07:50
that point and God brags on him to this
07:53
day we call him the father of faith
07:55
because
07:55
he he hoped against all hope that God's
07:58
word would be true
07:59
and we all know also that moses was
08:02
required
08:03
almost to do you know moses was required
08:06
to take uh the jews
08:09
on that long journey but the first part
08:12
of it was to cross the red sea
08:14
and so man here's a man we're talking
08:17
about a lot of people don't
08:18
understand moses i understand him a lot
08:20
but uh
08:21
he was raised right in egypt he was
08:25
raised as a royalty
08:26
in the egyptian household he had
08:28
privileges
08:30
he had authority he knew pharaoh he knew
08:33
his
08:33
um one of his best friends was you know
08:35
pharaoh's son
08:36
who entered by being fair in the time
08:39
when
08:40
he was tested and every time pharaoh
08:43
said no
08:44
we know what happened things came
08:46
against egypt
08:48
God delivered him but still and all that
08:50
he still had to lead them
08:52
knowing the egyptian army was coming so
08:55
here's
08:56
with over one million people probably
08:59
maybe two million but you need to
09:00
understand people
09:01
over women he had to take with him
09:03
encouraging them saying it's going to be
09:05
okay
09:06
God's delivering us out of egypt's hands
09:08
we're going to be set free and guess
09:10
what they took the silver and the gold
09:11
from egypt with them
09:13
so here they were taking the well
09:15
through their stand at the edge of the
09:16
red sea
09:18
and you know here is here's moses
09:21
waiting
09:22
to see what will God say and these
09:25
people
09:25
behind me begin to complain because
09:27
they're in great fear
09:28
see fear came it always comes when God
09:31
does something great
09:32
and you have to step out and stand in
09:34
faith look how long moses had to wait
09:36
before the red sea thing and then even
09:39
after the red sea
09:40
well sure is what when he told him what
09:42
to do
09:43
what happened here's the army after him
09:46
to take him out
09:47
or to drag them back and moses was
09:50
trusting God the whole time moses didn't
09:52
say i'm giving up and i'm running
09:54
he never said that he made his stand and
09:57
the miraculous happened and they crossed
09:59
on
10:00
dry ground not soggy ground
10:04
by land and here comes all the army
10:06
after them to slay them
10:08
and they get all the way to the other
10:09
side and God moves his hand and here
10:11
comes the cnn
10:13
to destroy the egyptian army which would
10:15
have taken out the jewish
10:17
you know would have taken them out and
10:19
he had to stand
10:21
this is one of those times and a lot of
10:22
people are relating it to at the very
10:24
same time
10:25
so in the bible when God was going to do
10:27
some major
10:28
changes or shifts for the better the
10:31
enemy always comes against you you
10:33
always try to bring fear you'll have
10:35
people that will argue with you
10:36
he will make fun of you none of that
10:38
matters to me
10:39
i'm going by what God himself has said
10:43
and he burying near future people
10:46
running into the streets and celebrating
10:48
because they were forced to say
10:50
trump won that's so good that actually
10:53
brings me into the question
10:55
uh it's on my list to ask you uh
10:59
about you know these are not all
11:01
questions about heaven or questions that
11:03
they hope you will know but but one of
11:06
the questions that's being asked is
11:08
what does it look like in heaven or in
11:10
the supernatural right now
11:13
is there a battle going on or is there a
11:16
bunch of activity in the heavenlies
11:17
where
11:18
fighting is going on between angels and
11:20
demons or what
11:21
what's going on or is it all just
11:24
peaceful
11:24
and the lord's laughing and that's all
11:27
oh no he is laughing because he already
11:29
he's seen the
11:30
okay he's been from the beginning to the
11:32
end he knows how this will end
11:34
heaven itself so i gotta gotta correct
11:37
that
11:37
heaven itself is not under attack heaven
11:40
itself is not warring but the armies of
11:42
heaven
11:43
certainly are okay doing
11:46
all kinds of things i myself send them
11:48
on assignment
11:49
it's our right as a joint ear with jesus
11:51
christ and i have sent them continually
11:54
not just in america but around this
11:56
world to
11:57
uncover every hidden lie
12:01
stealing lying deception
12:04
fraud all of it openly that it will be
12:07
known and seen
12:09
and as God said to say justice will be
12:12
given
12:13
justice has also been sent with the army
12:15
of heaven
12:16
and they're pulling down strongholds of
12:18
the demonic controlling the left
12:20
controlling all kinds of factors
12:22
involved with this
12:23
and uh they're not going to escape i'm
12:26
saying the fraud and the people
12:28
cheating alive they won't escape and
12:31
some actually ended by living a life of
12:32
crime because they said yes to the crime
12:35
you can't partake of the darkness and
12:37
think you can just get away with it
12:39
or or your life will just go back to
12:40
normal but i'm telling you the army is
12:43
busy
12:44
millions all over america uh millions
12:48
flooding washington dc in the senate
12:52
in the house in the supreme court
12:55
they're everywhere and they impact what
12:58
people say and do
12:59
uh they can release things of God into
13:02
these situations so let me tell you they
13:03
are totally
13:04
engaged with this whole thing
13:07
do help make sure that trump will win
13:11
in the end and justice will be brought
13:13
so they're very busy they're sent on
13:15
assignment everywhere
13:16
concerning the dominions regarding
13:18
protect evidence to expose more evidence
13:21
to have people begin to say things like
13:23
some people have the fear of the lord
13:25
come on them they begin to
13:26
they'll begin to squeal and yell louder
13:28
than you've ever thought
13:29
and i do know somebody high up i don't
13:32
know who it is
13:34
i don't know who it is but a lot of the
13:36
smaller individuals who did
13:37
crimes have already talked about it but
13:40
somebody higher up
13:41
will eventually give evidence
13:45
that no one can refute so i'm just
13:47
saying you hang in there
13:49
you celebrate because when you show God
13:51
you really believe him even the walls of
13:53
jericho i could go on and on
13:55
they celebrated every day did these
13:57
crazy things God said to do
13:59
it didn't matter where in the bible God
14:01
said do this
14:02
and it will be okay well he's evil
14:05
enough to stay in agreement with him to
14:07
celebrate the victory before it happens
14:10
call those things to be not as though
14:12
they already are
14:13
is what he's saying you're going to live
14:15
the scripture people and you're going to
14:16
see
14:17
great victory come out of it so
14:20
good now second question that's like
14:22
that
14:23
people several have asked this they said
14:25
Kat said that
14:27
the the angelic the spirit beings can't
14:30
really be
14:32
the people the angels on God's side
14:34
can't be hurt or
14:36
harmed so they're saying how then can
14:38
they fight
14:39
the demonic realm who are also spirit
14:42
beings
14:42
are they also not able to be harmed so
14:45
they're asking
14:46
how does that work there's a difference
14:49
on which side you're on
14:50
absolutely satan's army can be wounded
14:54
and they cannot be healed he tries to
14:57
patch them
14:58
and depending on what they're made out
15:00
of and what they're doing
15:01
but let me tell you i've seen them
15:03
wounded i've seen the missing eyes i'm
15:05
talking about satan's army
15:07
and every battle what happens with the
15:09
host with the army of heaven
15:11
don't you give up on what you sent them
15:13
for or believe for because sometimes
15:15
they have to turn around and go back
15:16
mine aren't going back i'm saying they
15:20
won't they will keep going and going
15:21
forward with what they have been
15:23
commanded to do they're an army they
15:25
need orders they don't
15:26
they don't take requests okay don't give
15:28
them a request you have to they have to
15:30
have orders
15:31
from headquarters and we are part of
15:33
that now since we're joiners with christ
15:36
but you can't step back and what you're
15:38
making is stand for it says if you step
15:40
back you're not
15:40
fit for the kingdom doesn't mean you
15:42
won't be sent into heaven
15:44
means that he can't use you like he was
15:47
using you
15:47
so whatever you don't don't step back
15:49
but yes the angels are engaged
15:51
and yes the enemy can be wounded i've
15:53
seen like i said before i've seen them
15:55
being dragged by
15:56
some of the army of heaven to
15:59
to be sentenced because of the in the
16:02
courts of heaven
16:03
and uh so all kinds of activity takes
16:05
place they're a real army they have real
16:07
courts in heaven
16:08
they have one in heaven itself one out
16:10
in space outside of heaven
16:12
and there's a lot of things you don't
16:14
understand but this is the thing
16:15
we trust God when he says something
16:19
and when let me tell you when eighty
16:21
percent of america
16:22
already believe trump is the winner
16:25
God is getting a lot of participate
16:27
participation from the moral majority
16:29
probably more than some of the christian
16:31
leaders
16:33
because they already know that they know
16:35
they know what is true
16:36
and they're not being influenced by
16:38
other people saying you need to give it
16:39
up they've already been through it all
16:41
this time they're not going to give up
16:42
our backup
16:43
but heaven's army they don't get wounded
16:45
they get weary
16:47
they have to go oh they do yeah the host
16:50
of heaven they'll get weary from
16:51
fighting sometimes if it's a long long
16:53
battle
16:54
the more you pray the stronger they can
16:56
fight
16:57
and that's the truth so don't stop
16:59
praying and believing
17:01
you don't have to beg God can you agree
17:03
with what he wants
17:05
and you encourage the army to keep
17:07
fighting
17:08
and because you know hell doesn't want
17:10
to let go the devil doesn't just want
17:12
the presidency people
17:14
he wants the world yeah oh he wants the
17:17
whole thing
17:18
hey now i remember you telling a story
17:20
about after jesus was
17:22
crucified he descended into
17:25
whatever we call it hell or where there
17:27
was a divide
17:29
and you said he some of the the evil
17:32
beings were
17:33
they were melted is that am i saying
17:35
that right they melt
17:36
some of them melted their part of it
17:38
right
17:39
[Laughter]
17:41
when jesus's spiritual body left the
17:43
cross he descended into abraham's bosom
17:45
or paradise
17:46
it was the same place it's where those
17:49
that God counted righteous
17:51
because they believed in him they didn't
17:53
go to hell
17:54
like abraham isaac jacob i mean i could
17:56
name all kinds of
17:58
before christ died on the cross before
18:01
he died
18:02
people didn't go up to heaven when they
18:04
died if they were if they were counted
18:05
as righteous
18:06
they were kept in abraham's bosom it's
18:08
in the middle of the earth
18:09
it's higher up than hell you can see to
18:12
the gates of hell from abraham's bosom
18:14
there's a great divide
18:16
uh and no one can cross over no one ever
18:18
crossed over
18:19
that was where hell was supposed to be
18:21
reside that's where the wicked
18:23
dead went but those that God counted as
18:26
righteous
18:27
it said when he when jesus went and
18:29
preached the gospel and he led
18:30
captivity captive that was when he
18:32
actually preached the gospel in
18:34
abraham's bosom
18:35
he went there preached the gospel when
18:37
he was done with that
18:38
he himself which was miraculous in the
18:42
south
18:42
crossed over to the gates of hell and
18:45
waited
18:46
no one had ever done that before here he
18:49
is you know
18:50
the son of God in his spiritual body and
18:52
he knew he had to go
18:54
there because he had to take back our
18:55
authority from satan
18:57
because adam had given it away and on
19:00
the third day
19:02
yes so christ had to wait there in hell
19:05
they came and took him they didn't do
19:06
anything to him in the beginning they
19:07
were afraid God would rescue him this is
19:09
absolutely
19:10
true and in colossians it's sad
19:14
you know on the third day christ stands
19:16
up and satan is ready to show off
19:18
in front of all his hierarchy he's
19:19
invited all of the
19:21
hierarchy the principalities and powers
19:23
off their thrones around the world
19:25
in the spirit realm so they could watch
19:28
they could see their leader torment the
19:29
son of God
19:31
all of this was all known by God that
19:33
this would happen
19:34
so christ stands up but right when they
19:35
were to start their own
19:37
show christ put a show on in hell and it
19:40
said he spoiled
19:41
principalities and powers forever and he
19:45
made a
19:45
show of it openly there's the show yes
19:48
he did melt some of the faces
19:50
fire came out of his hands he tore up
19:53
satan he took every gemstone off of him
19:55
God put on him
19:56
he took keys of hell death in the grave
19:58
away from him which was very significant
20:01
so he put a show on in hell they weren't
20:03
expecting that
20:05
and they will not be expecting this
20:07
great victory that's coming right now
20:09
there is going to be another show put on
20:11
in this earth
20:13
first it was God in heaven when he
20:14
kicked all them out when satan and one
20:16
third of the angels were kicked out
20:18
christ put the second show on in hell
20:20
when he took
20:21
absolute authority um because he had a
20:24
right to they can't keep a righteous man
20:26
in hell
20:27
and then he of course after he did all
20:29
that was when he ascended
20:31
back up into the tomb he got his body
20:33
back it was glorified
20:35
and after that was when the disciples
20:37
came mary came the stone was rolled away
20:40
so this is all revelation but it is
20:43
in the bible so let me tell you we're
20:45
about to have a great show put on
20:47
you better get your i love what they
20:48
said somebody sent out um
20:51
an image of of trump with some popcorn
20:54
and he said are you enjoying the show
20:56
you better get some more popcorn because
20:57
the second act is about to happen and
21:00
that is absolutely the truth
21:03
i remember you saying
21:06
i think it went back to 2012
21:09
God began to speak to you and you'd
21:12
correct me if i'm wrong but God said let
21:14
the show begin
21:15
was it am i saying the year right was it
21:18
about 2012
21:20
well he God will always announce things
21:22
several years before he does it
21:24
but i know that he got stronger much
21:26
stronger in 2014-15 he was having me say
21:29
that everywhere
21:31
okay and then he even had me say i
21:33
actually did a whole um
21:35
a whole meeting on let the show begin
21:38
and God said let the show begin
21:39
that was right uh before the elections
21:42
and all that stuff
21:43
started in 2016 and God did say
21:46
trump is part of the show that's so good
21:50
well i have a list of other questions so
21:52
let me go these are in
21:54
completely random order as they came in
21:56
and and my apologies to those who are
21:58
watching we have now
21:59
several hundred questions behind so we
22:02
just can't get to them all but i'm going
22:03
to get to as many as we can
22:05
but here the next question on my list is
22:07
what is it like in heaven on
22:09
jesus birthday
22:12
well you know most people in heaven they
22:15
celebrate
22:16
the day they came to heaven just so you
22:18
know that
22:19
people celebrate the the time that they
22:22
left this earth and moved to heaven
22:25
you're young again you're not old time
22:27
isn't really kept track of
22:30
time is measured by events and so the
22:33
event
22:34
of the birth of his son is celebrated in
22:36
heaven
22:37
they celebrate in christmas town and all
22:40
of heaven celebrates it
22:41
they do bring gifts to christ everybody
22:43
wants to give gifts to him anyway
22:45
they make sure he gets a hug and they
22:48
rejoice
22:50
over the fact that God was very
22:52
victorious and triumphant
22:55
and sending his son to be born to have a
22:58
body to have
22:59
authority in the earth you have to have
23:01
a body to have authority spirits can't
23:03
really rule without us allowing them to
23:06
or them using people to do that but in
23:09
heaven they certainly celebrate the
23:11
birth of christ
23:13
and everyone remembers the glorious time
23:15
they probably re-watch it because
23:17
there's ways that they've recorded
23:19
things in heaven everyone can re-watch
23:21
the whole birth
23:23
when the army of heaven had to come and
23:25
sing at the birth of christ
23:27
uh that was a sight to be seen when
23:29
gabriel came to announce it you know
23:31
this is the glory
23:33
outside the manger in the sky the glory
23:35
in the sky that happen
23:36
and they all love to see that especially
23:38
the army of heaven they love to see that
23:40
because they remember that was not easy
23:42
for them
23:43
uh they don't necessarily sing and
23:45
people think every angel sings
23:47
every angel is not a worship angel they
23:50
worship
23:51
but it really was it was required of
23:52
them to come and sing for his birth
23:55
and the army was the ones that were
23:56
chosen because the ones who got kicked
23:58
out
23:58
um were the ones that that lucifer was
24:02
over that 130 angels were kicked out of
24:04
heaven they followed
24:05
lucifer and a creative being instead of
24:07
the creator
24:08
but they certainly celebrate the birth
24:10
of christ
24:12
i keep being asked over and over can i
24:15
re-watch the one the angels came and
24:18
sang
24:19
bethlehem can i re-watch my birth can i
24:22
really watch what
24:24
life was like on the earth before i was
24:26
born can i re-watch
24:28
uh these events that jesus took place
24:31
can you can you do that
24:33
everything that ever happened in the
24:34
bible was all recorded so
24:36
everybody can watch any of that in
24:39
heaven they have certain places you go
24:41
to see it it's some it's amazing
24:43
you can even watch as a place called
24:45
creation lab you can go in and watch
24:47
God when he made the physical realm and
24:50
first
24:50
the plan is there and from there on you
24:52
can watch all the activities that happen
24:54
in the bible
24:56
but you yourself you
24:59
have your own theater and people can
25:02
come and see your life
25:03
from the time leaving heaven until you
25:06
were knit together in your mother's womb
25:08
until your birth
25:09
watch your life no sin is involved in
25:11
that
25:12
but all the silly fun things that you
25:15
got to do
25:15
growing up everyone can go and see that
25:18
and a lot of people love to do that so
25:19
yes God records things
25:22
he recorded like all these events going
25:24
on right now he's recording them
25:26
so make sure you're looking up at the
25:28
camera and smiling
25:31
okay now i keep being asked this
25:33
question over and over and i keep saying
25:35
i'm not going to ask this but i'm going
25:36
to go ahead and ask it
25:38
because people keep asking can we pray
25:41
people out of hell i don't know if this
25:42
is catholic doctrine
25:44
or why they're asking that but they want
25:46
to know if they can pray people out of
25:48
hell
25:49
i'm pretty sure i probably have a clue
25:52
about what they talk about as purgatory
25:54
there is no purgatory and i'll probably
25:57
have a lot of catholics argue that's
25:58
okay i love them anyway
26:00
they're going through what the
26:00
traditional one's always been tradition
26:02
has always been
26:04
however i'm not saying you can
26:06
necessarily you cannot pray people out
26:07
of hell that have been there for
26:09
you know a year five years ten years
26:11
that is not possible
26:13
but if you ever made a stand
26:16
for your loved one's salvation to know
26:19
christ
26:20
to not miss their destiny to be together
26:22
in heaven with jesus and you for
26:24
eternity
26:25
and to know him as their savior if you
26:27
make that stand
26:29
then christ can use the keys and i
26:31
rarely talk about this but
26:33
but i've been given permission by the
26:34
father if somebody asked
26:36
christ there's a reason why he took the
26:38
keys away from satan
26:40
it was was it hell death in the grave or
26:44
you could say
26:44
death the craven hell however you want
26:47
to say it doesn't matter what order you
26:48
put them in
26:49
those are three keys and they do
26:52
something and they were taken away from
26:54
satan so
26:55
he could no longer manipulate
26:59
those those are all about synchromens
27:01
increments of time
27:02
that they can be used and they were
27:04
never meant for him to have
27:06
and so christ took them when he was in
27:08
hell on the third day he took them back
27:11
and those keys because of our
27:13
declarations
27:14
we make over our family members give
27:16
christ permission
27:19
at the very time of death and you know i
27:21
forgive anyone who bashes me i'm sorry i
27:23
gotta say what the father has shown me
27:25
at the very time of their death before
27:28
they go anywhere step out of their body
27:31
christ has the right and permission to
27:33
meet with them and say do you want me
27:35
now
27:37
and then our testimonies given by people
27:40
around the world
27:41
before i even spoke about this um i knew
27:44
about it but i didn't really speak about
27:46
it in the beginning
27:47
where that actually happened to them
27:48
they were actually descending into hell
27:51
and jesus came and took them out and
27:53
talked to them and said because if your
27:55
mother's
27:56
prayers and her not giving up on you i
27:59
have to ask you
28:00
if you want me now these people know
28:02
that they're sinners they know that
28:03
they're
28:04
that they are uh condemned to hell
28:06
because of them not receiving christ
28:08
and so they have that moment that they
28:11
can make a decision
28:12
you can do that but you cannot go rescue
28:15
people
28:16
have been there for years that's just
28:17
not going to happen those are time
28:19
frames of
28:20
death when you right die uh
28:23
before you're in that grave and before
28:27
they've got you in hell
28:28
those are time frames sometimes they
28:30
happen at different
28:31
when there could be a few days within
28:33
there i just know this
28:35
you better be praying for your family
28:36
members now why
28:38
sure why are you about this it's not
28:40
something you want to argue about
28:42
it says if you declare and believe a
28:43
thing and do not doubt in your heart you
28:45
shall have whatsoever you say
28:47
and that means that you as family
28:50
members
28:51
are people who love these people like
28:53
family have the greatest authority in
28:55
the spirit realm when you pray so
28:58
instead of fighting with your unsafe
28:59
family members
29:01
tell them you love them but you're going
29:02
to pray for them don't get drawn into
29:04
fights or arguments
29:05
and then you separately go aside and say
29:07
God i'm making a stand for the salvation
29:09
of my family member
29:10
i do not want to see my dad in hell i
29:13
want my dad to
29:14
become a christian so i'm making a stand
29:16
for his salvation
29:17
in jesus name he'll he'll be a witness
29:20
and a testimony to the saving power of
29:21
jesus christ
29:23
that we will spend eternity together in
29:25
in heaven
29:26
and you make that stand and then i'm
29:28
sure after that happens the devil will
29:30
try to use that person you pray for
29:33
to be even meaner or nastier to you
29:36
because the devil is trying to make you
29:38
drop that declaration the bible says
29:41
what you dare to decree or declare
29:43
it will be what established unto you
29:47
so the devil would like to take your
29:48
words away don't let him
29:51
do that do you make a stand for your
29:52
family members and jesus said you will
29:55
be surprised to see who actually makes
29:57
it to heaven
29:58
it will be because of your prayers and
30:00
he said that to me the first time he
30:01
caught me up to heaven
30:03
you know and i i've told people on this
30:05
platform so this is not
30:06
secret i've said it several times you
30:08
know my father was extremely abusive
30:11
both to my sisters and to myself and yet
30:14
i know he's with the lord now
30:16
because we pray them in and in his case
30:20
he received the lord on his deathbed he
30:23
called for the pastor
30:24
he actually was a pastor but he wasn't
30:27
really a saved
30:29
man but he called for the pastor and got
30:31
his heart right
30:32
and i knew he went to be with the lord
30:34
and what people will need to understand
30:36
and maybe you can address this
30:38
when my father went to be with the lord
30:40
30 years ago
30:41
he left behind a big mess
30:45
and to this day it's a huge mess can you
30:48
talk about that for a minute
30:49
how about the person who's gone to be
30:51
with the lord
30:52
and you know there's that scripture that
30:54
says their works do surely follow them
30:56
well in a weird way my dad's evil works
31:00
are still following him on this earth
31:03
even though he's with the lord what
31:05
do you have any thoughts about that i'm
31:07
sure that he's probably up there
31:08
declaring
31:10
and believing that they will learn how
31:12
to lose all that stuff from their soul
31:15
the way the best way to break anything
31:17
that's affecting your life usually it's
31:19
trauma that you've been put through
31:21
because of a loved one
31:23
and usually it's the hardest i guess i'd
31:25
have to say the worst
31:28
hurt you'll ever feel now i have godly
31:30
parents my mom is still with me my dad
31:32
is in heaven but my dad was like my best
31:34
friend
31:35
he loved even his enemies and i'm
31:36
telling you he was slam bash trash made
31:39
fun of and you know what he actually
31:40
like it never happened
31:41
which is what bible says and it's hard
31:44
because you're hurting in here
31:45
and my dad didn't even know about losing
31:47
all that stuff from your soul so you
31:49
didn't have to carry it around with you
31:51
he made a decision i'm not going to be
31:53
used by the devil i'm not going to take
31:55
what he's saying i know he's using these
31:57
people
31:57
i'm going to choose to love anyway and
32:00
people who've been through that
32:01
i my my greatest prayer is they learn
32:03
about the keys to the kingdom
32:05
that what you loose on earth will be
32:07
loosed in heaven
32:08
that that that wicked thing that was
32:11
done to you or that harmful hurdle thing
32:13
that was done for you you don't have to
32:15
keep it inside of you
32:17
the word says that you can loose it you
32:20
lose it out of your soul
32:21
because what you experience what you
32:24
watch
32:25
what you hear what people say to you it
32:28
goes in the layers of your soul
32:30
and that's why you keep thinking about
32:31
it that's why the enemy
32:33
can use that trauma and he'll replay and
32:35
replay and replay it
32:37
you can stop that by not keeping it
32:40
inside of yourself but by losing all
32:42
those cares
32:42
all those hurts those wounds those
32:44
traumas those crushing
32:47
harmful words that keep you down
32:50
to keep you crushed in a whole God
32:52
doesn't want you to live like that
32:54
the bible actually says cast your care
32:56
upon christ because he cares for you
32:58
but you also can loose it from your soul
33:00
and then you
33:01
bind this is important you bind the
33:03
things of God can you imagine if you go
33:05
watch
33:06
extremely violent movies for 10 years
33:08
how much violence do you have inside
33:10
your soul
33:11
right you listen to profanity all the
33:14
time it's eventually going to come out
33:15
even if you don't swear because you're
33:17
storing it
33:18
you lose the junk out of your soul
33:22
and you jesus name and then you bind the
33:25
things of God
33:26
at any time in your life you can say i
33:28
bind God's love his
33:30
presence his purpose his will his way
33:33
his creativity you know what no one can
33:35
take that from you
33:36
so good you don't just
33:40
let the past go you let it out of you
33:43
you let it out of you then it's not in
33:45
there to bring you turmoil
33:46
and after you've done that if the enemy
33:48
tries to bring you back say no thanks
33:50
yeah that's good got it out i'm not
33:53
taking the junk back
33:54
i'm living my life for God and then
33:57
every day
33:59
every day when you get up you say father
34:00
i ask for grace for abundant life
34:03
and he'll send you fuel from heaven all
34:05
this changes you is called
34:06
heaven culture when you have a culture
34:09
you don't need to keep anything i don't
34:10
care if something happened to you
34:11
i have prayed with people that 30 years
34:14
ago
34:15
were horribly abused by
34:18
two or three different husbands because
34:20
the stuff
34:21
so they get rid of that when they find
34:23
someone else who's the same way
34:25
that's why people do that that's why a
34:27
criminal goes back to the same crimes
34:29
it's in here but in here you will think
34:32
about
34:33
you will choose and you will do it again
34:36
so get that stuff out
34:37
bind the life and the love of God to you
34:40
and then
34:41
you will be powerful you be victorious
34:43
and you will be free
34:44
the truth will make you free so
34:48
God never intended i have to add this
34:51
God didn't put you with somebody because
34:52
he knew you would be tormented he sent
34:54
you with somebody because it was a
34:56
purpose and a family line
34:58
that he was wanting to complete and he
35:01
chose you
35:02
to be that person he didn't make that
35:04
person wicked
35:05
they made their own choices
35:10
the enemy the enemy doesn't love any of
35:12
us he doesn't love even any of his own
35:14
so if you know people like that help
35:16
them to choose to loose that
35:18
junk out of their soul and and choose
35:21
christ
35:22
bind the things of God to the soul and
35:24
they're like
35:25
to me to people they say it's like it
35:28
never
35:28
happened to them that's so good now i
35:31
keep being asked this and this list and
35:33
i've got
35:33
here's i got a lot a lot of things here
35:36
you can't really see them out but
35:38
there there are at least three or four
35:41
questions that are the same question
35:43
they're saying
35:44
if i had a guardian angel which they
35:46
believed that they did
35:48
how then did it become possible for that
35:51
abuse to happen
35:52
or why did the guardian angel who's a
35:55
guardian
35:56
allow that i mean there's probably no
35:58
easy answer for this
35:59
uh i guess we're not looking for an easy
36:01
answer but what
36:02
what would you say to somebody who said
36:04
if i had a guardian angel why did he let
36:06
that happen
36:08
i think that they have boundaries that
36:10
they also have to keep
36:12
they can't number one they can't attack
36:14
people and i know a lot of people would
36:15
like for them to attack people
36:17
uh so there's boundaries set when
36:19
they're sent from heaven
36:21
on your behalf and i will say this when
36:24
the most important things that can
36:25
happen is for a
36:27
young person even your children
36:30
teach them right away about their
36:32
authority over the enemy
36:34
most people didn't even know they had
36:36
authority
36:37
and so a lot of them if they suffered
36:40
under that stuff they would run away
36:42
or they would try to escape in other
36:44
things when they got older
36:45
and yet God never intended them to go
36:48
through that so that wasn't God's
36:49
purpose
36:50
we we can pray for people to know God
36:54
and pray that they turn from what their
36:56
wicked ways which God talks about in the
36:58
bible
36:58
and yet their mind they have their own
37:01
mind their own will
37:02
and they choose all the time and
37:04
sometimes the reason just not that it
37:06
makes it any better
37:07
sometimes that happened to them and that
37:10
wasn't necessarily a family curse it's
37:12
something they experience that
37:14
eventually shows up in their life
37:16
make sure it doesn't show up in yours i
37:18
can say the best thing about all this is
37:20
you don't have to carry that stuff on
37:22
in your own life or with your own
37:24
children make sure you're
37:25
not doing that you can still bring glory
37:27
to God and though you've been through a
37:29
lot
37:30
you can still bring glory to God don't
37:33
walk around
37:33
beat up like no one cares about you
37:36
because God does love you
37:37
the angels have boundaries and there
37:39
have been times when they have just
37:41
rescued them completely and just taking
37:43
them to another place
37:44
or help them to get to other people for
37:46
help but because God made a decision
37:49
when he made man
37:51
will i control them or will i let them
37:54
make their own decisions and let them
37:56
choose their own life
37:58
he didn't want a bunch of robots we're
38:00
not robots
38:01
the angels aren't robots guess what the
38:03
angels had to choose too
38:05
and so we make our choices in the earth
38:07
and let me tell you
38:09
uh there's a lot of people that wish
38:11
they had done things differently
38:13
in heaven the thing about being in
38:14
heaven is no one has grief
38:16
and i know some people think that people
38:18
should suffer even though they receive
38:20
christ
38:20
but that is how far reaching the grace
38:24
is
38:24
if you repent like you never did it
38:27
that's why it's important to repent
38:29
because he couldn't let you come to
38:30
heaven
38:31
carrying all that stuff in you so if you
38:34
know people if you know children that
38:35
are under that attack
38:38
pray for them you send your army over
38:40
there to help on their behalf
38:42
because i know kids who are 10 and 8 who
38:44
are living in places like that that
38:46
aren't tolerating the acts of the enemy
38:48
and they have the army of heaven coming
38:50
to pull the demonic
38:51
away from their parents wow
38:55
if they were born in a time when this
38:57
was possible to know
38:58
and it will be well known one day that
39:01
they do have authority over the darkness
39:03
it says so if they're a believer i got
39:05
saved at age four and knew i was saved
39:07
and i learned early on that i didn't
39:09
have to tolerate the things the enemy
39:11
but also learned
39:12
i couldn't participate with him so yeah
39:15
it's this is a deep question
39:17
i don't even think it's theological i
39:19
think it's a life it's the way you live
39:21
your life
39:22
and what you choose to live and these
39:24
people who didn't repent for it i know
39:27
where they are and i've been to hell and
39:28
seen hell
39:30
and i'm telling you it's never worth it
39:32
to give yourself to the enemy and right
39:34
now it's not worth it either
39:36
so God can remove all of that like it
39:38
never happened to you
39:40
and just like the little babies who are
39:42
waiting on their parents and praying
39:43
that their parents make it to heaven
39:45
even if they aborted them they want
39:47
their parents so i always tell people
39:49
when i get a chance please repent of
39:51
that
39:51
and when you do die and go to heaven if
39:53
you repent receive christ
39:55
you get those babies back they're not
39:57
going to be angry they're not going to
39:58
be
39:59
going to be in love with you because
40:01
God's grace
40:02
it's all about his grace but he doesn't
40:04
control us like the devil wants to
40:06
control
40:08
God requires surrender but the devil
40:11
wants to control
40:12
and so you remember that now on
40:16
on a person i have several questions on
40:18
this Kat where someone has said
40:20
um either recently or in this list where
40:23
they
40:24
go you know i've forgiven everybody for
40:27
everything that i can think of
40:29
but i simply cannot forgive my father or
40:34
my mother
40:34
for what they did i just can't do
40:38
it talk about that for a minute what are
40:40
the consequences for that
40:42
i think you mean the one you mean not
40:44
being able to forgive
40:45
right yeah yeah the bible is very clear
40:49
about
40:49
and there there's a line and there's
40:51
always a line
40:53
in there it's not like if you're out of
40:56
anger or out of attack
40:57
if you say you've just done too much i
41:00
can't i can't handle the agony or the
41:02
suffering so
41:03
i'm not ever going to forgive you that
41:05
doesn't mean they'll stay in that place
41:07
God understands what they just went
41:08
through i think if they
41:10
died at that moment even when they went
41:12
to they would still go to heaven
41:14
if they knew christ or they had an
41:16
opportunity to receive him at their
41:17
death
41:18
i'm just saying that um there's a line
41:21
it's just the same thing with suicide
41:23
not everything is suicide sometimes it's
41:25
just ending your suffering not ending
41:27
your life
41:28
it's the same situation uh unforgiveness
41:31
is something that just moves in and
41:34
takes over you
41:35
and that your will then embraces so your
41:38
emotions can say things and you can even
41:41
think things but it has to be your will
41:44
you choose with your will to not forgive
41:46
and more people are not in unforgiveness
41:49
they're in suffering
41:50
they're in suffering and they're in
41:52
agony of what happened to them
41:53
they can't talk about it they'll hide
41:55
from those people they don't want to see
41:56
the face of those people
41:58
because it causes them pain and
42:00
suffering so i think only
42:02
God knows who has unforgiveness in them
42:06
and i tell people if you have it you
42:08
have to get rid of it
42:09
so what do you do you don't involve your
42:11
emotions
42:12
you're already in a turmoil about all
42:14
the stuff going on maybe some people are
42:16
still being
42:17
verbally abused by these people um i
42:20
would try
42:21
say try to limit your your time with
42:23
them
42:24
you know let them know you love them
42:25
you're praying for them but you don't
42:27
have to submit yourself to continue
42:29
abuse from them
42:31
but you can't go around you know who
42:34
you're making
42:34
happy the people don't care most of the
42:37
people don't care because if they're
42:38
already in a violent state their self
42:40
they don't care that you don't want to
42:41
forgive them
42:42
and uh you're hurting when you say those
42:45
words
42:46
but you don't want to let satan win
42:49
and end up with both of you
42:52
this is what you say it's always what
42:54
you say your words are so powerful um
42:58
your words are probable you just say God
43:00
even though my flesh
43:02
does not want to forgive them you say
43:04
these words
43:05
i choose as an act of my will to forgive
43:09
them anyway and in his name i'm trusting
43:14
you to line up my emotions
43:17
with the declaration i just made and
43:19
people will be shocked
43:21
you might have to say it more than once
43:23
if those saying things flow back again
43:25
you say it again
43:26
but you're not saying it from the
43:27
emotional turmoil you're not saying it
43:29
from your turmoil you're saying it your
43:31
will
43:32
what you choose with is what you will do
43:35
is what you will say
43:36
and i've helped many people get rid of
43:38
unforgiveness
43:39
and they will connect i'm choosing to
43:41
forgive because an act of my will
43:43
i know God doesn't want me to have
43:45
unforgiven so i'm
43:46
not keeping it i choose
43:50
to forgive my father whoever else that
43:52
my father my uncle whoever that was
43:54
that abuse you you say their name i
43:56
choose my will to forgive them in jesus
43:58
name
43:59
and God will go and write it down the
44:02
day you said that
44:04
that's good and you will begin to lose
44:06
the holy spirit onto that person
44:09
because when you have unforgiveness it's
44:12
almost like a chain
44:13
not just a soul tie a chain is formed in
44:16
the spirit which makes it almost
44:18
impossible because you're making this
44:21
i'll never
44:22
do this i hate them i don't want to do
44:23
this a chain is there it's not just
44:25
a soul tie which is almost like i would
44:28
say
44:29
it looks sort of like threads woven
44:31
together
44:32
that ties you together whether it's a
44:34
bad soul tie or a good one
44:36
it's so hard to break it when it becomes
44:38
that hardness of your heart gets in
44:41
there it looks like a chain
44:42
a solid chain you don't want that to
44:44
happen choose what you will
44:46
to to forgive the people forgive the
44:48
company who took your
44:50
job away forgive people who are ugly and
44:52
hateful to you
44:54
say it as an act of your will and God
44:56
will make sure he begins to do
44:57
something on the soul and the soul that
45:00
person
45:01
you the only way that this the other
45:03
thing's important you may be the only
45:05
reason they ever get to heaven
45:07
if you don't hold something against them
45:10
it gives God the right to pursue them
45:14
that's really good now someone's
45:16
actually several people
45:18
have brought up the situation and they
45:19
said i know family
45:21
is so important to God and i've now
45:24
forgiven
45:25
this person or persons am i
45:28
now because family is so important am i
45:31
now supposed to be spending time
45:33
with those family members that did that
45:38
that's the question i will tell you this
45:40
if they're still abusing you know
45:43
even though you've forgiven them they
45:45
may not have changed at all like i said
45:47
before spend limited time with them
45:50
you can let them know that you love them
45:52
but you can also let them know that
45:53
you're praying for them
45:55
i'm not saying you go back to them now
45:57
that you've done that so you can get
45:59
abused again
46:00
don't do that good God didn't ask us to
46:04
come to this earth
46:05
and to have to put up with abuse he did
46:10
good things and great things for us
46:12
don't stop praying for them
46:14
but until you see a a noted change in
46:17
them
46:18
let them make the effort you're not
46:21
holding anything against them
46:22
send them a gift send them a card let
46:24
them know you still care but
46:25
you do not have to go before them all
46:27
the time continually so you can be still
46:29
beat up
46:30
that's really really really good okay
46:32
one last question we'll keep it on the
46:34
light note
46:35
some kids want to know because my
46:37
children want to know how
46:38
noah built the ark if there was no heavy
46:42
machinery in that day i don't know if
46:45
you would know the answer to that
46:46
he he gave noah so much revelation
46:51
that he actually developed things that
46:54
we didn't even have yet in that time and
46:57
you know he's done that more than once
46:58
in the earth by the way he's given
47:00
greater revelation even now he does that
47:01
some people just get great revelation
47:04
they're called inventors or creators and
47:06
noah had devised a system that God gave
47:09
him because
47:10
you know it took him a hundred years 100
47:13
years to build that ark
47:16
and and and the whole time he was
47:18
building it he was being
47:19
laughed at by the wicked people who said
47:21
it never rained
47:22
let alone flooded before they were
47:24
making fun of him all the way up to
47:26
when the ark doors were closed but he
47:29
had revelation on
47:30
how to shift weight and what to use to
47:32
shift the weight of
47:34
the beams and stuff that he would need
47:36
to be placed in there
47:37
and of course his sons were there to
47:39
help so i would have to say
47:42
he didn't have help from the nephilim
47:45
uh please don't watch the movie the new
47:48
movie was made a few years ago the shows
47:49
you know noah had help from the nephilim
47:51
the great giants came and helped him no
47:53
they didn't do that
47:55
it was by effort alone that God asked
47:58
him to do that and when he
47:59
asked you to do it he gives things that
48:01
you need he might not give to other
48:03
people
48:04
in this situation but he absolutely was
48:06
successful
48:07
and it is about shifting weights and
48:09
balances my dad used to build so i
48:11
understand that
48:13
the most ordinary person might not but
48:15
he was successful and this is the thing
48:18
let up even under all the barrage so
48:22
that's so good hey Kat tell people how
48:24
they can get a hold of your website you
48:26
got a couple of websites tell us
48:28
tell them how to get ahold of them
48:30
heaven.com which is the name of my books
48:32
and that was just the most convenient
48:34
one to pick if you go to
48:36
revealingheaven.com you find out about
48:38
events you find out about all the
48:39
products we have that represent heaven
48:41
reveal heaven
48:42
or we have things that ideas like such
48:45
as this it says i don't do demons
48:47
there's the copper
48:49
that cop that lightning bolt reminds the
48:51
when they were kicked out of heaven on
48:52
lightning bolt so
48:54
you know we we don't necessarily want to
48:56
make things to bash people
48:57
we don't mind bashing the enemy and
48:59
reminding you he's already lost
49:01
so you can go and find out that kind of
49:03
stuff or you can go to KatKerr.com
49:06
and find out more revelation you can
49:08
find out declarations to make for your
49:10
family
49:11
over all kinds of things and that's
49:13
God's spiritual platform to say what he
49:16
wants to
49:16
when he wants to and it's the only way
49:20
if you choose to give to me
49:22
uh you may go there to KatKerr.com and
49:25
uh
49:25
i don't have any other place out there
49:27
so if you see other facebooks and say
49:30
Kat Kerr this can't create that and
49:31
they're asking for money that is not me
49:35
that's good good you know ken thank you
49:37
so much
49:38
this has just been amazing i learned
49:40
every single time i
49:41
i can't wait to hear the answers a lot
49:43
of these questions i wouldn't have asked
49:45
myself because i thought well i don't
49:46
know if i really want to know that
49:48
but every single time i do ask it i
49:50
think i learned something so thank you
49:51
so much for being such a great teacher
49:53

49:55

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE! - Episode 8
by ElijahStreams Jan 6, 2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4jRcZ0YDJI
or https://youtu.be/V4jRcZ0YDJI

01:38
well hello it's steve schultz here with
01:40
the elijah list it's good to hear
01:42
you or see you it's wednesday if you're
01:45
down under it's thursday
01:47
but we're here talking january 6. this
01:50
is that big event day
01:51
in washington dc if you're in the united
01:53
states and
01:54
both houses of uh the congress the
01:57
senate and the
01:58
house are meeting together to talk about
02:01
this election so we'll talk a little bit
02:02
about that with kat
02:04
it's good to point out to you all that
02:06
uh generally speaking
02:08
almost never including today i don't
02:10
talk to kat
02:11
ahead of time about what she's going to
02:13
say what remarks she has
02:15
what stance she still holds or doesn't
02:18
hold
02:18
anything like that we just take it as it
02:20
comes and so
02:22
um that keeps it kind of cleaner so you
02:24
know we're not in the back of the
02:26
saying what should we say today so i'm
02:28
about going to be just as
02:31
interested as you are in what Kat has to
02:33
say today we're
02:34
really in crucial times uh some may
02:37
remember that chuck pierce is prophesied
02:39
that we won't know the answer
02:41
until january 18. we won't know who
02:45
or what specifically and his dates have
02:47
been quite accurate
02:49
sometimes you don't quite know what you
02:51
will see on that date
02:52
that you know something really
02:54
significant that you can point your
02:55
finger will happen on that date related
02:57
to that issue so
02:59
these are going to be really interesting
03:00
times be sure to subscribe to our
03:03
youtube channel so far they have not
03:05
kicked us
03:05
off so we still like them as long as
03:07
they like us
03:09
on the youtube channel you just go to
03:11
youtube
03:12
and then under the search box type
03:14
elijah streams either as one word or two
03:17
words
03:17
it will pull us right up there's a way
03:19
to subscribe
03:20
there's a red button that says subscribe
03:23
um
03:23
to the left of that there's a thumbs up
03:25
just hit the thumbs up
03:27
hit the subscribe and then there's a
03:29
bell to the right which says you want to
03:31
be notified
03:32
when something comes on from us so
03:35
okay what else do i want to say we are
03:36
in year 23 of bringing you the voice of
03:38
the prophets and
03:39
uh 2021 is going to be extremely active
03:42
no matter
03:43
how this stuff goes and turns out
03:45
there's going to be a lot of fresh
03:46
revelation
03:47
that's coming to you so don't expect
03:50
that once this whole thing's decided
03:51
that things will slow down they'll
03:52
probably speed up
03:55
i think that's probably on what i have
03:57
to say on my list today
03:59
be sure and tell your family and friends
04:00
about us and
04:02
so without further ado let's bring Kat
04:04
online here on the table see if the horn
04:06
is on
04:07
and there she is
04:10
good to see you Kat people should know
04:13
you
04:13
we can see you but you cannot see if
04:15
you're just looking into a camera so
04:17
yeah i accidentally interrupt you one
04:19
time is because you don't see me opening
04:20
my mouth
04:22
so well here you are on january 6th and
04:25
i
04:26
asked jen about two minutes ago before
04:28
you came on
04:29
has has Kat looked at the things that
04:31
were going on
04:33
on tv and she said no not really she
04:36
doesn't
04:37
so i i kind of like that because it
04:39
means you're not
04:40
looking at the news and reacting to the
04:43
news whatever you're going to say
04:45
is going to be what you say not related
04:47
to the news is that about right
04:49
that is correct it's only what God says
04:51
that i respond to
04:54
sounds good well without further ado
04:55
then let's go ahead and whatever you
04:56
want to say
04:57
in relation to the elections and where
05:00
we are today
05:01
the floor is yours okay
05:09
that works as good as uh doing right now
05:13
i am wearing heaven's colors today these
05:15
are revelator colors you see the
05:17
eyes that represent the living creatures
05:20
around the throne of God
05:21
no one up there is in travail no one up
05:24
there is in fear
05:26
they already know what the outcome is
05:28
going to be this is the outcome
05:30
[Applause]
05:32
hey karen you don't know this you don't
05:34
know this but you said you told me once
05:36
the heavens colors
05:37
was teal was kevin's favorite color
05:39
during picked out a teal
05:40
shirt for me today and a child that has
05:42
teal we
05:44
pretty much match and we didn't know
05:46
this that's kind of the way God works
05:48
with prophetic people these things are
05:50
just regular
05:51
everyday things but they fall into place
05:53
just like God wants them to so
05:55
and he's absolutely right there is
05:57
nothing pre-planned except that i come
06:00
and sit in this
06:01
stool at my media desk if you
06:04
are hearing from God all the time if
06:06
you've been to heaven so many times you
06:08
lost count
06:09
and so i i hear God every day talking
06:12
about this
06:13
why would i watch the news
06:16
with fear with assumptions with um
06:19
lies we know that already and i won't
06:22
say this
06:23
we will have a new network that people
06:26
can
06:26
trust and so i'm not sure when that will
06:29
happen if God
06:30
gives me a date then i will give you
06:32
that date but i can tell you this
06:34
trump is one he already has one and God
06:38
keeps reminding that don't say that he
06:39
has to
06:40
he hopefully he'll win God said he has
06:43
won
06:44
and so he has one and everything is
06:46
going to be revealed and like chuck
06:48
peter said he has a date that's great
06:50
usually God will tell me this is going
06:52
to happen then he shows
06:54
me it happening and i don't mean it
06:57
happening
06:58
why would i be moved by anything out
07:00
there and if you're standing with God by
07:02
the way he said
07:04
keep standing don't lose your stand
07:07
don't step back don't get in fear don't
07:10
get in doubt
07:11
the enemy wants you to be there the
07:13
enemy controls by fear and obviously
07:16
so does the left i only hear things
07:19
every now and then if my staff mention
07:21
something
07:22
but actually none of them are allowed to
07:24
even talk to me about anything
07:25
from any source of news media or
07:28
anything or any other people out there
07:31
i'm not allowed to listen to it God
07:33
wants me to have
07:34
none of that in the layers of my soul so
07:37
he can feel me what he has to say
07:39
and what he shows me and then there's no
07:42
cloudiness in there okay what you get
07:44
is straight from the throne of God and
07:47
they are celebrating in heaven why
07:50
because
07:51
one and you may not see that in the
07:53
natural but everything happens in the
07:54
spirit
07:55
first okay it's not the other way around
07:58
things happen in the spirit first and
08:01
then that impacts
08:02
this natural world and when you say when
08:05
you say
08:06
that that God shows you he takes and
08:09
shows you what happened
08:11
this can you describe what you what you
08:13
mean what did you
08:14
see in either your natural eyes or your
08:17
spiritual eyes what did he
08:18
show you specifically when i say he
08:20
showed me i don't mean he gave me a
08:22
vision
08:22
i don't mean he gave me a dream i mean
08:24
he took me
08:26
into the future that may be word to you
08:30
why it happened in the bible it happened
08:33
in the old testament
08:35
i know that john the beloved was shown
08:38
things from the past and he was showing
08:40
things from the future
08:41
what about revelations what do you think
08:43
that word means a revelation comes from
08:46
the heart of God
08:47
it does not come from the mind of man it
08:50
doesn't come from something that's been
08:52
written down
08:53
unless somebody got revelation and they
08:55
wrote that down
08:56
so revelation is from God himself he is
08:59
sitting on his throne
09:00
jesus christ is right there next to him
09:02
and
09:03
millions and millions i could say
09:05
billions of angels especially the army
09:07
has been
09:08
sent here and right now for all of you
09:10
who are in dc
09:12
there are actually this is going to be
09:14
really something you there are 50
09:16
billion angels there
09:18
wow not million not million nobody has a
09:21
number oh you know i don't think God's
09:23
given anybody a number of how many exist
09:25
i just know that God has a whole lot
09:28
more than
09:29
than what lucifer God or satan controls
09:31
that's why he has to use people
09:33
okay satan controls people and when he
09:35
finds a group of people he goes wild
09:38
this is a thing i have learned about
09:39
satan when he
09:41
thinks he's one he gets very sloppy
09:45
he gets beyond bold he gets crazy and
09:48
he will begin to make those people that
09:51
he has
09:52
influenced and have convinced
09:55
through fake news media and other
09:56
sources he has convinced them
09:59
no matter what the evidence is against
10:01
them
10:02
that he has got satan has convinced him
10:04
they've won and so they'll start saying
10:06
crazy things they would never say
10:08
in public they would never say uh to a
10:10
news source
10:12
and i do know that some of that stuff is
10:13
happening just crazy stuff that they're
10:15
they're making up
10:17
and they've already got all their plans
10:18
made guess who has
10:20
plans God in heaven
10:23
and you know you heard the gavel the
10:25
last time
10:28
okay God is definitely bringing justice
10:31
he doesn't change what he says
10:34
when the bible says there's no shadow of
10:36
turning that means several different
10:38
things that means he's not
10:39
changing his mind he chose america
10:43
for himself and on in 2016
10:47
he actually came and laid his hand his
10:50
entire hand
10:51
on this country and he said i'm going to
10:54
turn america
10:55
red that's what he said i'm taking for
10:58
myself
10:59
for the next 24 years i will be allowed
11:02
permitted and welcomed into the white
11:04
house so let me tell you do you think
11:06
because of all this rabble
11:08
and all this stuff going on do you think
11:10
he changed his mind
11:12
do you think he can't make things happen
11:14
go back and read your bible
11:17
some of the greatest days of celebration
11:18
and when i said he
11:20
showed me he took me forward in time
11:23
not it wasn't a long time forward in
11:25
time and he showed me
11:27
when that announcement is made that
11:30
trump
11:30
is the 46th president of the united
11:32
states and that announcement
11:33
will be made i'm not saying it'll be
11:35
made today you know that doesn't move me
11:37
right
11:38
it's okay the due process and what we
11:41
feel like
11:42
we have to do or what the courts feel
11:44
whoever says
11:45
they're not greater than God he showed
11:47
me people
11:48
running out of buildings in towns and
11:51
cities
11:52
and all over not just america and they
11:55
were shouting and they were blowing
11:57
these silly horns so if you can find
11:59
left over in clearance somewhere you go
12:01
get some
12:02
you will need it i saw people
12:04
celebrating they were grabbing and
12:05
dancing
12:06
they were laughing out loud not in just
12:08
america but around the world
12:11
you may not know this but if you think
12:13
God is going to ignore
12:15
prayers from this world that are for his
12:18
plans he's
12:19
not ignoring that he already had the
12:21
plan
12:22
but when people come into agreement for
12:24
what God wants which is
12:26
justice righteousness liberty in freedom
12:29
there's a great celebration in the
12:31
spirit realm in heaven
12:33
there's terror in hell and i can tell
12:35
you
12:36
hell is terrified and even if they don't
12:39
say it
12:40
God has told me some of the hearts of
12:42
some of the left terror
12:43
is about to overtake them wow some of
12:46
them already realize they're not going
12:48
to get away with it see they can't show
12:50
that
12:51
but they're about to tell it so let me
12:53
tell you i
12:54
really am here to encourage you and i
12:56
will be coming on myself
12:58
later on today several times a day just
13:00
to encourage everybody in dc
13:02
anybody who wants to listen uh God will
13:04
keep saying things throughout this day
13:07
he knows that people are there he knows
13:09
they're there to pray to declare to
13:11
worship
13:12
and let me tell you it delights his
13:14
heart
13:15
and all the hosts that are there can
13:17
hear that they're probably dancing right
13:19
now
13:20
so you have to go beyond what your
13:22
natural eyes see
13:23
or your ears here and really understand
13:27
that if you belong to God he has number
13:30
one
13:30
not appointed you under wrath he has not
13:33
appointed you to even be here
13:35
in the harsh times when they do come
13:38
i've been taking
13:39
over 100 years into the future literally
13:41
caught up and taken
13:42
to that time and the tribulation had not
13:45
happened the perilous times had not com
13:47
y we've been living in some of the
13:50
greatest
13:50
days the earth has ever seen and that's
13:52
what is about to happen right now
13:55
God is literally exposing it all
13:58
so he can clear that platform and
14:02
set in place the ones he trusts and the
14:05
ones he's going to use
14:06
in these days to be great for him
14:09
so kick fear out get your celebration on
14:14
get ready for one of the biggest
14:15
celebrations the world has ever seen
14:18
and actually the father told me last
14:21
night because i'm always up late at
14:22
night
14:23
he said this will be one of the biggest
14:24
celebrations
14:26
that has happened since christ went into
14:29
hell on the third
14:31
really stood up in hell and wasted the
14:34
principalities and powers in front
14:36
of satan and stripped the gems off of
14:40
satan and took the keys to hell death in
14:41
the grave away
14:43
the greatest that was the greatest
14:44
horrific thing that could have happened
14:46
well they're about to get really really
14:50
hard
14:50
and their plans will become dust
14:55
so keep that in your heart no matter
14:57
what you see here here today
14:58
God said don't start shooting people
15:03
i know all you read next this message is
15:06
your God the God he made you redneck and
15:09
all
15:10
don't shooting people to think that you
15:14
can change and
15:15
handle it yourself
15:18
you say this though he isn't saying you
15:20
can't protect yourself
15:22
right not against america having guns
15:26
and having weapons to defend themselves
15:28
i can tell you the hosts have weapons
15:30
right
15:31
yeah they do military oh go ahead steve
15:34
no no that was good
15:35
i i i was saying i'm gonna say i have a
15:37
couple sons and laws that i love very
15:39
much
15:40
you can only have two and they they're
15:42
both great they both are gun
15:43
toting bible bible quote and gun toting
15:47
you know and uh one of them lives on 80
15:50
acres i think i live on a big spread
15:52
with 20 acres
15:53
he lives on 80 acres you know and he's
15:56
like he's a farmer and he works
15:57
also for a major oil company they're
16:00
very successful
16:01
and our oldest daughter is married to
16:03
him but you know
16:05
the guys they you know they're comparing
16:08
they
16:09
they're blowing my mind the other day
16:11
the two sons-in-laws and they copy me
16:13
which is fine i like being part of the
16:16
company on what they want
16:17
you know they went and got ammo they
16:19
don't really expect to be in the war but
16:21
they want to be able to protect
16:22
themselves
16:23
yeah and you know what i was saying
16:25
would show me something and i'd say well
16:26
you know be careful don't
16:28
feast on the violent fights that you see
16:30
breaking out here and there
16:32
don't feast on that i said maybe i need
16:34
to be a little more aware
16:35
but you probably need to be a little
16:36
less aware you go yeah you're probably
16:39
right so you know
16:40
you're a good guy he's a good guy you
16:42
know no i
16:43
have i have generations of family
16:46
members that were in the military
16:48
probably every branch of the military
16:50
and of course even my husband the
16:52
marines and let me tell you he's a tough
16:54
guy he doesn't say much
16:55
yes he packs heat my husband packs guns
16:59
he he does no matter where we go he's
17:00
licensed to carry
17:02
and guess what so is margaret okay my
17:05
gun
17:05
wow i have the biggest guns of all
17:08
they're 150 feet tall
17:10
and i have many of them around me who
17:13
they actually have
17:14
orders from headquarters to take anyone
17:17
down that if they think that they're
17:18
going to touch me
17:19
and that's not bragging that's telling
17:22
you the truth
17:23
so God said i would not even be allowed
17:25
to pray for mercy for someone
17:27
who thought that they would hurt me so
17:30
the guns
17:30
i have and that i carry with me you
17:34
can't see
17:34
them but the enemy your spiritual enemy
17:38
my spiritual enemy he can see them
17:40
and anyone is an army from heaven you
17:43
have the same
17:44
ones around you and God's day
17:47
is changing things to be more
17:49
spiritually aware
17:51
but powerfully spiritually aware of who
17:53
you are in jesus christ
17:55
i'm not saying any of this outside of
17:57
him i'm saying it's because of what he
18:00
said i give you power over all the power
18:03
of the enemy
18:04
but you rule in the spirit realm which
18:06
then impacts greatly what goes on in
18:08
this natural realm and if you think i've
18:10
been sitting in a corner somewhere
18:12
reading a nice little book you're very
18:14
wrong
18:15
i rule all night i take my staff and go
18:18
in the middle of the road at three a.m
18:20
it's my birthday and i send that army
18:23
everywhere and let me tell you they've
18:25
had a lot of activity
18:27
and no one will escape being exposed
18:31
so just rest assured even though it may
18:33
not come up the way you thought it would
18:34
or you wanted it would
18:36
doesn't mean that something is going to
18:39
it's not going to happen it
18:40
will happen and i saw victory already in
18:43
the streets all over this world
18:45
it's going to happen that's so so good
18:48
so so so good such good news you know
18:50
and i i have a little bit obligated to
18:53
see
18:53
some news but it's it's the least amount
18:55
of news i've ever watched but
18:56
because we do nike christian news i have
18:58
to be a little bit aware but
19:00
um but you know i i keep turning it off
19:03
and turning it off
19:04
and my relationship with the lord keeps
19:06
growing so there's a direct relationship
19:08
are you ready for some questions about
19:09
heaven oh yes i am i'm just so excited
19:12
about everything else
19:14
go ahead go ahead well if there's
19:16
anything else you want to add be sure
19:17
and do it is there anything else you
19:19
want to say about
19:21
where we are right now there was one new
19:23
revelation God gave me yesterday yeah go
19:25
for it
19:26
go for it say God i'm talking about the
19:28
father
19:29
you know he trained his son correct and
19:32
he does still train the father does
19:34
train he trains his
19:35
sons and daughters and uh when you go
19:38
home to heaven you go home as his son
19:40
and his daughter
19:41
and so he doesn't ever stop that
19:43
relationship of being our father
19:45
but if anybody knew anything it would be
19:48
him
19:48
and when we line up with God's plans
19:50
then we're covered
19:52
but he was talking to me about the keys
19:54
to the kingdom and i
19:55
rarely ask him a question people say ask
19:58
him this i'm not going to do it
20:00
he fills me with revelation okay and if
20:03
i have a thought or something that maybe
20:05
i may say it just briefly like like
20:08
yesterday i was saying
20:10
is there anything else that i don't know
20:12
about the keys to the kingdom
20:13
that would give us power in ways we
20:16
don't understand
20:17
good question this was the father's
20:19
answer
20:21
what you will allow to happen on the
20:24
earth
20:24
i will allow but what you will not
20:28
allow i will not allow
20:32
he said that is part of the keys to the
20:33
kingdom that you have authority
20:36
and my son gave you those keys this is
20:38
for all believers he gave you the keys
20:40
to the kingdom
20:42
how valuable was that kingdom the
20:45
greatest value of anything
20:46
in the earth in existence is the kingdom
20:48
why that's where your power is that's
20:50
what your authority is
20:51
and he said you need to start saying i
20:54
will no longer
20:55
tolerate the lying cheating stealing
20:58
witchcraft
20:59
violence illegal activities in
21:03
my government i won't tolerate it i no
21:07
longer will allow it to take place
21:09
in jesus name that is my ruling and that
21:12
is what i have to say about that
21:15
what you dare to declare he will match
21:18
your declaration
21:20
so instead of running around saying all
21:22
this other stuff especially those in dc
21:25
you make sure you're saying that you can
21:26
point right at the capitol wherever you
21:28
want to point at
21:29
you make that declaration your words
21:32
have
21:33
power they have power in the spirit
21:35
realm but also in the natural realm
21:37
and guess what will happen fear will
21:39
begin to fall
21:40
on all those doing those things if we
21:43
don't
21:44
stand up standing up and not moving
21:46
doesn't mean you're being
21:47
silent that means you're making a ruling
21:51
because you're
21:51
kings and priests unto your God
21:55
those rulings are heard all the way into
21:57
heaven they will begin to
21:58
impact all those people doing that
22:01
because you are saying no
22:05
and that's those are spiritual words
22:06
they're like missiles
22:09
you're releasing from yourself because
22:12
we were made in the image of God so this
22:15
is a brand new revelation and i have
22:17
never shared that anywhere before is
22:20
still using the keys to the kingdom you
22:22
operate in the kingdom
22:23
you rule in the kingdom so you make sure
22:26
you're saying that
22:27
if someone says what's going on i'm not
22:29
tolerating that happening
22:31
satan's not taken my country it belongs
22:34
to God and i'm agreeing with him
22:37
so so good so good yeah there
22:41
there's the justice thing and by the way
22:43
uh you know about sending out the host
22:44
which you talked about
22:46
you know i learned that from you a few a
22:48
month or so ago
22:50
we had a breach and we never have anyone
22:52
that breaches our security we don't
22:54
really have much security
22:55
there's a gate but and you should have
22:58
seen take off after
23:00
you know sending the hosts out to
23:01
protect that not another thing has ever
23:03
happened since then
23:04
i mean i sent host around every you know
23:08
place in the gate on the gate around the
23:10
gate around the property
23:12
you know on the neighbor's property
23:13
around the county you know i was just
23:15
placing you know i didn't want
23:17
anything close to you if you have
23:20
invited heaven's army
23:22
to be your body your mighty weapon they
23:25
are mighty to the pulling down of
23:26
strongholds that's
23:27
in the spirit realm you post those hosts
23:31
around you on your property when you go
23:33
somewhere
23:34
you ask them to do traffic control and
23:36
you'll never have an accident i know we
23:39
live that way when you're going on a
23:41
trip send them to take the plane send
23:43
them in the airport send them where
23:44
you're going
23:45
and i started flooding dc two days ago
23:50
with the army of heaven to keep people
23:52
from being
23:53
harmed now i can't control the flesh and
23:56
if people get in the flesh
23:57
[Laughter]
23:59
just repent for getting in the flesh but
24:01
if you already do command and army and
24:03
there's actually millions of people that
24:05
do
24:05
and you can shake your heads all you
24:06
want to why argue you want to die
24:09
no i'm sorry not a joke though it's not
24:11
a joke in this day
24:12
because you can see the darkness getting
24:14
stronger but it will never be greater
24:16
than the light or glory of God that's in
24:18
you but part of our weapons is that army
24:21
from heaven and they will fight for you
24:24
and some won't just fight in the spirit
24:27
so i'm just letting you know
24:28
things are going to rapidly begin to
24:30
change for the God
24:32
and for the better in our lives but
24:34
don't ignore the fact that you have that
24:36
army
24:36
i post mine continually and they go with
24:39
me everywhere i go
24:40
and you will begin to see them in the
24:42
sky over your home they don't go back to
24:45
heaven they're with you the whole time
24:47
you're here
24:48
and we will have to do maybe one time
24:50
which is one of the things because we're
24:51
not going to stop doing these i don't
24:52
know that we'll do them every week
24:54
stephen i already
24:55
had decided God had decided but we'll
24:57
take one session probably train people
24:59
how to invite the army of heaven
25:01
really train them how to send them how
25:04
to command them
25:05
and to protect yourself and your family
25:07
all the time
25:09
and you know i'm i'm not really a seer i
25:11
do have seer events
25:13
but i don't walk in it all the time like
25:15
you do
25:16
although you know that's my goal but i
25:19
prayed for this property for years even
25:21
before i met you we
25:22
we just used to pray angels we didn't
25:24
know about the armies we didn't know
25:25
about sending the hosts
25:27
once we learned the host then now it
25:29
became a more
25:30
targeted setting the armies of heaven
25:32
around in doing that
25:34
i've had some people drive by who didn't
25:36
know what this property was you can see
25:37
it from the main highway
25:39
there's a little bit on the hillside not
25:40
really high but a little bit of a slope
25:42
and we're right in the middle because
25:44
there's farmland around us it's not even
25:46
our farmland
25:47
and then they would meet me later and
25:48
say wait a year then they find out
25:50
you're the one that lives on that
25:51
property right in the corner and such
25:53
and such
25:54
they go man i drove by that and i saw
25:56
the the complete
25:57
hillside filled with angels and fiery
26:00
you know angels and and of course i was
26:03
clueless
26:04
all i knew is projection was was with me
26:07
you know i didn't see that so i just
26:08
really want to encourage people
26:10
whether you see it or not doesn't matter
26:12
you know what you need to do is you need
26:14
to send the host to heaven
26:15
so well let's ask a couple of questions
26:17
here um
26:18
these are kind of in random order let me
26:20
just
26:21
i'm trying to decide which way to go i
26:23
do want to say this i just
26:24
need to say one more thing go ahead
26:28
um chen will hold notes up in front we
26:31
do still do old school because
26:32
i'll be going 100 miles an hour of
26:34
revelation and when you've had
26:37
even recent encounters with God like
26:38
right before i came out here i was
26:40
shaking
26:42
the presence of God because it is his
26:45
purpose for you to hear what he is
26:46
saying and he means everything he's
26:48
saying
26:49
and one thing he wants to do right now
26:50
is he's going to validate
26:52
vice president mike pence he has not
26:55
changed his mind about
26:57
pence and if you haven't heard this on
27:00
on the inauguration day
27:01
for trump i was one of the people
27:04
because they had like three or four
27:05
different prayer breakfasts but in the
27:06
one i was in i was
27:07
actually the one chosen to pray for uh
27:10
president trump and vice president pence
27:12
and
27:12
at that meeting when i opened my mouth
27:15
out came God's words
27:16
and he said trump will sit for eight
27:18
years in the white house
27:20
and after trump pence i have chosen him
27:23
he will be president for eight years
27:26
after trump
27:27
and then after that whoever mike picks
27:30
as his vice president that person will
27:33
sit in the white house for eight years
27:35
i will have 24 years of God
27:39
consuming the white house guess what he
27:41
hasn't changed his mind
27:43
and he wants people to stop bashing vice
27:45
president pence because those are
27:47
thoughts the enemy's giving you
27:49
and he doesn't want people to think that
27:50
he's been validated God in this moment
27:53
is telling you he has validated him
27:55
he chose him and anointed him he's been
27:57
a believer a long time
27:59
he doesn't have the same character okay
28:01
it won't be quite as a show as it is
28:03
right now
28:06
God is not changing his mind he
28:09
validates pence
28:10
his family strong believers lies are
28:13
starting to be told about him
28:14
and people are always asking me and i
28:16
say why have you asked me
28:18
when God already said what he was going
28:21
to do
28:22
so yes pence can be trusted and he is
28:25
very close to president trump and they
28:27
meet all the time
28:29
not just for business but their families
28:31
do things so many things together and i
28:33
know people
28:34
and i'm not ever going to say their
28:35
names but i know people who are with
28:36
them all the time
28:38
and let me tell you pence is already
28:40
presidential looking
28:42
but he he is term until after these
28:45
four years are over and trust me
28:48
he will sit in that white house for
28:50
eight years so get used to him being
28:51
there
28:51
there you go Godzilla you know i'm glad
28:54
you i'm glad you're starting to
28:55
interrupt me because what you didn't
28:56
know is that's where one of the places i
28:58
was going
28:59
and i i have on my list three or four
29:02
things and i call these
29:04
people throwing away their good
29:06
questions that they could ask about
29:08
having their salvation
29:09
out of our route to say what happens why
29:11
do we need merchants and things like
29:12
that
29:13
and on my list i have put some things
29:16
where i feel like they're just kind of
29:17
throwing away their
29:18
their questions that they had because
29:19
first of all it takes us a week or two
29:21
to get to your question
29:22
and they're asking questions about a
29:23
couple days from now so they're here's
29:25
my
29:26
list is bigfoot real what's gonna happen
29:29
with pants are these rumors true about
29:31
parents and a bunch of those
29:33
um what's gonna happen congress meets
29:36
today
29:37
because that one got to me today and i
29:39
just brought it up
29:40
for um an example and then i even wrote
29:44
down this one
29:45
i mean i might be mildly curious about
29:46
this but but i'm not sure it's your
29:48
purview you're welcome to tell me you'd
29:50
happy to answer
29:51
this one says whether our ark or the ark
29:53
of the covenant be found
29:55
and so i just use these examples don't
29:58
necessarily they may not be thrown away
30:00
if
30:00
Kat wants to answer some of those but i
30:02
see people burning their opportunity by
30:04
asking questions that
30:06
probably is not what where you want to
30:08
say so anything there you want to answer
30:10
i would just say i think that that
30:14
there are somebody there's people out
30:16
there probably the right people
30:18
who already know where the ark of the
30:19
covenant is and
30:21
if they're who they're supposed to be
30:23
they won't be blasting that from the
30:25
housetops you have to understand there
30:27
are some things
30:28
that God shows people on purpose to
30:30
prayer or to cover or to even to protect
30:33
sometimes
30:34
and i'm sure that there are somebody out
30:36
there probably
30:37
possibly some of the jews that know
30:40
where the ark of the covenant
30:41
is and he's not telling me and it's not
30:44
my job to know
30:45
i just know it's very real i can assure
30:48
you it's real
30:49
i've seen the one in heaven that the one
30:52
on the earth
30:53
represents except the things on that ark
30:56
uh
30:57
that of the ark of the covenant they're
30:59
real like the
31:00
it talks about the angels it talks about
31:02
the seraphim that their wings touch over
31:04
the ark of the covenant i'm talking
31:06
about the one on the earth okay and
31:08
heavens are a lie
31:09
they're living and they do cover over
31:12
the things of
31:13
their powerful things that God declares
31:15
there and things that happen still there
31:17
in the ark of the covenant the one in
31:19
heaven uh but i can tell you this that
31:22
God has many people he's placed in
31:24
covert
31:25
operations if your mind has never
31:28
considered
31:29
considered i'm not saying you have to
31:30
become one although he may ask you to be
31:33
one in the spirit
31:34
there are covert operations
31:37
surrounding everything that's going on
31:40
and i'm talking about
31:41
for justice i can't talk about those
31:44
things and i'm not going to tell anybody
31:46
what they are i can just assure you
31:49
i know it's happening in the spirit i
31:50
know what the outcome of everything will
31:52
be
31:52
that there will be great celebrations in
31:54
the streets and i'm not the only one
31:56
that God is showing this but he does
31:58
show me
31:59
that there that trump will sit in that
32:00
white house for four years whether it's
32:02
now whether it's in february
32:04
and this is what he has said it doesn't
32:07
matter if you if they show you them
32:08
sifting bite in there i'll kick him out
32:12
clean it off and i will put trump there
32:14
so
32:15
you have to understand in your mind you
32:17
have to stand when he says stand and
32:19
stand therefore
32:21
that means you're going to trust and
32:22
believe God this is what's going to
32:23
happen
32:24
when it happens and you've heard it from
32:26
many sources
32:27
your faith will explode it will
32:31
grow no it won't it will explode God
32:33
said no he said it will explode
32:35
because you will have seen the fruit of
32:37
your own lips
32:38
and your stance that you made but God
32:41
just said to let them know this
32:43
there are covert operations happening
32:45
now and because you
32:46
hear certain people say things and
32:49
you're shocked about that person i'm not
32:50
talking about there isn't evil going on
32:52
everywhere
32:53
there's liars and friars everywhere and
32:55
that's what God calls them
32:57
but there are some who've stood firm and
33:00
have been asked to say certain things to
33:04
appear something so that's why you
33:06
cannot take everything you're seeing
33:08
and throw in one stew pot and say this
33:10
is what's going on
33:11
and so you might you don't want to uh
33:14
step beyond what
33:15
about what uh the bones or boundaries
33:18
that God has given
33:19
us ourselves here but there are some
33:21
covert operations going on
33:23
that no one in the trump administration
33:25
is going to talk about
33:26
and these are people because i
33:29
understand you know
33:30
there's a few people that probably need
33:31
to be removed not
33:33
not pence or any of them like that
33:35
there's a few people that probably will
33:36
be fired
33:38
i know some that will never be fired but
33:40
i will just say this there are friends
33:42
of theirs
33:44
overseas in certain countries that are
33:46
friendly that have
33:47
appeared to do something or say
33:49
something
33:50
so they can get uh information
33:54
and that's probably the closest i can
33:56
get to any of that so you don't think
33:57
this is all there is
33:58
right here this is what there is you
34:01
don't understand
34:01
covert really good covert activities
34:04
there's stuff you don't even know that's
34:06
here
34:07
not even the left i know i go to the
34:09
left okay i think this is your left
34:10
whatever
34:11
whatever it is okay
34:15
there's things they don't know about
34:18
and you know still at all when you're in
34:20
the middle of
34:21
deep covert operation so pray for all
34:24
those who are in that place that God has
34:26
put in that place that the president has
34:28
possibly put in that place
34:30
um there's just things i have always
34:33
known for many years before
34:34
any of this stuff before any of the
34:37
stuff even started happening
34:38
and so i'm just seeing you know prophecy
34:42
take place or things that God has shown
34:45
me
34:45
himself i'm seeing them taking place
34:48
it's going to be good
34:50
it's good well that's it and that's
34:52
that's exciting because i see the
34:54
enthusiasm and the excitement in you and
34:55
i can tell you know stuff that i would
34:57
love to know but it's on a need to know
34:59
basis
35:00
if we don't need to know we don't need
35:02
to know the only thing we need to know
35:03
is God is good there's love and dirt
35:04
forever
35:05
and he laughs he sits up in heaven and
35:07
laughs because
35:08
he knows they're they're inspiring me so
35:11
good
35:14
lovely
35:17
okay now we can move on there you go
35:20
okay let me ask you we'll ask a few
35:21
questions here
35:23
um i'm only gonna usually if someone
35:25
writes me three or four questions i
35:26
picked the best one because
35:27
i'm so far behind it's not fair to this
35:30
one i'll ask you because one of them is
35:31
for a child
35:32
and we try to make exceptions for that
35:34
and we allow silly questions for
35:36
children
35:37
yeah because they want to know or what
35:39
we think are some of these questions
35:40
um this this is a serious one she said
35:43
she knew of a woman
35:44
when she was sad she attempted to
35:48
suicide and then she in she had a dream
35:51
that the lord showed her hell
35:53
and there were she says in this two
35:56
children in hell out of the billions of
35:59
souls
35:59
she says i'd like to know if this is at
36:02
all possible that these children were in
36:04
hell
36:05
it is not possible in any way whatsoever
36:08
and this again
36:09
is a the more you get into the spirit
36:12
realm
36:12
realities and that's what God calls them
36:15
the reality of the spirit realm
36:17
both sides are there it's not this earth
36:20
but their activities are around the
36:22
earth in the atmosphere
36:24
uh the spirit realm is everywhere it's
36:26
the original
36:27
realm there's even highways and wasted
36:30
when i say highways i'm not talking
36:31
about a road like outside your house
36:34
i'm talking about beams and waves of
36:36
light that travel everywhere in the
36:38
unseen
36:38
realm the unseen realm is bigger than
36:41
the scene realm
36:43
and there's more activity there in the
36:45
unseen realm
36:46
uh so you need to be aware there's so
36:49
much going on you don't see
36:50
and right now there's a lot of stuff
36:52
going on on our behalf
36:54
on america's behalf so you need to be
36:57
uh rest assured that that God
37:00
understands everything and he's not
37:02
ignoring people
37:03
but this is the other thing you do need
37:05
to know that satan does have some power
37:08
he's the prince and power of what the
37:11
heir
37:12
talking about the air you breathe he's
37:15
talking about the spirit realm
37:17
okay he hasn't been thrown away away
37:19
somewhere forever
37:21
eventually when time is no more that
37:24
doesn't mean you won't exist that means
37:25
we won't have to count
37:26
time nobody will age none of that will
37:29
happen we'll be stepping into that
37:31
glorified part of our lives and there
37:34
will be no
37:36
evil no evil not anywhere
37:39
not any plan that God makes for us to
37:41
enjoy not on the new earth
37:43
um uh satan will not be allowed on the
37:46
new earth he will not be anywhere on the
37:48
earth or the new
37:49
in or inside the new earth he'll be
37:51
nowhere he can't stop
37:53
stop existing let me get a drink this is
37:55
a
37:56
question you need this answer
38:01
but God has been from the beginning to
38:03
the end and when he says that
38:05
the beginning is before the natural
38:07
physical realm was made
38:09
the end is when the natural physical
38:11
realm won't be used primarily for us
38:14
he's actually going to blend the spirit
38:16
realm and the physical realm it will be
38:18
one realm where there'll be no evil at
38:20
the end of everything i'm talking about
38:22
after the
38:23
middle millennial reign and by the way
38:24
it's gonna happen people sorry if you
38:26
don't understand it
38:27
God's given his son that thousand years
38:29
on the throne satan will be thrown in an
38:32
abyss during that thousand years and
38:33
will not be on the earth at all
38:35
and so don't wipe it out of your bible
38:37
because you don't understand or you
38:38
think maybe it's something else
38:41
but there will be a point where it will
38:43
be hell won't be
38:45
anywhere near us uh the lake of fire
38:48
which is there i keep telling people
38:50
uh all satan gets in the end is lakeside
38:52
property and it's gonna be really hot
38:54
okay because holy spirit is funny and
38:57
he's the drama king he had me say that
38:59
that's all he's going to do he be will
39:02
be if you're getting
39:03
in the most hated being who will have no
39:05
power
39:07
in that lake of fire that is eternal
39:09
every wicked person so every wicked evil
39:11
person
39:12
who never accepted christ rejected
39:14
christ for whatever reason
39:16
will be thrown there okay and they
39:19
probably can beat him up i don't know
39:21
i just know he'll be the most hated
39:22
being in all there because everybody
39:23
will know
39:24
they were deceived by him but they still
39:26
chose him so that is the end end
39:28
for satan up until the point where that
39:31
has happened
39:32
then he will be on this earth except the
39:34
thousand years he's sewn in in a pit
39:36
an abyss but the spirit realm there's so
39:40
much activity going there
39:42
but there's mock places you have to
39:45
understand how can satan have the second
39:47
heaven the second heaven is not up in
39:48
heaven
39:49
it's a place between our sky and heaven
39:53
spirit realm and satan kind of rules his
39:56
little kingdom from there
39:57
the thing you need to know about that is
39:59
i mean he has this mock
40:01
palace mock palace that looks pretty
40:03
crummy and um
40:05
and he sits on his thrones it's on a
40:08
throne of skulls because
40:09
death is his thing right and that's not
40:11
to give you fear i'm just giving you
40:13
truth this is revelation from the father
40:15
what he
40:15
showed me i saw that place when you
40:18
worship God
40:19
guess where it has to go through his
40:21
little kingdom gets busted and blown up
40:23
all the time because your praise
40:26
is adoration but it's also a spiritual
40:28
weapon against them and it's going up to
40:30
God
40:31
and satan can't stop there so his place
40:33
gets bashed up all the time
40:35
and so but what he can do is he can
40:37
create things
40:38
in the spirit realm and if you don't
40:40
test the spirits which is why the bible
40:43
says test every spirit
40:44
in other words if an angel comes and
40:46
says i'm supposed to take you somewhere
40:48
you better ask that angel are you
40:50
speaking about the spirit
40:52
of the most high God who sent his son
40:54
jesus to die for the sins of this world
40:57
if you don't ask that being that
40:58
question they could be fooling you and
41:01
what do they do
41:02
they will take you to a mock place that
41:05
you
41:06
think is heaven and is not and you'll
41:08
see people there that would never be
41:10
there wicked evil people
41:12
but satan also has created a mock hell
41:15
and he will take people to the mock hell
41:17
and he will show people
41:18
kids there christians there
41:22
and these people will ask this being why
41:24
are they there well they wore blue jeans
41:26
they had makeup they were jewelry that
41:27
is the biggest
41:29
help yeah love this stuff you need to
41:32
know this really goes on so just because
41:34
someone had a dream
41:36
and they were taken somewhere and shown
41:38
something doesn't mean that was a
41:40
valid place there are no children
41:44
in hell no kid no little because there
41:47
are no kids in health
41:49
and i happen to know it happened to
41:51
several people and some people this is
41:53
what they're told they'll be brought
41:54
back and say it is now your job
41:56
to teach and preach this truth
41:58
everywhere but it's a lie
42:00
why did they get away with it they
42:03
didn't test
42:03
that spirit and i want to hold every
42:06
pastor accountable
42:08
you better ask somebody who wants to
42:10
give a testimony like that
42:11
did you test that spirit that came to
42:13
you and took you there
42:15
if you've not seen jesus christ yourself
42:16
i met him in person
42:18
there are some that can even mock his
42:19
appearance i mean they can think
42:21
it says satan can appear as an angel of
42:24
light
42:24
and he can fool you that's why you need
42:27
a relationship with jesus christ so you
42:29
will know the truth
42:30
and you will have a little red flag
42:32
saying this is not true
42:34
but it doesn't line up with the word of
42:36
God then you better not be a part of it
42:39
okay
42:40
this is this is truth that people had to
42:42
know this for years
42:43
maybe you were never told this so satan
42:45
has his little mock kingdom
42:47
has his mock hell he has his mock heaven
42:49
so he can take people there and bring
42:52
separation in the church arguing in the
42:55
church
42:56
and other things can be told to these
42:57
people like they'll think that they're
42:59
talking to God or they're in this mock
43:01
heaven that have like buddhists and
43:03
other people in it
43:04
uh mary mary will never be called mother
43:07
mary
43:08
i'm just letting you know they don't
43:09
call her that's mother mary in
43:11
keep being asked that was on my list for
43:13
today so go ahead and
43:14
address that people keep asking me what
43:17
do you think about all these people
43:18
praying
43:19
to mother mary what does God think about
43:21
it and
43:22
i think that God has a little bit of
43:24
mercy on some people
43:26
if they love him especially if they
43:28
receive jesus christ he understands
43:30
sometimes just through their
43:32
their the way they've been raised that
43:34
people did that
43:35
i've also heard this i've heard that
43:37
mary appeared to some people and say
43:38
stop praying to me
43:41
and if she could tell people she would
43:43
say that because you have to understand
43:45
you think she made one of the greatest
43:46
sacrifices she did and he said she would
43:49
be highly honored among women
43:51
but it never said she'd be worshiped and
43:53
this
43:54
crazy thing you need to know this too
43:56
since you're asking about the future
43:57
there'll be a time in the future on this
44:00
earth
44:01
before all the stuff ends and all that
44:03
stuff happens
44:04
uh i've seen you over 100 years into the
44:05
future people it's not ending roll up
44:07
your rapture rug stick in the closet for
44:09
some generation down the road
44:11
uh we have to rule and reign with christ
44:13
but
44:14
but mary is not worshipped in heaven
44:17
i've had to tell catholics that
44:18
they loved him that until i said that
44:20
part uh no
44:22
she's not the bible says highly honored
44:24
she's everyone
44:25
loves mary in heaven uh they want to be
44:28
with her they want to talk about what it
44:29
was like
44:30
raising christ and when they escaped
44:32
into egypt and she'll tell you stuff
44:34
like that
44:35
but she won't allow anyone to put she
44:37
worships
44:38
jesus christ and at the cross when
44:41
when jesus said to his mother mother
44:43
behold your son
44:44
john john behold your mother
44:48
he was letting mary know i can't die as
44:51
your son
44:51
i have to die as your savior that
44:54
doesn't mean they don't have a special
44:55
relationship but mary is not worshiped
44:57
in heaven
44:58
so the prayers go right from her to
45:00
jesus christ i can tell you right there
45:04
oh that was gonna let me let me ask it
45:05
this way so first you know
45:07
this happened this is a true story we
45:09
had these charismatic catholics they
45:11
loved the lord they knew a lot more
45:12
about jesus christ and grace
45:14
years and years ago and my dream was
45:17
pregnant with our
45:18
our son and she laid hands on her
45:21
dream's little tummy and said and she
45:24
just trusted us i guess
45:26
because she was in the same home group
45:28
and i didn't know this was coming and
45:30
she said
45:30
blessed mother mary we pray that that
45:32
done she prayed a blessing for this
45:34
little baby so like here's my question
45:37
so what did that look like from heaven's
45:39
perspective
45:40
where did that prayer go i'm sure that
45:42
mary was giggling
45:45
okay mary doesn't hate people that do
45:47
that she understands that is something
45:49
that
45:50
they were steeped in especially family
45:52
family lines
45:53
and this is the crazy thing some people
45:56
who
45:57
know the full truth and don't even
45:59
worship mary anymore they will honor her
46:01
they may keep some of her little statues
46:03
around
46:04
again having a statue of mary uh you're
46:06
not feeding her food and bowing down to
46:08
her
46:09
and people may not like this you have to
46:11
have a balance
46:12
okay having a statue of mary isn't
46:14
sending you to hell
46:17
if you love God if you love his son if
46:19
you
46:20
honor the sacrifice he made you receive
46:22
him as your savior
46:23
people get up to him they go this is
46:25
what they say boy i missed that one
46:26
didn't i
46:30
i don't know teaching that um
46:33
to people you know if you're in a place
46:36
right now in your life or you're trying
46:37
to decide
46:38
run after jesus christ fill yourself
46:40
with jesus christ
46:42
spend time with him how do you do that
46:43
shut her door and say all right jesus
46:45
i'm meeting with you
46:46
and if you do every night at the same
46:47
time and you don't stop doing you talk
46:50
like he's right
46:51
here you talk with him like he's right
46:53
here guess what's going to happen
46:54
one night you're going to come in to
46:57
talk to him and
46:57
he will be there he hears our words he
47:01
knows how much you want to know him
47:03
but people who don't care and you're
47:05
just walking out your life like oh this
47:07
is just a
47:08
this is this thing i have to do no it's
47:11
not a task
47:12
it is a love thing to want to know jesus
47:16
christ
47:16
he is everything he is everything i mean
47:19
if it wasn't for him we would have
47:21
nothing we wouldn't have coke
47:23
we wouldn't have prosperity we wouldn't
47:25
have relationships restored
47:27
we wouldn't have healing satan can't
47:30
heal anybody but this also will happen
47:33
you you were talking about the times to
47:34
come and we may have to do a future
47:36
thing just because you know i'm talking
47:37
about
47:38
maybe 40 50 years into the future
47:41
it might start before that that things
47:43
are going to start
47:44
they will start changing things many
47:46
things for the better but satan's going
47:47
to have to come up with a better plan
47:48
than the one he's having right now
47:50
because it's not working
47:51
and he will always come up with
47:52
something what we would call would be
47:54
new which would be
47:56
he'll try to convince people that
47:57
witchcraft is a good thing
47:59
and this is what satan does if satan
48:01
puts sickness and disease on people
48:03
he can remove it he can't heal people
48:07
but he can remove that to prove that
48:08
somebody oh that's interesting
48:12
you need to understand you can't keep
48:14
ignoring the fact that there's a spirit
48:15
realm around us and there's activity
48:17
from both sides
48:19
i say this way you can't be ignorant you
48:21
don't have to be ignorant of those
48:23
things they do happen they've been
48:24
happening for years
48:26
but because satan is making a push right
48:28
now to take over which is
48:30
not going to happen okay there'll be
48:32
major countries that you will be so
48:34
shocked to see that shift to jesus
48:36
christ
48:36
so these things are like here waiting
48:38
right they're waiting
48:40
and God's like i'm cleaning this junk
48:41
off of here i can't have this stuff here
48:44
so that's why there's so much he's
48:46
exposing he exposes before he cleans it
48:50
and sets things in place but i can
48:52
assure you that mary
48:54
doesn't want to be worshipped mary's got
48:56
good friends in heaven and she's met a
48:58
lot of people and loves people she loves
49:00
to talk about
49:02
the you know when christ was born in the
49:04
manger that really did happen she loved
49:05
to share those stories with people
49:08
but i've the more i've talked to
49:09
catholics and all this was down to one
49:11
thing
49:11
there'll be a time on this earth
49:15
that mary is not worshiped in the
49:18
 catholic
49:19
religion how about that there's going to
49:21
be a major shift
49:22
i don't know if it would be the pope or
49:24
just different priests that start to do
49:26
it but they will begin to teach jesus
49:29
christ
49:31
for a season for a season i don't know
49:33
when the season is now if it's 20 years
49:35
and i don't know
49:36
there'll be a season where jesus christ
49:39
is just everywhere and people will know
49:42
he's real they'll know he's not a lie
49:45
God's
49:46
also erasing the gray area that says
49:48
there is no God because when this stuff
49:50
happens people you're going to know
49:53
we have a God who cares and he is going
49:55
to move his hand
49:56
and you're going to know it and what the
49:58
reality that will be was
50:00
there to be so many people saved at when
50:03
this happens and trump is sitting in the
50:05
white house so many people will run to
50:07
get saved because they'll realize oh
50:08
there is a God because only God could do
50:11
this and they'll want to know jesus so
50:13
if you can see the picture it helps your
50:15
life
50:17
and i want you to know that God thinks
50:19
about you continually
50:21
he always has me tell people he loves
50:23
you he has
50:24
great plans for you he's not doing the
50:27
bad things to you
50:28
you just need to make sure that you're
50:30
on the right side amen
50:32
okay so let's go on amen well now that
50:35
our time is up
50:36
but let me let me finish with this
50:38
little boy's question this is the second
50:40
question first of all it's good news i'm
50:42
sure to her
50:43
to the mom who's now she knows it's not
50:45
possible for a child
50:46
to be in hell ever so that's good she's
50:49
my little boy
50:50
my little boy is a seer
50:54
and he really wants to know quote do
50:56
teddy bears go to heaven
51:01
he's a very wise person and
51:04
you know every time i tell another truth
51:06
there's always going to be people that
51:08
will bash it ignore them and you know
51:10
just i do want to say this and i've
51:12
taught people who have been following
51:14
following revelation you know i can say
51:16
follow me it doesn't matter God gave me
51:17
the pink hair so i couldn't hide
51:19
i'm not into finding people to worship
51:21
me i don't have time
51:24
okay my humility was born in me and
51:27
helping to raise all my siblings i knew
51:29
it was never going to be about me and
51:30
i'm okay if it's not
51:32
but it has to be about jesus christ i'll
51:35
say that
51:36
there will be things in heaven you will
51:38
be so
51:39
delighted to see now when God had me
51:42
start talking about your
51:43
pets being there because that's his
51:45
choice of course some people raged
51:47
against it but i have to say this 75
51:50
of everybody was delighted and i happen
51:52
to know
51:54
my one brother was ministering in um
51:56
lockdown he was literally ministering
51:58
in um the worst
52:01
kind of the prison i can't remember
52:03
there's like five layers of bars they
52:05
lock oh death row
52:07
my my brother would go minister on death
52:09
row okay he has grace for death row and
52:11
for seniors no one in between
52:13
don't call me okay and ask for don't ask
52:16
him for counseling man he'll get his gun
52:18
out and say we'll dangle you over hell
52:21
he really would but death growth people
52:25
and there was a prisoner who was on
52:26
death row i'm not going to say his name
52:27
you know who is so evil and wicked
52:30
and my brother is so filled with God
52:33
he's not afraid of anything and he would
52:35
go they say don't stand by the bars
52:37
there's like what i'm trying to say
52:38
maybe five feet between you and the cell
52:40
with these uh
52:41
these the worst people on the earth that
52:44
were caught and put in prison
52:46
he'll get right up by the bars and he
52:48
will not take his eyes away and he'll
52:50
say do you know jesus christ
52:53
the son of the living God who has power
52:55
over everything
52:56
and the one who rules you should not
53:00
have you
53:01
if you want to go burn in his hell and
53:02
he'll start talking about hell
53:04
he said you can go there but God's
53:06
letting you know you can still choose
53:07
him you can still repent and he will
53:09
still take you
53:10
and then my brother will begin to
53:11
prophesy about things that
53:13
happened when their children when they
53:15
were children
53:16
and at one time this one prison his
53:18
favorite thing
53:19
and this got this when he was a child he
53:22
had a horrific
53:23
people who were raising him but his
53:26
favorite thing is most precious thing he
53:27
had was a teddy bear
53:30
and this little teddy bear had one eye
53:33
because i don't know what happened to it
53:34
but something happened to it and he's
53:36
telling this prisoner this this
53:38
prisoner has been killing murdering
53:40
everywhere he's telling him his life
53:42
this is what God has to say to you your
53:45
teddy bear
53:46
that you love that your dad shredded the
53:48
pieces and burnt in front of you
53:50
and your heart was broken that that
53:52
actually hardened his heart so we never
53:53
loved anybody after that
53:55
it was the only thing he loved God said
53:57
he wanted him to know his teddy bear
53:59
would be in heaven
54:00
[Laughter]
54:04
this is my brother prophesying from God
54:07
your teddy bear will be there
54:08
the teddy bear will talk to you it will
54:11
be like a little friend
54:12
because you loved it when no one else
54:15
loved you
54:16
that bear loved you and he said so i'm
54:18
taking your teddy bear your teddy bear
54:19
is in heaven it has both eyes
54:21
and he'll be waiting and that prisoner
54:23
broke
54:25
wow he held my knees and
54:28
weeped openly weeped openly about all
54:31
that and he received jesus christ before
54:33
he was
54:34
he was still a little elected with that
54:36
prophecy
54:37
oh man i mean that's like from hate
54:41
and evil because he was possessed the
54:43
demons left him
54:44
when truth came they left him and yet my
54:47
brother
54:47
who just can stay with the straightest
54:49
face ever when he talks about it he
54:52
doesn't talk very often trust me you
54:54
won't see him with his name on a venue
54:55
somewhere
54:56
you don't want that i mean
54:59
but but the things he's seen happen in
55:02
prisons because he's a prophet and he'll
55:04
my God opens uh walls up and takes my
55:07
brother into an open vision and that's
55:09
how he shows him things
55:11
so i'm not the only one i have come from
55:13
generations of seers of people who have
55:15
experiences like that
55:17
and yet we still have family members
55:18
that are messed up so don't think my
55:20
whole family's perfect oh trust me some
55:21
of them could care less about me some
55:23
are happy about it
55:24
some think i'm in it for the money these
55:26
are family members and you know i've got
55:27
150 right so cut me some fly
55:29
now most of them are happy but my
55:32
brother
55:32
does this and he would when they would
55:35
send them
55:36
these Gods would come on a prison visit
55:39
to these big
55:40
um prisons he would have most of the
55:43
people they'd send out these little
55:44
salvation cards here's your five
55:45
salvation cards see if you can win five
55:47
prisoners
55:48
my brother would end up by getting all
55:49
the salvation cards because
55:52
everybody was coming to where he was in
55:53
that yard you can imagine here's all
55:55
these wicked
55:56
horrific people coming to hear him give
55:58
truth about God
55:59
out in the courtyard of these prisons
56:01
there's guards everywhere
56:03
uh but my brother's got big angels
56:06
that's amazing my that's me and i i
56:09
would have never thought
56:10
in a hundred years animals if they mean
56:13
something to you yes they will be in
56:14
heaven that's amazing i would have never
56:16
thought
56:18
that's that's beautiful that's beautiful
56:20
that i mean that's huge because
56:22
i thought i don't know should i ask this
56:24
question look at this guy got saved with
56:26
that that is amazing i'm just listening
56:28
another
56:36
and it's something about um it's about
56:39
the new heaven
56:40
and where they're talking about in the
56:42
book of revelation it talks about you
56:43
know the
56:44
no more tears the dry waters and all the
56:46
stuff and then the new jerusalem will
56:47
come down and it talks all about that
56:48
but it says something
56:50
and it's talking about the new earth and
56:52
it makes this statement
56:53
there will be no more sea and people
56:56
think that means there won't be any
56:57
water well
56:58
you're wrong because the father carries
57:01
the river of life it comes from him it
57:03
doesn't come from somewhere out in space
57:05
or somewhere in the spirit realm
57:06
even in heaven it flows literally from
57:08
his being it's part of him
57:10
wherever he is that will always be there
57:14
so uh there sees there's a difference
57:17
you need to know by the way
57:18
there's a difference in the sea and an
57:20
ocean okay because there's seas all over
57:22
the world
57:23
um a sea is a tributary off of the ocean
57:28
somewhere it's a waterway it's a sea
57:31
like the sea of galilee it doesn't
57:34
connect with every ocean
57:35
in the world you understand what i'm
57:36
saying so wind seas the red sea
57:40
the sea of galilee all these are
57:42
individual
57:43
they're huge bodies of water those are
57:45
seas and when God made the earth the
57:47
first time
57:49
he made it like heaven one land mass
57:53
and one ocean was on this earth at one
57:55
time
57:56
until God split up the land masses when
57:59
he did that
58:00
the seas were created that came off of
58:02
this
58:03
when you split up the land masses there
58:05
wasn't just one massive ocean
58:07
on the new earth which i have seen
58:10
there is an ocean and that flows from
58:13
the father
58:14
from himself there'll be no more seas
58:18
separating the land mass on the new
58:20
earth there'll just be one
58:22
one motion around it so there you go
58:24
there's your answer
58:26
oh you know that's interesting because i
58:27
was gonna i didn't know that and i was
58:29
thinking about
58:30
in heaven i actually had this in one of
58:32
my questions down my list not
58:34
necessarily for today but it was the
58:35
last
58:36
i i wanted to know can there be are
58:38
there crashing waves
58:40
and warm sands that i can sit on in
58:42
heaven
58:43
but several people wanted to know this
58:46
and sometimes it was connected with the
58:47
ocean
58:48
sometimes it was connected with your
58:49
mansion they said
58:51
can we nap i thought oh first after my
58:53
own heart i love a good nap
58:55
especially on a warm sand with crashing
58:58
waves
58:58
i love a good net does anybody nap in
59:01
heaven
59:02
i think they probably rest and close
59:04
their eyes
59:05
and they can have beautiful experiences
59:09
but as far as your body being tired you
59:11
know people
59:12
sleep right i don't sleep by the way i
59:14
think i can't remember i think about the
59:15
bed at eight
59:16
now maybe eight a.m so i'm up like 20
59:19
hours a day and sometimes i'm just
59:21
for several days in a row but um
59:24
but some people like that they just want
59:26
to lay down and rest now i had one
59:28
experience
59:30
when i was taken up the heaven and there
59:32
was this the water was like emerald
59:34
green
59:35
normally it's got colors of the rainbow
59:37
in it even the crystal sea
59:39
itself has colors of the rainbow coming
59:42
up out of it
59:43
but there was this beautiful place that
59:45
was taken
59:46
and probably a passionate paradise which
59:49
is where people who
59:50
love jesus christ and they get to sing
59:53
with him and stuff like that it's a
59:54
beautiful place
59:55
but there's these waterfalls now the
59:57
waterfall isn't coming off of a body of
59:59
water just coming out of nowhere
60:02
so there's streams in heaven there's
60:04
brooks in heaven beautifully
60:06
but this place is special it's where you
60:08
meet
60:09
i don't know how to say this it's where
60:11
you meet peace
60:13
it's where you meet con uh there's a
60:15
there's a spirit of comfort everywhere
60:16
it comes up and wraps
60:17
up around you one of the places that
60:19
happened was i was shown this
60:21
this this creek or beautiful spring
60:24
and this water was flowing from this
60:26
waterfall and out of the waterfall steps
60:28
this
60:28
most beautiful angel and she is in
60:31
charge of the waterfalls in heaven she
60:34
stepped out she was filled with green
60:35
light
60:36
almost like it was twinkling light and
60:39
her voice when she spoke
60:40
peace and calm came and she told me to
60:43
lay down on the water and i did
60:45
and i began to float and i had my eye
60:48
shot and i saw
60:50
beautiful visions of other places in
60:53
heaven
60:54
and there was such a peace and calm and
60:55
i could hear her voice still although i
60:57
had gone
60:58
some ways on this stream and finally um
61:02
jesus came and got me said i have
61:04
something to show you but i'll never
61:06
forget that
61:06
so you can experience something like
61:08
that but this is the way
61:10
there's so many places in heaven one day
61:12
i don't i could draw individual maps but
61:14
i just can't fit them all together
61:17
but there are places in heaven where
61:19
it's warm
61:20
uh there's a place called wipeout surf
61:23
park
61:24
um parks whether it's for trees for
61:27
singing flowers or uh all kinds of
61:30
things but there's a place where you can
61:32
surf on 100 foot waves 200 foot waves
61:35
and that water off of the crystal sea
61:37
and crashes 200 feet down and makes
61:39
these mega waves
61:41
and there's warm sand so yes
61:44
there's a car i don't know who it was i
61:46
know it was jesse duplantis or so you
61:48
know
61:49
there was a doctor richard evie that had
61:51
gone to heaven so one of those books i
61:53
had read some years ago
61:55
maybe it was rick joy i really don't
61:56
know who told the story
61:58
they didn't nap but they said i i was by
62:01
the ocean or by a sea
62:03
and i laid there and i just closed my
62:05
eyes and i just like it was
62:06
like a rest not because they're tired
62:09
yeah it was like a
62:10
meditative just wonderful he said
62:13
he said there was no time he said
62:17
i understand there's no time and if i
62:18
had to put a time on it
62:20
i feel like i laid there for about
62:24
2 000 years that's what it felt like
62:27
that was his description because you
62:30
absorb
62:31
things into your spiritual being and
62:35
you don't even think about time because
62:37
they don't have clocks or calendars up
62:39
there
62:40
uh God does things by according to
62:42
events you need to know that
62:44
i know according to the jewish calendar
62:46
God set dates and things and seasons
62:49
like that
62:50
um but in heaven itself things are done
62:52
according to God has a timeline
62:54
and wherever he has a dot on the
62:56
timeline it's the events it's not like
62:57
he's
62:58
ignorant to everything else but there's
62:59
things he wants to happen on the earth
63:01
we're on
63:02
we're on one of those dots right now on
63:04
God's calendar
63:05
and it's a great victory you need to
63:07
know that but um
63:09
but as far as you being concerned it's
63:11
okay to have lots of questions about
63:13
heaven
63:13
it's just the most amazing place ever
63:16
but there are places you can sit and
63:19
kind of rest a recline and
63:21
you think about things you can even have
63:23
friends come and
63:24
have conversations with them and
63:26
sometimes they may be listening
63:27
sometimes they
63:28
may not be listening but as far as you
63:30
being exhausted that you have to sleep
63:32
that doesn't happen
63:33
but there are beautiful times of i don't
63:37
even know what you would call it it's
63:38
like this place
63:39
even though you're there you go to this
63:41
beautiful place
63:43
and see these beautiful things while
63:45
you're relaxing
63:47
yeah very nice to remind people how they
63:50
can get your books on revealing heaven
63:52
yeah i forget all the time i actually
63:54
have a book
63:57
focus on sharing that's my main
63:59
commission but they can go to
64:01
revealingheaven.com
64:02
and i have a business because God told
64:06
me to
64:06
have a business to make profits for the
64:08
kingdom and i can make a profit he's
64:10
fine with that
64:11
and then i have times i do go and
64:13
minister i do want to say this anyone
64:16
who sends me
64:17
if you want to bless me and send me
64:18
something make sure you just make it out
64:20
to Kat Kerr
64:22
because the banks say you're not a
64:24
minister you don't have a church they
64:26
won't let me do anything with it so i
64:27
just thought i'd throw this in there for
64:28
free
64:29
just make it out the cap curve you know
64:31
if you really want to bless me
64:32
i don't ever ask people to do that but
64:34
some people can't help but they've been
64:36
so changed and their life's been changed
64:37
but the other thing
64:38
chris forgot to say was God has many
64:41
places he created in heaven for everyone
64:43
to enjoy to explore to have adventures
64:47
one of my own sisters not any of them
64:49
you know they think that you soul sleep
64:51
so i'm just telling you it's family
64:53
people okay it's family yeah
64:55
you think when you die you're so asleep
64:56
you don't do nothing
64:59
can't wait for her to die but i haven't
65:00
known not really
65:02
no i get that because i was i was raised
65:04
exactly that same way so it took me
65:06
i left it about 40 years ago but that
65:09
was what i was raised
65:10
when you die you lay in the malt john
65:12
brown's
65:13
body lies the molding in the grave or
65:15
something
65:18
your body your body sleep your spirit
65:20
man would be like taking you alive
65:22
sticking you in the coffin
65:24
your spirit man never sleeps in your
65:26
soul is in your spirit man that's what
65:28
makes your decisions in your choices
65:30
so when you die that's why it says to be
65:32
absent from what
65:34
the bible is to be present
65:37
with the lord that means your spirit man
65:40
we just own it you go and live in heaven
65:42
your body
65:43
dies and you will get it back one day
65:46
you can't avoid that but it's gonna look
65:47
really good it'll still look like you
65:50
i encourage people you're gonna like it
65:51
you're gonna like you're gonna like it
65:53
also hey also when you when people you
65:55
heard uh Kat say you could give to her
65:57
don't you they don't they have to go to
65:58
KatKerr.com now if you want to get
66:01
or they can send checks in the mail i
66:03
have in my address my p.o boxes on there
66:05
but a lot of people just don't trust the
66:06
internet but you can go to
66:08
KatKerr.com k-a-t-k-e-r-r
66:11
dot com and if you want to give online
66:14
that is the
66:14
only place because right now there's
66:16
fake facebooks there's Kat Kerr
66:19
facebooks that i didn't make
66:21
and most of them are there just to help
66:23
advertise the revelation but some are
66:24
there to make money
66:26
and there's a new one right on there
66:28
right now on facebook brand new one
66:30
who's taken my i don't know how to call
66:33
all the stuff my background and even my
66:35
face
66:36
they've even put some of our Kat and
66:38
steve
66:39
videos on yes so but they're asking for
66:42
money or they're trying to give money
66:44
away which is just
66:45
it's a it's a scam so i won't
66:48
ask you for money but if you just want
66:50
to give go to Kat Kerr.com go to the
66:52
guardian zone
66:53
click on the treasury click on the
66:54
treasury on capco.com
66:56
and it'll tell you how um you can do
66:59
that and i'm very grateful
67:01
uh that God does that but most of the
67:03
time i forget to even say i have books i
67:05
have dvd
67:06
cds i have revelation calendars we're
67:09
about to release the new and the fire
67:10
and the glory that explains what the
67:12
baptism in fire is what it looks
67:14
like there are all revelation images on
67:17
every month you'll see something you
67:18
probably never saw before or didn't
67:20
understand before
67:22
because God has us do that it's not
67:23
about a calendar you look at and throw
67:25
away
67:26
it's the revelation in it that's
67:28
priceless
67:29
that's really really good so like our
67:31
cops they don't do demons right here
67:33
that makes a big statement okay and as
67:36
you can see i have a pen
67:37
here that says it you know what this
67:40
will start conversations in the grocery
67:41
store
67:44
more than you wore that or one of those
67:46
in israel i remember you
67:47
you had something that said i don't do
67:49
demons if you are around
67:50
right well we're way over time today but
67:53
it was worth it so
67:54
thank you everybody thank you Kat again
67:57
and Kat will be with us next wednesday
67:59
uh tomorrow is a new prophetic voice
68:01
that you haven't heard
68:02
his name is manny i can't pull up his
68:04
last name right now but african-american
68:06
guy God gave him
68:07
is either 2018 or 2019 he brought him to
68:10
the future oh is that blank Kat
68:13
yes that's man he did say you
68:16
administered at his place
68:17
so you know him yes he's also part of
68:20
the voice of hope that's been around for
68:22
probably 30 years and so there's even a
68:25
radio place and i did many
68:28
talks and interviews and he the guy was
68:29
just changed like crazy change but
68:32
God actually gave him a real encounter
68:34
people you need to make sure you don't
68:35
miss that because it is so powerful the
68:37
year 2022 he was taken to
68:40

68:43
it and so it's powerful see it and be
68:45
standing wrong
68:46
in dc now remember you're no longer
68:49
tolerating
68:50
evil or wickedness witchcraft of
68:53

68:54

01:46
january 8th and we'll have Kat on here
01:49
in just a minute
01:51
we've titled this episode it's not over
01:54
so that will give you a clue of where
01:56
we're going on this listen more than any
01:58
time
01:59
you know when you i tell some of you be
02:01
sure be sure be sure to
02:03
subscribe to the elijah list because
02:06
people that we
02:06
know are getting kicked off of facebook
02:10
all of a sudden they're gone
02:11
or they're getting kicked off of youtube
02:13
and so we need to have
02:15
the ability to email you and tell you
02:16
where we are we've said we're going to
02:18
rumble but we also may have an
02:20
alternative plan if we ever get kicked
02:22
off we hope that won't be
02:25
we also will have an announcement in a
02:26
few days when it's ready
02:28
we don't know how long it'll take
02:29

02:31
media
02:32
some of you have heard us talk about it
02:33
i'm not ready to announce it here
02:35
until we get a couple of those bugs
02:37
worked out but it's going to be a great
02:38
way
02:40
for social media to happen for you and
02:41
you won't get kicked off for saying
02:44
conservative things
02:46

some contact it sounds like yeah when
03:32
when the whole broadcast was over we had
03:34
our own little
03:35
meeting amongst us and so that we could
03:38
all just chit chat and fellowship a
03:39
little bit but kenneth
03:40
actually did call in and thanked all of
03:42
us for doing a great job and there was a
03:44
powerful response
03:46
i think like 51 countries were watching
03:49
right now
03:51
wow probably 100 000 people there was a
03:54
lot of people who want answers they want
03:55
to know what God is
03:56
doing right now and of course that's
03:59
what i talked about
04:00
i i was not prepared to share with them
04:03
do
04:04
part of what their stuff is their stuff
04:05
was important if you didn't see that
04:07
broadcast you need to seriously go
04:10
and watch it and i'm telling you leaders
04:12
all over the world were watching it
04:14
and a lot of them were contacting me all
04:17
night long
04:18
and it was only because they were a
04:20
little surprised about what God said but
04:24
basically God was saying you know that
04:26
um
04:27
things are about to happen very suddenly
04:30
and that he would not allow
04:31
evil to have our country and he also
04:35
confirmed very adamantly that he was not
04:38
done with trump that he was on
04:40
trump's side and that he would be for
04:43
the next four years
04:45
but there was even more than that uh
04:47
there are things going on behind the
04:49
scenes that people aren't aware of so
04:51
don't make your judgments by what you
04:52
see in the normal news i'll be nice to
04:55
them today
04:56
maybe they will walk us off everybody
04:59
i will say this everybody has a right to
05:01
make a decision with their own life
05:04
but it would be nice if you had unbiased
05:06
news
05:07
to make that choice with but we don't
05:09
have that right now in this country
05:12
and we have a lot of resources now
05:14
online that you can go and check out
05:16
we may end up by putting a list up here
05:19
a little bit later letting you know what
05:20
some of those are
05:21
but um there are activities going on
05:24
that are not seen
05:25
in by the news or by anybody right now
05:28
and there are activities of our
05:29
president
05:30
who in no way whatsoever conceded i have
05:33
to say that
05:35
i do know that there are activities that
05:37
will you will be hearing about in the
05:38
news
05:39
and of course i just letting you know
05:41
you'll hear about them from the other
05:42
news don't
05:43
don't take the other news seriously
05:49
different even conservative outlets are
05:51
now reporting and we saw it
05:53
that that trump had said or at least
05:55
they said he said
05:57
i i will now cooperate with a peaceful
05:59
transition
06:00
to biden now that's what they say he
06:02
said
06:03
in so many words so let me ask you this
06:06
way why do you say he hasn't conceded
06:09
uh when he said that because there's
06:11
things going on you can't know about
06:15
okay i understand that i hope you all
06:18
understand the hidden meaning in that
06:21
because there is one
06:23
uh we're about to have some actions take
06:25
place in this country
06:27
don't be alarmed about them God was very
06:30
uh
06:30
forceful when he said that he would no
06:32
longer tolerate the evil
06:34
trying to take his country and he caught
06:36
it my america
06:38
and uh to get ready for the landslide
06:42
and he again said when you feel the
06:44
ground
06:45
when you when the ground begins to shake
06:48
get ready for the landslide of
06:50
all the falsehoods and the other
06:53
activities that were wrong
06:55
that happened i'm not going to get
06:56
really blatant about that you already
06:58
know what those are
07:00
but God has said when you feel the
07:01
ground shake get ready for
07:03
action to take place and justice to come
07:06
and uh and whether you know it or not
07:08
today we had an earthquake
07:10
in america no i didn't i didn't know
07:12
that where was that
07:13
it was in alaska 4.4 a magnitude
07:17
uh get ready for a lot of that to be
07:19
evidence not anything destructive but
07:21
God's wanting to know that's his
07:22
evidence that the ground is beginning to
07:24
shake and therefore you may watch for
07:26
the landslide
07:27
that he talked about as being a good
07:29
thing
07:30
a good thing for everybody and because
07:32
of that happening there will be actions
07:34
taken
07:35
and decisions made by our president who
07:38
is by the way
07:38
still our president and of course the
07:41
other side thinks they've won and
07:43
everybody knows that and they're getting
07:45
crazy
07:45
and they're not getting very smart uh
07:48
one of the statements God made last
07:50
night
07:51
that i loved and i was not prepared for
07:53
any of that because you know
07:54
when you prophesy and it's him speaking
07:58
you don't really know what he's saying
07:59
until he says it
08:01
of of course and it was very very
08:03
powerful
08:04
it was so powerful that it stunned most
08:06
of the speakers
08:09
yeah and they weren't ready for that
08:11
they weren't ready we're not written
08:12
we're not prepared for what God was
08:14
going to say although it was powerful
08:16
powerful stuff
08:17
and uh later when everything was over
08:19
kevin copeland did call back in and
08:21
thanked me
08:23
for releasing great faith into the whole
08:25
entire situation
08:26
even into that ninth um meeting
08:30
what took place in the broadcast was
08:32
shifted
08:33
into God's plan and what his plans were
08:36
and what he was
08:37
about to do and that always brings hope
08:40
to people if you know
08:41
something about what's going to happen
08:44
i've known for some time
08:45
what would happen but God now is
08:48
speaking very
08:49
plainly about the things that are going
08:51
to happen so those things we've been
08:52
praying for and believing for waiting
08:54
for they are about to happen
08:56
and that is good news for us we the
08:59
people
09:00
and uh so just get ready for that but
09:02
that was just God's evidence
09:04
of that word being true when you when
09:06
you when the ground begins to shake and
09:08
it shook today
09:10
4.4 magnitude in alaska and
09:13
some people don't real didn't realize
09:15
that either yesterday or the day before
09:16
i think it was on the sixth
09:18
when all this was happening you're right
09:20
well there was one in the red sea
09:22
there was one the red sea had an
09:24
earthquake and a lot of problems were
09:26
saying that this whole thing is about a
09:28
red sea
09:28
experience to the church
09:32
that is true there was also one in
09:33
oregon um
09:35
but the main one was today uh
09:38
and that was that's happened so far
09:40
after God spoke that was the 4.4
09:43
in alaska in our country which is a sign
09:46
that things
09:47
are starting to happen that will bring
09:49
justice you have to remember that God
09:51
said justice would come
09:53
and he meant that and so i can just tell
09:55
you what i've been telling people all
09:57
along and
09:58
if you noticed if you watched it you saw
10:00
that i had my piece of cake that also
10:02
was quite a shock to them
10:07
they were reporting others yeah they
10:08
didn't know what to do with that you
10:09
need to know
10:11
they were talking about some of the
10:12
actual real activities that took place
10:15
at the capitol which was not
10:17
um an overtake by by the people who came
10:20
to
10:20
support trump and celebrate with trump
10:23
and
10:24
and back him up there was a mass of
10:26
people i think they think a quarter of a
10:28
million people were actually there in dc
10:30
the other day
10:32
i'm sure they never would have shown you
10:33
that on their news
10:35
but there weren't that many people there
10:36
and everything was peaceful
10:38
and it was powerful and then they
10:40
started putting in the fee that they
10:42
wanted to be put in for people to see in
10:44
here
10:45
and there were reports even in
10:46
newspapers that trump's people were
10:48
taking over
10:49
breaking into the capitol and taking
10:51
over that was not true at all
10:53
and that was actually shown uh in detail
10:57
of what actually happened on that show
10:59
last night so make sure you see that
11:01
show make sure you watch it
11:02
it's called right it is if you go to the
11:05
facebook we
11:06
i don't say we stream it but you can you
11:08
can play it from our site
11:10
or i'll click the link and it'll take
11:12
you so yeah it's there
11:13
make sure you see it was it was going in
11:16
one direction
11:17
and then when they asked me what i had
11:20
to say
11:22
God spoke and he said
11:25
that happened at least twice that God
11:27
twice said something very powerfully
11:30
another time he had me hit my desk as
11:33
hard as i could hit it
11:35
when he was when he was saying something
11:37
because we were shooting from here from
11:38
right here
11:39
and the presence of God was so strong
11:42
here you couldn't hardly walk back in my
11:44
room
11:45
because i spent so much time with God
11:47
earlier four hours actually so i was
11:49
still with him
11:50
when we started that that whole
11:52
broadcast
11:53
and if you watch it you'll have a lot of
11:55
hope a lot of excitement in you
11:58
so as you see activities i'm just
11:59
letting you know
12:01
as you see activities happening around
12:05
this country to probably bring someone
12:07
bring us some protection
12:08
uh that is not to bring anything against
12:10
us in any way
12:11
is to help to protect us and that's what
12:13
i'm gonna say about that
12:15
uh i know people are trying to say you
12:17
know that um
12:18
there's gonna be anarchy in the streets
12:21
and burning and looting well
12:23
there is that it'll be from the other
12:25
side it will not be from anything that
12:27
the president is doing but the president
12:29
is a very wise person he is in texas he
12:32
is in a
12:33
there's like a secret bunker thing it's
12:36
not like to keep him from being attacked
12:38
from war it's where they can make plans
12:40
in secret
12:41
and knowing here what's going on what
12:43
you know that has to happen if you're
12:45
making plans
12:46
uh to help the country and that has
12:48
always been
12:49
trump's focus don't be too concerned
12:53
about the people that you think have
12:54
abandoned him and have come against him
12:56
don't be too concerned about that
12:58
i will always say this if there's a
13:00
covert activity and you tell about it
13:02
it's not covert that's right that's
13:05
right
13:06
one of the things i think they're
13:07
awesome we're quite shocked at
13:10
uh at me except of course hank hank just
13:13
grinned the entire time
13:14
um until he had me at his place he knows
13:17
i'm not gonna be normal or say anything
13:19
normal but if God speaks he
13:20
he knows it's God and uh so it was a
13:24
powerful powerful night but it was the
13:25
beginning of something you need to know
13:27
that
13:28
that wasn't just another broadcast and
13:30
they were even saying that afterward
13:32
kenneth vidcon
13:33
and thank me he said i've never met you
13:35
but i can't wait to meet you
13:36
that was his content that was good and
13:38
the last time i saw you with that
13:40
i mean you've always been the anointed
13:42
person that you are but every once a
13:44
while the spirit falls on you
13:45
or comes out of you and that prophecy
13:48
and prophetic starts
13:50
coming and there's like don't don't mess
13:52
with Kat during that time
13:53
we were on the sea of galilee when that
13:55
hit you the first time that i saw it
13:56
like that and i'm going
13:58
whoa you know and so that happened last
14:01
night hey uh hank cunaman
14:03
jumped in a little later they they went
14:04
back and forth between the guests and
14:06
hank
14:07
towards the end said i want you to know
14:08
she's been in my church
14:10
and there's very few people and i'm
14:11
gonna paraphrase it because i don't
14:13
know those exact words there's very few
14:14
people i know that have that level of
14:16
anointing that i feel on this woman
14:18
something like that that basically yeah
14:20
he was validating me
14:22
and of course you know he himself is
14:24
highly anointed
14:26
he is also a show person and don't speak
14:28
against them because in this time God is
14:31
putting on a show
14:32
and he will you show people that means
14:34
they're very open
14:35
and very uh specific they're not afraid
14:38
of the face of man
14:39
and if God says to say something they're
14:41
going to say it and they will make a
14:42
show doing it and i will
14:44
remind you who else did that in
14:45
colossians it said on the third day
14:48
christ stood up and he uh spoiled and
14:50
ruined the principalities and powers in
14:52
the midst of hell itself
14:54
and made a show of it openly so guess
14:56
what God's a show person and so is his
14:58
son
14:59
and i'm just letting you know the show
15:01
is continuing
15:02
and this will be the good side of it and
15:05
the God side of it it will be clearly
15:07
seen and known
15:08
that when this is all over this entire
15:10
world will know
15:13
there is a God and the entire world who
15:16
was watching all this
15:17
were getting excited and God also talked
15:21
about
15:22
the when he showed me he actually just
15:24
said there will come a day
15:26
soon that the entire country this
15:29
country will run into the streets and
15:31
shout and celebrate because of the great
15:33
victory that has been won
15:35
and he said not only this country but
15:37
around the world they will be
15:39
celebrating so that should give you a
15:40
clue this is God himself
15:42
saying this so i can tell you that's
15:43
what you need to get ready for and if
15:45
you're not happy about that get in your
15:46
prayer closet or get some prayer
15:49
okay let me let me let me tell the
15:51
people
15:52
yesterday i gave them a list of some
15:54
names it was fairly early after this
15:56
whole thing started to
15:57
become our really red sea moment where
15:59
we realized okay this is it
16:00
all natural uh things are exhausted and
16:04
let's just say most of them are
16:05
and i gave them a list of people that
16:07
were still standing for trump because
16:08
some of
16:09
have apologized have begun apologies
16:11
there's like an apology chart i'm going
16:13
to ask you about that for a second but
16:15
the names i read jeff johnson
16:18
said it's not even cl it's not only not
16:21
over it's not even close to being over
16:23
obviously i read Kat's name johnny enlo
16:26
prophet named manny who we'll have on
16:28
later we
16:29
we rescheduled him or we are
16:30
rescheduling him
16:32
to that you add the names hank kuniman
16:34
lance waldow
16:35
dutch sheets tim sheets and there's more
16:38
i just don't have them
16:40
off the top i was on the acpe
16:43
private texting art or round table and i
16:46
can see there's a number of people
16:48
not everybody but there's a number of
16:50
them on there that are still contending
16:51
for trump
16:52
so obviously we don't speak against
16:54
prophets we don't even speak against
16:56
prophets
16:57
who are speaking against prophets that's
16:59
right but i want to ask you in general
17:01
um what attitude people should have
17:04
about and towards those who have begun
17:07
their apology chair most of the
17:08
apologies are filled with humility
17:10
i'm really sorry i got this wrong i'm
17:13
trying to learn
17:14
and what are your thoughts about that i
17:17
think that they will realize that they
17:18
didn't have to do that at all
17:20
when God has done doing he wants to the
17:23
thing is this
17:24
in the mind of man they have this
17:26
mindset of when they think
17:28
something should happen i'm not even
17:29
talking about the prophets right now i'm
17:31
just talking in general
17:32
if you've never had to make a stand for
17:34
something for and i'm not saying it will
17:36
take this long but this is a good
17:37
example
17:38
if you've never had to really stand and
17:40
not be moved in any way for a year
17:42
for 10 years for 20 40 years
17:46
if you've never been in that place where
17:47
you had to do that and you know what to
17:49
stand
17:50
means guess what standing means you
17:51
don't step back
17:53
so those who are stepping back and
17:55
trying to say well maybe i missed it or
17:56
i just did miss it they're getting a lot
17:58
of pressure from people on the outside
18:00
because in the mind of the other people
18:03
not the prophets
18:04
they believe in the natural this has not
18:06
happened when it should have happened
18:08
well they certainly were not considering
18:10
God's own timeline
18:12
nor have they considered him because
18:14
there was almost nowhere in the bible
18:16
when he was on time according to man
18:20
that's right God is not missing it God
18:22
is
18:23
never late he is right on time just
18:25
because it doesn't line up with your
18:27
time frame
18:28
i've also had to face a lot of that
18:29
stuff i just laughed at the people said
18:31
i love you i'm just going forward with
18:32
God there's nothing i have nothing to
18:34
apologize for
18:35
um but i will pray for you
18:38
so i'm trying to be serious about this
18:40
at the same time but there's such
18:42
celebration on the inside of me the
18:44
excitement on the inside of me
18:45
because God is moving and so is our
18:48
president
18:50
things will begin to happen quickly
18:51
probably in the next day or so
18:53
i'm just saying make sure don't let fear
18:55
overwhelm you or overtake you if you
18:57
feel like you need to make a few
18:58
provisions that's fine to do it
19:01
uh there's not going to be the whole
19:02
shutdown of all the whole financial
19:04
community and all the food's not going
19:06
to disappear and vaporizing to nothing
19:09
that there will probably try to be as
19:10
much as normal uh done
19:12
here i'm talking about from the
19:13
president's point president
19:15
trump's point of view there is no other
19:18
president right now and you need to
19:19
realize that
19:20
people can say what they want to but
19:22
right now he's still officially
19:24
president of the united states and he
19:25
will try to maintain as much as he could
19:28
to have our lives be as normal as
19:30
possible but he also will not let anyone
19:32
come in and
19:33
attack us or take things from us or harm
19:35
us in any way because his heart is for
19:37
us
19:38
and so is God so pretty much God was
19:41
kind of letting people know
19:43
the fraud is about to be exposed in
19:45
great detail
19:46
and there's going to be i've been saying
19:48
this for some time watch the airports
19:50
because that will begin to happen
19:52
also some will jump their ship i'm not
19:54
talking about
19:55
the the i'm not talking about the right
19:57
or you know
19:58
or God's plans or anything i'm not about
20:00
the other side there's people on the
20:02
left
20:02
we begin to realize things are failing
20:05
and crumbling
20:06
and i can say it all day long and a lot
20:08
of people are also understanding
20:10
even some of them that they have no
20:12
foundation
20:14
there's no foundation to any of their
20:15
planet just come see
20:17
comes ha we just have to we have to let
20:20
people think there's violence out there
20:21
we have to let people think that
20:23
the you know the right is all wrong and
20:25
we're the only ones that know what to do
20:27
but they don't really have solid plans
20:29
and i will say this criminal activity is
20:32
all about them it's about selfishness
20:34
it's about greed
20:35
so everybody's in that whole thing for
20:37
their self
20:38
none of them are in it for the good of
20:40
this country that's why they never talk
20:41
about that
20:42
they don't have plans for that and in
20:45
their mind
20:46
if it's been deceived or compromised if
20:48
the cell's been compromised
20:50
they can't even possibly think those
20:52
kind of thoughts of good
20:54
only control and that is going to end
20:56
quickly
20:57
it will not take months for that to
21:00
happen
21:02
uh there are options that our president
21:04
does have that will
21:05
actually keep him president for a while
21:07
i probably can't see anything more than
21:09
that so
21:10
don't look at it as being over
21:13
are you kidding the acting is just about
21:17
to begin
21:18
and like God said are you supposed to
21:20
fear you're supposed to be trembling
21:22
you're supposed to run and hide he said
21:23
to eat cake and celebrate
21:25
and he actually had me do that right
21:27
there during the broadcast when they
21:30
said you have anything to wrap up with
21:32
and i have my piece of cake waiting
21:33
right over here and i said
21:35
actually i do because God said you've
21:38
prayed you fasted you've interceded
21:40
you stood in the gap so right now it's
21:43
time to eat cake and celebrate i brought
21:45
my cake out
21:46
and once again they had a stunned look
21:48
on their face except yeah
21:52
jean gene bailey had it he's like
21:55
he didn't know what to do with that he's
21:56
a neat guy i really like it
21:58
from afar but he didn't i could tell he
22:00
didn't know what to do there hank wasn't
22:01
surprised
22:02
no because he brought it right to you
22:05
when you came to speak at his church is
22:07
that right he did he actually had cake
22:09
waiting on the platform
22:11
he thought that was the greatest thing
22:12
ever and actually people who watch me on
22:15
a regular basis are all over
22:16
the world eating cake and celebrating i
22:19
think that's
22:20
wonderful and so does God you trust
22:23
God in this time when you yourself don't
22:26
know what to do if you don't know what's
22:28
going up but you have given
22:29
all the God and sowed your life in
22:32
prayer and helping
22:33
others and and and keeping people calm
22:36
and keeping peace
22:38
and assuring your family that God is
22:40
going to
22:41
uh be in charge and he is people say
22:43
he's not yes he is
22:45
it says the lord in the fullness thereof
22:47
the the earth and the fullness thereof
22:49
belongs to the lord
22:50
yes he trusts us to steward it but guess
22:53
who it still belongs to
22:55
so i just want to encourage you there
22:56
will be activities taken
22:58
over these next few days they may start
23:00
today they may not start today
23:03
but our president is deciding which
23:05
action he's going to take
23:06
pray for him to have wisdom and he does
23:09
have wise people around him he does have
23:11
God people around him
23:13
and and he is really seriously now
23:16
knowing this that something will have to
23:18
be done to stop the other side from just
23:20
thinking they own everything
23:22
when they don't this place belongs to
23:25
God
23:26
this time literally belongs to God for
23:29
his plans and his purposes
23:31
and God is adamant about that and so
23:34
trust him if you believe in him trust
23:37
him if you don't know him
23:38
you better run to ask jesus christ to be
23:40
your savior and get a spirit of
23:42
celebration on the inside of you
23:44
because you yourself right now probably
23:46
can't do anything more than we have
23:49
stand behind president trump care about
23:51
each other
23:52
consider your neighbors and pray for
23:55
those who are deceived who don't know
23:57
what they're doing
23:59
and that they at least know jesus christ
24:01
because God has
24:02
plans for every person in this world
24:05
uh we all came from him he sent us here
24:08
for a divine purpose
24:10
and timed our birth on the earth and
24:12
they all kept saying well i think God
24:14
knew what he was doing when we were all
24:16
born here i said he timed your birth on
24:17
the earth that he did that from the
24:19
beginning
24:20
and so getting a lot of God and at one
24:23
time a lot of
24:24
revelation especially detailed
24:26
revelation
24:28
and then from God himself is quite uh
24:30
quite a thing to
24:32
to be a part of and i am honored that
24:35
God
24:35
uses me but i didn't get a choice
24:38
because i've already given permission to
24:39
God to
24:40
say anything he wants to whenever he
24:41
wants to and i'll do whatever he tells
24:44
me to do
24:45
that choice has already been made and
24:47
instead of waking up normally at noon
24:49
yesterday
24:49
he came in my room and woke me up at 11
24:51
55 a.m
24:53
yelling yelling will prevail and i mean
24:57
he said
24:58
really loud and then from that moment
25:01
for the next four
25:02
hours was sharing things with me
25:06
to the point where the glory was so
25:08
powerful in there i
25:10
i didn't want to leave but i had to
25:11
because i had to do the other broadcast
25:14
so i just want to encourage you what God
25:15
is very much involved
25:18
in the things that will be going on in
25:20
the decisions of our president to
25:21
bring america back to God
25:25
back to the plans God has to make
25:27
america greater than ever before
25:29
i want to encourage you just stay in
25:32
that
25:33
in that in that position of celebration
25:36
and excitement that yes
25:38
things are going to happen to change
25:41
everything back to what God wants and it
25:44
will be greater than
25:45
was before so stay encouraged and be
25:48
assured
25:48
that God is not ignoring anyone or
25:52
anything he's quite aware of everything
25:56
as we get ready to go into some
25:58
questions about heaven yes i'm going to
25:59
ask you a question about God visiting
26:01
you but
26:02
there's going to be a lot of new people
26:04
since last wednesday because Kat's been
26:06
on every wednesday
26:07
but we're bringing her on today because
26:09
it's these are crucial times we need to
26:11
get it really straight
26:12
um so a lot of people coming on do not
26:15
know that Kat has been to heaven
26:16
thousands of times
26:18
but more than that you've been with the
26:19
lord innumerable times
26:22
and you just alluded to it i was going
26:24
to my my first question on the list was
26:27
could you tell people what that was like
26:30
obviously there are things that you
26:32
can't say what is it like when
26:34
the God of all the universe walks into
26:37
the room shouting i mean you've told me
26:39
a couple times that you were shaking and
26:40
trembling
26:41
after four hours so tell us what that
26:44
was like
26:44
and then did you just sit there listen
26:46
the whole time i'm actually still
26:48
trembling i my hands are still traveling
26:52
because there's still um there's still
26:55
uh a good portion of his presence here
26:58
and even when i was trying to lie down i
27:01
tried at like six
27:02
seven eight eight thirty my husband was
27:04
waking up and i went
27:06
um i'm trying to just rest here and at
27:09
least
27:09
rest but uh but God was everywhere
27:12
in my in my room those who don't know
27:15
uh right now we actually live in our
27:18
offices he made us turn our home
27:20
into our offices which is literally
27:22
taking over
27:23
our shipping receiving the studio i'm
27:25
sitting in right now is in what was our
27:27
home
27:28
our front area is our reception area and
27:31
so this entire whole facility
27:33
now belongs to God because all of this
27:36
belongs to him
27:38
so i am accustomed i can't say it's ever
27:41
a
27:42
normal feeling i am accustomed to him
27:45
doing that without any warning
27:46
whatsoever to
27:48
me every now and then he'll let me know
27:50
um i'm going to come to see you tomorrow
27:52
but he normally doesn't do that he shows
27:54
up
27:55
and especially when he's ready to start
27:57
doing things he just walks in he starts
27:58
speaking to me like
28:01
i gave him permission right so i tell
28:02
people the time please tell him i give
28:04
you permission to use me any way you
28:06
want to
28:07
you need to say something that will draw
28:10
him to you
28:11
and that that shows him you're serious
28:13
if you speak it your words are powerful
28:15
if you speak it
28:17
you're making a covenant with God to to
28:19
allow him to use you and it may be the
28:21
most
28:22
unusual things it may be inconvenient
28:25
uncomfortable that's probably God
28:28
absolutely out of this world some of the
28:30
things that he'll make you declare for
28:32
him
28:33
but this is it when he finds someone he
28:35
can do that with
28:36
he will do it on a continual basis so
28:39
yes when he walked in yesterday
28:41
my eyes flew open and i was wide awake
28:44
he actually turns the ringer off on my
28:47
phone because everybody knows i never
28:49
turn my ringer off
28:51
and uh it was only off the other day
28:53
when i when i had
28:54
done the the um uh the the thing with
28:58
you you know the broadcast with you i
28:59
had turned my ringer off
29:00
uh but i had turned it on later because
29:02
i was talking to people
29:04
like four in the morning the other day i
29:05
was talking to roy fields people who
29:07
know i'm up late that i know will call
29:09
me
29:10
to have conversations but that ringer
29:12
was on when i went to bed but it wasn't
29:14
on when i woke up he had turned it off i
29:17
looked down and many people had tried
29:18
calling me
29:19
and God said do not call them back and
29:21
do not look at your text he said i want
29:23
to tell you some things
29:25
and then he began to just share things
29:27
with and he actually had me text my
29:29
family and say
29:30
please do not interrupt me do not text
29:32
me do not come
29:33
in do not try to call me on the phone
29:35
God is with me
29:37
yes they're used to that they're used to
29:39
that happening
29:41
isn't it you texted me too i i've never
29:43
seen you do that but you texted me too
29:45
and i thought whoa
29:46
okay i'm not going to interrupt her you
29:47
know but but it was an awesome thing
29:49
standing on the outside or being on the
29:51
outside to know
29:53
that the God of the of the universe is
29:55
sitting there in Kat's room
29:56
talking to her yes he was and he was
30:00
pretty adamant about what he had to say
30:02
and
30:03
um i did not know in the beginning what
30:05
was going to happen
30:06
he said you will text greg um
30:09
not grow you expect you will text gene
30:12
bailey and tell him
30:13
that i am with you right now and that i
30:16
will call you back later because he had
30:18
actually tried to call me i didn't even
30:19
know what it was about
30:20
and a few seconds later he goes can you
30:22
be on my show tonight at seven o'clock
30:24
see this is the way
30:25
God opens a door out of obedience of
30:28
doing that that's how i got
30:29
on now kenneth copeland's victory
30:31
channel that's how i got on flashpoint
30:33
uh because i obeyed God he said you text
30:36
him right now and tell him this
30:37
and he he wasn't gonna miss that it
30:39
wasn't it was not the original plan to
30:41
bring me on there
30:42
but they're all really glad that they
30:44
did
30:46
wow your acts of obedience even the
30:49
small acts now i
30:50
God trained me in very small ways in the
30:53
beginning
30:54
but got me to the point where it didn't
30:55
matter what he said or
30:57
or how he said to do i always obeyed
31:00
those who are willing and obedient shall
31:02
eat the fat of the land that means that
31:04
you'll be a part of the great things of
31:05
God people have many different
31:07
interpretations of that
31:08
that means you'll be a part of the great
31:10
things of God and you will have the
31:12
prosperity
31:13
and the joy of the lord with you all the
31:15
time because of your obedience even
31:18
jesus said pray that my people be
31:19
willing in the day of my power
31:22
well this is not the day of christ's
31:23
breath this is the day of his power
31:26
where great things will happen so
31:28
but when you're in a moment you're very
31:31
honored
31:32
all of you that you're alive and a part
31:34
of something
31:35
so epic that God is doing they'll talk
31:38
about this for
31:39
a long long long time about the goodness
31:43
of God and what he did and what our
31:45
president
31:46
did to take our country back for us so
31:49
you're not going to miss it uh i
31:52
wouldn't go by what the normal the
31:53
regular news is right now but
31:55
even that heads up that's going to
31:58
change
32:00
that's very good it's going to change
32:02
but there will be a network that will
32:04
actually speak the truth and give
32:05
unbiased opinions and it's coming
32:08
and uh so you need to rejoice that
32:11
you're alive now
32:12
don't let fear control you that's all
32:14
the enemy
32:16
if you're in fear then someone's
32:18
listening to the enemy and if your
32:19
friends don't understand what's going on
32:21
just say trust God i am
32:23
if you don't have anything else to say
32:24
trust God i am okay that will
32:27
bring hope to people there's simple
32:29
things you can do
32:30
you want to if you like you want some
32:33
cash other than
32:34
make yourself feel better then go ahead
32:36
and do it and just let people know you
32:38
don't have to be in fear
32:40
this is not a time of torment or extreme
32:43
lack
32:43
of extreme suffering it is not those
32:46
days and so he has not appointed us
32:50
he's appointed you to be great and to be
32:52
a part of greatness
32:54
that's good well countless let me ask
32:55
you a few questions and we'll get into
32:57
questions about heaven and when we talk
32:59
about heaven
33:00
then it transfers many people especially
33:02
if you're new to this
33:03
then someone wants to know about their
33:05
guardian angel which i'm about to ask
33:06
we try not to duplicate questions but
33:08
we'll ask a variant of the question
33:11
which i'm about to do
33:12
and then sometimes that gets into what
33:13
did the bible mean when it says such and
33:15
such
33:15
so it kind of all connects that really
33:18
this really is about questions about
33:19
heaven but these things do connect
33:21
so i'm going to ask you two questions at
33:22
the same time from two different people
33:25
this one said i know i've heard some
33:27
people know the names of their
33:29
angels meaning their guardian angels
33:32
does Kat and how can i find out the name
33:34
of mine
33:36
and the other question was um do we have
33:39
the right to either
33:41
ask our angel to do something or should
33:43
we ask the father
33:45
or ask God to to ask our angel to do
33:48
something so they're trying to figure
33:50
out this whole guardian angel
33:52
how personal how utilitarian i guess so
33:55
what are your thoughts
33:56
i will start with this God is the one
33:59
who sent them
34:00
all right and your guardian angel comes
34:02
at the time of your conception
34:05
they don't just eventually show up
34:07
sometime down here
34:09
from the time you're conceived they are
34:11
sent and they're waiting outside
34:13
of the mother for that child to be born
34:16
and they are with you
34:17
from that moment all the way to the end
34:19
of your life and they
34:21
literally will help escort you home to
34:23
heaven so you're not going to avoid
34:24
being around them
34:26
and yes i do know the name of all my
34:28
angels i didn't ask them
34:31
just so people know that that's up to
34:33
you if you feel like you want to
34:35
i don't know that they will respond it
34:37
just it depends on the boundaries God
34:39
has set for them
34:41
and some people are different than
34:42
others they think differently they
34:44
respond differently
34:46
and certainly um they're not to be
34:48
worshipped everybody knows that
34:50
and but some people think you should
34:52
have nothing to do with them which is a
34:53
little silly
34:54
they're with you all the time it's
34:56
perfectly fine even before i knew my
34:58
angels names i'd turn around and say
35:00
thank you for putting up with me you
35:02
might say that
35:04
that would actually make them laugh
35:06
because we are humans okay
35:08
and let me tell you this they have
35:10
personalities
35:11
and they have their own little likes
35:13
they like different colors they like
35:15
different things
35:16
they would like for you to spend more
35:18
time with God they would like for you to
35:19
make their life easier
35:22
by not choosing darkness whatever you do
35:25
don't use hell's language and don't use
35:26
profanity they don't like it
35:30
and that is healthy language but if you
35:32
ever wondered if hell has a language
35:34
yeah it's called profanity
35:38
but your angel was sent to guard and
35:41
keep you
35:41
and people think my angel never did
35:43
anything i will assure you of this and i
35:46
do know this when you go home to heaven
35:47
one day
35:48
you will get to know your angel okay
35:50
you'll get to know a lot about them and
35:52
they're going to have a lot of questions
35:53
for you
35:54
i always tell people that but there's a
35:56
place you get to go
35:57
that is like mini theaters now that you
36:00
can't picture a movie theater
36:02
it will play entire life minus the sins
36:06
if you've repented and you want and
36:08
there will be no sin in it
36:10
but all those crazy silly things you did
36:12
growing up they will be there in living
36:14
color
36:16
and you will see your angel with you
36:19
in these mini movies and you will
36:22
realize
36:23
how many times they intervened on your
36:25
behalf
36:26
and kept you probably from either making
36:28
a big mistake or your life being taken
36:31
so those things uh you'll find that out
36:34
later but
36:36
more and more in the days we're entering
36:38
into the world would become more and
36:39
more
36:40
spiritually oriented meaning the veil
36:42
that's already very thin
36:44
between the spirit realm and the
36:45
physical realm at one point will become
36:47
really super thin
36:49
and many people will see their angels
36:51
and they will know their names um
36:54
i don't know that they would they they
36:56
have like i said they have a boundary
36:58
put around them like there's so many
36:59
things that they would be allowed to say
37:00
to you
37:01
or maybe even go with you
37:04
to do something other than something
37:06
that you would like to go do with them
37:07
they may or may not be permitted to do
37:09
that
37:10
and sometimes they won't respond even if
37:12
you do see them that doesn't mean that
37:14
they don't like you that means
37:15
they're focused on what they were sent
37:17
for uh
37:18
but i do know do you know my angels
37:20
names i don't always call them by name
37:22
i'm always thanking them for
37:24
protecting me for obeying God when you
37:27
sent them
37:28
that they care i will tell you this they
37:31
care very much about you
37:33
they're always for you they will defend
37:35
you sometimes
37:36
around other angels because they know if
37:39
you're acting up you're doing
37:41
a wrong there may be other angels not
37:44
necessarily ones assigned to you that'll
37:45
say hey you must have a mess on your
37:47
hands
37:48
being real right now okay
37:51
these are real beings real personalities
37:54
they do have
37:55
a place of their own in heaven they're
37:57
not just shoving on the hill somewhere
37:59
um some of them even have pets in heaven
38:02
and so
38:03
oh try to help watch over your pet too
38:06
and i can just let you know they're busy
38:08
trust me they're busy
38:10
24 hours a day they don't sleep
38:13
they do get a break everyone has more
38:15
than one because one gets to go home for
38:17
rnr while the other one is still with
38:20
you
38:21
and so that's probably about the most
38:23
i'm going to talk about them right now
38:25
but they're very very they care very
38:27
much for you
38:29
but when you do things like obeying God
38:31
or just saying a kind word to people
38:33
you absolutely delight them
38:37
that's awesome you know and about i'm
38:39
going to ask you the next question here
38:41
but i'm just going to throw this
38:42
in a few years ago because i'm not
38:44
really as a seer that you are you can't
38:46
see my angels so and i
38:47
tried to hear his name or say what's
38:49
your name and i just couldn't hear it
38:51
so i finally i said okay you're not
38:53
giving me your name so from here on your
38:55
name is stan
38:56
until you tell me differently so
39:09
you'd be surprised how many people do
39:10
that and the angels actually laugh
39:15
this is a funny thing God gives
39:17
everybody a nickname that
39:18
that name you get when you get to heaven
39:20
on the white diamond the white stone is
39:22
not a river rock it's a diamond and God
39:24
puts a new little nickname for you that
39:26
just you and he know
39:27
God's all in the nickname so the angels
39:29
are perfectly fine if you give them one
39:31
uh my one my one older brother which you
39:34
hear me talk about a lot
39:35
he talks a little bit differently to his
39:37
angels i think they have to have triple
39:39
grace to be around him
39:44
but yeah he's definitely personnel a
39:45
different personality than me
39:47
most of my family rooms are very
39:49
different from each other
39:50
but we were all taught to love people no
39:52
matter who you were or where you were
39:54
from my dad told us about love the love
39:57
of God he loved his enemies
39:59
and it wasn't necessarily easy if you
40:01
were a warrior growing up in my family
40:03
that wasn't the easiest thing to see
40:05
your dad just beat up with words and
40:06
everything and then he kindly turns
40:08
around and asks people would you like to
40:10
go get a coffee and donut i really think
40:11
i have something interesting
40:15
some of my brothers weren't happy about
40:16
that i just went right along with my dad
40:18
and that's why i have love in me some
40:20
people think i know i'm fierce against
40:22
evil
40:23
i'm fierce against the darkness i do uh
40:26
i do
40:26
i am a warrior in the spirit realm and
40:30
my brother doesn't think i wore at all i
40:31
don't want to go kill people
40:33
however he probably would not mind if
40:35
they were bad so
40:39
triple triple busy i think he's got
40:41
about nine or ten angels
40:44
whatever well let me ask here's the next
40:49
question
40:50
i'm just gonna read this as a shirt this
40:52
one says i think it's a woman i can't
40:53
actually i don't know because i don't
40:55
have a name
40:55
my dad was abusive verbally and mentally
40:58
he was sick for about one year before he
41:00
passed
41:01
in 2018 i hope he repented before he
41:04
died
41:05
how can i know if my dad is in heaven
41:08
well the number one thing is this did
41:10
you ever pray
41:12
did you ever pray and stand in the gap
41:14
from and said God i'm just believing
41:16
that my
41:16
my dad is going to become saved he's
41:20
going to give himself to jesus christ so
41:21
his life can become my testimony and a
41:24
witness now i say that
41:25
that would be even in heaven because
41:27
people who get saved even on their
41:29
deathbed they can't wait to testify when
41:31
they get up to heaven
41:32
about the graciousness and the goodness
41:34
of God and they will even say my family
41:36
members were standing for me
41:37
i probably had no no chance whatsoever
41:40
but because of the goodness of God
41:42
in christ that he met me at my death and
41:45
i received him there's no way i was
41:46
going to miss doing that
41:48
and i remember the first time christ
41:50
caught me up to heaven
41:51
he actually told me this before he
41:53
brought me back one time tell everybody
41:55
to not
41:56
ever stop standing for their family
41:58
members it gives me permission to pursue
42:01
them
42:01
even to the very end of their life
42:04
because i have the keys now to hell
42:07
death in the grave and if they will make
42:08
a stand
42:10
and not turn from that stand then they
42:12
will be delighted to find their family
42:14
member in heaven
42:15
so that should be a christ answer for
42:18
something
42:19
so there's great hope and a great
42:21
promise we have
42:22
as believers that isn't given to other
42:24
people so make sure you're making that
42:26
stand for your family members it could
42:27
be somebody you love like family
42:30
and sometimes it's the only way they
42:32
actually get there so
42:34
and then this person is talking don't go
42:36
talking bad about them
42:38
right and this person who asked this
42:40
question
42:41
let's say he or she thinks to himself
42:45
thanks to them so i i don't know if i
42:47
ever did that
42:48
that doesn't preclude 10 or 15 other
42:52
people
42:52
who may have been praying for the same
42:54
person right who could have accomplished
42:56
the same thing yeah so
42:58
yes the older i get if they're the more
43:01
older i get the more i realize that
43:02
God's looking
43:03
for excuses to give if i can put it that
43:06
way
43:07
he's looking for excuses loopholes legal
43:10
loopholes
43:17
you're not even considering that there's
43:20
a scripture that says that God will keep
43:22
your family and keep you
43:23
up to a thousand generations i have
43:26
family members that i know
43:28
uh probably three or four generations
43:31
ago five generations ago
43:32
that stood in the gap for all of their
43:35
family members
43:37
up to a thousand generations
43:40
they would have the opportunity to know
43:42
jesus christ
43:43
these were really powerful people and i
43:46
know my grandmother my dad's mother was
43:47
one of those people
43:49
i would hear her pray and she was
43:51
staying in the gap for all of her
43:53
children all of her grandchildren all of
43:55
her great-grandchildren her
43:56
great-great-grandchildren up to a
43:57
thousand generations would be a living
43:59
testimony of the saving power of jesus
44:01
christ
44:02
and she was making that stand right then
44:04
and there for as long as it took as long
44:06
as they were here
44:08
that they would come to know christ you
44:10
may have had someone say that about you
44:12
or say that about your family
44:14
jesus will not let their words drop to
44:18
the ground
44:20
so so so good okay here's another one
44:23
if somebody is saved and they didn't
44:25
give the details which is fine
44:26
if somebody is saved but they're not
44:28
living right
44:30
and of course we don't know what they
44:32
mean by they're not living right there's
44:33
so many possibilities
44:34
if they're saved but they're not living
44:36
right will they still go to heaven
44:38
that was the question i think christ is
44:40
the one who has to make that decision
44:42
i think this is what God said if they
44:45
receive my son
44:46
even as a little child i put a hook in
44:48
them
44:51
not like a fish hook but he puts a hook
44:53
around them
44:54
that he can if necessary pull them into
44:58
him
44:58
even if it takes all the way up to the
45:00
point where they die
45:01
that they made a decision at one time in
45:04
their life for christ
45:06
and he has the right to take those words
45:09
and do something with those words
45:11
if you yourself did that and you're
45:13
wondering i can tell you right now you
45:15
may as well this is what you should tell
45:16
people in
45:17
churches you may as well lay down roll
45:20
over
45:20
and give up because jesus christ is
45:22
going to get you
45:24
why not leave a good testimony of your
45:27
life
45:27
here on the earth and not waste all the
45:30
way up to the time when you die
45:32
and people are very very happy that they
45:34
didn't waste their life
45:36
but i do know and have heard people in
45:38
heaven that
45:39
actually got saved on their deathbed or
45:41
at the moment they died
45:43
and they are the happiest people in
45:45
heaven they don't care if someone's
45:47
attention is bigger than theirs they
45:49
don't have a trash bin to live in they
45:50
have a beautiful place to live in that
45:52
jesus gives them
45:53
but they understand the mercy and grace
45:56
of God and they're
45:57
happy for everyone else if someone has a
45:59
massive mansion because of their life
46:01
being poured out
46:02
or just being kind every day of their
46:04
life you will be
46:05
highly rewarded by God no one is jealous
46:09
no one is sad in heaven and they will
46:12
rejoice continually to see
46:14
people get the rewards and they're so
46:16
grateful to God
46:17
that they didn't go to hell so there's
46:20
no sadness in heaven and even though you
46:22
remember
46:22
things up to a certain point when time
46:25
is no more
46:25
all those old uh memories will be taken
46:28
from you and it says the form of things
46:30
remember no more that's at the very end
46:32
of the bible
46:33
because people celebrate parts of their
46:36
life and they can remember parts of
46:37
their life
46:39
they had on the earth that were fun they
46:40
were exciting they do remember
46:42
the goodness of God every time he
46:44
rescued him even though they had given
46:46
up and wanted to throw their life away
46:48
he wouldn't let them do that
46:49
so God is definitely looking for every
46:52
way he possibly
46:53
can to get people into heaven he's not
46:56
an unloving God that wants to send
46:58
people to hell
46:59
he just can't let evil into heaven
47:02
that's so good
47:02
yeah that's true okay now this Kat this
47:05
one keeps being asked
47:06
over and over so i'm going to finally
47:08
get i'm going to give you two
47:10
questions blended together uh because
47:12
this
47:13
just continues to be asked if there's no
47:15
sin in heaven how is satan able to rebel
47:18
and sin causing it with sin causing his
47:21
downfall
47:23
and he says non-believers keep asking
47:26
her
47:26
him or her this um and then the the
47:29
second question
47:30
is even if God gets us all to heaven and
47:33
there's no
47:34
sin how do we know that this won't
47:36
happen again that some sin is going to
47:38
be found in somebody
47:40
no that won't ever happen
47:41
[Laughter]
47:44
when you're when when you're born again
47:47
all of that sin is wiped out of your
47:49
life like it never happened God doesn't
47:51
remember that in your life
47:53
and uh if you make it into heaven by
47:57
through some people have to repent go
47:59
for a while don't repent God i would
48:00
rather just keep going forward
48:02
i don't waste time having to do that
48:04
anymore i got to a place in my life
48:05
where i decided i'm just going to stick
48:07
with jesus and he's it
48:09
and that is the best place to be in but
48:12
because of God's mercy
48:13
he does and let me tell you angels that
48:16
fall
48:17
don't ever get a second chance i can
48:19
tell you that and the thing about sin in
48:21
heaven was there never was sin in heaven
48:23
before lucifer
48:24
it said iniquity was found or born
48:28
in him he is the very first one
48:31
who fell from the place God had him in
48:35
chose sin and chose wickedness
48:39
wanted to take over heaven and wanted to
48:42
now he couldn't throw God off the throne
48:43
because he wasn't a creator he couldn't
48:44
create
48:45
but he came to the point where thought
48:46
i'm smarter than him i'm taken over
48:49
and he began to deal with wickedness
48:53
even in heaven God knew everything that
48:54
was going on he allowed every single
48:56
angel to be tempted
48:58
that's why you have to be tempted that's
49:01
why when you're born you have to make a
49:03
decision for christ
49:05
and but he never got a second chance
49:08
there is no more sin in heaven there's
49:10
no chance of sin
49:11
ever being in heaven or in eternity
49:14
number one
49:14
when the end comes those who never
49:17
wanted christ
49:18
will not be allowed anywhere near us
49:20
that where the where the lake of fire
49:22
will be
49:23
will not be on the earth near the earth
49:25
anywhere about it
49:26
nobody will have any power there there's
49:28
no chance of anybody ever getting out of
49:30
that
49:32
we will have a sinless eternity and
49:35
this is the other thing is on the day
49:37
that the dead in christ shall rise and
49:39
you get your glorified body
49:42
you can't sin once that happens there's
49:45
no
49:45
sin not even in your anywhere in your
49:47
makeup or your thinking
49:49
and so when the day the dead and christ
49:51
shall rise that's your body your body
49:53
sleeps when you die
49:55
but your spirit man in your soul they
49:58
are together they go to live in heaven
50:00
and there is no sin up there there's no
50:03
fear no sin no control
50:05
no regret no rejection it does not
50:08
exist in the atmosphere of heaven when
50:11
lucifer was
50:12
cast out with every single wicked angel
50:15
who goes uh lucifer over God
50:19
every one of them were thrown out and so
50:22
therefore
50:24
has been thrown out of heaven and that's
50:26
why you have to receive christ because
50:28
it wipes it out of you
50:29
nobody goes to heaven with sin in them
50:32
it's totally removed so you don't ever
50:35
have to worry about the ever showing up
50:36
anywhere not not now in heaven and not
50:39
on the new earth or anywhere in eternity
50:41
there will be no sin that's so good
50:45
contact okay here's one uh this one i
50:48
i tell people i keep trying to ask the
50:50
question to you that the most people are
50:51
asking this one keeps being asked
50:53
yet have you seen what people have gone
50:55
to heaven and said there's actually
50:57
warehouses in heaven with completely
50:59
healed body parts
51:01
is that true does that exist and how is
51:03
that accessed
51:04
from here what's the because i've heard
51:06
of it myself and i've even i
51:08
this is me talking now i remember
51:10
praying that like send the parts
51:13
in heaven that i need i can't say that
51:16
yet that i've seen that happen
51:18
for me so i this this is not my question
51:20
but i added that part to it
51:22
i've actually been to the body parts
51:24
warehouse several times so yes
51:26
it really does exist and they have every
51:28
kind of body part that God has ever made
51:31
and they're alive so i i'm going to keep
51:34
your mind
51:34
and just do something to your mind right
51:36
now so i tell people take your natural
51:37
mind and sit
51:38
on the shelf and just here with your
51:40
spirit i'm talking about heaven i'm
51:43
talking about where all creation took
51:44
place and the one who made everything is
51:46
there
51:48
i can even take a moment to explain this
51:51
the father
51:52
how this creation thing happened was the
51:54
father and the word
51:55
worked together that's why it's a
51:58
three-in-one it has the ability to go
52:00
inside of each other go places and do
52:02
things this is what they did before the
52:04
earth was even made
52:05
and so the father would go somewhere
52:07
where there was nothing
52:09
he would speak what he wanted
52:12
and the word which is christ
52:15
the word would step out and he would
52:17
make
52:18
whatever it was God wanted now the word
52:20
says
52:21
when God made it he looked at it and
52:23
considered it if he liked it it remained
52:25
if he didn't like what he had said he
52:27
wanted then it disappeared so you have
52:29
to understand there was a process
52:31
so they made everything together it
52:33
wasn't just
52:34
one doing it but that's why it says
52:36
there was nothing that was not made that
52:37
wasn't made by the word
52:39
because he was with God God spoke the
52:42
word that he wanted what he wanted and
52:44
the word that's why it was his name
52:46
stepped out and made it and then of
52:48
course later the word came and died
52:51
the third the a member of the trinity
52:53
and then after that he was known as
52:55
yeshua
52:56
our savior our lord our king jesus
52:59
christ
53:00
and that's another question i'll answer
53:01
for free people say what does jesus want
53:03
to be called
53:04
any of those as long as you call him
53:08
just call her right um this is
53:12
this i think she's asked this a couple
53:14
of times but
53:16
um no it's he mark a guy named mark
53:19
wants to know
53:20
he knows that not everybody gets to go
53:22
to heaven and visit heaven
53:24
but he wants to know if we all did that
53:26
if we were all going and visiting so
53:28
that virtually all believers
53:31
armed with the knowledge that we have in
53:33
heaven how how would you
53:35
think we would be living i i understand
53:37
this question he's going
53:38
i hear i see what he's getting he's
53:39
trying to if we see all the right things
53:42
that God wants to see
53:43
will we come down here and be just like
53:46
on fire for God i guess he's asking
53:50
oh you mean if you've been up there and
53:51
experienced it with that change yeah i
53:53
think
53:54
i think yeah he's asking how would we
53:56
all be living if we all saw what you saw
53:58
i think it's
53:59
a lot happier really okay
54:02
you'd be happy almost all the time uh
54:06
and the holy spirit just told me you
54:08
didn't finish the last question
54:10
whoa what was that oh what was the other
54:13
parts warehouse
54:16
side track i've been to the body parts
54:18
warehouse they actually have a procedure
54:20
they use now
54:21
as far as you asking and getting here i
54:24
won't answer that i'll answer the part
54:26
about what the body parts where
54:27
household looks like
54:28
they actually have a huge reception area
54:30
it doesn't look like a warehouse like
54:32
you see
54:33
boxes stacked like in a storage unit or
54:36
something it's very classy
54:38
it's very well designed most of the
54:41
things that hold the body parts are
54:43
clear and transparent you can actually
54:45
see
54:46
eyeballs rolling around you can see the
54:48
lungs
54:49
lungs breathing really
54:53
i'm i'm a girl i am a girly girl i don't
54:56
like things like that
54:57
i never took whatever they called it in
54:59
the in school where you took body
55:01
animals apparently oh yeah at school
55:05
they made what is it called
55:07
yeah the other the biology where you had
55:10
it you had uh
55:11
yeah oh no i would use i took three
55:14
years of earth science i'm
55:16
really good about the about the stars
55:18
and the heavens and the planets i had a
55:20
lot of understanding how grass is formed
55:22
that part the weather i'm very well
55:24
educated don't know much of anything and
55:26
don't want to know what goes on in my
55:28
body
55:31
if there's a dead toad i'll say God just
55:33
let it go to heaven somewhere but i
55:34
don't want to look at the dead toad okay
55:36
and um so but you can't escape
55:40
it if you're in the body barracks
55:41
warehouse and i've heard almost
55:42
everybody say the exact same thing
55:45
they were taking down these beautiful
55:46
hallways they go in certain doors where
55:48
say all the eyes were kept or all the
55:50
lungs the feet the hands they're like
55:52
alive people
55:55
and i'm talking about physical body
55:58
parts okay you can't bring a spiritual
56:00
body part down
56:01
and stick it in your flesh body and
56:03
think that's going to work okay
56:06
your spiritual body doesn't need body
56:08
parts why is it so hard for us to access
56:11
those Kat why is it so hard
56:13
to get those parts down here
56:16
it has there's so many dynamics to all
56:19
of that i would just tell people don't
56:21
give up
56:21
because more and more and i will say
56:24
there is a season
56:26
coming probably not this first decade i
56:29
don't know about the second decade
56:31
but the father did tell me their plan is
56:33
to one day
56:34
empty the body parts warehouse and that
56:37
means there'll be a time on the earth
56:39
where people won't have
56:40
uh you know maimed or missing or not
56:44
working body parts
56:46
and i don't know how close that will get
56:48
towards like the
56:49
end because up until the end happens and
56:52
we're talking about perilous times
56:53
tribulation you know a few years and
56:55
then
56:55
if that part's over that part's over to
56:57
the millennial rain comes
56:59
and uh so i do know there'll be a time
57:02
when
57:02
the there will be no people lacking body
57:05
parts
57:06
and when he said that i didn't know if
57:07
he meant the body of christ if he meant
57:09
the whole world i didn't understand that
57:11
so
57:11
there will be mass mass
57:15
healings where some of those healings
57:16
are entire
57:18
uh bodies of people whether it's in a
57:20
tent meeting or if it's a stadium
57:21
heating
57:22
meeting there'll be times when everyone
57:24
in that one meeting everyone who's there
57:26
gets body parts replaced
57:28
that is coming and i don't know if it's
57:30
just God's timing for that i don't know
57:32
i do know it's happened many times i
57:34
actually do know people that had
57:36
gotten new body parts and and actually
57:39
was in the meeting
57:40
where that actually did happen and so
57:42
don't give up
57:44
thanking God for this is what i always
57:45
tell people don't
57:47
ask every day you ask and then you show
57:50
your faith by
57:51
thanking him that it's coming and i know
57:54
that does for some reason accelerate it
57:56
coming
57:57
um i know people serve God love God
58:00
anyway
58:01
ones who can't walk they don't have legs
58:03
if their legs are missing
58:05
but i have seen angels bring body parts
58:09
and put them in the person they come in
58:11
a gift box this is crazy
58:13
in this place really there's a
58:14
requisition that does make its way
58:17
however an angel or somebody brings a
58:19
requisition to this
58:20
entrance he gives a requisition for the
58:23
body part to be released they take it in
58:25
there they register it then they go and
58:27
get the body part they bring this gift
58:29
box to this other angel their courier
58:32
angels they're part of gabriel's group
58:34
and then the angel comes down to the
58:36
there's a whole tribes of them not just
58:38
one
58:39
and they will walk through the person
58:41
with that box whether it's a new heart
58:43
new lungs a new spine they walk to that
58:46
person they go up the other side and the
58:47
box is gone
58:49
and that body part has been put in that
58:51
person i do know that's how they do it
58:53
so i can help that way
58:55
but every kind of part is up there in
58:57
this place
58:58
it's really huge and every time i'm
59:01
taking i try to avert my eye
59:05
even in heaven even in heaven
59:08
not in your head rolling around so but
59:11
they're
59:11
already alive it's not like they have to
59:13
be made alive they're alive and living
59:15
when they're put
59:16
in you so standing straight
59:19
thanking God for that that you're
59:21
expecting it
59:24
don't get discouraged and step back
59:26
people will even laugh at you i do know
59:28
somebody who for
59:29
six years stood passionately stood
59:32
for their for them to have new legs they
59:34
could hardly walk
59:35
and people laughed they brought shoes to
59:38
church with them every every service
59:40
saying i'm going to wear these home and
59:41
people got where they ignored them but
59:43
they didn't stop saying it
59:44
and one day they came they had like a
59:47
church function fellowship
59:49
and right in front of everybody there
59:51
God came in and gave two brand new legs
59:53
to that girl
59:55
and she walked out wearing her new shoes
59:57
so i'm just telling you
59:59
it does happen and because of these days
60:01
of greatness
60:03
not destruction because of the greatness
60:06
of God that we're entering into these
60:08
great days of glory
60:09
you will see it more and more happening
60:11
and people who've been waiting and
60:13
thanking God for 10 years
60:15
well probably maybe not even 10 years
60:17
sometimes it's just going to happen
60:18
immediately sometimes
60:20
they've been in an accident lost body
60:22
parts by the time they get to the
60:23
hospital
60:24
God's going to shock doctors and they'll
60:26
already be replaced in the person's body
60:29
that's amazing well kat i had you and i
60:31
agreed we'd get you out of there by
60:33
quarter after because you have another
60:34
appointment so we're right there
60:36
do you want to um tell people quickly
60:39

that he's willing to put himself
64:31
out there you know and and to put true
64:34
prophets and who give true words
64:36
and do pray for all those who are now
64:38
stepping back
64:40
if you know prophets you've been saying
64:41
like for weeks and months now
64:43
that and all of a sudden they say well i
64:45
was wrong pray for them they probably
64:47
weren't wrong
64:47
it's just that they don't understand
64:49
God's timing God takes his time to do
64:51
what he wants to
64:53
and you have to be willing to receive
64:54
that and you do need to keep
64:56
celebration in your heart what comes in
64:59
these next few days

03:16
just
03:16
know i understand why God can trust some
03:19
people and some he's still working on
03:23
well what kind of things would you like
03:25
to say about the election that is yet
03:27
still in progress right now
03:29
well everybody thinks it's still in
03:31
progress i'll wink
03:34
i'll tell you about all you're going to
03:36
get me as far as that and
03:38
i should give everybody a lesson about
03:40
covert activities
03:41
not talking about this one
03:45
another clue when you have a covert you
03:48
cannot say
03:49
things people let's picture you as as
03:52
somebody
03:52
of importance in some country and all
03:55
kinds of things are going on and you
03:56
have to call in your covert team to do
03:58
stuff okay
03:59
are you gonna broadcast what you're
04:01
doing where
04:02
are you what's going on what is the time
04:05
schedule
04:06
absolutely not you just have to have a
04:09
good poker face
04:10
no i'm not saying to play poker let me
04:12
tell you people who take one thing and
04:14
they go wow
04:16
i would never stop being excited and
04:18
i'll tell you why
04:20
because of what God said
04:23
if it's his plan you can't abandon that
04:26
plan because it didn't happen in
04:28
your time frame right most covert
04:31
activities they
04:32
they do guess what they have a plan but
04:34
it gets changed five times so
04:36
what good would it be if they were going
04:38
to tell you and there's so many
04:39
parameters about being successful
04:42
in that plan if you've got a lot of
04:44
people that are involved
04:46
a lot of things that have to be prepared
04:49
uh
04:49
even if you reach the point where it's
04:52
really over for the other side
04:54
you can't announce that until you've got
04:56
everything in place everything is ready
04:58
to present for justice to come
05:02
you can't be telling people about that
05:04
guess what you trust
05:05
no matter what it is this is good life
05:07
lesson you trust you trust
05:10
God if you're a believer and if you're
05:12
not you just trust and hope that
05:14
something is going to happen
05:15
if you have confidence in and who's in
05:18
charge
05:19
then that should help you some but just
05:21
because it doesn't happen
05:22
every day all day long it doesn't mean
05:25
they're sitting on a log somewhere
05:27
playing parcheesi okay because some
05:30
people kind of act like that and i know
05:32
people who've
05:32
never in this time in this generation
05:35
especially
05:36
no one in certain generations have had
05:39
ever had to taste or believe or trust
05:41
for something
05:42
really important that would impact your
05:45
entire life but we are in that time
05:47
right now
05:48
but the good thing about this time is
05:50
God really has a say in it
05:53
and your prayers it's like your prayers
05:56
are like
05:56
fuel okay it's like fuel and when that
05:59
fuel reaches a certain level
06:01
that's it the action can take place
06:04
well i will tell you in this situation
06:07
that has happened
06:08
i'm not saying to stop praying start
06:10
thinking
06:12
when you feel in the spirit if you don't
06:14
know if you don't hear God if you're not
06:15
a prophet
06:16
and i need to tell some of them and the
06:20
other one's all gone
06:22
you know who you are too and let me you
06:24
still have time to jump back on the
06:26
train
06:27
if you if you if you step back anytime
06:30
during this thing thinking
06:32
it had all failed or you were wrong or
06:35
for heaven's sakes God was wrong
06:37
get back on it before it's too late
06:40
you'll be so happy you did
06:41
because you'll be on the side nobody
06:43
will listen to when this thing is over
06:45
the ones who've stayed
06:47
with their stand with God the prophets
06:50
who stayed and stood
06:52
and didn't go to the darkness who didn't
06:55
who didn't they didn't give up you'll be
06:58
so
06:59
accelerated by God because he knows and
07:02
has shown
07:03
he knows already but he has shown to
07:05
this world who can we trust who can you
07:07
trust to hear
07:08
in any time not just when in a time of
07:10
crisis
07:11
but in any time of your life
07:14
don't lose your place on the path and
07:17
God is really serious about this he's
07:18
saying this to all the prophets
07:20
don't lose your place in the path where
07:22
you were because when you step
07:23
back you know what the word says you're
07:24
not fit you're not fit you're not
07:27
in that place of hearing him that place
07:29
of intimacy
07:30
that place of integrity you have to get
07:33
back
07:33
on this train and saying yes God's going
07:36
to complete it he's going to finish it
07:38
yes i believe everything he said will
07:40
happen
07:41
and so i really want to encourage you
07:43
you still have a very
07:45
tiny window at this point to get back on
07:48
the side
07:49
with God saying you know everybody
07:52
you have to learn to trust God he has
07:54
spoken his word
07:55
he said that there would be a landslide
07:57
actually almost everything he said has
07:59
happened already
08:00
uh that there would be a landslide when
08:02
that already happened
08:03
okay i'm talking about you know the red
08:06
wave
08:06
whatever you want to call it i'm trying
08:08
to be really um
08:10
not careful with my words but uh i'm
08:12
choosing them wisely okay we want to
08:14
stay
08:15
here so you can get information right
08:16
now so you have to understand what God
08:18
said that would happen that happened of
08:21
course then you know things came in and
08:23
people
08:23
try to do fraud and stuff ah that's
08:25
gonna go down
08:27
and i can tell you this and now God is
08:29
still saying has never
08:30
changed what he said if you don't
08:32
realize and remember what part of that
08:34
was
08:34
go back to the lodge list look on
08:36
november the fourth
08:38
and see what God said on that day that
08:42
that thing he said that would happen is
08:44
happening
08:45
right now while you're sitting there
08:47
whatever you're doing it's happening
08:49
so celebrate you know celebrate that
08:52
God's having his way
08:55
righteousness will still be in the white
08:56
house for four more years so
08:58
there you go there you are
09:01
let me know cover is different than
09:04
every day
09:05
i got this list to do here to go here's
09:07
my school assignment it'll be this way
09:09
every day
09:09
it's not like that life is not normal
09:12
and some people can't handle not normal
09:14
okay well if you're gonna do wild things
09:16
for God you better get used to not
09:18
normal
09:18
it's all good everybody
09:22
yeah that's good okay
09:25
one of the things that i observed and
09:26
this this just you know as we all went
09:28
from
09:29
november three ever all of the
09:32
um the vast majority of the prophets who
09:34
had held that
09:36
trump would be elected be health firm
09:38
for a while
09:39
and then what happened is someone
09:40
started saying
09:42
and pointing out that hey you all didn't
09:45
notice it
09:45
know this but even if biden gets elected
09:48
trump has
09:49
can legally run one more time and all of
09:51
a sudden people started going oh
09:53
that's what God meant he meant
09:56
that trump will will serve two terms one
09:59
then
10:00
and one in 2024. that is what happened
10:04
and there's those those emails are still
10:05
passing around saying that's probably
10:07
what God meant
10:09
no that is not what God said period
10:12
he never said that he said he would run
10:15
two consecutive terms
10:17
he would be in office when he first
10:19
announced before he actually won the
10:21
first time
10:21
he will be in office for eight years
10:25
then announce the next eight years and
10:27
we can go into that little bit if you
10:28
want to okay nobody in that size going
10:30
to the dark side either
10:32
i'll just say he said eight years for
10:33
trump eight years for pence
10:35
and eight years for whoever he picks the
10:37
vice president there i've said it
10:39
he never changed it and just because in
10:42
your head
10:43
what you see or hear whatever news i
10:47
hope you're not listening to the fake
10:48
news
10:48
uh there i said that to you uh you need
10:51
to know who you're listening to
10:53
because what you let put in your soul
10:56
right in here is what you will believe
10:59
if you listen
10:59
enough you wonder what in the world is
11:01
wrong with my family members that
11:03
they're so
11:04
hateful and mean and uh vile when they
11:07
never were before
11:08
they compromised their soul as a man
11:11
thinketh in his soul
11:13
that's the core of the heart of your
11:14
being that is what you will be
11:16
are the abundance of the heart that your
11:18
soul you will speak that stuff
11:20
that's exactly what's happened we're
11:22
going to have a great big soul checkup
11:24
when this is over
11:25
and if we can loose all the junk of
11:27
their soul and bind the things of God to
11:28
your soul
11:29
and then you might be back to normal
11:31
okay or maybe even better than normal
11:33
but i will let you know it's who you
11:35
listen to even the prophets
11:37
you cannot listen to man
11:41
and take what they are saying because it
11:44
looks
11:45
possible yeah well God is not the
11:48
possible he is the God of the impossible
11:51
okay
11:51
right and so he made his statements very
11:54
clear
11:55
about what would happen who he chose and
11:57
guess what he
11:59
you may have changed your mind friends
12:01
may have changed your mind
12:02
your pastors may have changed your mind
12:04
of the prophets may be true guess who
12:05
didn't change their mind
12:07
God the one who's been from the
12:09
beginning to the end
12:11
you this is a good if nothing else get a
12:13
good lesson out of this
12:14
well there's a lesson that we have for
12:16
you to trust yeah i always
12:18
say that this is every time you know we
12:21
we're at the red sea we might be
12:23
partially waiting
12:24
in the we may have stepped through the
12:26
waters i don't know
12:28
and then at some point the waters
12:29
collapse on the enemy
12:31
whatever God's enemies are i'm not
12:34
stating who that is or deciding who that
12:36
is i'm just saying
12:38
the prophets have been more prophets
12:39
have used the red sea
12:41
analogy or metaphor or para whatever and
12:44
what we're going to
12:45
and what happens is i imagine when they
12:48
when they came to the red sea when the
12:51
children of israel came to the red sea
12:53
it didn't occur to them that they were
12:54
trapped because they just thought they
12:56
were going to get to hang out and
12:57
worship him until they see the soldiers
12:59
riding towards them
13:01
it had no options you know it had to be
13:03
completely
13:04
utterly impossible you couldn't say for
13:08
instance
13:08
well there's another path path if you go
13:10
way north there's a bridge
13:12
up there 50 miles you cross the bridge
13:15
and then someone says oh that's what God
13:17
meant amen
13:18
go up cross the bridge and then you're
13:20
on the other side
13:21
see so and i think that's what happens
13:23
is we're trying to give God a break to
13:25
tell him how he can get off
13:27
oh yes
13:30
God doesn't need to break people he only
13:32
knows how it's going to happen
13:34
what he needs from you is trust you
13:36
trust okay we have prayed
13:38
probably more than ever before in our
13:40
life some people prayed for the first
13:42
time in their life
13:43
those are good things unless it's a
13:45
prayer like dear God in heaven this is a
13:47
mess
13:48
come and rescue us come and take it out
13:50
it not taking you out of this
13:52
world it's staying
13:55
and staying there for and that's what
13:57
where a lot of people are but i can
13:58
already let you know we have totally
14:00
moved forward without you knowing
14:02
it i'll just leave it right there so yes
14:04
the the point of um
14:06
is you could say it's the point of no
14:08
return but nobody needs to
14:10
return to try to go back and do
14:12
something okay
14:13
unless you got off the rock got off on
14:15
the wrong path
14:16
no God is on purpose doing things the
14:19
way he is to expose as much as he can
14:22
expose
14:24
and i can just tell you this without you
14:26
knowing it and other people knowing
14:27
justice is already being dealt
14:29
and you will know it you will eventually
14:31
know all of this and you'll be so glad
14:33
that's what you celebrated ahead of time
14:35
now when i said eat cake i didn't mean a
14:37
whole cake
14:40
some people have taken everything to the
14:42
extreme
14:43
you know you need a little brownie eat a
14:45
little cupcake eat a cookie
14:48
not the whole pack
14:54
i got a little cake but for me it's ice
14:56
cream is the temptation ice cream with
14:58
either butterscotch or caramel and
15:00
whipped cream
15:01
that's my cake okay well listen
15:05
we gotta get on to the good stuff i just
15:08
don't even know
15:10
it's already okay
15:13
it's already okay uh you need to get
15:16
your go get your party hats
15:18
your little party horns i've actually
15:20
had some people who realize
15:22
in the spirit they know the shift is
15:24
happening and they've actually been
15:26
texting me i'm getting party hats you
15:28
know they still may have some on
15:29
clearance from new year's
15:30
please go and get them you'd be so glad
15:33
you did
15:34
you know about three or three days ago
15:36
maybe uh
15:37
i would say what is today maybe monday
15:40
is probably was monday
15:42
there's a guy whose name is known i
15:43
won't say it because it's a private
15:45
conversation
15:46
but he said steve i've been feeling
15:48
deliverance off of this nation
15:49
for like a month or two months is a long
15:52
time
15:53
lots of deliverance and he feels that
15:54
he's he's got the seer anointing or
15:58
discernment anointing he can feel the
16:01
demonic deliverance coming off of the
16:03
nation
16:03
he can feel it and he said i woke up
16:06
this morning which was a couple days ago
16:08
two or three days ago
16:09
he said it's it's stopped and the lord
16:11
said you've entered a whole new era and
16:13
he said
16:13
the warfare was over so i thought wow so
16:17
but we i waited to see something with my
16:19
natural eyes and so far i haven't
16:27
oh i can just tell you this uh one of
16:30
the greatest things you'll ever
16:32
do in your life is to stand and trust
16:34
God and let me thank you
16:36
you think this is a long time no 10 20
16:39
30 years
16:40
40 years and not removed okay not
16:43
be moved okay it isn't going to take
16:46
that long
16:47
these few days and weeks that we've
16:51
been experiencing this um
16:54
is worth it it is so worth it what you
16:57
may have
16:57
had to give up or change or or you know
17:01
i know that wonders a good thing it was
17:03
wonder about God
17:04
you know there's wonder and splendor in
17:06
heaven which means you're amazed
17:09
at what he has you're utterly undone
17:13
and that's how people will feel when
17:14
this all comes out
17:16
but trust me um we have a pretty smart
17:18
man in the top seat right now
17:21
and a lot of people may not think that
17:22
but you're gonna find out
17:24
how much we do and uh the fact that God
17:27
is still a part of all of it to him
17:30
and even in the moment when he he
17:32
wondered if there was anybody with him
17:33
he knew God was with him
17:34
and so i just can uh encourage everybody
17:37
out there
17:38
this will come out the way God wants if
17:41
he will rescue
17:42
if he will rescue the world
17:45
with eight people praying what do you
17:48
think he's gonna do with
17:49
millions of people intercessors
17:52
and worshipers and uh people who sought
17:56
the face of God and laid down and prayed
17:58
and believed
17:59
God what do you think he's going to do
18:01
it's going to be
18:02
fantastic that's what i can tell you
18:06
well ken are you ready for some
18:08
questions about heaven i am but i just
18:10
thought this is cute somebody sent this
18:12
to me
18:15

18:18
piece it's a small piece of cake okay
18:23

18:28
some years has been to heaven
18:30
and visits many thousands of times
18:33
and uh so she's always receiving
18:35
revelation so
18:37
she's not coming here without it with an
18:39
empty soul or spirit she knows the
18:40
things of the lord and she's here to
18:42
teach us a lot of things about heaven
18:44
and sometimes that spills over into
18:46
questions about what happened on earth
18:47
and so those so
18:49
if you're ready i'm going to start uh
18:51
Kat you said that you like it when
18:52

18:59
question for kat
19:01
she wants to know how quick it is from
19:03
the time you die
19:05

19:16

that
19:23
faith of a child that's a good tip
19:27
that's why they have fun that's why they
19:29

19:31

19:32
things just drop off when they go
19:33
through things
19:35
well let me tell you what there is no
19:37
time
19:38
there's no time in the spirit realm
19:42
and really even though there's eternity
19:44
you don't feel time going by
19:45
it's it's like that it's just as if in a
19:48
blink let's say a wink
19:50
and that time i winked that could be
19:52
from here and in heaven
19:53
however there are some people that want
19:56
a tour
19:57
and he gives you a tour a tour of what
20:00
he gives you a tour sometimes around the
20:02
earth
20:03
so you can stop by maybe they won't see
20:05
you but you could just
20:06
uh i'm going to give an example a friend
20:08
of mine was picked up by jesus
20:10
in his own chariot his chariots not just
20:13
jerry
20:14
flames of fire coming off of it the
20:16
horses have flames of fire
20:18
it's a show and it's a power show but
20:21
sometimes he'll pick you up in his own
20:23
chariot and he'll take you to some of
20:24
the favorite places you went to
20:27
uh maybe you want to want to say go by
20:29
and even if they don't see you
20:30
wave or even say i love you like if
20:33
parents aren't there
20:34
grandparents aren't there if your best
20:36
friends aren't there and i do know that
20:39
has happened many times to people
20:40
and then he takes you on a tour of the
20:42
cosmos now the cosmos
20:44
is still the universe as you go past
20:46
through the planet you can see the star
20:49
fields all these beautiful things um it
20:52
doesn't look
20:52
black and dark like from here when we
20:54
look up through the to a telescope
20:56
there's light all around as you go
20:58
plastic the planets create light the
21:01
stars create light it's like the
21:03
light show you've ever seen and then you
21:05
get to go all the way up through the
21:06
cosmos
21:07
up until you have a place where you
21:09
disembark in heaven
21:11
and you get out of that chariot unless
21:13
he took you in listen to this
21:15
a starship a star cruiser an elevator
21:18
uh all kinds of ways you can travel from
21:21
here to heaven
21:23
sometimes it's what people would really
21:24
love a world war ii biplane okay giving
21:30
you truth this is why it takes so long
21:31
to answer the question
21:32
there's so many ways and kids just love
21:35
to go very unique ways
21:38
because you can still dream okay and by
21:40
the way dreaming and imagination is not
21:42
a bad thing
21:43
God God imagined this world and
21:46
everything
21:46
he considered in his heart it's okay to
21:48
have imagination especially to create so
21:50
you go on these wonderful journeys
21:54
you don't feel like you're dead that's
21:56
important to tell you that
21:57
you've never had so much life in you
22:00
when you step out of this physical body
22:02
and the spiritual your spiritual body
22:03
looks just like you steps out
22:06
you feel like a child if you were really
22:08
old this body
22:10
you're young you look like you're in
22:11
your 20s so let me if you're 99 and you
22:14
step out and you're in your 20s your
22:15
grandma's not going to want to come back
22:17
and i tell people don't worry grandma
22:19
back if she's had long full life just
22:21
let her go
22:22
and so you're excited you see your
22:24
guardian angels for the first time if
22:26
you never saw them they're going to be
22:27
right there with you
22:29
even if jesus comes to take you they'll
22:31
go at the same time
22:32
sometimes every now and then he'll bring
22:35
somebody with him
22:36
like maybe a best friend passed away
22:39
or maybe it was somebody that you really
22:41
love passed away and they were in heaven
22:43
every now and then
22:44
this happened to one of my friends he
22:46
would bring them with him to take you
22:48
you don't know what excitement and joy
22:52
and adventure is until you have gone
22:55
there so this is what people really
22:56
confront
22:57
they step out there's their family
23:00
member maybe there's the guardian angels
23:02
or there's jesus there waiting to take
23:04
you
23:04
and you step into this thing you go
23:07
right through
23:08
the walls isn't that cool you go through
23:09
the wall in your spiritual body
23:11
and then you go through the cosmos and
23:13
see sometimes you'll go by star fields
23:15
sometimes the rings of saturn um since
23:17
this is italian spring i like to really
23:19
see all this when you get up there
23:21
there's some of the greatest things
23:22
you've never seen
23:24
in your life when you get up there it's
23:26
beauty it's splendor it's wonder it's
23:28
fun it's adventure
23:30
all of your friends who are in heaven
23:31
are waiting a lot of your family members
23:33
are there the prophets could be there
23:35
if you had pets they'll be there and
23:38
then you all get to go into the throne
23:40
room
23:41
and jesus walks you up the steps of the
23:43
throne and says here i'm bringing back
23:45
your son to your daughter
23:46
and then you really start to have this
23:48
huge celebration so
23:50
that's exactly what happens wow very
23:52
good
23:53
well you know you talked about jesus
23:54
bringing you around that reminds me that
23:56
it's on my list today i'm going to move
23:57
that question forward
23:59
because the person asked um i think it
24:01
was a woman and she said
24:03
um i know now when i pray on earth
24:06
because
24:07
God is omnipresent i can have him to
24:10
myself
24:11
because he's everyone can have them to
24:13
yourself you have your intimate
24:14
relationship
24:15
and you can be praying and talking with
24:17
him while someone else is
24:18
and she wanted to know so what is it
24:20
like when i get to heaven and he's got
24:22
billions of people there
24:24
i'd like to have myself but now he's in
24:26
we're all here together and he's going
24:28
to
24:28
want to be without how do i how can i
24:31
how much
24:32
relationship do i get with the lord you
24:34
get even more relationship with him
24:36
really number one you're in his home
24:39
right
24:39
and you're being welcomed home you're
24:41
the new person
24:43
i'm telling you the problems will come
24:45
and take you off somewhere to spend some
24:47
time with you or they'll just come and
24:48
visit you
24:49
you this is one of the most beautiful
24:51
things i found out about heaven
24:53
is uh in your mansion you have a secret
24:57
garden as part of it and people
24:58
i don't like flowers there's more than
25:00
just flowers there's not about the
25:01
flowers
25:02
you won't even think what you're
25:03
thinking those thoughts and you're
25:04
undone no matter what he gives you or
25:06
takes you in heaven
25:07
but as part of your mansion no matter
25:09
what that looks like it could be
25:10
really ultra modern supernatural
25:13
under the crystal sea wherever it is you
25:16
have a secret garden
25:17
and he gives you a key when you get
25:19
there when you want to be with him
25:21
any time you go into that garden that's
25:24
a part of your mansion and he comes to
25:26
see you
25:27
anytime he can be everywhere in heaven
25:31
anywhere in heaven all the same time
25:34
because there is no time
25:36
i know that's hard for you to understand
25:37
you have to wait to get there but it is
25:39
true
25:40
he can be with everybody all at the same
25:42
time you won't see hundreds of thousands
25:44
of jesus all over heaven
25:46
but when you wherever you are and you
25:47
want to be with him he'll be there
25:49
and the father also the father also
25:52
spends time with you so no it's even um
25:56
i can't say better because it doesn't
25:58
matter when you're with him
26:00
you know what really matters is that you
26:01
want to be with him right now here on
26:03
the earth
26:04
how do you do that you say it i really
26:06
want to know you i want to get to know
26:08
you i want to spend time with you
26:09
i tell people go in a room somewhere if
26:11
you can find one alone
26:13
and just shut the door and say i'm here
26:14
i'm going to talk to you i want to get
26:16
to know you and i know your heart
26:18
i want to know your ways i'm so excited
26:20
that you're my lord
26:22
it's not always about asking for things
26:26
or
26:26
you're in agony or suffering or you're
26:29
afraid and i know all those things
26:30
happen
26:31
why not take some time when you don't
26:33
have all this stuff around you and just
26:35
just because there's time
26:37
instead of watching something why don't
26:39
you go say i want to be with you you
26:41
know i did that for 20 years in a row
26:43
you don't have to wait 20 years it was
26:45
something he was training me in
26:46
and now i step anywhere i hear them all
26:49
i hear them father-son
26:50
i hear them talking usually separately
26:53
at different times but
26:55
their heart is more for you
26:59
to hear them and know them than your own
27:02
their heart
27:03
wants that more than what your heart
27:05
wants wow
27:06
yeah that's that's hard to grasp because
27:08
you think you know that scripture says
27:10
you know you'll seek me and you find me
27:12
when you seek with me seek me with all
27:14
your heart
27:15
so i that's left me i love the scripture
27:18
but
27:19
it feels like the onus is on me to show
27:21
him that i want him and i
27:23
i guess that probably is true but you're
27:25
saying they want the connection more
27:27
than you want it
27:28
they do they really do we have so many
27:30
things going on
27:31
in our head that can distract us and i'm
27:34
not saying there are even bad things
27:36
just living life you have to there's
27:38
things you need to do and take care of
27:39
or be a part of
27:41
or you have to you know listen to people
27:43
learn something
27:44
you have to work somewhere any matter
27:46
when i went to work if i went to work
27:48
and i had a break i'd go talk with him
27:49
somewhere
27:50
uh it was just my focus my my my heart
27:53
so desire to know him
27:55
more but i didn't just sit around
27:57
thinking it
27:58
i did something about it i used to write
28:00
down i would
28:02
write down in a little book tonight i'm
28:03
meeting with jesus
28:05
and i know you may if you're young maybe
28:07
you say that at seven
28:08
or maybe after your dinner's over just
28:10
go take five minutes in your room and go
28:12
i'm right here jesus
28:13
i want to know you more that's good i
28:15
like you know
28:16
how if all of heaven was talking to
28:19
jesus he would stop
28:20
and listen to you saying that because
28:23
you're reaching out to know him
28:25
and that so delights his heart so you
28:28
think most people think he's up there he
28:29
doesn't care no he's waiting for you to
28:31
say
28:32
something it's really like that
28:36
you know when i was uh i would go back
28:38
about 20 years ago i was beginning to
28:40
realize because i had more kids that our
28:42
kids were at home
28:43
at that time they're all raised now but
28:45
with the household i would i was
28:47
discovering that when i went into the
28:49
bathroom
28:50
especially my master bathroom i had more
28:52
revelation in that room
28:54
simply because i was distracted and i
28:56
would tell my home group someone made me
28:58
a really nice
29:00
wood embossed you know with a burned in
29:02
it says revelation room
29:04
and so i have a thing well outside my
29:05
bathroom right now it says revelation
29:09
and my staff i think elijah has heard
29:11
that story so at the office
29:12
they put on the door revelation room
29:14
because i actually had a
29:16
a particular one that was that was
29:17
dedicated to me because they were extra
29:19
bathrooms so they
29:20
they put this on the one that was right
29:21
across from there
29:24
but that's very true it is really even
29:27
for me
29:28
even for me because you know my life is
29:30
increasing
29:32
in having to be connected having me
29:35
that God desired me to be connected with
29:37
other people have conversations with
29:39
other people
29:40
uh i always save time for him um
29:43
like lately i've been probably getting
29:45
to lay down around 8 30 or 9 30 in the
29:48
morning having been up for
29:49
20 some hours um but even then you know
29:53
he'll wake me up sometimes
29:54
and say something to me find a room and
29:58
i tell people really
29:59
literally people we used to have prayer
30:01
closets and back in my day growing up i
30:03
mean i was born in the 50s people hello
30:06
that means i've experienced a whole lot
30:08
in my life i've been through a lot have
30:10
to trust God for a lot
30:11
so i didn't just get this way from just
30:14
waking up one day and going yay i get to
30:16
do all this and see all this no i was
30:18
tested i was tested
30:20
and and God would train me and talk to
30:22
me and show me but i still had to
30:24
experience life
30:25
but really clean a closet out now if
30:28
you're about 10 or 11 don't go throw all
30:30
your stuff out of your closet on the
30:31
floor in your room
30:32
ask your parent to help make some room
30:35
in there and make sure you can leave the
30:37
door open a little bit if you need to go
30:38
in there and find a little spot
30:40
but the bathroom is this crazy it's
30:42
right no one's in there with you right
30:45
you're on yourself give two minutes to
30:48
jesus when you're washing your hands at
30:49
the sink or go in there just to say hi
30:52
to him
30:53
no one's going to come in and bother you
30:54
or interrupt you and i always call it
30:56
the
30:57
the unspoken throne room
31:01
that's good i'm sure the line's having a
31:04
good time
31:04
it actually does put the lid down put a
31:06
towel on it and sit there and they don't
31:08
no one's gonna come in there and bother
31:10
you okay it's kind of crazy
31:12
that's right how about here
31:15
the more more the less stuff you have
31:17
over here
31:18
and your focus the more you're going to
31:20
hear him clearly
31:22
that's so true so so true well here's
31:24
another one related to a six-year-old
31:26
the mom is leah and she says my
31:29
six-year-old daughter has been talking
31:31
to what she has said
31:32
is an angel named rose but i had someone
31:36
tell me the angels are only male
31:38
is it possible this is really an angel
31:40
she's speaking with
31:41
well i don't know who told you the males
31:43
were only
31:45
the angels are only males i don't know
31:46
how that could possibly be
31:48
because you know a lot of the things the
31:50
way he made the angels they're made
31:52
in tribes and they don't all look like
31:56
they don't all look like you know um i
32:00
don't know
32:00
some things make me laugh out loud there
32:02
are feminine and the word is feminist
32:04
not male or female it is not it's
32:06
masculine appearance and feminine
32:09
appearance and there are
32:10
absolutely some of those beautiful
32:12
things that i've seen are feminine
32:14
in appearance and they have the
32:15
mannerisms and they
32:17
they have long beautiful hair and they
32:19
take care of like the flowers and the
32:21
gems and stuff like that but they also
32:23
are over things like sending out
32:25
war shields and down to earth and i mean
32:27
you can't
32:28
always say because this feminine can
32:30
only do that oh don't you dare say
32:32
something to that like an angel
32:33
there are feminine angels and i have
32:35
seen this mom and i do know some of
32:37
their names so
32:38
uh that could very well be they need to
32:41
learn i don't know
32:42
a six years old probably old enough to
32:43
know that if one ever comes and says
32:45
you're supposed to go with me
32:46
you need to train that child either to
32:48
come and tell you that
32:50
so you can say go tell that angel
32:53
are you from jesus christ who died for
32:56
the sins of this world
32:58
now a six-year-old can learn to say that
32:59
and they should really
33:01
because it says to test every spirit
33:03
that's not just like the
33:05
the character or the personality of a
33:07
person that's not
33:08
what we're talking about we're talking
33:10
about literally spiritual beings
33:12
um and if they're still if they're
33:14
starting to see them now
33:15
that's important for them to know that
33:18
if it says come and go with me or they
33:19
want to say here take my hand and go
33:21
then i would encourage them to ask that
33:23
question uh the angels can't lie
33:26
they can try to fake i'm talking about
33:28
the other you know it says satan can
33:29
appear as an angel of light and you're
33:31
gonna slow down with my voice
33:33
it says he can and he can he still has
33:36
powers he still has abilities
33:39
um but some of the angels that work
33:41
under him
33:42
also can do that and they don't do it um
33:45
to make you afraid they'll take it
33:48
places
33:48
that aren't real and maybe bring you
33:50
know deception to
33:52
people so it's important for them to
33:53
know yes there's angels in heaven who
33:56
work
33:56
who work on our behalf that God sends an
33:59
assignment your guardians are right here
34:01
around you
34:02
but don't let the enemy try to fool you
34:05
now
34:06
on the hand let's say this is an angel
34:08
from heaven
34:09
and they're they're sending uh either
34:11
words of wisdom to the child
34:13
or maybe they need comfort or something
34:15
like that
34:16
comfort is actually a being in heaven
34:19
it's a spiritual being
34:20
and does look feminine
34:24
a feminine appearance in heaven and so
34:26
there's wisdom
34:28
there's all kinds of them that are
34:30
actually a being
34:31
but there's definitely feminine angels
34:33
yes there are maybe they haven't seen
34:35
them
34:35
and if people haven't seen a particular
34:37
thing they think it doesn't exist and
34:39
haven't
34:40
there's so many you'd never be able to
34:42
see them all i can just say that
34:44
oh so good well good that's really good
34:46
okay now this almost sounds like um
34:48
this could be a kid but it's not it's a
34:50
woman named martian she's asking
34:52
who builds the mansions in heaven does
34:54
jesus give the blueprints
34:56
and then people who were carpenters
34:58
bricklayers et cetera
34:59
who do the building or what how do the
35:02
mansions get built
35:03
who does the blueprints and who does it
35:05
who builds it
35:07
the blueprints are always done either by
35:09
the father or jesus
35:10
and they actually have a boardroom in
35:12
heaven where they draw out plans i've
35:14
seen these plans
35:16
where they've designed now their plans
35:20
aren't like necessarily on a piece of
35:21
paper they wouldn't necessarily be on
35:23
something like you would see like this
35:25
they're they're the lines are drawn in
35:27
light so
35:29
almost like a hologram that they they'll
35:31
move their hand in parts of
35:33
the mansion and it's not flat it's like
35:35
a three dimension thing that they can
35:37
see as they're designing that's the
35:39
design of it
35:40
framing it God's framing it and uh and
35:43
jesus though
35:44
is a master carpenter and yes every now
35:48
and then what he does is he'll usually
35:49
build it
35:50
whatever it is he'll build it but to
35:52
embellish things or to put things
35:54
in it to furnish it i'd have to say
35:57
other
35:58
carpenters or other people would who are
36:00
going to design something maybe they
36:01
built
36:01
fountains outside the home but it says
36:04
that the builder maker uh
36:05
no human hands built them and so
36:08
you need to understand that that's
36:11
jesus's
36:12
delight the father's like in my father's
36:13
house his house
36:15
is a world the father's house is a whole
36:18
world called heaven
36:19
and some people don't know that either
36:21
so when a mansion is being designed
36:24
it's being worked on your whole life by
36:26
the way
36:27
they're working on it where they've
36:29
decided to place it the things they put
36:30
on your property
36:32
they put inside uh there's doors
36:35
on your man can you step into that takes
36:37
you to another whole place that is also
36:39
yours they design things are for these
36:41
things are for fun or for delight
36:43
and so they work on your whole life but
36:45
i will say i do know this
36:47
when they're done you're going home
36:51
it is a sure sign God has caught me up
36:54
many times and said this is this
36:55
person's home we're almost done not
36:57
quite
36:58
done this person was going to grow
37:00
vegetables
37:01
now how about this vegetables in heaven
37:03
for everybody to eat and enjoy and love
37:05
and we're all done except plowing the
37:07
field the home the mansion was totally
37:10
done
37:10
and i saw them plowing this field that
37:13
looked just like earth
37:14
but it was spiritual like heavenly earth
37:17
and they grow very quickly but
37:19
so that's a sign that when my own
37:21
grandmother was about to go home to
37:22
heaven i saw my grandfather who was a
37:24
florist in heaven
37:26
and he was designing this five foot
37:27
flower arrangement and all the flowers
37:29
sang
37:30
so this arrangement would be like a
37:31
symphony and he was putting that in her
37:34
place and i told my mom i see
37:38
your father putting this arrangement in
37:40
your mom's place she's gonna go real
37:42
soon
37:43
and she went two days later so i do know
37:45
when it's done
37:46
if a child goes home of course their
37:48
mansion is not done
37:49
they will they'll still be building it
37:51
but until that time you will live with a
37:53
family member
37:54
in heaven so you won't be alone wow now
37:57
you touched on something i was going to
37:59
ask so it was a
38:00
part of my question i'm going to get to
38:01
somewhere in my stack here
38:03
uh you said this person's husband was a
38:06
or someone was a florist in him someone
38:08
wanted to know so do
38:09
we know you don't work to make money
38:12
you don't work to make a living do
38:15
people have
38:17
occupations or vocations not to make
38:20
money but because
38:21
they and not to get up in the morning to
38:23
do because they're always nobody
38:25
sleeps i understand so do people have
38:29
vocations occupations jobs that they
38:32
just do
38:32
because they love it's called their gift
38:36
that's what you're looking for you're
38:38
working looking for the word gift
38:40
every good and perfect gift comes down
38:43
from the father of
38:44
lights those lights he's talking about
38:46
aren't stars
38:47
that's what you look like a little
38:48
spirit of life like you had a little
38:50
body you lived in God you moved in and
38:52
out on him on the rays
38:53
of that rainbow that comes from him and
38:56
so he already knew when you were there
38:58
back that far when you lived inside of
39:01
him before he sent you here and
39:03
you together your mother's home he knew
39:04
what you would be would you be a
39:06
carpenter
39:07
would you be a dancer would you be a
39:09
designer would you be a baker
39:10
would you be a jeweler would you be a
39:12
mechanic nothing breaks
39:14
down but people have car shows and they
39:16
make everything look great and wonderful
39:18
and they run on light i mean this could
39:19
go on forever
39:21
so i'm just letting you know it's what
39:23
you put is your passion
39:25
the thing that makes you click like i'm
39:27
a photographer and it doesn't matter
39:29
whatever else i do
39:31
even this being a revelator for God i
39:34
love that but
39:34
my passion is to create photographs
39:38
it is my heartbeat all day all night
39:42
and i'm good at it i didn't have any
39:45
professional training
39:46
it was in me God said i'm sending you
39:48
here you're a photographer
39:50
guess what when i go home to heaven come
39:51
by my studio it doesn't cost anything
39:55
i will have all kinds of ways new ways
39:58
to take photographs
39:59
and even produce the photographs i saw
40:02
them hanging
40:02
all kinds of photographs and art hanging
40:04
in people's mansions
40:06
so maybe you're an artist maybe you will
40:08
sing maybe you'll
40:09
create music uh maybe you make amusement
40:12
parks
40:13
so that is a gift it's never
40:16
work ask these people if they do work my
40:19
photography it could take hours it's not
40:21
a job
40:21
it's a delight so that's what you get to
40:23
do you lot you are that gift he made you
40:26
and even little children they grow
40:28
slowly they get to use different
40:30
measures of that gift they're not going
40:32
to lose it
40:33
and then when they grow finally to what
40:36
God would say
40:37
is the timeless age they have they'll
40:39
have their own place eventually
40:40
they'll have their gift to use for
40:42
everybody to enjoy
40:44
and so that's what you do you do what's
40:46
fun and what you love
40:48
that's cool well that that makes that
40:50
brings up a question that i'm going to
40:51
ask you is
40:53
is there such things as a as a
40:56
mall where you shop you don't have to
40:58
pay for anything but all the people that
41:00
are making all these things they put it
41:02
in the mall
41:03
and you come in anything like that or do
41:05
you just know the person you go to his
41:07
house
41:08
a lot of times because people love to
41:10
fellowship in heaven
41:12
uh number one worship God and even that
41:14
looks a little bit different
41:15
it's called living worship everywhere
41:17
you go you worship everything you enjoy
41:19
when he's made of you that's called
41:20
worshiping him
41:22
the second thing they love to do the
41:24
most is fellowshipping and they love to
41:26
meet people see people everybody's got
41:28
stuff your mansion is designed around
41:30
that gift
41:32
but they have festivals why do you think
41:34
we have festivals
41:35
they'll have festivals where people can
41:37
bring a lot of their stuff out there
41:39
into wherever the area is huge
41:41
festival's going to be
41:42
no mosquitoes no rain to ruin okay no
41:45
dirt
41:47
that's good it's like a festival that's
41:49
made out of
41:50
light that's the only way i can say it
41:53
yeah
41:53
everything's about the glory yeah
41:55
everybody bring all their artwork they
41:56
have a one called the galleria
41:58
an area in heaven where all different
42:01
events
42:02
they will bring all their beautiful art
42:04
whether it's pottery jewelry you know
42:06
glass whatever it is
42:07
wood whatever it is they make things out
42:09
of they'll bring all their stuff to give
42:11
away
42:12
but a lot of times i saw a jeweler's
42:15
store and it was made out of this
42:18
massive gemstone let's say maybe about
42:20
eight ten stories high with all the
42:22
facets
42:22
when you came up to go in a fast that
42:25
would open up like a ramp you walk up in
42:28
it
42:28
and all the display of this jewelry some
42:31
was in the air floating some was on
42:33
beads of light for you to look at but
42:36
anything in there was free and people
42:37
were buying gifts to put in their family
42:39
members homes
42:41
so when they got there they could have a
42:42
gift so this is just one example
42:44
and he could he would go he would
42:46
harvest uh the there's a gem depot
42:49
and the gems come from the the crystal
42:51
sea
42:52
where it flows from the father off the
42:54
throne and all these gemstones are
42:56
carried in it so they harvest they have
42:57
people who harvest them
42:59
i even know who they are the people
43:01
listen to this
43:02
this is God's sense of humor i hope this
43:04
is okay but it's really worth it
43:06
if you if you picked up trash for a
43:08
living that didn't mean it was your gift
43:11
on earth we we have a we have to have we
43:14
have to work to have a living
43:15
right in heaven you live to enjoy your
43:18
life
43:19
you live in heaven to do what you enjoy
43:21
so those who had to pick up the trash
43:23
every day down here
43:25
they get to harvest the gemstones
43:28
out of the gem depot this is for the
43:31
jewelers the builders the designers
43:34
uh to come and collect them to go and do
43:36
and make things with so
43:38
isn't that a tip somebody's joking
43:39
they're very good somebody jumped up
43:41
with me and goes i'm a trash man and
43:43
somebody else jumped up with it i'll be
43:45
your best friend in heaven
43:48
now a minute ago i think you
43:49
accidentally misspoke because you said
43:51
everything is free and then people you
43:54
said people come in to buy a gift for
43:55
their friends do you mean people come in
43:57
to just
43:57
get a gift yeah they select it they come
44:00
in take it off the show
44:01
they just take it off the shelf and
44:03
split right
44:04
they don't have time and they gift up
44:06
yeah nothing is so is so
44:08
normal in your normal head to just say
44:11
things the way they were on earth
44:13
yeah exactly talk a whole different way
44:15
if you're going to talk about heaven
44:17
there's not physical things there but
44:18
they are literal
44:20
but as far as receiving anything whether
44:22
it's going to amusement park and riding
44:24
whether it's having food to eat there
44:26
it is it is all for free it's given to
44:29
you
44:29
so no you don't you don't have to buy
44:31
anything there's no money
44:35
okay this we probably have time for a
44:37
couple more quick ones here
44:38
um i'm going to read this i can't read
44:40
it all but what does it mean when a
44:42
departed loved one appears before you as
44:44
a spirit
44:45
my dad who passed away in 2008
44:48
appeared out of nowhere while i was
44:50
driving his eyes were shining like i've
44:52
never seen before
44:53
it brought me such a great comfort and
44:55
joy this was short
44:58
it was shortly after the devil attacked
45:00
me mentally tried to get me to commit
45:02
suicide
45:03
my dad was wearing a shirt i knew he
45:05
loved that that i later found in his
45:07
closet
45:07
and i guess he's asking she's asking
45:09
what does that mean and i suppose he's
45:11
asking is that okay
45:12
as well i would have to say
45:16
it happened so many times and people
45:18
have so many testimonies
45:20
uh even in it could be a time of maybe
45:23
danger and for
45:24
for some reason you wake up and you see
45:26
and they just uh whatever
45:28
if they said something it would be
45:29
something short i
45:31
i would say that's definitely God God
45:33
allows that he permits it if they
45:35
ask you know their if someone who's just
45:37
going to heaven say
45:38
can i please just briefly appear to let
45:40
my family member know i'm okay
45:42
and this is wild sometimes they'll be
45:44
wearing their favorite thing they may
45:46
not be wearing in heaven but when they
45:48
appear to you
45:49
some people can identify with them but
45:51
the thing about the light shining from
45:52
their eyes is absolutely yes
45:55
when you move to heaven the light of God
45:57
shines out of you so that would be yes
46:00
i don't know why or when or how he
46:02
chooses
46:03
i do know that that's true i do know
46:05
that sometimes
46:07
in a moment of maybe danger people have
46:09
seen
46:10
a parent appear to them and say get up
46:13
get up or wake up or get out
46:15
and then they would disappear and they
46:17
would realize maybe there was a fire or
46:19
something so
46:20
i i can't give you a complete revelation
46:23
on why he picks or who he chooses
46:25
i will say that does happen and the
46:27
enemy of course i will tell you this
46:29
when you receive something great
46:31
an encounter or something like that from
46:33
God treasure it and i would tell people
46:35
write it down
46:36
the enemy will come in to try to steal
46:38
it from you
46:39
and rather than struggle or be attacked
46:41
just turn around and say
46:42
you're not stealing from me get out you
46:44
have to tell the devil just to get out
46:46
okay he didn't have a right if you're a
46:47
believer to attack you or harass you
46:50
he doesn't want you to have that joy and
46:52
he doesn't want you to think it's even
46:54
that's real heaven's real so it happens
46:57
quite often
46:58
with uh people and in the beginning the
47:01
enemy would try to do that now i laugh
47:02
at him
47:03
if he even tries i i laugh at him i'm
47:05
not being
47:06
bragging or anything i'm just saying i
47:08
know it's just too late
47:10
to try to convince me that's not real
47:12
and uh so that was a real encounter if
47:14
that did happen to somebody yes that was
47:16
probably
47:17
their family member that they saw
47:19
interesting
47:20
okay so um let's see okay so this person
47:24
gene wants to know she heard you say our
47:26
pets go to heaven
47:28
she's then heard you say our pets talk i
47:31
can picture my
47:32
a few cats and dogs being smart mouth to
47:35
me and say what were you thinking but
47:37
she wants to know she wants to know what
47:39
do they sound like do they sound like
47:41
human voices do they sound like you does
47:43
the dark
47:44
quack like a duck no no no they sound
47:46
like they sound
47:48
you need to number one i is some
47:50
questions you got to take a little bit
47:51
of explanation
47:53
because i will tell you exactly the way
47:54
this is what i do i tell you exactly the
47:56
way
47:57
God showed me or the father showed me or
47:59
jesus showed me it's always the same
48:01
exact way
48:02
he he told me the father said when i
48:05
created
48:06
creatures he calls them creatures uh
48:08
dogs cats
48:09
lions anything anything that's on the
48:12
earth roaming
48:13
uh i guess uh because i've even heard
48:16
dragonflies speak in heaven so i can't
48:17
say not insects by the way there's no
48:19
mesquite there's no flies up there they
48:20
all went to hell
48:21
anyway but but he designed
48:25
in the creatures or the animals make up
48:29
the ability to speak in the garden of
48:32
eden
48:33
they all talked to adam he called
48:36
them by name why would he say name he
48:39
didn't say horse come here
48:40
he gave it a name why how do i say that
48:43
God gives
48:44
everything in heaven on earth he gives
48:47
them little nicknames or names so adam
48:49
had conversations
48:51
with the animals in the garden of eden
48:52
okay that was on this earth that he did
48:55
that
48:56
and then he made eve okay she probably
48:58
never stopped talking
48:59
anyway so just like on
49:02
the earth when adam fell when they fell
49:05
and they turned their back on God he
49:07
took away
49:08
on purpose the ability for the animals
49:11
to talk
49:12
he didn't want them cursing him or them
49:15
suck you know
49:15
they're not guilty of that they uh
49:18
animals and creatures they have no guilt
49:20
um of that they don't have to repent of
49:22
sins okay he made them
49:24
when they die he takes their little
49:26
their spiritual body your pet has a
49:28
spiritual body he has a spirit of life
49:29
and
49:30
he takes that to heaven in their at your
49:32
mansion inside or outside
49:34
but yes they do have conversation i've
49:36
seen it many times and they have
49:38
different personalities if your dog
49:40
likes to bark a lot
49:41
they'll probably never stop talking in
49:43
heaven uh if they really want to be real
49:46
close to you
49:47
be with you i'm i'm not making any sense
49:49
this is the wildest thing
49:51
that your pat will be with you forever
49:53
so be nice to it right now
49:55
[Laughter]
50:01
for any reason this is true too if my
50:04
pet or one of my cats have been
50:05
made afraid i don't know from whatever i
50:07
lay my hand on it and i say i lose hell
50:10
off of you i'm not having fear in you
50:12
and then i'll say
50:13
i i bind the love of God to you uh
50:17
my mom had a dog that was afraid and
50:19
terrified of lightning
50:20
as long as she said it was afraid it was
50:22
always afraid but when she learned this
50:24
truth that when you impart life to
50:27
something it changes it she began to
50:29
tell her dog
50:30
all right here's the peace of God it's
50:32
gonna be okay that lightning is gonna
50:34
hurt you peace peace i put peace into
50:36
you guess what the dog stopped being
50:38
afraid
50:40
so yeah animals are not more important
50:44
than people
50:44
they never will be but he does care he
50:47
knows when one
50:48
sparrow falls to the ground he knows and
50:51
creatures are important to him too
50:53
they're part of his creation
50:54
and so i would say God does not like it
50:56
when people are abused and he does not
50:59
like it when animals are abused at all
51:01
so
51:02
yeah absolutely okay so here's a
51:06
last question um i keep being asked this
51:08
and i keep thinking ah she won't want to
51:10
answer that
51:11
but here i'm going to merge them all
51:13
together
51:14
as one question or one maybe simple
51:18
maybe complex
51:19
you know jesus said i've lost none of
51:21
these except the senate perdition that
51:22
the scriptures will be fulfilled
51:24
sounds like judas was lost he betrays
51:26
the lord but as
51:28
before he commits suicide he says i've
51:30
betrayed innocent blood so people are
51:32
saying did he get
51:33
saved because he repented okay
51:36
okay he was not this is his thing he was
51:40
never sorry for what he did okay
51:43
i think he was sorry that he was caught
51:47
there's a big difference no he allowed
51:49
himself
51:50
at one point in one pi point judas knew
51:52
he was being
51:53
uh led and uh moved and
51:57
affected by satan he knew he was
52:00
and he was dead set on forcing
52:04
christ to be something he was never
52:06
called to be
52:07
and he not only that he gossiped about
52:09
me back by them he stole from the
52:10
treasury people
52:12
i mean there wasn't much good about him
52:14
really he had every opportunity
52:16
while he was with christ he went places
52:19
he saw the miracles is this crazy
52:22
it's almost like the angels would have a
52:23
new God on the throne was the creator
52:26
they knew lucifer was created and yet
52:28
they chose his words
52:30
and his will over God so that does
52:32
happen even in people down here
52:34
and he just gave himself to him why
52:38
why would christ have said that to him
52:41
when they were having seven he said go
52:42
and do what you must do
52:44
say uh satan was using um
52:47
um him judas and judas knew he was being
52:50
pushed and pulled
52:51
so even at the last supper
52:54
and here's christ explain what will
52:55
happen to him you would think
52:57
judas wouldn't be moved but his soul had
53:00
been
53:00
corrupted no he still went out he still
53:03
got the army he still did what was
53:05
what was wrong he still did it now
53:08
jesus had to die on the cross but judas
53:11
chose those things to do those things
53:14
and he is in hell he's in hell and hell
53:17
seeing him there with hitler okay uh
53:20
hitler's in hell if you ever wondered
53:21
yes
53:22
he's the most tortured thing in hell
53:24
that's just a tip for everybody
53:26
uh the more evil you are on the earth
53:29
and
53:29
satan said when you get here i'll give
53:31
you all this power and everything he's
53:32
never changed that lie
53:34
no he just mocks you and tortures you
53:36
more than all the rest so if you're over
53:38
there doing evil for
53:39
him thinking i'm going to be put in a
53:41
high place that won't happen
53:44
it's not going to happen so judas had
53:46
every chance
53:47
during the years he was with christ to
53:49
repent and say
53:50
i've had these wicked thoughts and then
53:52
he reached a point when christ didn't
53:54
want to set up his kingdom on the earth
53:56
right there because jesus kept saying i
53:57
have to die i have to do this stuff
53:59
he wanted power judas wanted power
54:03
he wanted authority he wanted more money
54:05
so he's thinking if jesus is greater
54:07
i'll have more to handle and i will be
54:08
more important it was always about
54:10
him it was about pride and no he did not
54:14
he did not
54:15
repent as in repenting for my sins
54:18
repenting for the evil i did
54:20
i think he was more repented that he got
54:23
caught
54:25
wow wow well kat that's that's our time
54:28
that's so good
54:28
so so good i always say you know because
54:30
they have a big stack
54:32
this stack keeps growing you can't see
54:34
because i'd have to flip it i never can
54:35
flip it and there's a whole bunch more i
54:37
have to pray out so
54:38
well we'll hit some more next week uh
54:40
can't tell people how they can get your
54:41
books on revealing heaven and your other
54:43
site too
54:44
yeah i have sometimes i'm talking and
54:47
i'll forget my name
54:48
i know okay my name is Kat i know i have
54:51
pink care sometimes
54:52
i forget that too so God pick somebody
54:55
who you know
54:56
um my my mind isn't filled and crammed
54:59
with
55:00
man's thoughts i don't listen to the
55:03
news that is not good that doesn't
55:05
promote good things i don't listen to it
55:07

00:19
hi steve schultz here we are with the
00:21
ligest streams today a lot of times
00:23
you're seeing us
00:24
on the live shows that are actually out
00:26
of my home today we're in our actual
00:28
studio and we're here with kat Kerr
00:30
good to see you it's about time we've
00:32
gotten together i know
00:33
i'm excited to be here so it's really
00:36
great to talk about
00:37
what we decided to do today is we're
00:38
going to talk about heaven
00:40
and what i want to do today is hit all
00:42
the
00:43
main questions and we sat down yesterday
00:45
and began to make a list it's way too
00:47
long
00:48
but we'll see where it goes that we're
00:50
going to do a second show for those
00:52
watching
00:52
we won't even finish on this show so
00:54
watch for the second one so
00:56
i'm going to start right off by asking
00:57
you um
00:59
the question that some people ask how
01:01
many times have you been to heaven
01:03
i lost count after a thousand times i i
01:06
just gave up and stopped counting
01:08
but it's been 25 years this year is it
01:11
thousands
01:12
then it is thousands yes and how how are
01:14
you defined between
01:17
going to be wherever heaven is versus
01:20
the lord walking through the wall i mean
01:22
is it like is it just as many times he
01:24
comes through the wall and talks
01:26
to you or what i think it's probably
01:28
more
01:29
being caught up to heaven in the
01:30
beginning it was right now i think it's
01:32
a lot of
01:33
walking through the wall he just walks
01:35
through the wall i mean
01:37
just like if you could that you would
01:39
just walk through the wall it's that
01:40
real
01:40
it's not like he's a little wispy thing
01:43
remember the lord is actually in his
01:44
glorified body so
01:46
he walks bodily through the wall and
01:48
just will
01:49
talk to me sometimes he sits next to me
01:51
sometimes it's the father
01:54
it is usually if the father walks in
01:56
it's not to sit down and have a
01:58
conversation
01:59
if he's going to have a conversation
02:00
he'll catch me up to heaven if he's
02:01
going to say something important to me
02:03
like write something on the wall which
02:05
he does often
02:06
he walks in he'll glance at me and walk
02:09
over to the wall write whatever he wants
02:11
and then he'll say take a picture
02:13
because it'll be gone after a while
02:15
really and then he'll stand there
02:16
explain to me what this is and why i'm
02:18
doing this
02:19
and then he'll just walk back out what
02:21
do you mean take a picture do you mean
02:22
take your actual camera and take a
02:24
picture
02:24
yes of the lord's handwriting
02:27
yes he wrote the last time he did that
02:30
he wrote the next 50 years of my life on
02:32
the wall and what i would be doing and
02:34
the platforms i would be speaking from
02:36
he's very detailed and i'm a detailed
02:38
person which is why he uses me to do
02:40
this so
02:41
i know i've heard you talk about we'll
02:43
get into the heaven thing in a minute
02:44
but what are you going to say
02:46
how does your answer when people say
02:47
well i thought the word said
02:50
that God said no one can see me and live
02:53
well i have to tell you this that's
02:55
probably more about
02:57
your flesh that you know we die to our
03:00
flesh right a lot of people don't
03:01
understand that that's your rights
03:03
your opinions your attitudes
03:06
when it says to walk in the spirit not
03:08
the flesh he's talking about
03:09
that kind of a thing and i know anyone
03:11
who's been caught
03:12
up to heaven and saw the father they
03:15
were never the same
03:16
but you also have to understand that
03:18
even in the word
03:20
john himself in the book of john said
03:22
himself no one can see the face of God
03:24
and live he was talking about the father
03:26
but what did God do in revelation what
03:29
did he do in revelation 4
03:31
he caught him up caught john up remember
03:34
he's on the isle of patmos
03:35
he was in the spirit which is a place
03:38
and he heard a voice he saw the door
03:41
open and he was caught up before the
03:43
father's throne
03:45
the father is the only one who has the
03:47
rainbow coming from him it describes in
03:49
a revelation right
03:50
and that's who john saw so john actually
03:53
did see
03:54
the face of God and this is when he was
03:57
alive and was caught up in his body
04:00
taken there and there's that place in um
04:03
you know the lord is rebuking um i think
04:06
i don't know if it's miriam but he said
04:07
with moses i
04:08
speak to him face to face that's right
04:11
as one man talks to another so he
04:13
in genesis exactly what happened uh when
04:16
he
04:16
came called them out of the tent of
04:18
meeting and he was rebuking them because
04:20
they were complaining
04:22
about moses thinking he was something
04:24
special and he was the only one who
04:25
could see God
04:26
and God clearly told them when i speak
04:29
to
04:29
him i don't speak to him in dreams of
04:31
visions i speak to him
04:33
face to face so there you go
04:36
i think it has a lot to do with what the
04:38
father desires and if it's the father
04:40
who does it
04:41
i obviously don't call him from heaven
04:44
to come off his throne he comes down
04:45
because he has something he wants
04:46
revealed
04:47
or wants me to know there's going to be
04:49
a change in what he's having me do
04:51
and each time he catches me whether it's
04:53
up in heaven or comes to me
04:55
is something really important now i'm
04:59
i would have assumed and i've known you
05:01
for what
05:02
ten almost ten years seven eight nine
05:04
years and
05:05
i would have assumed before knowing you
05:07
that you must have
05:09
sought the lord for months or years to
05:11
please
05:12
help me go see heaven one day
05:15
i sought the lord because i loved him
05:18
and i did it for 20 years
05:20
but that didn't change or didn't really
05:22
cause what was going to happen
05:24
because God said he chose me before i
05:25
was born to reveal heaven
05:28
to earth and to create things off that
05:30
look were in heaven and put them on
05:32
earth so it was my it's a commission i
05:34
have
05:34
so it wasn't that you begged him and
05:35
finally i never asked once to go to
05:37
heaven
05:38
i just wanted to be with the lord i
05:39
wanted to know jesus christ more
05:41
and every night between midnight and 4
05:43
for 20 years
05:45
i would meet with him in the beginning
05:47
he didn't show up but i acted like he
05:49
was there
05:50
i would just tell him i didn't complain
05:52
about things i didn't give all my needs
05:54
i just really wanted to know him and i'd
05:55
say how much i loved him
05:57
that i would love to be just like him i
05:59
wanted people to know his heart
06:01
and i wanted a relationship with him and
06:03
one night
06:04
maybe months into all this he walked
06:07
through the wall for the first time
06:09
in my home i got undone i thought i
06:11
would melt into the floor because of the
06:13
the love that he carries
06:15
and so it was it was amazing and from
06:17
that time he came often
06:19
but i didn't stop doing it and then in
06:23
1993
06:24
he actually came and said something to
06:27
me
06:27
that they were going to give me a new
06:29
thing to do
06:31
and to prepare for this new thing and so
06:33
for
06:34
three years i really sought him he
06:36
trained me in different things
06:38
and then in 1996 he walked through the
06:40
wall of my home again while i was doing
06:42
dishes
06:43
and uh and that's when he said the
06:45
father and i are going to start taking
06:46
you on tours of heaven
06:48
and from that day he took me and they
06:50
haven't stopped so you're going on and
06:51
it increased a lot so now it's almost
06:53
every day sometimes several times
06:54
and i've heard you talk about you were
06:56
shopping one time you put your hand up
06:58
to take an item
06:59
and between the time you took reached up
07:02
and
07:02
came back down and you had already been
07:04
to heaven what it would seem like about
07:05
45 minutes or something like that
07:07
absolutely because there's no there's no
07:09
time in heaven there's no time
07:11
well so you said one of the main
07:14
questions that people ask you is
07:16
is there a literal heaven and i'm
07:17
thinking well why would they ask that
07:19
but that's that's it
07:20
what do you what do you think it's a
07:21
viable question they wanted to know if
07:22
it was a place where they would really
07:24
live
07:25
you know it talks about mansions in
07:27
heaven in the in the bible
07:29
i was raised on the word of God from the
07:31
time i was born my dad was a very
07:32
precious
07:33
person who loved everybody i'm one of 15
07:35
kids so
07:36
but i chose to spend time with my
07:38
earthly dad
07:39
like i did later with my with my
07:42
heavenly one
07:43
and so he taught me about the word and
07:45
so i was
07:46
accustomed to what the word said and
07:48
things so
07:49
so this is a literal place there's a
07:51
literal place a little heaven
07:53
and i learned very early on that your
07:55
spiritual body
07:56
inside of this natural body this
07:58
physical body you have a spiritual body
08:00
that looks just like it except much
08:01
better
08:02
your spiritual body doesn't age it grows
08:05
to a certain point and then after that
08:06
you're like timeless
08:08
so when you die out of this physical
08:10
body which goes in the ground
08:11
it's what rest your spiritual body is
08:14
taken to heaven either by jesus in
08:16
chariots uh or just caught up by your
08:19
own guardian angel and you're taken to
08:20
heaven
08:21
and it is a literal spiritual place
08:24
it's a planet it's not a flat place in
08:27
the book of john recently there's
08:28
a sense of around yes around things so
08:31
forget the flat earth people
08:34
that's really so heaven is
08:37
interesting a planet bigger than our
08:39
whole galaxy
08:40
and there's such life even in the
08:42
atmosphere even up in the sky of heaven
08:45
there's a life going on
08:46
and you have a literal mansion he
08:48
wouldn't have said you didn't
08:49
so you're going to sit on all of your
08:51
beautiful furniture probably made by
08:52
jesus
08:53
these mansions are not made by human
08:55
hands and they have some
08:56
under the water well i'll talk about
08:58
that later i know he mentioned the
08:59
mansions but you have a real mansion you
09:01
have a real life you taste the food
09:03
you walk on the ground you don't walk
09:06
through the trees
09:07
this your spiritual body in a spiritual
09:09
uh place
09:10
like you live here okay so it feels
09:13
it feels like you're in your spiritual
09:16
body but you're saying if you walk up to
09:17
a tree
09:18
you could touch the tree you can climb
09:20
the trees climb the tree if you wanted
09:22
to
09:22
probably be talking to you while you did
09:24
that you eat
09:26
real real food except no animals are
09:28
killed it's all made out of light but
09:30
smells like steak
09:31
pizza chicken whatever and so you live a
09:34
literal life
09:35
and you get to use the gift God put in
09:37
you like if you're a baker you're a
09:38
baker in heaven jesus will visit you a
09:40
lot he likes sweets
09:42
and so you have an actual life in this
09:44
mansion in heaven
09:45
that's amazing well let's let's go um
09:48
and one of the questions people say well
09:50
what happens the moment
09:52
i die now you already kind of mentioned
09:54
that but there's
09:55
okay you're you're dying and suddenly
09:58
you've taken your life
09:59
it doesn't matter where you are or what
10:01
situation you're in you could be very
10:02
sick could have been sick a long time
10:04
your spiritual body will begin to lift
10:06
out of the physical body
10:08
just like in the movies because you see
10:10
people just step
10:11
out of their bodies your guardian angel
10:13
is there and what happens begins to
10:15
happen before you
10:16
many times you'll see your guardian
10:18
angel before you step out of that body
10:20
and they're actually saying come on
10:21
let's go
10:22
let's go we have to go and sometimes
10:24
jesus will be there and he'll be saying
10:26
saying it's time to go come on
10:28
and people sometimes resist a little bit
10:30
but eventually they're going to come out
10:32
and the minute they step out they're
10:33
whole
10:33
there's no sickness there's no age no
10:36
handicaps whatsoever
10:38
the life of God flows i think the life
10:41
of God comes
10:42
everybody talks about peace there's
10:43
peace but there's joy there's
10:45
celebration
10:46
there's excitement you know you're going
10:48
home and yeah
10:49
just do you it sounds like it comes to
10:51
you
10:52
pretty quickly but you don't know what
10:54
first kind of what's happening it sounds
10:55
like for a moment well but this is the
10:57
thing you think is strange
10:58
you come out of your body you see your
11:00
body laying there okay and you go okay
11:02
how can i be there when i'm here and you
11:04
instantly feel yourself because you're a
11:05
spiritual body right
11:07
but you can feel yourself and people are
11:09
surprised
11:10
and they go man i feel good and here's
11:13
family remember saying
11:14
we want you to come back if you're 99
11:17
you're not going to come back okay and
11:19
then either jesus
11:21
your guardian angel will take you on up
11:23
to heaven through the cosmos
11:25
literally you can go through and see all
11:27
kinds of things to the cosmos sometimes
11:29
people are taken by their pa their
11:32
family members homes
11:33
just to wait even though they can't see
11:35
them yes they are their family members
11:37
on earth
11:37
yeah almost as if to say goodbye yes
11:40
absolutely when you talk about the
11:42
cosmos
11:43
you said something recently and i don't
11:45
know if this is always true but the way
11:46
you described it
11:48
is when we see things about outer space
11:50
and star trek and star wars there's
11:52
there there's the black
11:53
space and then once in a while there's a
11:56
planet
11:56
you said at least at one point God would
11:59
take you on a tour in
12:00
in the the space was not black
12:04
it wasn't black and uh now when he takes
12:07
me i'm in my spiritual body
12:08
i'm not in this flesh body so in your
12:11
spiritual body
12:12
you see things that you didn't even know
12:14
were out there
12:15
but he takes you like through the
12:17
nebulous up to the planets and they are
12:19
filled with light
12:20
it's light it's light because you have
12:23
to understand
12:24
you there's a spiritual realm in a
12:25
physical realm
12:27
but they're like together at the same
12:29
time
12:30
in your physical body you don't see all
12:32
the light that's in the spirit realm but
12:33
in your spiritual body you would see
12:35
all of that light and so it's like a
12:38
whole different thing
12:39
going through there in your in your
12:41
spiritual body and most people do get to
12:43
go on a tour
12:44
around the cosmos and i say the cosmos
12:46
because the word universe means
12:49
by the big bang theory oh okay and i
12:51
think in a lot of the ancient writings
12:53
they call it the cosmos they call it the
12:55
cosmos in heaven
12:57
and that means by God's design you
13:00
you told me one time and
13:04
different things mean something special
13:07
to
13:07
to to different people what you told me
13:10
kind of
13:10
sounded special to me that God would do
13:13
this kind of
13:14
funny thing and without telling the name
13:17
of the family because it was a real
13:18
family there was
13:20
actually pictures on the wall of
13:23
somebody's
13:24
mansion from their time on earth that
13:27
seems really weird but also kind of cool
13:29
yeah they do have a gallery you do have
13:31
pictures of your family members but this
13:33
is the thing
13:34
in the people's mansions are pictures of
13:37
babies and people that aren't even born
13:39
yet really
13:40
i don't think i got to tell you that no
13:42
you didn't tell me that this one
13:43
person's mansion i was taken to you
13:46
they had a couple of brothers and a
13:47
sister that i knew of and their pictures
13:49
were on the wall but there were other
13:51
siblings and they hadn't even been born
13:54
yet and
13:55
in the holy spirit said these are those
13:56
who will be born and are not born yet
13:59
it's like i could not and i couldn't
14:02
fathom to me it was like really because
14:03
there's a few pictures
14:05
from our kids or my wife especially when
14:08
we were young
14:09
and we had these great pictures together
14:11
and you're saying God would take
14:12
some of those even though one day the
14:15
elements will burn up with fervent
14:16
he's going to take some of those photos
14:18
and it'll be waiting for me in my mind
14:20
absolutely yes that is so
14:21
to me that's cool someone else would say
14:23
i don't want to know anything from
14:24
if your house was burned up in a fire
14:26
and all your precious things like that
14:28
were lost
14:29
those same pictures you used to treasure
14:31
he will have in heaven for you
14:32
that's unbelievable talk to me or talk
14:35
well about
14:36
transportation there's got to there got
14:38
to be a lot of different ways to travel
14:40
around
14:40
remember i keep reminding people i'm not
14:42
talking about earth okay
14:44
earth is a shadow in heaven which means
14:47
it says in the bible that heaven is a
14:49
country in the city
14:50
so that's why we have city areas and we
14:53
have country areas
14:54
it's because heaven does and the
14:56
transportation
14:58
they have kiosks like it would maybe 12
15:01
people could step into it's like a big
15:03
frame like thing and light is shooting
15:06
out and you step into the beams and they
15:07
will take you to the other side of
15:09
heaven instantly
15:10
that is one way i've i've experienced
15:12
that another way is when you begin to
15:14
worship
15:15
your your worship is visible your song
15:18
the words are visible
15:19
ribbons of color intertwined with your
15:21
words when you worship
15:22
and you're caught up and you actually
15:24
ride on that worship
15:26
all the way into the right up on the
15:27
worship that you just that you just
15:30
as you're singing you're riding on that
15:32
worship and there's like ribbons of
15:33
color like
15:34
when people sing now in a meeting i see
15:37
ribbons of color
15:38
coming out of their mouth the same thing
15:40
with instruments
15:41
and because i'm a seer so this is in the
15:43
spirit realm what you're creating
15:44
and heaven it's a substance something
15:47
and you can see it on earth now right
15:49
yes like i gotta ask this because i was
15:50
talking to someone in the studio before
15:52
that
15:52
and uh before this program and we were
15:55
talking about there are times when we
15:56
worship
15:57
God we don't even feel like worshiping
16:00
but we know we're supposed to worship
16:01
because he's worthy of our praise so
16:03
that's like a sacrifice of praise
16:05
and i have felt like to me it must not
16:08
be worth that much because it's not
16:11
flowing from me i'm doing it as a
16:13
sacrifice maybe it doesn't sound so
16:15
beautiful right
16:16
but it's coming from your heart and
16:19
uh and you're honoring God in the
16:22
highest way
16:23
in your worst day in the highest way
16:25
yeah in the highest way because when
16:27
your worst days you're worshiping him
16:28
anyway
16:29
you're very dangerous against hell when
16:31
that happens
16:32
now when worship happens on the earth
16:35
normally
16:36
it it is collected number one by angels
16:38
a lot of times but it also goes up
16:40
through the atmosphere
16:42
and it's put into the bowls before the
16:44
altar of God
16:45
and it creates an incense well that
16:47
sacrifice of praise is the most
16:49
beautiful incense in the throne room
16:51
when someone's doing that
16:52
but it also creates a weapon as you
16:55
do that when you say that you know i i
16:57
you're worthy anyway you know you are my
17:00
God and i will not serve another you
17:02
are it missiles come out of your mouth
17:06
and they go up through the second heaven
17:08
where satan has this little mock kingdom
17:10
set up and you actually blow up parts of
17:13
it i mean really it explodes they have
17:15
to try to rebuild all the time
17:17
and so you're very dangerous against
17:19
hell and your worst days
17:21
we should always worship God especially
17:23
i mean literally this has
17:24
never been taught taught to me so i mean
17:27
i'm i'm just going to say back to you
17:29
what i just heard
17:30
when i'm having a cruddy day and i feel
17:32
like doing nothing
17:34
there is this massive like atomic
17:36
nuclear
17:37
power if i say if i say lord you're
17:40
worthy anyway i i just feel
17:42
empty but nevertheless you're worthy
17:44
you're saying missiles are flying out
17:46
it's like missiles of light they fly out
17:48
of your mouth straight up to heaven
17:51
and on the way up to heaven they hit
17:53
satan's little mock kingdom in the
17:55
second heaven
17:56
and literally whatever is in the way
17:59
blows up
18:00
it will blow up he's got these mock
18:02
streets of gold that look horrible he's
18:04
got
18:04
his uh trophy rooms he's got there he's
18:07
got
18:08
his throne sits on a mountain of skulls
18:10
literally
18:11
and it blows whatever's there is going
18:13
to blow up so he's already patching and
18:14
repairing
18:15
everything and so he didn't think that
18:18
he didn't think anybody would worship
18:19
God
18:20
if he was trying to rule over them or
18:22
crush them down and
18:23
and you're saying that that actually is
18:26
also a sweet smelling
18:28
aroma to the lord roma i've been in the
18:30
throne room when people were worshiping
18:31
and i knew somebody was having a really
18:33
hard time
18:34
the in the aroma increases
18:38
it's like it comes into you like life
18:40
you can see it like wafts of light
18:42
and oh my gosh the aroma and the
18:44
father's just
18:45
receiving that praise it's very precious
18:48
to him that is amazing you know that's
18:50
i had heard this concept of it being
18:54
important to the lord when i and elmer
18:56
wrote we we
18:57
published a book called transported by
18:59
the lion of judah where she was writing
19:00
on the lion
19:01
and God took her to a place where there
19:03
was this very
19:05
i'll just the term was very dry
19:08
not very powerful worship but they were
19:10
doing the best they knew because
19:13
they didn't have the what we might even
19:14
consider the full gospel and the lion
19:16
said
19:16
this is one of my favorite places to go
19:18
because
19:21
i can't even fathom it's like
19:23
everything's turned upside down that
19:25
when it was the hardest
19:26
to worship and the driest God is like
19:29
loving it and appreciating it the most
19:31
because we're looking at times like that
19:33
i'm looking at someone up there dancing
19:35
in the spirit
19:36
and they're flowing and going and you
19:38
think why wouldn't it be nice to
19:39
to worship like that but God's looking
19:42
at it differently
19:43
so when we go to heaven my first
19:46
question is if i get to heaven
19:49
and someone that i love let's say one of
19:51
my brothers and sisters because a couple
19:52
of them are not serving the lord right
19:53
now
19:54
and let's just as a just a what if what
19:57
if one of them never chose the lord and
19:59
didn't make it
20:00
am i going to be sad for the rest of
20:02
eternity because i know that they didn't
20:04
choose
20:05
there's a few dynamics to that that
20:07
everyone needs to know
20:08
number one if you pray for them
20:11
adamantly to know
20:12
christ it gives christ the ability
20:15
at the time of their death to ask him if
20:17
they want him
20:19
many times you will maybe think they
20:22
didn't make it
20:23
but they did and the very first trip
20:25
they took me on that was something jesus
20:27
explained to me however if for whatever
20:29
reason
20:30
they did not make it that is not
20:32
something that would cause you suffering
20:34
i know that's hard for people to think
20:35
but when you are in heaven
20:37
and living in the very presence of God
20:39
himself
20:40
and jesus christ any sufferings any kind
20:43
of pains they don't touch you
20:45
it isn't that you wouldn't care but at
20:47
that point in your life you would
20:48
realize and understand like everyone
20:50
else on the earth
20:51
that had a choice to make and it just
20:53
wouldn't cause suffering
20:54
however nine times out of ten they're
20:58
probably going to make it because of
20:59
your declaration
21:01
and your stand for them and that was the
21:03
time when jesus said make sure you tell
21:05
everybody to never stop
21:07
believing for their family members to
21:08
make it it gives me permission because
21:11
of your words what you do
21:12
day or decree will be established unto
21:15
you and if you're standing in faith for
21:17
that then even at that very second
21:19
uh even if you're not there if you're
21:21
there and you can't see
21:22
he will still meet with him and say do
21:24
you want me so i have
21:26
like right now as we speak i have
21:27
probably four siblings
21:29
that aren't serving the lord so you're
21:31
saying
21:32
or the lord's saying yeah if i if i'm
21:35
standing in faith for them saying lord i
21:37
want my siblings i want and i name them
21:39
all i want them to know you
21:40
i'm standing for them i'm trusting that
21:42
you're going to say you're saying
21:44
i could pretty well trust that God's
21:45
saying i uh yeah i'll take that i'll see
21:47
you i'll see because he can't let your
21:49
words drop to the ground the bible talks
21:51
about that your words how important your
21:52
words are so important
21:54
your faith you're releasing faith on
21:56
their behalf for their salvation
21:58
and there's actually something he has me
21:59
teach people father i declare that my
22:02
loved one
22:03
will make into heaven they will be a
22:06
living testimony of the saving power of
22:08
jesus christ
22:09
and they will not miss their destiny
22:11
with you and but you don't have to say
22:13
those words but those are really good
22:14
words to use
22:15
you're out of your heart saying God i
22:18
want them to make it please let them be
22:20
in eternity i don't want them to be in
22:22
hell
22:23
i'm standing in the gap for their
22:24
salvation if you say anything similar to
22:27
that prayer
22:28
then pretty much he's going to meet with
22:31
him at their time of death
22:32
and he has the keys and i can't go into
22:35
a lot but he has keys
22:36
those keys are to hell death and the
22:39
grave
22:40
and those were the ones he took away
22:41
from satan just to give everybody a
22:43
reminder
22:44
talks about that in colossians and
22:46
that's why he rejoiced when he got them
22:48
back
22:49
because that gave him the ability at
22:51
that time of
22:52
death the keys of hell death and the
22:54
grave he had the right to do that if you
22:56
were standing
22:57
for their salvation i have and you know
23:00
i'm
23:00
my life sometimes is an open book
23:02
because i just say it because it is
23:04
but like okay my two sisters who are not
23:07
serving the lord
23:08
can understandably be not serving the
23:10
lord because they were
23:12
molested over many many years yes
23:15
and it was it became known by everybody
23:19
way long after they were adults nobody
23:21
knew yeah okay
23:22
so now probably even because of what he
23:24
did
23:25
they're not serving the lord one's
23:27
totally into a wiccan witchcraft the
23:29
whole thing
23:30
um a lot of people do go to into the
23:32
darkness if they've experienced a lot of
23:34
that
23:35
so so they went that way and i can stand
23:37
for them but here's the
23:38
here's the thing here's the rub the one
23:41
who did the damage to them
23:43
is with the lord now because he repented
23:46
he repented and we see the lord they
23:48
would never forgive you
23:49
clearing over them so when they get to
23:51
be there and they will go because i'm
23:53
going to stand
23:54
for them to go what's that going to be
23:56
like they're going to be up there and
23:58
there's this
23:59
father that abused them how does that
24:01
work they won't think that way anymore
24:03
you are so filled with the love of God
24:05
you hold nothing against anybody
24:08
when you arrive there or those who let's
24:10
say we're on the other
24:11
side maybe they were the abused ones and
24:13
they arrived and here comes those
24:15
who they didn't think maybe would get
24:17
saved but they're saved there is
24:18
no hate there's no anger there's none of
24:22
that there there's nothing but love
24:24
and let me tell you the person up there
24:25
will actually say to them i am
24:27
so sorry i didn't treat you well you
24:30
know i want you to know i love
24:32
you i'm so glad that you're here that's
24:34
probably not because of me
24:36
but i'm grateful that you made it so
24:38
let's just love one another
24:40
and instantly that relationship is
24:43
bonded right there
24:44
wow yeah it's interesting i i love that
24:46
you're saying that because
24:48
this is probably a decade ago this
24:49
sister said because i was trying to say
24:51
you know dad's with the lord now and
24:53
they probably didn't want to hear that
24:55
no she said if he's there i don't want
24:57
to go
24:57
that was what i was going to say and and
25:00
i understand that but i didn't know what
25:01
to say what do you say
25:03
you just say well i'll just keep praying
25:05
for you and believing God for you that's
25:06
what you say
25:08
you can't really you can't really
25:09
explain or even make them
25:11
want to change that it's something that
25:13
has to happen
25:14
with them in God but because you're
25:16
standing for her salvation
25:18
she will get into heaven because you're
25:20
not dropping next and your dad's up
25:22
there saying the same thing by the way
25:24
that you know my daughter will become a
25:26
living testimony to the saving power of
25:27
jesus christ
25:28
i'm standing for her also well i was
25:31
going to ask that
25:32
do those that go before do they still
25:34
proceed
25:35
yes they do and their prayers are your
25:38
prayers are actually mixing with your
25:40
prayers
25:41
they're they're getting it they're going
25:42
to get caught between heaven and
25:44
earth just like this is what happens so
25:47
we're two or more agree on anything so
25:48
my dad
25:49
and i are praying for absolutely in
25:51
agreement with your salvation
25:52
that's like huge that's like huge it is
25:55
huge
25:57
um okay so husband and wife uh
26:00
one goes to be with the lord years
26:02
before which is
26:03
my father and my mother and my mother
26:05
gets there
26:08
what's the relationship like do they
26:10
live next door do they walk arm in arm
26:12
are they friends what what what is it
26:15
like in heaven for a
26:16
minute they will totally remember they
26:17
were married and they will be
26:19
really good friends and because most
26:21
families live real close to each other
26:23
they'll probably live either next door
26:24
or
26:25
down the way you know maybe somebody
26:27
wants to live by the crystal sea someone
26:29
wants to live in the mountains
26:30
but there'd probably be a place in
26:32
between the areas somewhere
26:34
everybody does things together as a
26:35
family they remember they were family
26:37
but of course it says in the bible that
26:39
you won't be having a wife in heaven
26:41
you'll be like best friends am i
26:43
probably going to call my dad hey dad
26:45
is he you can call him dad if you want
26:47
to but probably most people will call
26:49
everybody by the first name of heaven
26:51
but you'll still know that you were his
26:53
son yeah it's it's almost hard to think
26:55
of
26:55
and the things you remember are the
26:57
great things if you remember the good
26:58
things
26:59
or you create new great things
27:02
if you didn't have any of those so and
27:04
and if someone and i remember asking
27:06
this i can't remember quite how you
27:08
answered it before but
27:09
someone had always wanted to be married
27:13
and it never happened they would and i
27:15
um
27:16
i've had multiple letters that they said
27:19
ask Kat i've always wanted to be married
27:20
what will happen when i get to heaven i
27:22
don't know what kind of answer they're
27:23
looking for
27:24
but what do you say to someone like that
27:25
when you get to heaven no matter who you
27:28
let's say you had a friend a close
27:30
friend maybe you were engaged you died
27:32
and went to heaven
27:33
you you would be good friends in heaven
27:34
but there's only one bridegroom in
27:36
heaven
27:37
and when you go home to heaven you are
27:39
going home as the father
27:40
son or his daughter and
27:43
there's going to be a wedding ceremony
27:45
in heaven you know that everyone knows
27:47
it as a believer
27:48
jesus christ is the bridegroom and
27:51
marriage on earth is only symbolic
27:53
of christ and the bride it's just
27:56
symbolic
27:57
and because there isn't any of that
27:59
fleshly thing going on
28:00
it's a spiritual love which is much
28:02
higher than the cersei love everyone in
28:04
heaven is in love with jesus christ
28:07
number one so they'll still have that
28:10
feeling of
28:11
having someone who loves them especially
28:13
it doesn't matter how many people in
28:14
heaven jesus loves
28:16
everybody in heaven and can spend time
28:18
just with them in heaven
28:20
but there's going to be a wedding
28:21
ceremony and it will be with the bride
28:24
of christ
28:25
in heaven christ is the only bridegroom
28:28
and the father actually spent time
28:29
explaining
28:30
to me why you can't go home married if
28:32
you went home married that would be big
28:34
of me
28:35
because you can't marry be married to
28:37
jesus christ
28:38
and already be married and everyone
28:41
wants that everyone wants that
28:44
relationship with jesus christ so it's
28:46
all going to be good
28:47
yeah and i had a woman that wrote and
28:49
she she had always wanted to be married
28:51
and
28:51
another one wrote and said and she i
28:55
i remember asking you about this
28:58
and she was looking for something that i
29:00
could didn't even not answer but she
29:02
said i
29:03
have been celibate on purpose my whole
29:06
life
29:07
and she wanted to know what the reward
29:10
in heaven would
29:11
would be for that i just think the
29:13
relationship with jesus you've already
29:15
got a super close relationship with
29:16
jesus some people don't
29:18
many people got born again probably
29:20
within just a little time of
29:22
going to heaven but you can build that
29:24
relationship
29:25
with him he wants to but those who
29:27
already have the intimacy with him
29:30
yes it's very special some people maybe
29:33
feel like God they're so in
29:34
awe of christ right but when you have
29:37
that bond with him you just
29:38
run up and grab him and hug him and so
29:41
that is really the reward that you've
29:43
already built that relationship
29:44
it's not something you have to try to
29:46
build on in heaven you already have that
29:49
real intimacy it's not like yeah it's
29:51
not like the lord is
29:54
we've we've talked about the lord you
29:56
know putting gifts in your mansions and
29:57
building things in your mansions
30:00
i've not heard you yet or anyone else
30:02
say because you were celibate on earth
30:04
and you did this on purpose
30:06
there's going to be this special message
30:08
for you there's a special place actually
30:10
it's called
30:11
passionate paradise i don't know if i've
30:12
ever told you about it i don't know
30:14
it's where those who really gave
30:16
themselves to christ
30:18
you know loved him on the earth and
30:20
didn't
30:21
well you of course everyone can go there
30:24
but the greater relationship you've
30:25
built with him
30:26
you get to do more things there with him
30:29
one of the things i know he does is he
30:31
gives you his own song
30:32
or he sings to you alone in this place
30:36
and uh jesus is very romantic not the
30:39
way we would
30:40
look necessarily like it down here it's
30:42
all about that closeness you have with
30:44
him so
30:45
she'll be greatly rewarded for that
30:47
having given herself to him
30:49
talk about i don't know if you called it
30:51
a secret garden or your own garden you
30:53
said everything else has a garden and
30:55
what's that
30:55
yes outside of everyone's mansion
30:58
there's a walled garden a beautiful
31:00
walled garden
31:02
made only for you you as that's your
31:04
mansion
31:05
he gives you a key when you come to
31:07
heaven jesus gives you a key
31:09
anytime you want to be with him you go
31:11
in that garden and he comes to be with
31:13
you
31:13
and the rose it's a rose the lock is a
31:16
rose
31:17
and you put the key in the middle of the
31:19
rose there's a hole
31:20
and you turn it yeah and many different
31:22
flowers usually your favorite ones
31:24
some of the flowers that christ loves
31:27
and actually is something that's one of
31:28
his favorite things
31:30
are the flowers he loves flowers people
31:31
leave him on the steps of the throne all
31:33
the time
31:34
along with sweets i think that's the
31:36
second
31:37
sweet so there's got to be
31:40
i'm trying to picture a mansion i can i
31:42
can picture
31:43
a kitchen where you would make things
31:46
and if you wanted to then
31:48
why don't you say if you wanted to i am
31:50
true i'll just speak into existence
31:52
yes that's what i'm going to do my
31:53
wife's not going to want to cook and she
31:55
even when she's visiting you know but
31:58
okay so i can picture a gathering room
32:00
okay obviously there's no need for a
32:02
bathroom so
32:04
a bedroom there's you wouldn't think of
32:06
a place to sleep so what's in this
32:08
mansion you have well this is the thing
32:11
God is so precious
32:12
if you always said you wanted certain
32:14
things a certain way like i want the
32:16
biggest
32:16
bedroom ever but it's not just a bedroom
32:19
there'd be places to recline
32:20
to meditate just to relax and everything
32:23
there are rooms like that
32:25
in your mansion and usually made lot of
32:27
the times the way you would always want
32:28
them made
32:29
so there's places that you can go that's
32:31
just beautiful
32:32
your your favorite fragrances are like
32:35
coming out of the wall
32:36
flowers living flowers are growing out
32:38
of the walls singing to you
32:39
you have this place just to be because
32:41
let me tell you sometimes you'll look a
32:43
place to be alone
32:44
because everybody wants to see you and
32:45
know you you know and they all know
32:47
where you live in heaven
32:50
and so you have these beautiful places i
32:52
call them like
32:53
parlor rooms or something you know
32:55
places you just enjoy yourself
32:57
maybe your closest friends you'll invite
32:58
into that place to spend some time just
33:00
chatting and laughing
33:02
talking about places you're going to go
33:03
to in heaven your dining rooms could
33:05
hold 100 people
33:06
it depends on if you like to entertain
33:08
if you want a lot of company
33:10
i was shown this one person's mansion
33:12
she could see a hundred people
33:14
in her dining room and everybody said i
33:16
mean it would look like king's tables
33:18
the gemstones were actually some of the
33:20
stuff that were in the center pieces and
33:22
living flowers like growing and singing
33:25
on these tables
33:26
and everybody sat down and all the
33:27
plates were just beautiful
33:29
layered place with all kinds of you sit
33:31
there and say i want roast beef
33:33
and then it appeared instantly someone
33:35
goes no i want gonna have fried chicken
33:37
no i want seafood
33:38
and what everybody wanted instantly you
33:40
would actually say at the same time
33:41
there's all the food everybody eats
33:43
you taste the food you can feel the food
33:45
going in it's made out of light though
33:47
it's not really roast beef it looks like
33:49
it looks and smells like it but no
33:51
animals are killed
33:52
no life is taken in heaven okay
33:56
it's all made out of light but if you
33:58
want to cook there's things that look
34:00
like that stuff and you have a full lot
34:02
kitchen with things you never saw before
34:04
and the greatest thing is i was also
34:06
shown that somebody was making this
34:07
massive salad about the biggest
34:09
this table and they were like peeling
34:11
this cucumber
34:12
and as they peeled it and it came off
34:14
the end it disappeared
34:15
there's no trash no garbage anywhere in
34:19
heaven so they got to make food if they
34:21
want to cook
34:22
i won't i'll say chocolate cake and
34:24
that's probably what i'll have
34:25
i'm going to declare a decree okay let's
34:27
talk for a minute about
34:29
um you said you know have friends and
34:32
you use the term
34:33
if you have some special friends that
34:35
you want to so
34:36
what i'm getting by that is that you
34:38
have
34:39
friends maybe that you had here on earth
34:42
that are still your friends
34:43
and and you have then special friends
34:46
and then do you
34:47
make new friends that become your
34:49
special friends you absolutely do
34:50
and some of those are the disciples or
34:53
the prophets
34:54
everybody wants to know you so at one
34:57
point when you come to heaven jesus is
34:58
going to put on a big
35:00
event for you in his own mansion
35:03
i don't never touch this jesus has his
35:05
own i said okay he had to live as a
35:07
human he deserves one that's what i say
35:09
that is a joke
35:10
and all the tables are set in his
35:12
mansion for two things
35:14
dancing and eating sweets and he will
35:17
actually send
35:18
this beautiful carriage for you an angel
35:21
will come within a personal invitation
35:23
from christ that will read itself to you
35:26
and he gives you the best things to
35:27
waste itself to you yes the invitation
35:30
will read itself to you everything is
35:31
alive in heaven
35:32
and then they wait you you get dressed i
35:35
have all this beautiful
35:36
and it takes you to this place and
35:38
everyone is there to meet you
35:39
there's apostles there's prophets
35:41
probably adam and eve
35:43
you know definitely probably elijah
35:45
likes to meet a lot of people he didn't
35:47
back in the day but he likes it now
35:48
king david is always going to be there
35:50
because king david is
35:52
loves to be with people and meet people
35:54
so this whole event is for you
35:56
wow and he does that jesus does it just
35:58
for you
35:59
so you don't have to run around trying
36:01
to find these people you get a chance to
36:02
meet them and know them
36:04
and later they'll come by and see you or
36:06
invite you to their there's their
36:07
mansions in places and i do remember you
36:09
talking about
36:11
people's closets and their choices oh
36:13
yes talk about that
36:15
you don't get a closet you get a
36:17
wardrobe room
36:19
that probably could be like maybe a
36:20
thousand square feet
36:22
that would be holding your wardrobe and
36:25
that doesn't mean just like rope not
36:26
just a gown and a robe you get those so
36:29
you get your gown of righteousness your
36:30
rover righteousness and your gown of
36:32
salvation
36:33
which are beyond amazingly beautiful but
36:36
you get whole wardrobes because there's
36:37
so many things to do in heaven we didn't
36:39
talk about that yet
36:40
and so everything you would need to go
36:42
anywhere and do and enjoy things in
36:43
heaven
36:44
all those all those apparels are in
36:46
there uh different things to go with all
36:48
of them are in there your crown room is
36:50
part of your mansion
36:51
the crown room there's soul winners
36:54
crowns it's the prophets all kinds of
36:56
different crowns you
36:57
earn on this earth really yes and so you
37:00
can go in there and see all the crowns
37:01
that you have gotten
37:02
through your life and doing things for
37:04
christ now
37:06
as i'm looking i'm watching the clock
37:07
we've got about five more minutes yeah
37:08
what what about
37:11
you said i don't remember was in the
37:12
house or out in the yard
37:15
there's like a doorway it's in the yard
37:17
in the yard
37:18
and you can go to different places to
37:20
the store i love that that's very star
37:22
wars star trek
37:23
it is very star trek star wars star trek
37:26
actually has some stuff that actually
37:28
kind of exists in heaven
37:30
i love how that creativity drops into
37:32
the mind of man
37:33
but one of the few times probably one of
37:35
the first five times i was taking heaven
37:38
and i was taken to see this man's
37:39
mansion and uh
37:41
it was amazing it was beautiful it was
37:43
probably like gosh probably i'd say
37:45
maybe a mile
37:46
square and then on his mansion grounds i
37:49
kept seeing these doors they were
37:51
suspended in air
37:52
there was there was a front of the door
37:54
and you could go around
37:55
and there's a back of the door but when
37:57
you went through the door
37:59
on the same space his mansion was on it
38:02
was a whole different
38:04
place that belonged to you so you could
38:06
have your house
38:07
built along the crystal sea but here's
38:09
these different doors you walk through
38:11
you have a place in the mountain of
38:12
spices
38:13
also and when you walk through she could
38:15
look out the door and see that mansion
38:17
the grounds
38:18
but you go in here and go all through
38:20
this other area that belongs to you
38:22
see i can see i can picture saying okay
38:23
i want i want to go to this door
38:25
i want my cabin in the mountain yes and
38:28
i want my
38:29
thing on the on an ocean with waves
38:33
yes and the crystal sea sounds pretty
38:35
good too so you can have multiple
38:37
places yes yes the place he said i go to
38:40
prepare a place
38:42
that place has so many things and
38:45
properties that are
38:46
all yours heaven is almost unlimited and
38:49
as many times i've been there i haven't
38:50
even seen just a little tiny bit of
38:52
reality
38:52
yeah but i've seen many mansions built
38:54
in the sky on the ground
38:56
under the ocean under the crystal sea on
38:59
top of the crystal
39:00
sea up in the mountain of spices and so
39:03
uh people who love these things you're
39:05
not going to be limited
39:06
to one little spot well it's other thing
39:09
and then
39:09
then you talked about mobile your
39:13
me about that what does that even mean
39:17
that means you get an rv in heaven
39:20
people always wanted one and never got
39:22
to have one like my parents always
39:24
wanted to have them on tour everywhere
39:26
they have them but they fly and they're
39:28
called mm's
39:29
this is all the truth no way by the way
39:32
i was psychoanalyzed by psychiatrists
39:34
and said there's no way i could lie
39:36
because i've said all these thousands of
39:40
times
39:43
mobile mansion and your family they go
39:46
up
39:46
into the sky they park in the sky
39:49
and they're beautiful they're not like
39:51
don't don't picture an airstream or
39:52
something like this way beyond that
39:54
it's very supernatural looking and you
39:56
all get in there and you leave and go
39:58
together
39:59
all over places in heaven they have
40:01
places to park i keep telling people my
40:03
dad is helping you park that was
40:04
something he loved to do
40:05
and then you come down and enjoy like
40:07
the uh
40:09
you could go to the mountain of spices
40:10
and see all that there's beautiful
40:12
things to see there
40:13
uh you could go to video land you could
40:15
go to the artist gallery all these are
40:17
places
40:18
actually in heaven the rain forest where
40:20
12 massive trees support your whole
40:22
mansion there's no roof on it
40:24
things can fly in and out nothing's
40:26
gonna make a mess
40:27
so you can imagine how people get so
40:30
undone there's adventure in heaven
40:31
everywhere
40:32
and your family go all over heaven like
40:34
tour places do things taste all the food
40:37
everywhere
40:38
then they come back and they park and
40:40
they come down then they all go back to
40:41
their
40:41
mansions i love this
40:45
when we do the next show and watch for
40:47
the one because we'll do two of these
40:48
today they'll air a different apart
40:52
probably a week weeks apart but um
40:55
i'm going to talk about ask you about
40:57
people looking down
40:59
so don't tell us that now we'll make
41:00
people but we're going to talk about
41:02
people being able to look
41:04
on us yes and see and pray for us
41:07
and that sort of thing and uh i did want
41:09
to ask you one last question
41:10
when we're praying for our relatives and
41:13
God gives them one
41:14
chance is it like they
41:18
die and they begin to come out like you
41:21
described and
41:21
at that point he says he get he says
41:25
gives them a chance he talks with them
41:26
then how does that work sometimes he
41:28
does it especially if people are like in
41:29
comas and stuff like that
41:31
and you know you know they're they're
41:33
sort of normally unconscious you have to
41:35
understand your soul never sleeps
41:37
your spirit man never sleeps sometimes
41:39
he reaches them
41:40
at that point and maybe they never come
41:43
back
41:43
you know to their senses or something
41:45
like that where you could actually see
41:46
and talk to them
41:48
they would still go to heaven and it's
41:50
normally it's right
41:51
at that moment at that moment when he
41:54
says
41:54
because they are praying for you and
41:56
they'll he'll actually show them who's
41:58
praying
41:58
they're a strong believer they've been
42:00
with me a long time they've stood in
42:01
faith for your salvation
42:03
i can't let their words drop to the
42:05
ground they've declared
42:06
and they have decreed this continually
42:09
you would know me and serve me so i have
42:11
to ask you do you want me now
42:14
and i tell you they get undone they weep
42:16
and then you will cry
42:18
and i can say almost everyone will say
42:20
yes and they'll still repent i repent of
42:22
all my sins
42:23
all the times i reject you i am so sorry
42:25
i i really want you so much so and he
42:28
goes okay then
42:29
then i will it made me think of that
42:30
last night we were together and we were
42:32
talking about
42:33
then this just happened so like two
42:35
nights ago
42:37
there was a man who betrayed me in
42:39
business years ago this is like in the
42:41
mid-80s a long time ago now he's 90
42:44
something and he's been in a nursing
42:46
home they finally got him
42:47
and brought him back because of
42:49
different things finances and now he's
42:51
back to the house
42:52
he's mostly gone yeah his mind is not
42:55
there he doesn't remember anyone he
42:57
didn't even remember he he looked at a
42:58
picture of his son recently
43:00
and he's he said who's that so
43:04
it's not alzheimer's but it's one of
43:05
those things that you go in and out yes
43:07
so the other night he had one of those
43:10
moments where he was lucid and he could
43:12
think
43:13
and his son told me just told me about
43:15
it he showed him a picture of me and he
43:17
and he looked at it and he concentrated
43:19
for a minute he says
43:21
oh i didn't treat him right and it's
43:24
like oh
43:24
man all that was all i ever ever
43:28
needed he knew he was wrong right yeah
43:30
that's all i ever do
43:31
that's how the lord does that confession
43:34
yeah
43:34
if you confess your sins you know he's
43:36
yeah and you had to forgive him anyway
43:40
all these years but it felt so good how
43:42
wonderful of God to do that
43:43
yeah it's like a real gift from God and
43:46
and at that moment when he gets to
43:48
heaven he'll really realize
43:49
man when he gets here
43:53
so well interestingly enough this
43:55
specific man
43:57
if you took the whole train through what
43:59
he had done
44:00
he's responsible for what i'm doing now
44:02
because i saw him at a trade show once
44:04
he stuck his hand out and
44:05
stopped me down the aisle and says hey
44:07
have you thought about buying a house
44:08
that's what it was in 1990 wow
44:10
and one thing led to another and we
44:12
started going to the bible study
44:14
and we received the lord in a big way
44:16
all through that particular matter wow
44:19
so it goes it's quite a story so that's
44:21
my story well anyway that's our that's
44:22
our time we
44:23
when we when we do our next show we're
44:25
going to talk so much about
44:26
what happens when your relatives can see
44:28
us and different things really this
44:30
believe me there's a lot more to cover
44:32
so make sure you still celebrate
44:34
celebrate celebration God's gonna do
44:36
something possible celebrate
44:37

02:37
hey i want to thank um jacqueline
02:41
you know i used the middle initial m for
02:43
my patriotic tie
02:44
she sent this to me uh probably a few
02:48
weeks back
02:49
and came to our office and they mailed
02:51
it to
02:52
me and when it arrived the envelope was
02:54
empty
02:55
or if the envelope if you prefer
02:59
anyways empty and they she had my
03:01
accountant who had sent it
03:03
had put an envelope inside the envelope
03:05
and somehow it had gotten out of there
03:06
and fell
03:07
out so we informed uh
03:10
jacqueline by mail we didn't have a
03:12
phone number or email
03:13
and in the meantime it showed up because
03:16
that particular envelope that fell out
03:18
was addressed
03:19
or uh so it went back days later
03:23
it showed up so here we are with the
03:25
patriotic title so thank you
03:27
to jacqueline and for your very nice
03:28
card that you sent we're very grateful
03:30
for that
03:31
so here's a few announcements by the way
03:33
tomorrow we have chris
03:34
reed on the program prophet chris reed
03:37
he's
03:38
the last time he was on he had a word
03:39
about the elections he may or may not
03:41
have a word specifically but let me just
03:44
address that if you will we were talking
03:45
about this before the show
03:47
we are not backing off in any way
03:51
it is not over so you need to understand
03:54
that we're not backing up some people if
03:56
we don't cover
03:57
quite enough or if we do one show that
03:59
is more testimony and more stories than
04:01
elections
04:02
people start getting all antsy and
04:04
saying i hope these guys aren't backing
04:06
up to no we're not
04:07
but just there are many other things God
04:09
is doing
04:10
as one of my engineers said that which
04:13
is the
04:14
best best way to say it there are many
04:16
other things
04:17
than than the election God's working on
04:20
the elections simultaneously
04:22
unlike us who cannot walk and shoot gum
04:24
at the same time God can do
04:25
millions and millions of things at the
04:28
same time
04:29
talk to millions of people at the same
04:30
time and appear to them at the same time
04:33
so
04:33
guys working on the election and has
04:36
done the
04:37
in fact i believe it's a subtle thing
04:39
and at the same time he's doing many
04:41
he's
04:42
bringing me to the lord yesterday a
04:43
woman wrote after the show
04:46
or during the show she might have
04:47
written and said that my i
04:49
i heard nathan french and when i turned
04:52
to my son
04:53
and said he was five years old would you
04:55
like to get saved would you like to
04:56
accept
04:57
jesus and she he said yes he or she i
05:00
don't remember
05:01
and so she let her i think it was a son
05:03
to the lord
05:04
and so God is doing many things not only
05:07
the election but he's never
05:10
stopped working on this thing and as
05:12
i've said i believe
05:13
it's a done deal another
05:16
couple of some of you may or may not
05:18
have heard
05:19
we lost two uh generals
05:23
i would say in the body of christ but
05:24
they're completely different carmen
05:27
uh the singer carmen went home to be
05:29
with the lord yesterday
05:31
i believe it was yesterday unless it was
05:33
earlier today i think it was yesterday
05:35
and then rush limbaugh went home today
05:37
and i say went home because he was very
05:39
spiritually
05:40
he was a strong believer in his later
05:42
days i don't know
05:43
for how many years but it's for a number
05:45
of years and he's a general and
05:47
as an analogy i want to say this God
05:49
makes a statement
05:51
very often by who he brings home at the
05:53
same time
05:54
so the statement he's making is that he
05:56
sees
05:57
rush and carmen in the same light the
06:00
same kind of rewards for
06:01
jobs well done and for serving him back
06:04
when
06:04
princess die um lost her life in that
06:08
fateful accident
06:09
the same day she went home to be with
06:11
the lord mother teresa went home to be
06:13
with the lord
06:14
and a prophet at that time said she she
06:16
was God
06:17
showed her literally he could she could
06:19
see through mother uh through princess
06:21
dye's eyes
06:23
as just before they lack the accident
06:25
hit
06:26
uh princess dye had uh turned around to
06:30
see what was going
06:30
in and on and she said she never saw it
06:33
happen
06:34
she didn't see it coming because she
06:35
wasn't even looking forward she was
06:37
looking back to see
06:38
all these racing motorcycles and cars
06:41
but God was making a statement that the
06:43
same love he had for mother teresa who
06:45
went home that day
06:46
he had for princess die who had received
06:49
christ and was a follower of christ
06:51
you know mother teresa had taken the vow
06:53
of poverty and here's another princess
06:56
died living
06:57
probably on the ragged edge of all kinds
07:00
of wealth but
07:01
uh as far as some of the work she did
07:04
that we are rewarded for you're not safe
07:05
for your works but you know
07:07
uh princess die was
07:10
one of her platforms that she stood up
07:13
for years just to getting rid of the
07:15
minds that have been buried beneath the
07:16
earth all over the earth
07:18
um that was killing were killing
07:20
children that were playing in the dirt
07:22
so
07:23
uh i so that's at a point that God's
07:25
making is that
07:26
both rush and carmen would take taking
07:29
home on the same day or receiving the
07:30
same
07:31
rewards or or rewards for a job well
07:33
then
07:34
maybe there's a better way to say it not
07:35
the same rewards but um
07:38
because they would be very individual
07:39
rewards for the things that they did so
07:41
a couple more things uh we do want to
07:43
remind people about
07:45
our new social media platform zap it
07:48
and some of you have been once we
07:50
announced that we've been getting a
07:51
thousand new users a day
07:52
many days not all days i guess it more
07:55
accurate to say
07:56
some days we get a thousand new users a
07:59
day
07:59
some more than that uh be sure you tell
08:02
your friends about it
08:03
we are very facebook friendly next time
08:06
i come on we'll try to have we either
08:07
have a commercial for you or we'll show
08:09
you our logo which we're very proud of
08:11
but zap it look if you once you get
08:14
either zappa.com or go to the app store
08:16
for your android or
08:18
iphone smartphones and load load those
08:21
apps up that way
08:23
you won't have a really strong learning
08:25
curve because it will feel
08:26
similar it can't be the same but it will
08:29
feel it looks similar
08:31
as facebook so uh we are the
08:34
the lord told us to start building that
08:35
three years ago
08:37
and so we went online about a year
08:40
and but we haven't been making a splash
08:42
about it because we've been fixing the
08:43
little bugs along the way and getting
08:45
ready for the big yet because
08:46
one day someone like president donald
08:49
trump is going to mention zapin and we
08:50
have to be ready for that
08:52
so right now we're making ourselves
08:54
ready but there's many
08:55
many thousands on now uh many of your
08:59
friends i'm sure
09:00
i'm sure already on zap and to be sure
09:02
to tell them about that so
09:04
last announcement is that Kat Kerr will
09:08
be with us today but
09:09
she's with us today this wednesday today
09:11
and
09:13
friday on friday we're having her again
09:15
so we'll have her twice this week
09:18
we have tried and we will continue to
09:20
try to do her every
09:21
wednesday but we're coming into the time
09:23
when travel will
09:24
kick back in and probably won't be able
09:26
to be every single wednesday so
09:29
because she'll be back on the road
09:30
speaking at many places so
09:32
probably will be having her speak from
09:35
hotel rooms at times when she's on the
09:37
road
09:38
which is just fine um we'll all have to
09:41
do a little bit more of that i've
09:42
enjoyed this time on the
09:44
not being on the road and being able to
09:45
do it all from here i if there will be a
09:47
few times i'll probably have to do the
09:49
show
09:50
on the road um but i love this setup
09:52
right at my home there's my kids and my
09:54
wife and
09:55
all of that so let's see i think that's
09:58
all i
09:58
have for you today so
10:02
all right without further ado let's
10:03
bring kat in here
10:05
and here she is hey you're all
10:08
looks like you've got a new uh pink dude
10:12
did you get a new did did you get your
10:14
hair picked up again
10:17
well actually you can tell when it gets
10:19
closer to the time when it needs to be
10:21
repinked i do some alternative
10:24
styling so after today i actually go
10:27
today to get
10:28
more pink put in it oh i thought you
10:31
must have just had it because it looks
10:33
so pink but maybe that
10:34
is that it's because we fixed the lights
10:38
in the studio
10:41
yeah and i can you know we see your face
10:44
much better thank you for fixing that it
10:45
was
10:46
we just had a bit too much light on you
10:47
so
10:49
for that so well you know kat um we
10:52
didn't get a chance to talk before the
10:53
show but we usually start with things
10:55
where all things related to trump and
10:56
the election
10:58
and i'm just going to turn that over to
10:59
you and when you're all done with that
11:01
we'll jump into the questions you got
11:02
way more than enough questions so yes
11:05
all right we actually sat together for
11:07
several hours
11:09
and i wanted to thank steve and doreen
11:11
for having me
11:13
at their home now that really happens
11:16
rarely for me also to visit people who
11:19
put me on the air
11:20
but my hubby and i had a couple extra
11:22
days we made it possible
11:24
we wanted to visit with steve and doreen
11:26
and thank them for all they've done for
11:28
us and for one question for heaven
11:31
and it was a delightful time but guess
11:32
what we talked about uh
11:34
heaven for hours going over all these
11:39
questions that people have asked and we
11:40
picked up so many
11:42
it'd probably take quite a few shows but
11:44
you know we love doing this don't we
11:45
steve we really do we do it's really fun
11:47
and we we sat in the living room for a
11:49
couple hours i guess and
11:50
then we went into our kitchen slash
11:52
breakfast and we've got this neat little
11:54
built into the wall
11:55
and we all sat around there and made
11:56
sandwiches and yeah yeah
11:59
we were eating and snacking while we
12:01
were going through our hours
12:03
of we wanted to make it as exciting for
12:06
everybody as possible because you know
12:08
i love to see having to know but heaven
12:10
but i think i love even more
12:11
sharing it so we have some some new
12:14
things coming up that we can talk about
12:16
but
12:16
first first of all
12:19
i want to make it perfectly clear
12:23
my choice about trump and all this stuff
12:26
going on with the elections
12:28
it's never changing okay i don't have
12:31
just a little job
12:33
where i decide to talk about trump i
12:35
have a commission
12:37
for my life okay here to share heaven's
12:41
plans
12:42
God has chosen him yes
12:45
whether you believe it or not he is
12:48
actually right now our president
12:50
he is okay because he won and a lot of
12:54
you may not like me saying that that's
12:55
just too bad because guess what that's
12:56
the truth
12:58
and yes you're going to hear more about
12:59
actually there's been a couple little
13:01
clips he's been putting out there
13:03
and i happen to know you are about to
13:05
see a lot of
13:06
action concerning all the stuff we've
13:09
been talking about
13:10
and we we try to hold back as much as we
13:12
can until
13:15
then you're all going to know anyway
13:17
because we want to keep being able to
13:18
talk to you you know on the on the
13:20
format that we have right now we want to
13:22
keep talking about things but trust me
13:25
i will just say this i live in florida
13:29
if you're making those to come and take
13:31
me down you have to face these 154
13:34
angels who are with me
13:36
i always have to give a warning you will
13:39
not live
13:40
in a decision like that uh the father is
13:43
that when he told me
13:45
they're not gonna let anybody take my
13:46
life that's not a challenge to you
13:48
that's a warning
13:49
for your your safety so this is it i
13:52
live in florida
13:53
we are by four military bases
13:57
never and all the years i've lived here
14:00
over
14:01
50 years have i heard so much activity
14:04
in the sky
14:05
that one thing people what you've been
14:09
hoping to see
14:10
is going to be happening that means
14:13
there's activity going on and i can say
14:15
this again
14:16
yay that trump was acquitted from the
14:19
appearance
14:20
yes lord once we were expecting that why
14:23
because the whole thing was a fraud
14:25
there was nothing they could even hold
14:27
and do guess what there's nothing else
14:28
they can do just so you understand
14:31
once that part is over the action will
14:34
begin
14:35
and we we all knew that here other
14:38
people i know knew that also
14:40
so no he's not abandoning anybody and i
14:43
want you to know
14:44
he's a smart cookie God made him smart
14:48
he made him bold he'd have to to put up
14:50
all the mess he's had to
14:52
i can just say you're about to see
14:53
action the kind of action you want to
14:56
see
14:56
so hold on to your seat remember i said
14:59
this would be a wild roller coaster ride
15:01
and it has been
15:03
you're also going to start hearing the
15:04
actual truth
15:06
about the virus so guess what
15:09
this thing is happening people probably
15:11
and i can't give dates on
15:13
anything i just say the next few months
15:16
couple months
15:18
is going to have some of the greatest
15:19
activity you've ever seen i'll leave it
15:20
at that
15:21
but i want you know i'm celebrating my
15:24
family is celebrating remember there's
15:25
150 of us
15:27
and everyone i talked to around this
15:29
country while i
15:31
have been doing some traveling by the
15:33
way i'll give you a tip i am almost
15:35
always home on wednesday steve i almost
15:38
always make
15:38
here on wednesday i try to travel
15:40
through the week and the weekend but i'm
15:42
always
15:43
almost always here on wednesday so as
15:44
long as i'm here on wednesday you'll
15:46
keep seeing me
15:47
i want to encourage you and all of you
15:49
also in the snow thing
15:51
uh i think that thing is going to be
15:53
coming to an end fairly soon
15:56
a lot of the weather workers have been
15:57
on that
15:59
crushing the ice and any destruction i
16:02
do need to make a comment
16:04
yay hank you nailed it there is snow and
16:08
it's everywhere not in florida
16:11
but it's everywhere up around the
16:12
northeast across
16:14
all of central america most of it i'm in
16:17
contact with a lot of different people
16:18
there
16:19
a lot of them once the weather warriors
16:21
that's the body of christ who have
16:23
chosen to take authority over
16:24
destructive weather
16:26
we're not changing the weather patterns
16:28
we're not allowing destructive weather
16:30
and this is the what the
16:32
the holy spirit taught me himself they
16:35
did not create the weather to destroy
16:38
they created to replenish and nourish
16:40
the earth so there
16:41
those four seasons will keep coming and
16:44
uh
16:45
and the bible says something about that
16:46
but we're not going to allow destruction
16:49
do you like destruction so stop bashing
16:52
us about it start saying something with
16:55
your mouth
16:55
that matters and so i'm still
16:58
celebrating here
17:00
like i said there's a lot of activity
17:01
going on in several different states on
17:04
purpose
17:05
wink wink uh i'll give you some time
17:08
i promise you you will see in here
17:11
activity even if they don't put it on
17:12
the other news channels
17:14
you're gonna hear it trust me it'll be
17:16
all over the internet
17:17
so stay excited and i do want to say one
17:19
more little thing about the cake
17:21
make sure you do that eat a piece about
17:24
this big
17:25

17:28

but i want to know once you know i am
18:16
praying all the time for everybody
18:18
out there and i know i'm talking a lot
18:20
about america but right now guess what
18:22
the focus of the world
18:23
and heaven is on this country God let it
18:28
go into the darkness and throw it away
18:29
to the devil
18:30
he isn't angry at any of us those we the
18:34
people
18:34
we stood we prayed he loves your prayers
18:37
they create an incense in the throne
18:39
room so you haven't done any of that
18:41
wrong
18:42

18:45
keep your trust and belief in God and
18:48
all you bashers go get saved then you'll
18:50
be happy
18:52
that's [ __ ] right now yes
18:55
things are going on behind the scenes
18:57
and it is definitely
18:59
not over it won't be soon for one side
19:03
for one side who hasn't been good that
19:05
side is going to see the end of what
19:07
they've been getting away with
19:09
so hello hello now um
19:15
let me ask you one more quick question
19:17
on that um i
19:18
uh one gentleman wrote a few days ago
19:21
and i think it was an older message
19:22
because it's
19:22
where hundreds behind and he said please
19:25
ask Kat
19:26
please ask Kat to just please tell us
19:29
the date trump's coming back because
19:32
we're just getting tired and weary we
19:34
want to know the day
19:35
tell people why you can't or won't it's
19:38
usually kent
19:40
in other words God's not revealing it
19:41
but i'm gonna let you say it
19:44
i have been given the commission okay
19:46
that means jesus came
19:48
in person and he gave me a commission
19:51
to share what they share with me
19:54
and to show and tell what they have
19:57
literally shown
19:58
and told me that means i've been taken
20:00
to the past
20:01
into the future i've seen over 100 years
20:04
into the future
20:06
about this country it was still here
20:08
people
20:09
and celebration maybe not eating cake
20:12
but there was great days glory days
20:15
and all this is going on i know this
20:18
from the father
20:19
he said for over a year great deep
20:23
detailed exposure would take place
20:26
guess what he knew it guess what
20:29
he knows that has to happen you can't
20:32
bring in a season
20:33
that's so filled with with creativity
20:36
brand new inventions that will make our
20:38
lives
20:39
better and happier and he can't bring in
20:42
these
20:43
moves of God like baptism and fire
20:46
and carrying the glory around the world
20:49
without
20:49
interference he has to do something
20:52
first guess what
20:53
clean the platform off make sure the
20:56
darkness is pushed back
20:58
so we don't have to fight a lot of you
21:00
are still fighting
21:01
for things and i understand that but
21:03
days are coming where you will walk into
21:06
what God has shown you in order for that
21:09
to happen
21:10
all the southern mess is being dealt
21:13
with
21:14
if he doesn't give me a date i would be
21:17
breaking my commission with him
21:20
and i'm not doing that and i don't have
21:22
a date i can't give you a date
21:24
i'm just telling you there's a shift
21:26
towards uh
21:28
justice coming and you will know and see
21:31
it and he promised that when all that
21:33
stuff starts happening
21:35
you will see and you will know it then
21:37
you'll start getting really excited
21:39
don't let any fear come into you that
21:41
comes from the enemy
21:43
the enemy can't do anything else he'll
21:45
make you afraid guess what
21:46
i'm not i'm not concerned about anything
21:49
because i know what my God
21:51
who he is i know how much he loves us he
21:54
raising up america to be a light for
21:56
generations why would he let the
21:59
darkness take over
22:01
so until he gives me a date i can't give
22:04
you one
22:05
that means you need to ask for greater
22:08
faith trust in God find something to
22:12
stay busy with and i was actually going
22:13
to tell everybody out there
22:15
get a blank piece of paper and on one
22:18
side i want you to write down what you
22:20
didn't get to do last year you had
22:21
planned
22:22
and over the next year i want you to
22:26
write the things that you will do
22:28
that you purpose to do make sure you put
22:30
something in there for God
22:32
and then a year from now you look back
22:34
and see the things you wrote down
22:36
that you desired to do or you knew you
22:39
wanted to do
22:40
and see how many of those things you get
22:41
accomplished that is being productive
22:44
okay
22:45
but i'm not going to give you God has
22:47
not given me
22:48
because then who would be able to trust
22:50
right yeah
22:52
and to speak for God you say what he
22:55
says
22:56
that's right amen
22:59
yeah amen there's yeah there has been or
23:01
you know everyone
23:02
everyone coming near into the prophetic
23:05
i remember when paul cain walked by me
23:07
the first time
23:08
this is like 32 years ago he didn't know
23:11
me and i didn't know him i became
23:12
i got to know him years later and became
23:14
my friend but
23:16
i was i lived in dallas texas and i went
23:18
to this big old convention
23:19
he came walking by me down from the
23:21
platform and because
23:22
he's a prophet and a good one and he was
23:25
coming my way i was confessing
23:27
everything lord i
23:28
have confessed to make sure because i
23:30
had heard
23:31
that a prophet can't see confess since
23:34
and so i was sure that he would
23:36
he would walk by me and know all of my
23:38
sins even though i was just one in a
23:40
crowd of thousands
23:41
and so i was confessing forgiving the
23:44
you know anyone
23:45
so people everyone knew the prophetic
23:47
thinks that if a prophet is in the room
23:49
they know everything
23:50
they only know what God has told them
23:53
and so
23:54
yeah go ahead go ahead once they have
23:58
been
23:59
with God and have been there for say 50
24:02
years
24:04
and you have focused on everything he
24:06
wants and you have walked in obedience
24:08
you will one day begin to walk in the
24:10
things remember what christ said the
24:12
things
24:12
i did you will do also christ himself
24:16
walking is a man a righteous man knew
24:19
the thoughts and intents
24:20
of everybody's heart guess what
24:24
when i'm in a room i know the thoughts
24:26
and intents
24:27
of everybody's heart even if i don't say
24:30
it so i get happy when i see lots of God
24:33
in there
24:35
wow yeah so that's and you know that
24:38
anointing is going up
24:39
and that's interesting because the
24:41
scripture does say
24:42
the holy spirit i'll send you the
24:43
comforter and he will lead you into all
24:45
truth to this
24:47
pastor that i had this is i wasn't my
24:49
own pastor he was someone else's
24:51
in san luis obispo in those years i
24:52
don't know he i don't even know if he's
24:54
alive anymore but it was
24:55
35 years ago and he said steve sometimes
24:58
i
24:59
just go to the mall not that many people
25:01
go to the mall these days he said
25:03
sometimes i just go to the mall to
25:04
discern people and i said what
25:06
he said the holy spirit came to lead us
25:08
into all truth
25:09
so i go and i discern people as they
25:11
walk by
25:12
he was just practicing his gift so that
25:15
sounds legitimate right
25:17
it does it does actually happen
25:20
and some people sometimes want to shut
25:22
it out but you know when it gives you an
25:24
opportunity
25:25
when you reach that stage make sure
25:28
if he has said go say something if he
25:30
ever says go tell this person
25:32
that i said this make sure you say God
25:34
just had me
25:36
wants me to tell you this make sure that
25:38
you don't take credit for that
25:40
and make sure you know he wanted you
25:42
them whoever they say
25:44
if i'm in the mall every now and then
25:46
it'll happen i'm going to go tell that
25:48
woman
25:48
that her grandson is going to be fine
25:50
from the surgery
25:51
something like that wow if i kept
25:55
avoiding doing that when i knew he was
25:58
saying and guess what my discernment
26:00
would be squat
26:01
that's what would happen so i have to
26:03
step out and be bold enough to say
26:05
so i'd go tell them that and they begin
26:07
to weep and cry and laugh and shape
26:09
because
26:10
their grandson was actually in surgery
26:13
and guess what i knew she knew because
26:16
of the word God
26:17
gave that he would be okay
26:21
most i say 90 of prophetic is used for
26:24
that very purpose
26:25
and by the way in the past back in the
26:28
ancient days
26:29
there were no prophetic lines prophets
26:32
spoke to the leaders of the nations
26:34
the religious hierarchy of the day every
26:37
now and then
26:38
like the angel came and talked to mary
26:40
and things like that every now and then
26:42
that personal thing would happen because
26:45
they were going to be called for
26:46
something
26:46
great in the earth so you're in a whole
26:49
time
26:50
we've been in this time for about maybe
26:52
40 years where God would let personal
26:54
prophecy take place so you
26:56
all are blessed because back in the day
26:59
that's why the prophet stayed in the
27:00
mountains
27:03
okay i don't have a cave or a mountain
27:05
i'm stuck right out here
27:07
in the face of everybody and i can't i'm
27:09
going to be there
27:10
so i just want you to know it's not easy
27:12
to live the life of a prophet
27:14
uh they reach you or they're chasing
27:17
after you because they love you
27:18
or they want to know something from God
27:20
and i've been able to
27:22
understand and hear God from a very
27:24
young age don't think four and
27:25
five-year-olds can't
27:27
get saved they can i did yeah
27:30
i used to do these i used to do these
27:34
i i used to do these uh prophetic
27:36
conferences
27:37
um and i you know i don't do as much we
27:40
do one a year
27:41
that when it's not the cover time but i
27:43
prophesy i don't call myself a prophet
27:45
but i prophesy at will when when i
27:47
choose to i just
27:48
prophesied because it works out that way
27:50
um
27:52
but oh what was i going to say let me
27:53
lose my train of thought uh-oh uh-oh
27:57
you'll get it back uh we'll go on if i
28:00
think of it i'll bring it back up that's
28:01
every once in a while i'm gonna
28:03
i'm building it up to the point and then
28:04
by the time i get there it's gone
28:07
listen let's let's jump into some
28:09
questions about it and i've got
28:10
i think i have more than usual from kids
28:13
today it's not all from kids but
28:14
sometimes the kids
28:16
sometimes they have to expect the adults
28:18
are saying my daughter wants to know
28:20
this
28:20
so that they'll get asked but i don't
28:23
really know
28:24
because if we have childlike faith our
28:26
questions should sound like
28:28
children's questions frankly um so this
28:31
is in
28:32
this is from a little girl i don't know
28:34
her age
28:35
her name is danica and she's requesting
28:37
that you address her
28:39
by name when you answer her questions i
28:41
thought that was pretty sweet all right
28:45
the same name as a famous uh race car
28:47
driver danica patrick was that
28:49
this is a different danica but here i
28:52
mean she has three questions
28:54
about heaven and i'll just give them all
28:56
to you if you forget i'll remind you of
28:58
one
28:58
is there candy in heaven that's one do
29:01
they have an art room which i assume i
29:04
don't know if she means in my house or
29:05
an art room in heaven i'm not sure and
29:08
then this
29:08
does God really walk through the walls
29:11
those are her three candy in heaven an
29:12
art room or
29:13
does God really walk through the balls
29:15
yeah i will i will address the last one
29:18
first he is God he can do anything he
29:22
wants to
29:23
when there was nothing out there he
29:25
created
29:26
it so if he is the creator that would be
29:29
the father and the son
29:30
working together they did that a lot
29:33
about creating the earth and creating
29:35
the
29:35
the planets and all the stuff that's out
29:38
there
29:38
they are over time they're over physical
29:41
walls
29:42
spiritual walls yes he really walks
29:45
through the wall
29:46
just walks to the wall like he's just
29:48
walking down the street or something
29:50
it's not like there's some big drama
29:52
thing then he appears he just comes
29:54
in says what he wants to or writes
29:56
something on my wall
29:58
and then he goes out jesus is more the
30:01
visitor kind of a person if jesus comes
30:04
he'll usually sit down and talk to me
30:06
about things
30:07
i i i don't understand why one does one
30:10
does the other
30:11
uh because they like to do things
30:13
together that's all i know
30:15
but yes he does and i'm undone it isn't
30:18
like a person coming through the wall
30:20
this is the God of all creation
30:22
he sent his son to die for us i am
30:24
undone
30:26
i feel the glory beginning to fill my
30:29
room before he comes to the wall
30:31
and then waves of love consuming me so
30:34
it's not just like oh he walked through
30:36
the wall
30:37
no you know who it is and i get
30:40
really uh hot from the from the love
30:43
that he carries for all of us
30:45
he loves you the same by the way so
30:47
second question
30:48
yes absolutely there are there is
30:52
art all over heaven and guess what
30:55
danica
30:56
you can paint the sky of heaven because
30:59
it's heaven
31:01
and there are art places there's an art
31:03
gallery there's a place called the
31:04
galleria
31:05
where they hold huge festivals in the
31:08
streets of heaven
31:09
everybody comes and sees everybody's art
31:11
you get to take it
31:12
back to your mansion nothing costs
31:14
anything your supplies won't cost
31:16
anything
31:17
and all this is part of your gift if
31:19
you're an artist you'll get to do this
31:21
in heaven
31:22
and like i say sometimes people come and
31:24
paint in the throne room
31:26
and the very air for our breathing is
31:29
the canvas
31:30
i i i can't explain any better than that
31:33
except yes you're going to have art and
31:34
of course
31:36
there is candy chocolate is one of the
31:39
best things they have in heaven
31:42
gift is candy makers down here they use
31:45
the same gift in heaven but it's just a
31:46
whole lot better
31:47
and no one's going to be hurt by sugar
31:50
but it will be some of the sweetest
31:51
things you ever have there you go
31:53
that's really really good my wife bought
31:55
me for valentine's day a box of c-scan i
31:57
haven't had this in years she doesn't
32:00
buy it because
32:01
i she she said you got the dark
32:03
chocolate
32:04
with the nuts that you like i ate way
32:07
too many
32:10
i'm glad that she didn't and then she
32:12
bought me maybe i mentioned this the
32:13
other day i don't know
32:14
she bought me a trump trump from the
32:17
trump store
32:18
it was like gold bouillon and silver
32:21
bouillon maybe i mentioned it but
32:22
it was chocolate inside it looked like
32:24
actual gold bars
32:25
it was good all right well listen okay
32:28
so this one is she says the woman says
32:31
um sally archelli or sally
32:35
uh says my son asked me
32:38
where did God come from where was he
32:40
before creation
32:41
and then she also said and i think he
32:43
addressed this on another one not for
32:44
this person
32:45
my son wants to know if there are cars
32:47
in heaven and technology so maybe just
32:49
answer those at the same time
32:51
where was God before creation and where
32:53
he got
32:54
what wings was and there would be
32:56
something probably no one will ever do
32:58
any
32:59
answers in that he was the one who made
33:02
everything
33:03
life came from the father creation came
33:07
he
33:08
even time comes from him so he always
33:11
was there was no one he made him he
33:14
didn't disappear somewhere
33:16
he has always existed and one day when
33:18
you get to heaven
33:19
why don't you ask him that question
33:21
yourself you'll probably get the same
33:22
answer
33:23
and yes there are cars in heaven every
33:26
kind of cars there
33:27
most of them ride on air they don't need
33:29
tires however there's places you can go
33:32
they actually have antique car shows i
33:35
actually saw elvis at one
33:37
i was taken by to see sometimes i'm
33:39
taking the places in heaven just so i
33:41
can tell you what's there
33:42
they have antique car shows none of them
33:44
are rusty they're all pristine
33:46
beautifully uh beautifully kept i don't
33:49
think it's something from the earth i
33:50
think that these are all all made in
33:52
heaven
33:53
just for your delight but yes they have
33:55
them they have car racing nobody can get
33:57
hurt racing the cars
33:59
they have trails that you can ride on
34:02
in the sky made out of fire and you can
34:04
take motorcycles heaven has those two
34:08
i call them that they're they're by
34:10
hyper drive you can ride them on these
34:12
fiery trails in heaven uh through the
34:15
sky
34:15
so there's a lot of places to take cars
34:17
some go straight up the side of a
34:19
mountain without a road
34:21
so man
34:24
i got to ask you when you say antique
34:26
cars
34:27
some guy goes oh man i collect 57 chevys
34:30
are you saying they have 57
34:32
chevys whoa whoa that's you know
34:36
they have them and um people who love to
34:40
do that on the earth guess what they get
34:42
to do in heaven
34:43
they get to show their cars or they get
34:45
to create these
34:46
shows they have a lot of events all over
34:49
heaven
34:50
for us we have adventure excitement and
34:53
fun in heaven
34:54
so it's important that God provides all
34:57
this and he's the one who gave that
34:59
person that gift
35:00
you're not going to have a job in heaven
35:02
what your gift is the thing you're the
35:04
most passionate about
35:05
whether it's art or even styling hair
35:09
yes they have those through
35:10
building designing all florists i could
35:14
just go on
35:14
rodeos uh oh amusement parks
35:18
that's all there but you have to
35:19
understand there is no darkness
35:22
nothing bad nothing evil nothing that
35:24
represents hell
35:25
they even have movies but nothing that
35:27
represents hell is in
35:28
any of that stuff but it's adventurous
35:31
fun and exciting
35:33
so that's why your family members
35:35
they're not bored and sometimes jesus
35:37
will go and enjoy those things with you
35:39
and so that i mean i was asking the lord
35:42
about his person um that personality but
35:46
how person how personal he is
35:48
with our life and i brought this up a
35:50
couple times because it really made an
35:52
impact on me that you said
35:53
you saw in a mansion where somebody's
35:55
favorite photo from
35:57
from his camera from earth and i thought
35:59
really in this perfect time
36:00
which then brought me to this question
36:02
that i wanted to ask if i just
36:04
popped back into my head so i have a
36:06
favorite photo of my wife and i were
36:08
married 42 years ago
36:10
if that if i want a photo of us in our
36:13
wedding
36:14
is that off limits because we're not
36:15
married anymore so
36:17
therefore i wouldn't have that photo no
36:20
that doesn't count no he wouldn't look
36:22
at it like that that was your life on
36:24
earth okay
36:26
he understands there's precious memories
36:28
we make on the earth
36:30
he doesn't just wipe all that away
36:34
at the end of the bible i have to say
36:36
this too
36:37
because it takes me there when the word
36:40
says
36:40
at the end of revelation the former
36:42
things will be remembered
36:44
no more that doesn't mean that you'll
36:47
forget you ever had a family that you
36:50
won't know them anymore in heaven
36:51
that means none of the wicked none of
36:55
the evil
36:56
none of the trauma the attacks the
36:59
violence the hate
37:01
will be remembered no more by anybody
37:04
for all of eternity
37:06
so it's like the devil would be wiped
37:08
out of your mind all the wicked and evil
37:10
stuff that went on through history
37:12
for you for your family that will be
37:14
remembered no more
37:16
but your precious knowledge you made on
37:18
the earth he does not mind
37:20
these photographs or these things being
37:22
on your wall
37:23
and this is how they do it i laid down
37:25
my gift as a photographer myself
37:28
to do all of this for him the only thing
37:30
i get photos of now
37:31
are when the host appear and he says
37:34
tells me take a picture uh
37:36
so this is what he said to me if you see
37:39
something you wish you could take a
37:40
picture of us maybe i'm in the mountains
37:42
maybe it's the fall leaves he said you
37:43
just say take it
37:45
and he said the angels will take that
37:46
and it will be on your wall
37:48
in heaven i would say i would sincerely
37:51
say
37:52
if you have a favorite beautiful
37:53
photograph nothing bad nothing dark in
37:56
it
37:57
just say God i would love to have a a
37:59
copy of that
38:00
he will make a copy and put it in your
38:02
mansion so he doesn't wipe that away
38:04
that you were married that you had kids
38:06
that's that part's not wiped away to me
38:08
that to me kat that is a whole new
38:11
revelation it's not
38:12
and it wasn't that i thought God would
38:14
refuse a memory
38:16
but we've been we've spent so much time
38:19
and and um
38:21
time explaining that in heaven we're not
38:24
neither married nor giving a marriage we
38:25
will be friends with our former spouse
38:27
but that we live in our own mansions but
38:29
we've made such an important deal of
38:31
that
38:31
that for you to tell me and to clarify
38:34
and other people are hearing that say
38:35
you mean i can't have
38:36
a picture of my husband and i on earth
38:38
in my house
38:39
to me that's going to come across as
38:41
really good news to a lot of people
38:44
well it's your if he has your family
38:46
lying practically
38:48
on that wall why would that matter if it
38:50
was just you
38:51
and somebody that you you know you all
38:53
made those kids right
38:55
uh evan they don't do that you are best
38:58
friends as husband and wife
38:59
you go home as the father's son and his
39:02
daughter
39:03
uh but he doesn't take away the memory
39:05
now if it was a horrible
39:08
situation that's different i'm not
39:10
talking about that i'm not about
39:12
happily married wonderful family that
39:15
you loved
39:16
uh those photos are on your wall i've
39:19
already seen it in someone's mansion
39:22
and they hadn't even had some of those
39:24
children yet that i saw their photos on
39:26
the wall wow
39:31
God outside of time just blows my mind
39:33
so okay
39:34
um my daughter and son-in-law are having
39:38
their first child in june
39:40
how should i pray for this child before
39:42
she is born so this is like
39:44
uh the grandma of the child and how
39:46
shall i pray for this child before she's
39:48
born
39:48
and i would like to pray a special
39:50
blessing over her at her birth
39:52
when i see her for the first time so
39:53
she's asking about how she would do
39:55
those
39:56
do you do you know uh do they have a
39:58
name yet maybe you don't want isn't it
40:01
no the the the person asking the
40:03
question is krista
40:05
but no it doesn't say that okay we're
40:07
just gonna say
40:09
the baby it's gonna be a baby girl let's
40:10
just say her name is sarah
40:12
you would say sarah i declare you will
40:15
not miss
40:16
one moment of your destiny on this earth
40:19
you would do great things for God
40:23
you will have favor with God himself
40:26
he purposed you he sent you we will pray
40:30
over you and declare over you
40:32
but we are thankful he sent you you're a
40:34
blessing to this family
40:36
that would be one of the most precious
40:38
prayers you could say over
40:40
any child being born even if maybe one
40:43
was adopted you could even declare
40:44
that that same prayer over them number
40:46
one that they will be everything God
40:49
intended them to be and they won't miss
40:51
their destiny here on earth
40:53
and that they will have love around them
40:55
they will walk in favor
40:57
and you might want to add one other
40:59
thing you will be
41:00
fierce against the enemy
41:03
i said that over all of mine my
41:07
daughters are so fierce against
41:10
evil they don't tolerate anything in the
41:12
enemy in their life
41:13
uh not even one of my grandkids who was
41:16
very young
41:18
she is a force to be reckoned with
41:20
against the enemy
41:22
so make sure you declare that because
41:23
the season we're coming into
41:25
there's so many children uh being born
41:28
now and have been being born
41:29
for i don't know maybe a couple
41:31
generations that will be very
41:32
significant
41:34
in these great moves of God so yes make
41:36
sure you're covering them with your
41:37
prayers
41:38
they still have to grow up in a normal
41:41
way
41:41
but you can definitely just declare that
41:44
supernatural part of their life
41:46
and she and you would decree that thing
41:48
both um
41:49
before she is born and as after she's
41:52
born it'd be kind of the same decree
41:54
yeah some kind of things you just keep
41:56
decreeing it yeah
41:58
so and they they will be growing as
42:00
they're growing God will open
42:02
up new things to them that concern their
42:03
destiny because you talked about their
42:06
destiny
42:07
which is what the enemy would like to
42:08
steal away if you keep declaring you
42:10
will not miss
42:11
one day of your destiny you will fulfill
42:13
everything God has given you to do on
42:15
the earth
42:16
that includes as they're growing
42:19
that's good that's really good okay um
42:22
this i like this question i didn't know
42:24
what what i didn't know what the answer
42:25
would be what is the difference
42:27
between the way jesus looked before he
42:29
came to the earth
42:30
and after he went to heaven did he have
42:33
flesh and blood before
42:34
and does he now he does still have flesh
42:38
and blood on him well
42:40
he has flesh i don't know that he needs
42:42
blood
42:43
in his glorified bone his life was in
42:47
the blood right
42:49
he does look somewhat different he does
42:51
look somewhat different
42:53
than when he was all spirit okay and i
42:55
will prove it
42:57
satan didn't recognize him when he was
43:00
in his
43:01
flesh body on the earth he wasn't sure
43:03
who he was but
43:05
did he not live in heaven with him
43:07
before he was cast
43:08
out right so this is a clue right there
43:11
that he had to
43:12
change the very way his exact images
43:15
look
43:16
when they say he's the exact
43:17
representation of the father
43:19
that's talking about his power his glory
43:23
his love for people um but he had to
43:26
have flesh put on him that didn't just
43:28
do like a little wink
43:30
they actually had a big discussion in
43:32
heaven before
43:33
about a year before christ was born left
43:36
to have to do a whole
43:37
different thing on that but he knew what
43:40
was going to be required of him as the
43:42
word
43:42
who was all God at that time and would
43:45
work with the father would say i want
43:47
this created and the word would step
43:49
out because they can go in and out of
43:51
each other and then the word would make
43:52
it this is before he came to the earth
43:54
he had to be willing to die for all of
43:56
us to make a way
43:58
back to the father and so he was a
44:01
little bit different looking
44:03
satan never knew who he was until he
44:05
actually said that he suspected it
44:07
remember on the mount of temptation
44:10
when he was trying to get him to come to
44:12
his side to the darkness and offer him
44:13
all this junk and stuff which he's still
44:15
doing satan still does that today
44:17
to people but but christ resisted all of
44:20
that
44:21
but he did look different or he would
44:23
have known immediately
44:25
that's that's that's the son of God i
44:27
better not mess with him
44:28
had he known who he was actually
44:32
he probably would have been too
44:33
terrified to do anything to him but
44:36
because it was
44:36
in a very short amount of time from that
44:39
time until he actually was crucified
44:41
he didn't know who he was he didn't know
44:44
that was the word who
44:45
came to earth and became christ his
44:47
flesh is still on him
44:49
i can tell you he's a little over six
44:51
foot tall
44:53
in his natural body which of course that
44:55
natural body is glorified
44:56
he can be a hundred feet tall 2 000 feet
44:59
tall
44:59
it doesn't matter he can look like a
45:01
lion a lamb an eagle right
45:05
but he is himself when he was on the
45:07
earth had mussels because he lifted big
45:09
trees he was a carpenter
45:11
he did a lot of physical labor uh even
45:14
what happened to him on the cross he
45:16
probably would have gone long before
45:17
that had he not had
45:18
strength in his body so he's strong
45:20
looking
45:21
you can see the scars when his hair kind
45:23
of blows and you can see the stars where
45:25
the crown of thorns was
45:27
he'll show you the holes are here
45:30
they're not
45:31
right here this would have ripped right
45:32
through the nail
45:34
so this this is where the holes are on
45:36
his wrist
45:38
and also in the middle towards the top
45:40
of his feet
45:41
is where the the nail holes you can put
45:43
your finger right through it
45:44
in heaven so uh but he is very strong
45:48
looking
45:49
uh i would say uh like looks like a
45:52
man's man to me
45:53
real really but he's just so filled with
45:57
love and he
45:58
also is still fierce against remember he
46:01
went into hell and whipped up the devil
46:02
and all the rest him in there
46:04
that was in his spiritual body but his
46:06
physical body
46:07
he still has the flesh he knew when he
46:09
said yes
46:10
father i'll do this he would forever in
46:12
all time
46:14
had that flesh as a testimony
46:17
not for the terror or the bad things as
46:19
a testimony of his willingness
46:21
and his love for us that he was willing
46:23
to give himself for us
46:25
that's good good really really really
46:27
good okay this
46:28
woman um and people send me multiple
46:31
questions i have to kind of pick the one
46:32
that
46:33
because we're a couple hundred behind
46:35
pick the one that best seems the most
46:36
important
46:37
and it will help the most people but
46:38
she's asking she said i was abused
46:41
by a close relative as a child and
46:43
starting then she began
46:45
to on purpose or it just came over she
46:48
started
46:48
using profanity and she says i've tried
46:51
for 30 years now to break that off
46:54
and she says i try i prayed every prayer
46:56
that i know how to pray
46:57
and i can't stop when i get upset i
46:59
start using profanity
47:01
he says please would you help me know
47:03
what to do to get
47:04
rid of profanity that's what he doesn't
47:07
want
47:08
i'm sure i'm going to talk real quick
47:10
first it's not
47:12
really that hard it's something you have
47:14
to purpose in your heart and i'm sure
47:15
you have purpose that in your heart
47:17
but it is in here
47:20
it wouldn't be coming out of you if it
47:22
wasn't in you
47:24
and i'm not saying that was necessarily
47:26
your fault from all the stuff that
47:28
happened
47:29
when those things happen to you
47:31
especially young the enemy
47:33
makes little deposits in you you need to
47:36
lose it
47:37
on purpose from your soul and i'm really
47:38
serious so we're just gonna
47:40
say this together with her right you
47:43
have to choose with your will
47:44
it's about your will you have to choose
47:46
who you will to lose
47:48
not just the profane words you've spoken
47:51
but you
47:52
have to lose the deposit of profanity
47:55
that was put
47:56
in you that causes that to happen if you
47:58
will lose that
48:00
in jesus name jesus will come down and
48:03
take it
48:03
out of you now if you have an urge to
48:06
say that
48:07
you after that after you've done that
48:09
this is what you do i choose my will to
48:11
bind the love
48:12
and the life and the words of God to my
48:15
soul
48:16
guess what's deposited then he'll come
48:18
up with deposits of his own words in you
48:21
and then when you speak the other thing
48:23
you need to take authority over is
48:24
any anger since it seems anger causes
48:27
that to happen
48:28
and i also tell people don't watch
48:30
movies that have a lot of profanity in
48:32
them guess what's going to come out of
48:33
you
48:34
those are deposits so don't watch movies
48:36
they have a lot of profanity okay
48:38
because then you're putting new deposits
48:39
of that in you
48:40
and eventually when people get really
48:42
angry sometimes it comes
48:44
out so make sure you lose all the anger
48:48
and lose the trauma please say i choose
48:51
my will to lose all the trauma from the
48:53
past
48:53
all the abuse from the past i am not
48:56
having it anymore
48:58
i won't have that mess up my life i lose
49:00
it in jesus name
49:02
so it's not just one thing you have to
49:04
lose all the stuff that happened to you
49:06
and have no ownership to it anymore and
49:10
then lose the profane words
49:12
loose the deposits that were made by the
49:14
happening you
49:15
lose any anger you have from your soul
49:18
and then you bind the love and the life
49:21
the words of God
49:22
his plans to you in your soul and then
49:26
guess what
49:26
what is in you will come out and you
49:29
will notice
49:30
a an amazing almost shocking change
49:34
in the way you think and the way you
49:36
speak
49:37
wow that's good and i guess you would
49:39
say that if you
49:40
if you faltered and stumbled back into
49:43
it or even accidentally got back in the
49:45
habit you just
49:46
rinse and repeat right you just keep
49:47
doing i would say
49:49
if it happens again say i repent for
49:51
saying those words i'm not doing that
49:52
anymore
49:54
i lose them from my soul again in jesus
49:56
name and because the enemy will try to
49:59
drag you back into things like that and
50:01
you say i'm not doing that
50:03
and i'm not going there and you have the
50:05
right to say i'm not
50:06
tolerating being controlled by the enemy
50:10
that's good i do need to say one more
50:12
thing if it repeats several times you
50:14
have to say this
50:15
i serve the most high God of heaven and
50:17
earth
50:18
i will not serve you devil i'm done
50:21
you're not controlling my life in jesus
50:23
name and
50:24
that one statement is one of the most
50:26
powerful statements anyone on the planet
50:29
can make
50:30
if you can if you're continually
50:31
tormented by things or stuff like that
50:34
you need to say that because when you
50:36
make a statement to him
50:38
saying i'm not serving you i serve the
50:40
most high God
50:41
he will actually know that you're
50:43
serious about that i know that sounds
50:44
crazy but what you say matters i have
50:48
just a few more minutes
50:50
okay okay let me just get um let's see
50:53
um this is i'm gonna ask two quick ones
50:56
okay
50:57
because you gotta i know you have to go
50:58
did God create you know two-thirds of
51:00
the
51:00
angels didn't fall one-third fell does
51:03
God create new angels or were they all
51:05
created
51:05
from the beginning and that's it i i
51:08
can't say that he can't create new
51:10
new ones he is God i do know that there
51:13
were
51:13
billions of angels everybody tries to
51:17
figure out in their head
51:18
how many they think that is but he did
51:21
make billions of angels they're made in
51:23
different
51:23
angels are made in tribes and i know i
51:26
have seen
51:28
so many having been to heaven but not
51:30
just having all the ones sent to the
51:32
earth right now we probably have
51:33
close to 200 billion angels on the earth
51:37
right now because you'll tell me i'm
51:39
sending this money for this
51:40
right now with all the stuff going on
51:42
around us now we have
51:44
more warring angels than we ever have
51:47
had before
51:48
so i can't say he can't make more uh
51:50
that would be entirely up to him
51:53
i just know that when they're made
51:55
they're going to be tested in some way
51:57
we were tested in our own lives and
52:00
those angels were tested at that time
52:02
and then there were others tested
52:03
another time when they were on the earth
52:05
the watcher angels were sent down here
52:07
on the earth to educate mankind
52:09
some of those fell but some did not fall
52:12
so i can say that's entirely up to him i
52:14
i don't know the answer to that question
52:16
if you make or not
52:19
last one that i'll let you get going
52:21
here Kat says Kat have you seen
52:23
or visited your own family members and
52:25
having to have passed away
52:28
i don't get to visit any family members
52:30
i've seen them
52:32
but i'm not taken up there for me
52:35
i'm not taking up to heaven i don't even
52:37
ask i still don't ask to go to heaven
52:39
i have a commission to be taken to
52:41
heaven by father son of holy spirit
52:44
showing specific places in heaven shown
52:47
how heaven operates that means what life
52:49
is like there
52:50
um and then i'm brought back and then
52:53
i'm told to share them
52:55
so if he doesn't show me i don't i don't
52:58
know i haven't seen everything that's
52:59
for sure and all the years i've been
53:00
there
53:01
there's so much to see so so i haven't
53:04
seen it all
53:05
but um i forgot what the question was
53:08
well
53:08
if you if you if you've been around your
53:11
family members
53:12
right i've seen my dad he doesn't talk
53:16
to me in heaven he doesn't come over and
53:17
say hi and give me a hug
53:19
i've seen them in heaven i've seen quite
53:21
a few of my family members in heaven
53:22
i've seen a lot of celebrities
53:24
people from the past people from the way
53:27
past
53:28
uh like even some of the people who
53:29
helped heart start this country
53:32
i've seen like abraham and moses
53:35
and noah in the day they were on the
53:38
earth so i've seen
53:39
a lot but for me i've never seen my
53:42
mansion i've never been shown my mansion
53:44
it's not about what he can give me for
53:46
me what he gives me
53:49
is for everybody so i've seen my dad on
53:51
his ranch with all of our pets
53:53
don't tell me they don't go there it's
53:54
too late i've seen a whole long line of
53:56
them talking to him as he walks across
53:58
his ranch
53:59
and uh and so my dad looks good he looks
54:02
like he's in his 20s he always wanted a
54:04
big ranch he has a
54:05
massive branch in heaven he loves to be
54:08
with people so i've seen him i've seen
54:10
my grandmother
54:11
my mom's mom i actually got to see from
54:14
here
54:15
all the way to arizona when she passed i
54:17
knew when she was passing i could tell
54:18
my mom
54:19
she was in the room with her the glory
54:21
was so great
54:22
so there's all kinds of things that
54:24
happen i've seen her in heaven with my
54:26
grandfather who is a florist
54:28
he always loved flowers even in the
54:30
desert he grew up
54:31
grew them but they never talked to me
54:33
and they don't see me so i've seen some
54:36
but i think that's for me to bless like
54:38
my mom
54:39
and uh other my siblings about seeing um
54:42
our dad up there so i don't think it's
54:45

00:19
hi it's steve schultz here with another
00:21
episode of elijah streams i'm here with
00:22
Kat
00:23
Kat we've done one part we did earlier

00:26

00:28
those watching the first part will air
00:31
uh well it's a friday this coming friday
00:33
and the next one when you see this it'll
00:35
be the next friday so watch for the
00:36
friday episodes of this
00:37
we've been talking about heaven you've
00:39
been to heaven thousands of times
00:41
and this subject i want to start with is
00:44
one of our favorite epis
00:45
our favorite questions issues whatever
00:48
it has to do with do pets go to heaven
00:50
now i just told you
00:52
off the air and i wasn't planning on
00:54
this but i'm just going to say because
00:55
we did talk about it yeah
00:57
my daughter my beautiful oldest daughter
00:59
this day
01:00
is having to put down wow her beautiful
01:03
black lab which we love bella
01:05
and the question is do pets go to heaven
01:09
and the answer is absolutely yes and i
01:12
need to explain that because
01:14
God gave me revelation on that he said a
01:17
lot of people will
01:18
argue with you that why would i care
01:21
why would animals go to heaven and he
01:23
said they have a spirit in them
01:25
and if it has a spirit if it's a if it's
01:28
a creature or an animal
01:29
they're going to go to heaven he said
01:31
they're innocent they didn't sin against
01:33
me
01:34
in the garden of course the snake had to
01:36
give permission we won't go into that
01:37
part
01:38
but God said they're innocent and he
01:40
said if you go back to genesis he always
01:42
takes me to the word
01:44
go back to genesis where it talks about
01:46
when i was telling a
01:47
noah to put the animals on the ark
01:50
and he said there's a scripture he's
01:51
quoting scripture this scripture that
01:53
says
01:54
that God told noah to put every animal
01:56
on the ark
01:57
that had a spirit of life in them wow
02:02
now then he said go back
02:05
into genesis where i made adam and he
02:08
said
02:09
where he and the word made adam and he
02:12
said
02:12
adam was made his body was perfect and
02:15
we all know the word made that body but
02:18
the father
02:19
carries the spirits of life in him we
02:21
all lived inside him
02:23
and he said that when adam's body was
02:25
done he leaned over and
02:27
breathed adam's spirit of life into the
02:31
body
02:32
and it said then adam became a living
02:35
soul
02:36
and so that was adam's spiritual little
02:38
spiritual being
02:39
breathed in there and he said that
02:41
proves to anyone who asked
02:43
that animals have a spirit in them
02:46
so when your pet dies your personal
02:49
guardian angel like my guardian angel
02:51
took my own dog up to heaven
02:53
that's how it happens and they'll be
02:55
waiting on you they'll remember you
02:57
and they'll be happy to see you and so
03:00
that scripture God always uses
03:02
scriptures when he talks to me so
03:03
there's a scripture
03:04
that proves that your pet has a spirit
03:07
in it and so when it dies when it passes
03:11
your angel is waiting to carry it on up
03:13
to heaven they stay at your mansion
03:15
if it's a dog they run around and greet
03:17
people Kats probably never leave your
03:19
mansion they're taking over it i can
03:21
tell you
03:22
so but yes your pets could have it
03:24
regardless i saw a little boy's goldfish
03:27
God had created a waterway through this
03:29
whole boy's mansion
03:30
of course the boy will live a full life
03:32
but when he goes home to heaven he would
03:34
always tell his mom i'll see my goldfish
03:36
now i didn't know them
03:37
and God showed me chester that was a
03:40
gofish's name
03:41
caught me up and i saw this waterway go
03:43
through the whole mansion and end up in
03:45
a big swimming pool
03:46
and uh the day i ended up by meeting him
03:49
and saying this he had just told his mom
03:51
that day
03:52
when his goldfish died his mom said no
03:54
honey they just don't go anywhere and he
03:56
kept saying i know God's taken my
03:58
goldfish to heaven
03:59
and when i get there i'll swim with him
04:01
in a swimming pool now he said that to
04:03
his mom we have all that recorded
04:05
so don't bother telling me it's not true
04:07
and so i
04:08
i saw chester in a goldfish bowl and
04:11
this waterway thing
04:12
in this huge pool in the waterfall he'll
04:14
be able to swim with
04:16
the little boy when he gets to heaven so
04:17
even a goldfish he cares about
04:20
and so your pets will be waiting we had
04:22
to put our own dog whose name was angel
04:26
uh we named her that on purpose and she
04:28
was there especially with my wife
04:29
because i was dying for a few years
04:31
yes and angel was there she was lit like
04:34
an angel to dream
04:36
she would begin to die of cancer after
04:38
something like 11 and she's a
04:40
little young to have cancer but when we
04:43
finally
04:43
took her in to to have her put to sleep
04:46
put her down
04:46
whatever term you use right after that
04:49
someone wrote this and said i saw your
04:51
dog in heaven
04:53
running around with see if i can get
04:55
this out
04:56
running around playing with children yes
04:58
who died of cancer
04:59
absolutely they would do that
05:03
you know well you had a word about the
05:06
putting down of an animal yes you're
05:08
actually
05:09
doing them a favor i know it hurts you
05:13
and i know you miss them and you know
05:14
God knows that he gave his past
05:16
i i believe adam had pets and uh
05:20
and you may think this is crazy but
05:22
angels have pets i don't know if i even
05:23
told you that they do have pets and
05:25
sometimes i see them
05:26
in the sky with them well they were the
05:28
first ones to have pets before we did so
05:30
this is just a heaven thing
05:32
but yes my mom was in the same situation
05:35
that you were she had a little yorkie
05:38
and it was just
05:38
almost skin and bones but wouldn't give
05:41
up it was hanging on
05:42
and the holy spirit said tell your
05:44
mother to let him be put to sleep he'll
05:47
be in heaven well we all knew they went
05:48
to heaven
05:49
but it was hard for my mom it had him 14
05:51
years and she said i just can't do it i
05:53
said okay jenna and i will take him
05:55
so we took him to our vet and they gave
05:58
him the little shot
05:59
i prayed over him and everything and we
06:01
stayed there until his spirit left his
06:03
body
06:04
and the holy spirit says run outside and
06:07
take your phone
06:09
and he said look over the top of the
06:10
veterinarian's clinic and i looked up
06:12
there and there was
06:14
the spirit of this little dog because
06:16
remember you look like you your
06:17
spiritual body looks like you
06:19
and here's this little dog he had real
06:21
pointed ears and i still have the
06:23
picture to this day
06:24
and he was leaving going up to heaven
06:27
and the holy spirit said he wants you to
06:29
know
06:29
he's grateful you put him to sleep so
06:31
he'd stop suffering and he went to
06:33
heaven
06:34
where we saw him playing with other pets
06:36
we had
06:38
another time that i had to put my own
06:40
dog down the same way
06:42
and uh when when i was taken to heaven
06:44
once i saw my dog playing with one of my
06:46
other
06:46
my brother's pat who died and they were
06:49
chasing these squirrels
06:50
and my dog's favorite thing to do was to
06:52
chase squirrels but these squirrels were
06:54
their friends in heaven oh wow
06:56
and so they would take turns chasing
06:57
each other up and down the stands and it
06:59
made my heart so happy to know
07:02
that my pet and my mom's pet was still
07:05
having a good time in heaven
07:06
waiting on us and do i understand that
07:10
you can communicate with your
07:12
pets in heaven absolutely well in the
07:14
garden of eden
07:15
adam actually talked to all of those
07:18
animals
07:19
when God said that he called them by
07:21
name
07:22
he didn't mean he said you're a horse
07:24
you're a dog
07:26
you know you're a you're a guy i always
07:27
thought it was no he gave them a name
07:30
and i can say this about the father the
07:32
father loves to give nicknames
07:34
and everyone knows when you go to heaven
07:36
he has a little white stone which is a
07:38
diamond
07:39
and he writes a little nickname on it
07:41
and gives it to you that only you and he
07:42
will know
07:43
he loves to give nicknames so adam gave
07:46
all of these animals in the garden
07:48
nicknames and it said he called them
07:51
by name why would they say that he
07:53
called them by name because they
07:55
answered him
07:56
and if they couldn't talk then eve would
07:58
have been freaked out by the snake
07:59
who could talk so in that day but when
08:02
they were
08:03
thrown out of the garden when they asked
08:04
to leave the garden God
08:06
took away the ability of all the animals
08:09
to talk because he didn't want them
08:10
cursing him
08:12
like man did and later on kept doing it
08:15
we also know the donkey talked
08:17
and he didn't just put a voice in him he
08:19
had the ability to talk God had just
08:20
stopped that
08:21
so in heaven all your pets will speak to
08:24
you well you know and i asked you about
08:26
this
08:26
maybe it was yesterday when we were
08:28
talking but we've had a lot of pets
08:31
over the years and one time we had four
08:32
dogs and four cats we had two
08:34
two miniature donkeys and a horse and
08:37
probably some things i'm forgetting
08:38
when we first moved out in the place
08:40
that you have a lot of pets waiting on
08:42
you up there
08:43
you know but most of them belong to my
08:45
girls but uh
08:47
and son but but my wife and i even we've
08:50
had many many pets does that mean our
08:53
mansion
08:53
is like a little zoo yeah well it is so
08:56
huge you have a lot of property with
08:58
your mansion
08:59
and if they also belong to your
09:01
daughters they'll be visiting them at
09:03
theirs too
09:04
so if you all grow up together as a
09:06
family and have a pet in common that pet
09:08
will take turns visiting you in heaven
09:10
and yes and they play and they actually
09:12
have other ones that they meet and make
09:14
friends with in heaven
09:16
when i when i was very very sick so this
09:18
had to be around
09:19
2007 or eight and i was i would lay on
09:23
the couch
09:23
day after day i was wasting weight under
09:25
100 pounds people they hadn't figured
09:27
out what was wrong with me at that time
09:28
it was a sinus thing but and many
09:31
surgeries later here i am but yes
09:33
my daughter had was had moved to
09:36
california and
09:37
and her cat was with us his name was
09:40
ebony
09:41
yes and he was dying
09:44
and i was laying on the couch dying
09:47
basically and he was
09:49
laying there on the floor dying and i
09:50
said a rug little
09:52
thing there tell them and i would speak
09:54
to him and i
09:55
said to him and i said someday
09:59
all right together in
10:03
this heaven you're right sorry i had no
10:06
idea i was going to go there but
10:07
so you actually will be talking to them
10:09
yeah i
10:10
felt it was a true thing i felt like
10:14
i would one day talk to this boy cat
10:16
ebony
10:17
and we were talking about what we went
10:18
through together that's right and
10:20
it was meaningful yes and i was you know
10:24
when he finally passed
10:25
the house i um drain had to take care of
10:27
it i was too weak to do anything but i
10:30
knew
10:31
i had done my part you know because you
10:33
know God loves you that probably also
10:35
gave him comfort and you're absolutely
10:37
right
10:37
and i'll prove in the word if he knows
10:41
when one sparrow falls to the ground and
10:44
guess what he does care he does care
10:46
he also now he doesn't love the
10:48
creatures more than he loves us
10:51
but they're also his creation and he
10:53
does care he doesn't like it when
10:54
animals are abused of course he doesn't
10:56
like it when people or children are
10:57
abused
10:58
he despises evil however he cares about
11:02
them
11:02
why wouldn't he allow them to go to
11:04
heaven if you love them especially
11:06
and they're a part of your life you know
11:09
and they have a spirit
11:10
right and he told me a long time ago he
11:13
said i had a decision to make when i
11:15
created life meaning man and creatures
11:18
i could even admit i could make them
11:20
where they would disappear and never
11:21
exist again
11:22
ever or i could make a decision that
11:25
they would remain
11:26
eternally you know and he said and i
11:28
made the decision they would remain
11:29
eternally
11:30
he said so if i did that and they would
11:32
remain eternally
11:34
and i didn't allow them to go to heaven
11:36
where would they be
11:37
he said yes they're going to be in
11:39
heaven even ones that you knew not maybe
11:42
your own pet but other people's perhaps
11:43
you'll recognize them when you get to
11:45
heaven
11:45
i've been in my father's ranch and i've
11:47
seen every pet we've had
11:50
in your family yes i've seen my father's
11:52
ranch no i don't go there and visit him
11:53
but i saw his ranch
11:55
and walking behind him was his 1100
11:58
pound this bothers some people he's a
11:59
1100 pound pig named sally
12:02
that he had from a little pig when he
12:03
retired from ministering
12:05
and i saw writing on her two of the
12:07
little mice we had in new york city
12:09
as our past and there was charlie the
12:11
alligator there was iggy
12:13
iguana i recognized each one of these
12:15
pets it wasn't like they were just
12:17
someone similar they were the same ones
12:19
we had
12:20
and they went like forever oh my God
12:23
because he had a hack
12:24
he was up there they were all gathering
12:26
on his ranch to be there together
12:28
let's talk then while we're talking
12:30
about the little ones
12:32
let's talk about the children because i
12:34
heard you
12:35
more than once say every child
12:39
who dies is with the lord is that right
12:42
that's absolutely true every single one
12:44
of them whether they were miscarried
12:46
whether they were aborted
12:48
all babies and children they all go to
12:51
heaven
12:52
and God has them all so if you
12:54
miscarried a baby
12:55
when you get to heaven one day it will
12:57
be given right back to you the very same
12:59
one
13:00
that you lost and and couldn't raise on
13:03
your own
13:04
most of them stay very little and you
13:06
actually get to finish
13:08
raising that baby in heaven and
13:11
and the same thing with children if they
13:13
were really young here's a good example
13:15
um i met someone whose son had died when
13:18
he was seven
13:20
and later on 20 years later his mother
13:23
dies and goes to heaven and here's her
13:26
little boy still seven
13:27
playing in the streets of gold and his
13:29
mom is so undone of course he recognizes
13:32
her i mean she was probably the same
13:34
age when he left hi mom what are you
13:37
doing here and she goes
13:38
i i'm i'm here but you were here and he
13:40
goes
13:41
of course i'm here and she goes what
13:43
have you been doing he goes i've been
13:44
playing with my friends all this time
13:46
and he was actually playing with his
13:48
friends and he goes but but you know
13:49
what you can't stay mom
13:51
you have to go back you're not done with
13:54
your life
13:54
and she said and so she grabbed him and
13:56
hugged him before she left and he
13:58
brought back down
13:59
came out of the surgery perfectly fine
14:02
she was healed
14:03
and for years her and her husband would
14:04
go around the world and that's what they
14:06
talked about
14:06
that your children are in God's hands
14:09
they're having a good time in heaven
14:10
and so there's many other people with
14:12
that same kind of a testimony
14:14
so your children will know you in heaven
14:16
they're talking about you in heaven they
14:18
can't wait to see you
14:20
i will say this about the ones that were
14:21
aborted every aborted baby goes to see
14:24
jesus first he heals any hurts
14:28
any memories of what exp they
14:30
experienced in that situation
14:32
they forgive the people who do it these
14:36
little babies even though there's some
14:37
are very small tiny different sizes
14:40
their spiritual body is perfectly formed
14:43
completely formed they laugh they play
14:45
they have some understanding
14:47
of who their parents are and they all
14:50
the time pray
14:51
that their parents will make it to
14:52
heaven if you so if you had
14:55
a woman let's say she had an abortion
14:57
she thought it was okay to do that
15:00
now she lives to be 70 80 years old and
15:03
she receives the lord
15:04
yes and she goes to be this is going to
15:08
be one of those shows
15:09
she goes to be with the father within
15:12
him and she gets to now raise
15:13
this child aborted absolutely yes that's
15:16
incredible that that
15:18
puts a new uh a new picture of grace the
15:21
grace and love of
15:22
God it is the grace of God and so many
15:25
people are
15:26
healed now when they find that out some
15:28
have had multiple abortions they thought
15:30
they weren't doing anything wrong
15:31
because that's normally what they're
15:33
told
15:33
you know it's not really anything but
15:35
that's not true
15:37
at the at the time of a conception
15:40
life begins when that happens God sends
15:44
one of the little spirits from himself
15:46
that would be that baby's little spirit
15:48
and and knits it together
15:50
in the mother's womb and there's that
15:51
little dot of flesh that formed
15:53
he knits that little baby's spiritual
15:55
body to that
15:57
and that's when life begins and from
15:59
that time on they continue to grow
16:01
inside the womb of the mother
16:02
and by the way if you play beautiful
16:05
christian music that baby hears it in
16:06
the womb
16:07
if you talk to the baby they hear also
16:09
they'll recognize your voice already
16:11
when it's born
16:12
but for whatever reason some are forced
16:14
to have abortions and i do know
16:16
people that happen to them but this
16:18
little baby when it gets up to heaven
16:20
the aborted babies jesus greets them
16:23
he loves on them they have a special
16:25
they laugh
16:26
and play they ride in the kangaroos
16:28
pockets around go rides
16:30
they ride on birds and they're all
16:32
declaring all the time i can't wait to
16:34
meet my parents you know
16:36
they want them very much to come to
16:38
heaven and i encourage
16:40
people even if you had an abortion name
16:42
your baby
16:43
give it a name that could be a boy or a
16:45
girl name and
16:46
when you do that now the angels give
16:48
them a nickname in these beautiful
16:50
nurseries it doesn't look like a clinic
16:52
it's very beautiful some outside some of
16:55
the parts are in the
16:56
inside building inside they will call
16:58
the baby
16:59
to the father and he'll say your parent
17:01
just named you wow
17:02
wow instead of the nickname they put in
17:04
the nursery on the little wall
17:07
uh God will say this is now your name
17:09
your parent just named you and have a
17:10
huge celebration for the babies
17:13
we learned that from you before we knew
17:15
you
17:16
it was a year before we went on a cruise
17:18
just my wife and myself
17:20
yes so it had to be eight nine years ago
17:22
something like that and
17:23
the book and and and God said bring
17:26
every book on heaven
17:27
which i had never read the books on
17:29
avenue one years and years ago so i had
17:31
a stack like this
17:32
but there were more from you but there's
17:34
90 minutes in heaven and
17:36
heaven is for real and i brought them
17:38
all but i came to that
17:39
part and i brought tears i'm not going
17:41
to do that again
17:43
if i can help but i i said listen to
17:45
this dream and i read her the part
17:46
where you can name your baby and they
17:48
would give it and that and the baby
17:50
would be in heaven
17:51
and so we we named it i can't remember
17:54
if we named it at that
17:55
moment but we both sat there and balder
17:57
yes because we realized
17:59
that was true and we understood so now
18:02
we don't have three children
18:03
yeah we have four children four children
18:05
we just didn't know that's right
18:07
and is this possibly true and i have not
18:10
asked you this before but
18:12
some women have you know inadvertent of
18:16
miscarriages that they never even know
18:18
about
18:18
are those children of theirs in heaven
18:21
as well
18:22
if that conception took place and that
18:25
baby
18:25
began to grow and maybe they lasted a
18:29
few weeks
18:29
yeah they're still a baby yeah once that
18:32
spiritual
18:33
little body is knit together to that
18:35
little dot of flesh
18:36
then that is when life begins yes i know
18:39
people had like five or six
18:42
ones that didn't go all the way through
18:43
they maybe lasted a few weeks or a few
18:45
months
18:46
every one of those was a baby yeah and
18:49
okay and one last question about that so
18:52
if you're a little baby whether you were
18:55
whether you lost your life
18:57
in india pakistan any muslim country the
19:00
middle east
19:01
china india you're still going to have
19:03
you're still going to heaven
19:04
absolutely he sent them from himself he
19:07
actually
19:08
timed your birth on the earth because he
19:10
wanted you here at that time
19:12
and no matter what your gift was whether
19:14
it was singing
19:15
or a florist or a designer a builder a
19:19
baker
19:20
that gift you keep when even the little
19:23
babies when they go up to heaven they'll
19:24
still have that desire to do those
19:26
they'll grow very
19:27
slowly once you get there and eventually
19:29
they'll come to what he calls the
19:31
timeless age
19:32
it looks like 20 25 they will step into
19:35
their own destiny in heaven and become
19:38
that whatever that gift was he gave them
19:40
so no real
19:41
no baby ever really loses their true
19:44
destiny
19:45
which is what God sent they actually
19:47
begin to operate in their destiny they
19:48
begin to operate in the world
19:50
and they pray for the parents they're
19:52
always praying for the parents the whole
19:54
time
19:55
i wanted to talk about this is this gets
19:57
asked a lot so let's talk about
19:59
there's a lot of people who have had
20:02
suicides of their family and they're
20:04
convinced
20:05
many are convinced that because of the
20:07
suicide
20:08
uh the person took their own life that
20:10
they will not be in heaven or they're
20:12
there and grieve talk about that issue
20:14
the father was very
20:16
adamant and so was christ that people
20:19
know
20:20
the truth about that and by the way they
20:22
don't like it
20:24
if somebody especially was a believer
20:26
and people are telling them that their
20:27
loved one is in hell
20:28
when if they belong to God there's no
20:31
way that's going to happen
20:32
so the father on purpose told me
20:36
about these three different people's
20:38
lives and took me to heaven and showed
20:40
me them
20:41
each in heaven the first one was
20:44
somebody who was known
20:45
i won't say who that was but it was one
20:47
of their children
20:49
and they had been in an accident and
20:52
they had taken medication that totally
20:54
altered their mind
20:56
their emotions they had no control over
20:57
their mind or anything
20:59
they finally ended their suffering and
21:01
this is how the father said
21:03
he said look in the dictionary and see
21:04
what it says about suicide and i he
21:07
actually had me look in a dictionary not
21:08
in heaven when i was on the earth
21:10
and this is what it says to commit
21:12
suicide you are willingly
21:14
knowingly intelligently ending your own
21:18
life on purpose knowing that's what will
21:21
happen he said
21:22
like a suicide bomber like a terrorist
21:25
who comes in to kill knowing they're
21:26
going to die
21:28
or you do it because you hate someone so
21:30
much you want to cause them suffering
21:31
you know what you're doing in other
21:33
words most people
21:35
who end their life that is not suicide
21:39
not according to the dictionary what
21:41
they're doing is they're having so much
21:42
trauma suffering mental suffering
21:45
emotional suffering or physical pain
21:47
that they cannot stand it
21:49
they want to end the suffering so when
21:51
they do it for that purpose
21:52
that's not suicide and God does not
21:54
count it as suicide
21:56
and this person who i saw in heaven was
21:59
a young person
22:00
and that has what had happened the
22:02
medication altered their whole thinking
22:04
they were in
22:04
suffering and agony all the time they
22:07
prayed for them all the time but he
22:08
couldn't take it anymore so he ended his
22:10
suffering
22:11
and God said i will show you and he took
22:13
me to heaven and showed me him
22:15
in his father's mansion it was being
22:18
built his father was still alive on the
22:19
earth
22:20
and he was living there in his father's
22:22
mansion and i saw
22:23
a trophy on the mantle that said the
22:26
name
22:27
of that person it said satan
22:30
zero and the name of the parent of this
22:33
child
22:34
it said one in other words God
22:37
had kept him and saved him because he
22:39
belonged him number one
22:40
but what the suffering he went through
22:42
he couldn't handle and then he did that
22:44
two other times with other people
22:46
one was a young woman who had been so
22:48
abused her whole life
22:49
she couldn't handle or take it anymore
22:52
and so she ended her suffering she
22:53
wanted to be with jesus but she
22:56
she couldn't handle it so that's not
22:58
called suicide okay
22:59
and uh so another time it happened so
23:02
all three of these people
23:03
who had ended their suffering one was a
23:06
young boy
23:06
who had also been so tortured and abused
23:09
he had just been adopted by a christian
23:10
family
23:11
they prayed but he had these nightmares
23:13
all the time of the suffering
23:14
and so he ended his suffering that young
23:17
boy is in heaven
23:18
playing football right now i had no idea
23:21
he liked football watched football
23:23
always wanted to do it he actually is in
23:25
heaven playing football
23:27
and so these things that were their
23:28
passion they still get to do that in
23:31
heaven but i got to share it with each
23:33
of the parents
23:34
and it changed their whole life because
23:35
people were saying it's too bad your
23:37
child is in hell
23:39
you know when you're a believer and it's
23:40
wrong to do that okay God doesn't like
23:43
that the world this is it the secular
23:45
world
23:45
said our heart is with you our
23:47
compassion is with you but a lot of the
23:49
christians
23:50
had to prove their point because it says
23:53
in the bible about suicide but suicide
23:56
is when you know what you're doing
23:58
and you don't care almost all suicide
24:00
bombers we know where they went
24:02
they did it on purpose to hurt knowing
24:05
intelligently willingly
24:07
taking their life for that purpose so
24:09
most things are not suicide
24:11
when i grew up 50 60s 70s
24:14
i was taught i was trained in a fairly
24:17
fundamental
24:18
fundamentalist type of thing and the God
24:21
that i was shown
24:23
nobody meant harm by it they were trying
24:25
to show me
24:27
who they believed God to be was that God
24:30
who had a
24:31
set of rules and he was they would never
24:34
reward it this way but the upshot of it
24:36
was
24:37
he was just waiting for them to mess up
24:39
so that he didn't have to take him to
24:40
heaven that was the way
24:41
they would never say that they would
24:44
just say you know if you let me keep my
24:45
commandments but what they meant was
24:48
even if you did one last thing and
24:49
didn't repent and now i've come to the
24:52
point where i'm
24:52
the God that i'm seeing is still the God
24:54
of the bible yes but he's
24:56
if he's looking for loopholes he's
24:58
looking for loopholes to save
25:00
to save you not to not to cause you
25:02
that's right but that does
25:03
i do i've been asked this question
25:06
several times i don't think i've ever
25:07
asked it of you
25:08
i keep being asked this by people that
25:09
right they say ask Kat what does it mean
25:12
as wide as the way that leads to
25:14
destruction and narrows the way that
25:16
leads to life and few there be that find
25:18
it how do you
25:18
how do you respond to that back in the
25:20
days and you have to understand
25:22
a lot of the scriptures that are in the
25:24
word other than the salvation one and a
25:27
couple
25:27
others most of them are tied to the
25:30
culture
25:31
of that day okay like in leviticus
25:34
leviticus a lot of the things that are
25:36
in there were tied to the culture of the
25:38
day
25:39
when people were cutting parts of their
25:40
body off and putting on altars
25:42
to have been burned before demonic idols
25:46
they actually did that
25:47
they also marked themselves with the
25:49
marks of the dead
25:51
because they were so controlled by satan
25:53
and in leviticus
25:55
this is another thing but it's going to
25:56
join together that scripture actually
25:59
says
25:59
do not mark yourselves with the marks of
26:02
the dead
26:03
it doesn't say don't mark yourself so
26:05
don't say don't get a tattoo no it does
26:07
not say
26:08
although although the new translations
26:10
say
26:11
don't get a tattoo that is not what the
26:13
original scripture said
26:15
because that scripture was tied to the
26:17
day
26:18
in leviticus leviticus the culture of
26:21
that day
26:22
so many people were doing it that's why
26:24
they put in there
26:26
don't cut yourself don't let yourself be
26:29
passed through the fire
26:31
people think you can't be cremated
26:32
either but yes you can God can put the
26:34
ashes back together
26:35
but in that day that's what they were
26:37
doing and they were putting demonic
26:39
marks on them
26:40
and so they felt like they had to make
26:42
that part of the law
26:43
so you didn't do those things that were
26:45
evil this is
26:46
not that day i'm not giving everybody an
26:49
excuse to get a tattoo
26:50
but i happen to know people personally
26:52
that God said you will put my mark on
26:54
you
26:54
and so you can't use that to beat people
26:57
up okay you can't use that
26:58
you can't use a thing like you're
27:00
getting a lot of people won't get
27:01
cremated they think that God can't put
27:03
the ashes back together
27:04
and i say what about if you were burned
27:06
up in the fire does that mean you're not
27:07
going to get your body back
27:09
so again those scriptures will tie to
27:11
that this
27:12
about finding christ when there was not
27:15
hardly anyone
27:15
out there speaking on his behalf now we
27:18
have the internet
27:19
now we have churches everywhere so that
27:22
scripture
27:23
where it says the the white is the way
27:25
to hell
27:26
and narrow is the path to God and you
27:29
know blessings
27:32
there's a lot wider path now i see
27:35
that it means you can be led to christ
27:37
and this day especially
27:40
with all the stuff that like i just
27:42
explained is out there back in that day
27:44
when that scripture was made there was
27:46
almost
27:46
nobody out there and so these are
27:49
different days
27:50
so sometimes you have to adapt what that
27:52
says to now
27:54
so in the scripture in right now in the
27:56
scriptures it would say
27:58
the path has gotten much wider to find
28:01
christ which is a blessing for all those
28:03
who live today
28:04
compared to those who in the past did
28:06
not so i would have to say
28:08
i've seen hell i've seen who was in
28:11
there and when i was in heaven there
28:12
were more people in heaven than there
28:14
were in hell
28:14
really yes and that will actually
28:17
increase because of the revivals the
28:19
moves of God
28:20
because of the great harvest coming uh
28:22
because of the presence of God himself
28:24
and also the people with all doing all
28:27
the things stepping into what God has
28:28
for them
28:29
it will be really more clear now that
28:32
there
28:33
is a God and he loves him than there
28:35
ever was in the past day
28:37
in the past you told me a couple of
28:39
names i think i remember them but i'm
28:40
not going to say
28:41
in case in case i have them remember but
28:44
can you
28:45
name a couple of people who would be
28:46
considered almost celebrities
28:48
who people would wonder if they went to
28:50
heaven that you've seen in heaven
28:51
i have seen so many people in heaven
28:54
i've seen people from the past well i've
28:56
seen the disciples and the prophets just
28:58
so you know adam and eve made it i
28:59
absolutely
29:00
saw adam and eve i saw um uh
29:03
enoch which is got like emerald eyes you
29:06
hear him everybody has a frequency in
29:08
heaven
29:08
you hear him coming before he shows up
29:11
so
29:12
heaven is amazing but i can tell you
29:14
that i've seen
29:15
john wayne i saw john wayne in heaven
29:18
and then later on i heard the testimony
29:20
from his
29:20
own daughter she was present when he got
29:23
born again he was in a hospital bed
29:24
dying
29:26
really and i think it was the crystal
29:28
cathedral which a lot of people even
29:29
bash them they don't like the way they
29:31
gave their services don't bash people
29:33
who released jesus christ and lead you
29:35
into sinner's prayer
29:37
he came on and he watched him his
29:39
daughter said regularly
29:40
but in that day he said if you want to
29:43
receive jesus christ as your savior get
29:45
down on your knees
29:46
and john wayne could hardly move at that
29:48
time she said he dragged himself across
29:51
the bed
29:52
he lowered himself to his knees and he
29:54
received jesus christ she was a witness
29:57
and she gave that testimony later in her
29:59
church and
30:01
i didn't even see that testimony i just
30:03
saw john wayne
30:05
he was in heaven i've seen michael
30:07
jackson
30:08
and i'm probably going to get bash for
30:09
that it doesn't hurt me or bother me
30:11
because i saw him and he was worshiping
30:12
jesus christ
30:13
and whether you know it or not anyone
30:15
out there i can tell you
30:17
he was pursuing christ in those last
30:19
days he was going to do his final tour
30:21
now i didn't follow him or anything like
30:24
that this is just things that jesus
30:25
showed me
30:26
he was he was following he was preparing
30:28
for his final tour
30:30
and he was his mind was always stressed
30:33
he was always in fear about things
30:35
and people will try to calm him down and
30:37
at the
30:38
end maybe a week or so before he passed
30:40
he started telling people
30:42
i heard jesus i heard the God
30:46
of heaven and earth i heard him calling
30:48
me
30:49
wow and some of his friends thought he
30:51
was nuts
30:52
so they did an investigation after he
30:55
died after he passed
30:56
they did an investigation they called in
30:58
eight different people
30:59
or eight or nine people who were going
31:01
to be on the tour separately
31:04
and they asked him did michael say
31:06
anything
31:07
different than he had before was
31:09
anything
31:10
going on was he getting threats from
31:12
anybody
31:13
and every one of them without the others
31:15
even knowing said the same thing
31:18
he said he heard God speaking to him
31:21
and he heard God calling him and he had
31:23
to answer him
31:25
and so they never told anyone else
31:26
because they thought he was nuts
31:28
and so it turns out all these witnesses
31:31
who said they heard
31:33
michael said that he heard God calling
31:35
him and he heard christ calling him
31:37
he answered him wow so whether anybody
31:40
was present when he did that that
31:42
doesn't matter
31:43
he testified to all of them and he
31:46
probably would have made some changes on
31:47
the tour
31:48
and i think probably i don't i can't say
31:51
this uh
31:52
um officially but i'm sure that his life
31:55
was
31:55
ended not by him because that would have
31:59
drastically
32:00
changed the whole thing about his tour
32:03
and even his
32:04
life michael would have told people had
32:06
to remain
32:07
don't listen to some of the stuff i
32:09
produced before
32:10
don't listen to that stuff when i wasn't
32:12
living for christ
32:13
because i know in heaven they all say
32:15
that i would have changed stuff
32:17
i would have not done certain things all
32:19
i know is this
32:20
the point is this he's in heaven he
32:22
received jesus christ
32:24
have you did you mention robin williams
32:26
before yes robin williams i saw robin
32:28
williams in heaven also
32:30
and i know a lot of people think that he
32:32
did certain things robin williams
32:34
this is the thing about comedians if
32:36
nobody knows this
32:37
they get hit so hard by satan satan
32:40
hates
32:41
laughter he doesn't want anyone to laugh
32:44
he doesn't like
32:45
comedians at all because they let people
32:47
laugh laughter is in medicine
32:49
and so and i know several other
32:50
comedians actually suffer from great
32:52
oppression
32:53
and he did he go into rehab all the time
32:56
robin williams did to get help for this
32:59
oppression
33:00
the last place he went to was a
33:02
christian
33:03
retreat he gave his own testimony
33:07
in an interview that's been recorded and
33:10
he
33:11
started telling people we all need God i
33:14
got more help at this place than i ever
33:16
have before
33:17
you need to let jesus in your life he
33:19
can change everything for you
33:21
and and he didn't of course get rid of
33:23
all the oppression but his testimony
33:25
that is proof right there that he knew
33:27
jesus christ and i did see him in heaven
33:29
and i saw all kinds of people
33:31
i've talked about whitney houston before
33:33
i saw whitney houston in heaven and i
33:35
was sitting on the front row of a church
33:37
waiting to speak
33:38
and i kind of wasn't even really aware
33:40
she had died
33:41
and so i was caught up to heaven sitting
33:44
on the front row
33:45
my body was there and i saw her standing
33:47
before the throne of God
33:49
and she was beautiful she was young
33:52
she was so overwhelmed with the joy and
33:55
the father was thinking here for guess
33:57
what using her gift
33:59
because your most important thing you
34:01
can do is use the gift he put in you
34:04
her gift was singing and i know she
34:06
maybe didn't believe
34:07
at that time in the religion that
34:09
necessarily
34:10
said all this about jesus christ but i
34:13
do know this much about her this is what
34:15
jesus said
34:16
she's saying her own salvation he said
34:19
on the last night of her life
34:21
like i wasn't connected to her life on
34:23
the last night of her life she was with
34:25
friends out somewhere and they kept
34:27
asking her
34:28
sing a song sing a song and she was
34:30
really greatly repo
34:32
you know depressed she wasn't feeling
34:34
well they kept asking so finally she
34:36
said i will sing
34:37
one song and she gets up there at the
34:39
mic and she sings
34:41
yes jesus loves me and jesus said
34:44
in that song she gave herself and her
34:47
heart's cry gave herself back to me
34:49
so i took her to heaven and the father
34:52
was giving her a reward
34:54
for singing and he had this beautiful
34:56
chest that he took from his throne and
34:58
said whitney this is yours
35:00
because you were willing to use your
35:01
voice to sing i'm giving you one of my
35:04
own songs
35:05
that you can wear and when you opened
35:08
this chest
35:08
this beautiful garment like fabric came
35:12
out and wound itself around her became
35:14
this beautiful
35:15
red dress it was so gorgeous and as she
35:19
wore it and she moved you could sing the
35:21
father
35:22
singing off of her dress is that what
35:24
you call a God of breath
35:26
oh man he gave her a garment of praise
35:29
and it was his own song that had never
35:31
been sung
35:32
and he saves them for rewards for people
35:34
who use that voice
35:36
she was so undone so filled with the
35:39
life of God
35:40
standing up there and then when i saw
35:42
her every time she moved her hand or
35:44
moved
35:44
you'd hear him singing off of that gown
35:47
and then after that i was caught back
35:49
down and i was sitting on the front row
35:51
so this happened just like that yeah and
35:53
i got up and talked about it at the
35:55
meeting
35:56
i just i think there's your stories
35:58
you're telling and you've said people
36:00
have gotten saved hearing these stories
36:02
i i just think one of the things the
36:04
stories communicate
36:07
you know it's in the word but until you
36:09
hear it in modern
36:10
speech sometimes you don't grasp the the
36:13
level
36:14
of the love of christ and the love of
36:16
the father and the love of the spirit
36:18
for his creation the love he has is so
36:22
un he desires that none should perish
36:25
and he desires
36:26
even the vilest sinner be set free
36:30
so i know people think it's not fair but
36:33
that's the blood of christ
36:35
and what he's showing in that is no
36:36
matter what your life was like and let
36:38
me tell you a lot of these people who
36:39
are vile and hateful it doesn't give an
36:41
excuse they are probably abused
36:43
themselves
36:44
and when you're abused usually as a
36:46
child that shows up later because it
36:47
goes in your soul
36:49
and that's what we everybody knows what
36:51
you put in there is what you will become
36:53
and many people even though it's not an
36:55
excuse that's probably why they were
36:56
like that but if they receive
36:58
christ they're going to sins forgiven
37:01
like they never
37:02
did it each one of us you know he
37:05
doesn't have to do that
37:07
but because of his love for us and his
37:10
son
37:10
sacrificed for us that is the way it
37:13
works in heaven and there'll be people
37:15
there you never expected to be there
37:17
i've also been to hell i've seen people
37:19
who went to hell
37:20
someone who totally absolutely despised
37:22
and hated God
37:23
would never come back to him i did see
37:26
hitler and i tell people all the time i
37:28
saw hitler the first time i was taken
37:29
there
37:30
and he was hanging on a meat hook in
37:32
hell and i want to say this
37:34
you can be as wicked and evil as you
37:35
want to thinking satan will reward you
37:38
he rewards no one he hates everyone
37:42
and those who serve satan the most will
37:44
be the most
37:45
tortured in hell when they get there
37:48
there's
37:48
no reward in hell it's so worth it to
37:51
give yourself to jesus christ
37:53
yeah i've heard you say before that
37:56
some people that were led to the lord by
37:59
someone else
38:00
that in heaven from heaven or when that
38:03
person
38:04
who led them to the lord or influenced
38:06
them to the lord
38:07
goes to heaven that they're there they
38:09
remember with gratitude
38:11
yes how they got there is that yes they
38:13
did people who were won by certain
38:15
people
38:16
on the earth whether it was at a crusade
38:18
or just one on one on the street
38:20
if they won if they're the ones who won
38:22
your jesus you never forget that person
38:24
and they will so grab you and hug you
38:26
when you get to heaven
38:27
thank you for believing in me thank you
38:29
for taking the time
38:31
to win me to jesus christ i wouldn't be
38:33
here if you hadn't done that
38:35
and they thank you adamantly also this
38:37
the same thing goes like as
38:38
we said before that maybe you had and
38:41
maybe you were angry at somebody maybe
38:43
you had a fight this is a good one
38:44
happens a lot
38:45
people ask me this if they had a really
38:47
bad fight and they
38:48
separated and were angry and these were
38:50
friends and then the person died
38:53
this person can spend 20 years suffering
38:56
from
38:56
guilt that person in heaven is not
39:00
thinking about that happening they're up
39:02
there
39:03
wanting to bless you wanting to let you
39:04
know they'll love their feeling they
39:06
have forgiven everything
39:07
even if you never get to hear them say
39:09
that they're forgiving you
39:10
don't live your life being messed up
39:13
because you were angry
39:14
with them i'm telling you the minute
39:16
they stepped out of that body filled
39:17
with the life and the love of God
39:19
they forgave that so people always ask
39:23
me
39:23
will they know if i say i'm sorry if
39:25
they fought i said you can say it to
39:27
them and they'll hear it
39:28
but the first thing they'll do when you
39:30
get to heaven and say i didn't even
39:32
think about it you know
39:32
that's interesting that you say because
39:34
you said you say it and they'll hear it
39:36
because we're not taught that
39:38
but to declare and decree a thing
39:41
you know God can get the message to him
39:43
or whatever
39:44
um oh there was there are places in
39:46
heaven though where people can go and
39:48
watch your life
39:49
and declare over your family members
39:51
they're called portals
39:52
i've been there several times it's just
39:54
beautiful open big place inside of this
39:57
building
39:58
and there's stairways going up and a
40:00
balcony around and your family member
40:01
looks down if they're living in heaven
40:03
they look down they see you as close as
40:04
the ceiling
40:06
and every year on your birthday they go
40:08
there and sing happy birthday
40:10
you're saying to them they're right
40:12
there they're right here yeah
40:13
looking at you because there's no time
40:15
or space now heaven is way
40:17
up away from here but when they look
40:20
down and they want to declare over you
40:22
sometimes they'll pray over you they'll
40:23
declare if it's a family member who's
40:25
not born again they will always declare
40:27
i declare my family member will become
40:29
born again they will not miss their
40:31
destiny
40:32
they'll become the living testimony of
40:34
the saving power of jesus christ
40:36
so if your grandmother's up there and
40:37
you're not born again you might as well
40:39
give it up
40:40
if your mom's out there praying
40:41
declaring with him you better really
40:43
give it up
40:44
because jesus is going to get you that
40:46
is so good
40:48
you know jesus there's i don't have this
40:50
you know perfectly memorized but
40:52
jesus was talking to the people and he
40:54
said you've reaped
40:56
where other people have sown that's
40:58
right and he said
40:59
what what you did not sow they sowed and
41:02
he's talking about other people that
41:03
shared the lord
41:05
and he called that the heart he said
41:07
they did the hard
41:08
labor they did our perspective who don't
41:11
consider themselves
41:13
evangelists in any way may have had more
41:16
to do
41:16
with a person be receiving christ and
41:18
the person that's waiting
41:20
to thank them yes is in heaven they're
41:23
not necessarily willing to
41:24
thank the guy that got the notch in his
41:26
belt maybe they will they will
41:28
thank everybody but they remember the
41:30
ones who planted the seas maybe every
41:33
year for years
41:34
you did you did acts of kindness you
41:37
encouraged them that christ cares about
41:39
them
41:39
you know he wants you and maybe you
41:42
never saw the fruit of that
41:44
but the seeds are the most important
41:46
thing the seeds that are planted
41:48
and the other one who actually may be
41:50
led in the prayer they were drawn by the
41:52
holy spirit
41:53
so holy spirit gets involved when you're
41:55
willing to plant things into people holy
41:56
spirit will begin to draw them and draw
41:58
them and draw them
41:59
till they get to that point where
42:00
they're willing or want to receive
42:02
christ
42:03
and so this is the easy part you're
42:05
right
42:06
all this planting over these years
42:08
sometimes it takes
42:09
it is the hard work because you're
42:10
seeing the opposite i don't want him
42:13
don't tell me about that and they show
42:16
no
42:17
evidence but it goes in their soul and
42:20
remains in that soul and the holy spirit
42:21
can draw them from that
42:23
until finally they receive christ though
42:26
that thank you they give
42:27
that person who did all of this will
42:29
probably get more than the one who
42:30
actually led them
42:31
but they remember them and having so
42:33
good
42:34
well we only have a few minutes more and
42:36
i wanted to give you a minute or two to
42:38
talk about
42:41
what were the environments yeah the
42:42
current situation in the government
42:45
and eating cake or whatever you want to
42:47
see yes
42:48
talk about that for a minute i will
42:50
adamantly
42:51
um the father is still saying the same
42:54
thing to me
42:55
that he said all along even back in 2015
42:59
when he said i have chosen trump and
43:01
i've chosen him for two
43:03
terms he will be president for two terms
43:06
he didn't mean one term then four years
43:08
go by then another term he meant
43:10
two continual terms i will put him there
43:13
he will make a great difference in
43:14
america and everyone who knows
43:16
him knows the four years and what a
43:19
difference it made in our country to
43:20
bring us back to God
43:22
because he actually invited God and i
43:24
will also add all this
43:26
into that those who won
43:29
one those who lost lost
43:33
so those who were there now lost and
43:36
stole it
43:37
so our true president right now
43:40
is still trump according to God he won
43:43
80 million people
43:44
voted him in they voted for life for
43:47
hope for justice for liberty and freedom
43:52
and that's what we're going to get what
43:54
is there now
43:56
will not remain and the father on
43:58
november the 4th remember on your show
44:01
when God said we were going to do it
44:03
through the third and God said i want
44:04
the fourth
44:05
he actually said that so i ask you and
44:07
on the fourth
44:08
the father said when the ground begins
44:11
to shake
44:12
the physical ground the spiritual ground
44:14
the landslide of fraud will begin to be
44:17
exposed
44:19
it won't just happen it will begin to be
44:21
exposed
44:22
and he said the fall will be great from
44:24
the smallest to the
44:26
highest level will be great justice will
44:29
be served
44:30
and then i will put trump back in the
44:33
white house because even
44:34
that first thing in the morning when a
44:36
lot of the stuff was going on
44:37
he was already saying it God was saying
44:40
it on the fourth
44:41
after the third when they shut down
44:42
everything he knew what they were doing
44:45
everyone knows now what they were doing
44:47
and so it's not been hidden
44:49
God is adamant a lot of people began to
44:51
say that because when it didn't happen
44:53
on their dates
44:55
God doesn't always choose man's dates
44:57
but it didn't happen on the third
44:59
when it didn't happen when the when the
45:01
when the vote was taken
45:02
later on you know when they voted in
45:04
georgia and then when the whole thing
45:06
where the electoral thing was done and
45:08
it didn't happen then
45:09
then here comes the knowledge it didn't
45:10
happen they were like nope not going to
45:12
happen not going to happen i have news
45:14
for you
45:16
God never changed what he said the fraud
45:18
will be exposed

03:35
time
03:36

uh 17 years out of the i think we've
03:48
been in town about 21 or something like
03:51
that i don't know
03:52
but dennis and his wife especially ran
03:55
things i literally was dying in about
03:58
9 10 11 you know 29 209
04:02
2011 2012 right in there i just was
04:05
literally dying wasting away they
04:07
couldn't figure out what's wrong
04:08
dennis and his wife rand and michael and
04:11
julie
04:12
ran ran the operation julie has um julie
04:14
to your left
04:15
bottom is both the the primary editor
04:18
for the elijah list and she's the
04:20
producer for this program
04:21
so let me just tell you this warren is
04:24
in
04:25
bend oregon that's about three to four
04:26
hours drive
04:28
michael's in albany oregon uh
04:32
jeff is in salem right yeah he's in
04:34
salem
04:35
and uh dennis is in albany and i'm
04:39
someplace close to salem which i don't
05:05
that's everybody uh that's everybody
05:07
that's on the show
05:08
as we're doing the show these are all on
05:11
the show and then when
05:12
when the show is going they're
05:14
troubleshooting
05:15
as you know youtube and facebook and
05:18
people can be putting some pretty nasty
05:19
remarks
05:20
this is the team that's that's
05:22
monitoring it and cutting people off as
05:24
fast as they can if they say something
05:25
that's
05:26
that's mean-spirited not if they
05:28
disagree but if they're mean-spirited
05:30
they'll cut them off and ban them so
05:32
that keeps the list clean keeps the
05:34
youtubes and facebook clean for us so
05:36
that's that's why so when you're
05:38
donating
05:39
this is just a small part of the group i
05:41
think there's probably almost 20 of us
05:42
all together
05:43
um but it goes to these are all
05:45
full-time positions so
05:46
it's a little more complex than it looks
05:48
like when i'm sitting here at home
05:50
doing my things all right everybody
05:52
thank you everybody everybody very much
05:54
thanks for your hard work and here they
05:56
go one at a time
05:58
okay that's a team uh that's on on the
06:01
show
06:01
as we do it um i just want a couple
06:04
there's a couple announcements first of
06:05
all
06:06
there's a rumor going around we just
06:08
heard about it there's apparently either
06:10
a guy named steve schultz has the same
06:12
name as i
06:13
as me who they say is claiming that kim
06:16
is a false prophet kim is
06:18
not a false prophet kim was my good
06:21
close friend a very dear friend
06:25
back in the day we even helped promote
06:26
him one time his assistant
06:28
when he lived out in texas for a while
06:31
said you
06:31
i went out there to shoot a program and
06:33
she said you'll have you have no idea
06:36
what you've done for kim and i said i
06:38
guess i don't what have i done for kim
06:40
and basically she was saying that the
06:41
elijah list at that time we didn't have
06:43
the
06:44
we were doing some video but it was just
06:46
kind of like extra we didn't have a show
06:48
yet and she kind of credited us with um
06:51
kind of launching his ministry in public
06:54
forum so
06:54
he's he was a dear friend of mine i love
06:57
him very much i
06:59
cried crocodile tears when he went home
07:02
with lord not
07:02
i'm sure he's happy but i feel the loss
07:05
it i
07:06
really felt it strongly for a lot of
07:08
years so there was another steve schultz
07:10
who was in the prophetic
07:11
years ago i've lost track of him i don't
07:14
know if he said anything about kim or if
07:16
this is somebody just
07:17
claiming that i said something about kim
07:19
with kim's
07:20
kim's a person of great to be hiding
07:23
esteem so
07:24
i wanted to tell you all that um
07:27
yesterday
07:28
i got word through a third party and
07:31
they they acknowledge this party who's
07:33
in dc who are they saying
07:35
there's a sudden shift in dc they could
07:37
feel an open heaven
07:39
and open heaven is good because that's
07:41
when God can begin to really move and do
07:44
his stuff
07:45
and then this morning a good friend a
07:47
prophetic intercessor friend
07:48
out of um either the windy city i always
07:51
forget which one
07:52
she's in uh or or st louis
07:56
she said wow open heaven open heaven
07:58
open heaven so it's not just
07:59
in dc prophets are beginning to feel the
08:02
open heaven so
08:03
this is a really good thing we're
08:05
putting on uh
08:07
it's either there right now or will it
08:08
be there shortly on facebook
08:10
robin bullock had a word
08:14
about nine he said the lord said if i
08:17
only could get
08:18
nine prophets to take their staff and
08:21
bang the ground hit the ground
08:23
and call trump back into office and when
08:26
he did that as soon as he
08:27
did that i paused it because it was on
08:29
the replay i ran and got my staff
08:31
went out in the uh room where i was
08:33
watching and i banged the ground with
08:35
him
08:36
and later of course he had already done
08:37
it because it was a recording and i
08:40
texted robin
08:41
and uh because he said there need to be
08:44
nine
08:44
prophets that would do that and and i
08:46
said i just did it with you on
08:48
on the replay he said we only need seven
08:51
more well i guarantee you there's gonna
08:52
be a whole lot more than nine because
08:54
any most intercessors are really
08:56
prophets who pray
08:57
that was a phrase i got by jennifer
09:00
evans a few years ago and i thought you
09:01
know that makes sense
09:04
because most intercessors are seeing
09:05
prophetically or they wouldn't even want
09:07
to pray
09:08
they see what they're praying so if you
09:11
get watch that tape
09:13
watch that's not tape watch that video
09:16
and get your stat
09:17
of a broomstick if you have to uh bang
09:20
the table with the spoon if that's all
09:21
you got and
09:22
and prophesy that the return of trump
09:24
and uh that may well be one of the
09:26
reasons there's a sudden open heaven in
09:28
dc
09:29
and and over the nation so uh let's see
09:32
what else do i want to tell you robin
09:33
when we got to talking we agreed
09:35
yesterday to start a new weekly program
09:38
uh it's on in this hour but starting
09:40
march 8th
09:42
robin will be doing a regular program
09:44
every monday
09:45
it's i won't tell you the name of it
09:47
that'll be a surprise you'll like it
09:49
it's something that
09:49
no one else is doing or has ever done
09:51
that we know
09:52
and you're going to like it a lot it
09:54
will of course be doing some of the same
09:56
stuff
09:56
on those programs but then there's a
09:58
twist to it that i think you're going to
09:59
really like
10:01
so that and then last but not least
10:05
timothy dixon or tim dixon the truck
10:07
driver is going to be on with a special
10:08
program this afternoon so two o'clock
10:10
pacific time which is five eastern
10:14
many of you have written to us saying
10:16
can you get timothy dixon on the truck
10:18
driver
10:19
and uh he's quite the prophet he's God
10:22
just
10:23
breathed on it said in favor on the lord
10:24
most of his prophecies come from his
10:26
truck
10:27
and you can hear the engine running
10:28
because the truckers tend to leave their
10:30
engines on um that's the way that that's
10:34
the way truckers do it so you'll hear
10:35
the
10:36
the the oh i can't think of the name the
10:39
diesel engine's running so
10:40
hey steve that show is actually tomorrow
10:43
at two
10:44
it's tomorrow oh okay
10:47
are we taping it or is it tomorrow it's
10:49
gonna be live tomorrow
10:51
at two o'clock oh my apologies everybody
10:53
i my
10:54
information was wrong thank you see
10:56
that's why we need the team behind us
10:58
think how much better it is when
10:59
somebody's auditing this and can pop on
11:02
and tell us when we blew it so
11:03
apologies everybody well i have this
11:06
afternoon off after all
11:07
um okay i think that's about it so
11:10
without further ado let's bring our
11:11
friend kat kuran here
11:14
there she is hey Kat how are you
11:18
i'm doing fine you just
11:21
did you said nine nine lumping fine
11:26
how many so how many services did you do
11:29
i've done uh nine meetings and probably
11:33
the last
11:34
like week and a half wow you i would i
11:37
would be tired
11:39
wow well
11:42
are you holding up okay i'm doing great
11:45
i actually was
11:46
one of those prophets out in the middle
11:48
of the road just the other night doing
11:50
the very thing that robin said
11:52
okay wow that's three we only need six
11:55
more and i guarantee it's already been
11:56
more than that
11:57
it probably has even in the little bit
11:59
of time you've spoken i'm sure they've
12:00
all done
12:02
you know someone gave me that staff and
12:04
when he had his staff on it was
12:06
the one i think somebody gave him and i
12:08
looked at it i thought that
12:10
looks identical to mine it had the
12:12
leather strap
12:13
it had a leather tag on it my someone
12:16
gave it to me is called the ezekiel
12:18
stick or something like that yeah
12:20
whoever gave it to me if you're watching
12:22
this thank you because i used it yeah
12:24
probably for the first time doing that
12:26
so any right way to get it
12:28
so well Kat before we get into questions
12:31
of heaven why don't let me just throw
12:32
the floor open to you and tell us
12:33
anything you want to say about
12:36
current events i do know there's a lot
12:39
of activity that's going to be starting
12:41
like
12:42
in the natural i'm talking about in the
12:43
natural and
12:45
one thing we're going to do before we're
12:47
all done we are going to declare over
12:48
our military
12:51
very specific reasons they're going to
12:53
need it okay
12:55
so we have to declare over the military
12:57
that God will
12:59
sharpen their skills give them
13:01
supernatural discernment
13:03
and of course the hosts are already with
13:05
them and
13:06
i've been declaring probably over the
13:08
last month
13:10
uh commanding the heavens to open over
13:13
dc
13:14
and the host to pour in and i do know
13:17
that a lot of the demonic
13:18
has actually run out of dc
13:22
left and i knew that would cause
13:25
something to begin to happen
13:27
number one the ones hiding behind the
13:29
barbed wire are getting very terrified
13:33
they've tried everything they can you
13:35
know to get rid of trump has not worked
13:38
and i think they've been successful in
13:39
making him mad
13:42
i will smile about that me too
13:45
i'm smiling too and there are plans if
13:49
we've been saying his plan set in place
13:52
they have their own time to happen but i
13:55
do know that those things are about to
13:57
happen
13:58
and i think probably uh let's see close
14:02
to a month from now things are going to
14:04
be different i can't say what those
14:05
things are but they will be different
14:07
but the heavens have definitely opened
14:09
over dc
14:11
and over areas of texas and over areas
14:14
of florida all offer the same purpose
14:16
and like i said i do know that the
14:19
demons have been
14:20
running from dc as fast as they can
14:24
because they know that their mission
14:25
there has already failed
14:27
their mission has actually failed in
14:29
america because they have not gotten
14:32
what they wanted
14:33
i'm talking about the physical and these
14:36
in the spiritual have not gotten what
14:38
they wanted
14:39
out of americans because americans are
14:42
not
14:43
a third world country i pray for third
14:45
world countries all the time i'm not
14:47
speaking against them i'm just saying
14:49
third world countries are controlled
14:51
usually by satan
14:52
and by the leaders there but that's not
14:55
who we are
14:56
we are americans this is the land of the
14:58
free the brave
15:01
and justice and that's not going to
15:03
change because you know what they didn't
15:05
count on
15:06
they couldn't get out of the heart of
15:07
the people
15:09
they figured if they could move their
15:11
hand and control everything from there
15:13
it would happen
15:14
but it didn't happen okay it did not
15:16
happen
15:17
uh the heart of the people hasn't
15:19
changed
15:20
freedom is still in our hearts they
15:23
can't take that out it's like you can't
15:25
take something out the heart of a person
15:27
or out of their soul uh even though you
15:29
think you can you can't do it
15:32
and the normal way of satan doing all
15:34
this is if he can get the mind of the
15:35
people
15:36
and get the mind of the majority of the
15:38
people controlled
15:40
and defeated and crushed down that's
15:43
when satan will usually move in and be
15:45
successful but he hasn't been able to do
15:47
that
15:48
he's actually afraid hell is trembling
15:51
demons are leaving dc like
15:53
crazy like in waves and the hosts are
15:56
are are flying in there so they're
15:59
surrounded already they can't see that
16:01
they're surrounded
16:02
but they're totally surrounded by the
16:04
host of heaven
16:06
who would be there to do what they need
16:07
to do when
16:09
that special event happens and this is
16:12
probably one of the most powerful things
16:14
he's had me say
16:15
so far i do know what's going on on the
16:18
other side
16:19
of righteousness and freedom i can't
16:22
talk about those things
16:23
but i can let you know what's going on
16:25
in the spirit realm and what happens in
16:27
the spirit realm
16:28
impacts this natural world
16:31
so yes i am very excited i
16:34
expect i expect that celebration
16:38
uh to not drag out and people will
16:41
already begin to know when things are
16:43
happening
16:43
that that part can't be hidden so don't
16:46
worry everybody you'll know when those
16:48
things
16:49
actually start to happen don't let any
16:52
fear come into you
16:53
because this is not the day of wrath
16:55
against us
16:57
is a day of wrath against the devil and
17:00
against those who
17:01
serve him so the only ones that should
17:03
be afraid
17:05
the ones behind the barbed wire and
17:07
anyone connect to them
17:09
worldwide is about to be shaken
17:12
yeah for those that don't know behind
17:14
them but when you say behind the barbed
17:15
wire a lot of people do not
17:16
show this on the media but the but the
17:19
military that surrounded
17:21
uh the reflecting pool and the capital
17:24
and the white house
17:25
the military is still there is that not
17:27
right
17:28
it is and people may not may not know
17:31
this and this is probably is known in
17:33
many places
17:34
but the president well of course he
17:38
is our president still but even at the
17:40
time of uh
17:42
an inauguration you know even at the
17:46
time of an inauguration
17:47
there's months after that that the
17:50
president that was standing
17:52
has absolute total control of the
17:54
military maybe
17:55
people didn't know that but they do
17:58
so although the real president who won
18:02
still is actually literally in that seat
18:06
and those who stole it aren't going to
18:08
be able to keep it they meant not doing
18:10
a very good job at all
18:11
because they're not number one organized
18:14
they have no foundation
18:16
usually the people who are over this
18:18
country have a foundation of hope
18:20
and greatness for the land that they are
18:23
guess what serving
18:24
not controlling and so that foundation
18:27
of hope for everybody is there
18:29
but when the devil comes in there is no
18:32
foundation
18:33
that's why so many of his attempts fail
18:37
or they last for a period of time than
18:39
the end but i can tell you right now
18:42
that our president donald
18:45
still has absolute control of the
18:47
military
18:48
so you need to know that everybody and i
18:51
think that that's why they keep trying
18:52
to take him down
18:53
hoping they can end that but they can't
18:56
have
18:56
no authority not even in the natural not
18:59
even officially not even legally
19:01
can they do anything about the fact that
19:03
he still has control of the military
19:07
wow that's amazing that's amazing now
19:10
you you said we were going to uh command
19:13
uh
19:14
what did you want to do did you want to
19:15
do that right now regarding
19:17
praying for the military i didn't do it
19:19
now everybody can just repeat this and i
19:21
don't want people to say i'm in
19:22
agreement i actually want them to say
19:24
the words
19:25
it's nice to say an agreement for
19:27
something for somebody
19:29
but when you yourself are making a
19:31
ruling
19:32
over what's going on because we rule
19:35
right with jesus christ
19:37
you say those words
19:40
so we're going to say this together
19:42
father
19:43
father we declare we declare
19:47
in jesus name in jesus name
19:50
that our military our military
19:54
will be covered completely covered
19:57
completely
19:58
during this operation during this
20:02
operation they will have physical help
20:06
they will have physical help they will
20:07
have words from holy spirit
20:10
they will have words from the holy
20:11
spirit they will have discernment
20:14
they will have they will have
20:15
discernment and be able to move quickly
20:19
they'll be able to move quickly with no
20:21
harm done to them
20:23
with no harm done to them every
20:25
operation
20:27
every operation on behalf of america
20:30
on behalf of america will be successful
20:34
will be successful it will be a suddenly
20:37
it will be a suddenly that God is behind
20:40

21:05

21:43
in jesus name amen amen
21:46
amen oh that's so good well we're going
21:50
to things of heaven
21:51
but that's amazing is there anything
21:52
else you want to add before we go on and
21:54
make sure i don't
21:55
cut anything off i i think that's pretty
21:58
much it that's probably all that can be
22:00
said
22:01
that i can just tell everybody this is
22:03
such a
22:04
an amazing year that you're living
22:07
we can't say a lot of us cannot say
22:09
we've ever lived
22:11
through or experienced anything like
22:12
this but the thing that is so powerful
22:15
is that we can
22:16
all declare an agreement with God's
22:18
plans
22:20
that we don't have to step back because
22:22
we don't know what time he's going to do
22:24
something
22:25
we do know he is going to do something
22:27
and the most important thing you can do
22:28
is
22:29
don't step back keep that stand
22:32
on behalf of our God and our country
22:36
and the president that God has chosen
22:39
we're not stepping back in jesus name i
22:41
expect
22:42
celebration in a great way that never
22:45
seen before not just in america but
22:47
around this world
22:48
and he has never stopped saying that to
22:51
me
22:53
so good so good Kat uh Kat thank you so
22:56
much for that that's really good
22:58
well for those of you that may know uh
23:00
be maybe new
23:01
Kat has been to heaven over the last 20
23:03
some years thousands of times she
23:05
stopped counting at a thousand
23:06
but she's really with the lord all day
23:08
every day he sometimes walks through the
23:10
wall
23:11
literally and sits down and writes
23:13
things on her wall it's amazing so
23:15
we ask her every time she comes on every
23:17
wednesday when
23:19
it's mostly every wednesday she can't
23:21
necessarily make it every single
23:22
wednesday but most wednesdays
23:24
and we ask her questions from you the
23:26
viewer
23:27
i'm hearing some feedback in my ear is
23:29
that me or is that something else
23:31
interesting well if let me know if i
23:33
need to do anything different
23:34
michael jeff so just a little bit of
23:36
feedback there that's better it went
23:37
away
23:38
so Kat you said you uh like to ask um
23:41
answer questions from kids too by the
23:44
way i'm still getting some feedback in
23:45
my ear if it makes any difference guys
23:47
um so i'm gonna give you three kids
23:49
questions i can't tell if these are
23:51
from the same mommy because there's
23:54
three different ones but she only refers
23:56
to one
23:56
so here's the here's an eight-year-old
23:58
question from taylor
24:00
do you have your own house or can you
24:03
share your house with your parents in
24:05
heaven
24:08
i wonder if they mean as a child i think
24:12
if they
24:12
probably i think she's seeing it from or
24:15
she i assume
24:16
yeah i assume she's seeing it as if
24:18
she's there with her parents right now
24:20
at this age like if the lord returned or
24:22
something
24:23
i guess uh absolutely the children would
24:26
be with their parents
24:28
um and i will say this if a child leaves
24:32
here early
24:33
they're never alone they're with the
24:35
closest family members who are already
24:37
there in heaven
24:38
usually it's with grandparents or even
24:41
great-grandparents
24:43
who will keep them until the parents
24:44
arrive no matter how long that is
24:46
earth time they're never alone um of
24:49
course
24:50
families do things together all over
24:52
heaven
24:53
uh together as a family because that's
24:56
just the way God designed it he doesn't
24:58
split up families
25:00
when you go home to heaven we've already
25:01
said before
25:03
you don't go like you're married on the
25:05
earth but you'll be like best friends
25:07
everybody can visit and stay at each
25:09
other's mansions that happens a lot
25:12
sometimes they go off somewhere and stay
25:14
somewhere in heaven
25:16
i mean i don't mention that but they
25:17
have beautiful fun places to go
25:19
and even stay at in different places in
25:21
heaven
25:22
maybe you want to be there even though
25:24
there's no time you might want to be
25:26
enjoying all the activities festivities
25:29
uh or fun that's going on there then
25:31
there's actually places for you to stay
25:33
at there
25:34
awesome okay wow okay so liam seven
25:38
years old liam wants to know if there
25:39
are mermaids in heaven
25:42
well i've never seen a mermaid liam i'm
25:45
not saying they aren't there
25:47
um just about everything else is there
25:49
i've seen unicorns i've seen dinosaurs
25:53
i've seen creatures there that aren't
25:56
even
25:56
on the earth so but that's one thing i
25:59
haven't
26:00
seen i haven't been under the crystal z
26:02
very much
26:03
i've been maybe once actually under the
26:06
crystal sea swimming
26:07
and the creatures talk to you while
26:09
you're there the whales the sharks yes
26:11
there's sharks there
26:13
every kind of thing octopuses
26:14
everything's there so i haven't really
26:17
been under there a whole lot
26:19
uh mainly i've seen it from the land or
26:21
been on ships going across
26:23
it so i can't say there aren't
26:26
uh because i haven't i don't know the
26:28
answer to that question but that was a
26:30
good question
26:30
that's good and then last one jonas five
26:33
years old
26:34
wants to know does God take off his
26:36
slippers or change his clothes
26:42
i can't say he has slippers um
26:47
i would say he absolutely has a wardrobe
26:50
he made everything i'm
26:52
i'm certain because he's such a person
26:54
of um
26:56
you know God can be in the shape of
26:58
almost anything actually we know christ
27:00
appears as a
27:01
lion as a lamb as an eagle i'm sure the
27:05
father can do the same thing i mean they
27:07
made everything
27:08
i can imagine if God did have slippers
27:12
i wouldn't be surprised if he did
27:14
probably the one who would get a chance
27:16
to see that is a child if a child ever
27:18
went up there to visit
27:19
and they were in their bedroom slippers
27:21
God would put bedroom slippers on too
27:23
just to make them feel at home i can
27:25
just i will say that much
27:27
but i've seen the father wearing
27:29
different robes
27:30
different kind of gowns um absolutely
27:34
he has different kind of crowns the
27:36
rainbow never stops moving
27:38
in and out of him you know that's where
27:40
life comes from
27:42
so that was a great question i don't
27:44
think anyone's ever asked me that
27:45
i do know this that when this little
27:48
child was caught up to heaven to visit
27:50
God sent them back they had passed from
27:53
something i remember what it was
27:55
but he was taken up just for a visit and
27:58
um
27:59
God sits on his throne when this little
28:01
child came
28:03
God sent for a little throne
28:06
lightly and put it right next to
28:09
his on the left side and that little
28:12
child
28:13
got to sit in that throne and just like
28:16
the father did
28:17
so that's why i said if a little child
28:20
was caught up and they were in their
28:21
pajamas in their bedroom slippers God
28:22
would probably wear bedroom slippers
28:24
just for them
28:27
he's so personal huh that's so good okay
28:29
well i know
28:31
each person in heaven like when they
28:32
walk up will i instantly know
28:35
who they are do they have to introduce
28:36
themselves or does everybody know
28:38
everything about everybody kind of like
28:41
at least as far as names
28:42
or do you introduce yourself i'm just
28:45
looking at this
28:46
um yeah i guess that's it
28:50
it's like when you're walking up you see
28:52
a person you automatically know that
28:53
your father your grandfather
28:54
do you see another person because we're
28:56
all young then and suddenly you know
28:58
that is your friend from
28:59
your little friend from high school or
29:00
from grade school do you know that stuff
29:02
automatically
29:03
or do they introduce themselves to
29:06
well first of all let's talk about the
29:08
ones that they know personally the bible
29:10
says
29:11
that in heaven you will be known as you
29:14
were known
29:15
that means that your friends and your
29:17
family will automatically recognize you
29:20
and you will recognize them no one is
29:22
old but people still
29:24
know the other thing i do know also is
29:27
everyone in heaven automatically knows
29:29
your name
29:30
and i've heard that over and over and
29:32
over again from other people who've been
29:34
to heaven
29:35
or had visits there they recognized
29:37
people
29:38
they knew that that was their
29:40
grandfather the great grandfather even
29:42
people they hadn't
29:43
met they were part of the family they
29:45
knew who that was
29:46
but every heaven knows your name when
29:48
you get there and they call you by your
29:50
by your first name yeah i can imagine
29:53
that just strikes a new question to me
29:55
it's like if
29:56
everybody knows everybody and i i never
29:58
met my great-grandfather i didn't met my
30:00
great-grandmother
30:01
but his father and his father and his
30:02
father and his wife we could have
30:04
we could literally have a schultz
30:06
reunion of that whole line
30:08
right and there'd be hundreds and
30:10
hundreds of people
30:11
oh yeah they do that all the time they
30:13
have like huge like reunions
30:16
massive reunions from people who are you
30:18
know in your family line
30:19
people say i don't know anybody trust me
30:21
they're up there
30:23
and they will know you and yes you will
30:25
everybody's gonna hug
30:26
no masks in heaven people no social
30:29
justice
30:30
there's no social different thing in
30:32
heaven and everybody will know you and
30:34
greet you
30:35
and usually what happens is after your
30:38
throne room party with the father son
30:40
and holy spirit
30:41
your family will eventually come to get
30:44
you because you so want to be in the
30:45
throne room
30:46
they'll talk you into going with them
30:48
because they want you to see your
30:49
mansion
30:50
and usually that's how it happens they
30:51
come get you they take you to the man
30:54
your mansion because they've been
30:55
putting gifts in that mansion for you
30:58
since they've been there and then you
31:00
have another whole party with all your
31:02
family
31:03
your relatives even from way back and
31:06
that's usually when you actually meet
31:08
uh most of them that's amazing now you
31:11
said i was dared to ask you this
31:12
question so you're gonna giggle but
31:14
um first of all there's all kinds of
31:16
hairdos there's pink hair
31:18
purple hair and different hairdos and
31:19
people change their hair to
31:21
up right okay so i just dared to ask you
31:23
this question
31:24
have you ever seen anyone any guy with a
31:27
man bun
31:27
in heaven
31:34
well i will say this that
31:37
some people from their culture
31:41
if that was their culture actually there
31:43
is there are and you know
31:46
people can wear their hair any way they
31:48
want to like you said it can be long it
31:50
can be short
31:52
most of the guys will wear the hair
31:55
similar to like jesus it'll be kind of
31:57
loose
31:58
most of the time it's about down to
31:59
their shoulders
32:01
almost nobody in heaven almost nobody's
32:04
balls at all because
32:05
i guess unless they wanted to be i've
32:08
never seen
32:09
people in heaven without hair but almost
32:11
every other kind of hairstyle that
32:14
you know that they would like to have
32:15
you can change it
32:17
uh they have salons especially the women
32:19
like to go there but they have like
32:21
diamond dust emerald dust put in their
32:24
hair
32:25
people dress sometimes God will have a
32:27
huge event
32:28
and everybody dresses like royalty it's
32:31
the most magnificent place
32:33
and people wear all kinds of things up
32:35
there everything's
32:36
decent i have to always say that nothing
32:39
revealing or indecent in heaven
32:42
but beautiful amazing some of it's kind
32:44
of edgy
32:46
you know i've never heard anyone
32:47
complain that they were given a
32:49
nightgown or a bathrobe
32:50
up there although most people draw that
32:53
most people draw that because they don't
32:54
know
32:55
they know you get a gown of salvation a
32:56
robe of righteousness but those things
32:58
are the most spectacular things
33:00
you actually own in heaven so but
33:03
there's all kinds of clothing to wear
33:04
because there's so many things to do
33:06
you don't want to wear a gown on a
33:08
roller coaster there's a clue right
33:09
there
33:10
i was thinking about that yeah this i'm
33:12
gonna blend a couple of questions and
33:14
you might have touched on this a little
33:15
bit before but
33:16
um so there's
33:20
there will probably be he's and she's in
33:21
heaven and i'm guessing
33:23
and this is a as much a question as a
33:25
statement i'm guessing the women have
33:27
the form of women and the men have a
33:28
form of men
33:29
but the quest two questions are if we
33:31
don't go to the bathroom
33:34
and of course we're not having children
33:36
what what happens to the end
33:38
they're asking what happens to the
33:39
inward parts do they are they just not
33:41
there
33:42
because you don't need what you just
33:44
don't
33:45
need those parts that's what the
33:47
question is
33:48
you have to remember everybody you're in
33:51
your spiritual body
33:53
of course except elijah and enoch during
33:55
their physical bodies they've been there
33:57
a very very long time in the physical
34:00
bodies but they don't look old either
34:01
they're amazing
34:02
but everyone else when this physical
34:05
body dies
34:06
your spiritual body steps out it doesn't
34:08
have
34:09
all the inward physical parts that you
34:12
need to live on this earth
34:14
you don't need that in heaven okay when
34:16
we get our glorified body
34:18
i don't think that uh i think when our
34:20
body at the very end when everything's
34:22
over all the wars the millennial reign
34:24
when all that's over
34:26
and then we all go we will be together
34:28
at that time you know
34:30
it says in the day the dead and christ
34:31
shall rise that's this body you left
34:33
behind
34:35
that was buried or whatever happened to
34:38
it even if it was a
34:39
burn up in a fire or you were cremated
34:42
God will put every ash every piece of
34:44
you particle view back together
34:47
and if you've been living in heaven your
34:49
spirit man at that point will come down
34:51
be glorified in that physical body
34:53
they'll be put together as one
34:55
and after that your physical body and
34:57
spiritual body will never be separated
34:59
you'd be like one
35:02
and so i don't know that you will have
35:03
to have all those parts that worked for
35:06
certain reasons
35:07
i don't believe anybody will ever ever
35:09
have to go to the bathroom again because
35:12
everything you eat is made out of light
35:14
it's absorbed into your
35:16
spiritual body which is made out of
35:17
light it tastes
35:19
like all the food you eat here no weight
35:21
gain
35:22
nothing's bad or not good for you but
35:24
it's dissolved
35:26
into your entire being so i don't think
35:29
that will ever change even when you get
35:31
your physical body back so you don't
35:32
need
35:33
those certain parts in heaven you still
35:36
feel
35:36
uh you can breathe in heaven and your
35:38
spiritual body so it's like you have
35:39
spiritual lungs
35:41
you couldn't sing right you have to suck
35:43
an air
35:45
to sing and to speak so you actually
35:48
feel like you're breathing the air of
35:50
heaven and you also can smell things in
35:52
heaven
35:53
which you need those kind of things and
35:55
you eat
35:56
okay you don't look at a piece of food
35:58
and it just dissolves in you you
35:59
actually eat it
36:01
so those sensations and things you still
36:03
have those
36:04
but as far as the other ones like waste
36:06
and stuff like that there isn't
36:07
any anywhere in heaven none of that
36:11
it just gets better people yeah
36:14
awesome okay now this one has been asked
36:16
me many times i finally decided
36:19
to jump in and ask it our guardian
36:21
angels are with us from the
36:22
important of conception i think you said
36:24
they're with us all the time
36:26
this question keeps coming to me so when
36:29
i'm
36:30
i'm going to use the word indisposed i'm
36:31
going to say when i'm doing intimate
36:33
things
36:34
married couples there there seems to be
36:36
a concern what hap what is the angel
36:38
what is it my guardian angel see you
36:41
guardian
36:42
angels are outside the room
36:46
but they're very well aware that there's
36:48
nothing there that could hurt you
36:50
because that's their number one job
36:52
is to keep you and to help to guard over
36:55
you
36:56
especially if you you go in places
36:58
they're always right there next to you
37:00
but things like the bathroom and the
37:01
shower and stuff like that they don't
37:03
they don't have to be there
37:04
they're they would be aware of something
37:06
happen like if you started to fall or
37:08
something in the shower
37:09
they of course could rescue you from
37:11
there but their heads
37:13
you have to understand they're from
37:14
heaven they don't think
37:16
like in your natural mind they don't
37:19
think oh man they can't see me like that
37:21
because they've rescued people and save
37:23
people on the operating table
37:25
from death and i don't think you wear
37:27
clothes on the operating table
37:29
so that that intimacy that privacy you
37:32
get to keep that
37:34
to some extent but if harm was ever
37:36
going to come to you they certainly
37:37
would intervene
37:38
so that's the way that they do things
37:41
they're not like
37:42
glued to you every second every second
37:45
uh those times when you go but i will
37:47
tell you this the holy spirit speaks to
37:48
you more when you're in the bathroom
37:50
than any other time and you know
37:52
your mind is quiet your mind kind of
37:55
shuts down
37:56
it's focused on what it's doing and so i
37:59
will know holy spirit is everywhere also
38:02
and uh but he doesn't think that way
38:04
that oh my gosh i'll see them
38:06
not dressed right or not this they don't
38:08
think that way in their head
38:10
they're here to protect us and i can
38:12
tell you the
38:13
conception they are sent waiting outside
38:15
your mother
38:17
for you to be born and they will be with
38:19
you
38:20
when you go back to heaven one day
38:23
okay and then on the guarded angels
38:25
they're there to protect
38:26
you does God bestow on them
38:30
also um for lack of a better terminology
38:33
powers to heal so
38:35
at the right time when God said now can
38:38
your guardian angel touch you and create
38:40
healing or
38:40
are they really only there to protect
38:43
you and
38:43
something else has to happen for the
38:45
healing to happen oh i've seen
38:47
angels many times when actually you know
38:50
it says that they actually go back and
38:52
forth to heaven you know it says that
38:54
that it they go before the face of God
38:56
and stuff like that
38:57
and you actually have more than one
38:59
because one's always with you if one has
39:01
to go back to heaven
39:02
to receive stuff to give to you to bring
39:05
to you
39:06
to shower over you there's so many
39:08
things that they do like that
39:10
and yes sometimes they go back up and he
39:12
speaks to them
39:13
and sometimes they can bring healing
39:16
they can bring body parts for sure i
39:18
know they deliver body parts to people
39:21
like they'll walk through them with the
39:22
body part and it's in them i've seen
39:24
that happen many times
39:26
so yeah they can get special assignments
39:28
to special times
39:29
i've actually seen in and like an er
39:33
somebody was like dying they were
39:35
actually dying
39:36
and i saw all of a sudden the people
39:38
that were praying and then God said it's
39:40
not their time and these
39:42
angels flew in and they leaned over this
39:45
person beginning to blow the breath of
39:47
God on them
39:48
wow okay literally i've seen that happen
39:50
several times
39:51
and all of a sudden instant healing for
39:54
that person
39:55
like they were on death door and
39:57
instantly
39:58
healed still in the er um
40:02
waiting to do something with them so
40:04
they actually flew in
40:05
i've seen it blew on the people and they
40:08
were restored
40:09
because God said it wasn't their time to
40:10
go yet so angels can actually do that
40:13
and maybe a special group he sends to do
40:15
that but i do know that the breath of
40:18
God
40:18
is so powerful i felt it blown on me
40:22
not to make me not to make me still live
40:24
and not die
40:25
but for for different reasons and i've
40:28
seen
40:28
people especially prophets if you see
40:30
them sometimes when they're
40:32
speaking over people sometimes they'll
40:34
blow like that
40:36
when they do that that's the breath of
40:37
God that they're blowing out whatever
40:39
God had them saying to somebody
40:41
that kind that sometimes can seal
40:43
something that God has said this
40:45
and then he seals it and they they'll
40:47
blow the breath of God on himself
40:48
there's so many things we don't talk
40:49
about the operations of everything we're
40:52
that side we talk about the operations
40:54
in heaven there's so many things the
40:56
angelic do
40:57
the army does army of heaven does on
40:59
this earth it's like would be countless
41:01
probably
41:02
impossible to actually talk about all of
41:04
it but as far as healing i have seen
41:06
those things happen
41:07
really good now i asked you a form of
41:10
this question before and this woman
41:11
wanted to know and i'm going to add mine
41:13
back into it
41:14
she wanted to know if if there are
41:16
certain activities
41:18
that she always wanted to do but never
41:21
did but i'm not just talking about
41:22
activities she wanted to be able to do
41:24
something that she
41:25
couldn't do they'll become a painter a
41:28
dancer an ice skater mountain climber
41:30
and i had said boy i want to be an
41:32
athlete but i'm not an athlete really
41:35
could i be something i never was i've
41:37
always wanted to play the piano i'm a
41:39
little bit musical
41:40
and play different instruments but i
41:41
always want to sit down and play
41:43
whatever came to my mind
41:44
you know i couldn't do that like
41:46
something could i
41:48
have a skill that i was never given on
41:50
the earth just because i wanted it
41:52
i'm certain that you could most people
41:55
actually do get to enjoy that and
41:56
there's places you go in heaven
41:59
for instance i've seen people that
42:01
that's what they did
42:02
their gift was to teach piano and that's
42:05
what they did
42:07
and in heaven they have a studio with
42:09
like i don't know
42:10
50 other pianos and people go there to
42:13
learn piano in heaven
42:15
but it only takes a couple lessons it's
42:17
not like it takes
42:18
six months and that's true with anything
42:21
i've also seen people who always want to
42:23
play football
42:24
they get to join a team that they all
42:27
were experts that was their gift
42:29
they get to be a part of that team and
42:31
at that time they get to play really
42:32
good so
42:33
all those things you talk to are
42:35
absolutely possible in heaven
42:37
that's amazing that's amazing all right
42:39
this one i'm going to just read it
42:41
it's a little bit longer she says i have
42:42
a question for Kat i'm somewhat of a
42:45
strategist and this question is about
42:46
something that stops me praying
42:49
when we pray and utter the words that
42:51
express our deepest feelings
42:53
does the enemy hear these prayers
42:54
meaning when she's saying out loud
42:56
and do they give him greater insight as
42:59
to how to overthrow us
43:00
i pray almost always internally it seems
43:03
foolish
43:04
to let the enemy know my heart and
43:06
deepest needs this is only for God to
43:08
know
43:08
please help me understand this more
43:10
fully from a strategist's point of view
43:12
there is something you can do about that
43:15
every time you say it when i when i'm
43:18
when i'm declaring
43:19
declaring a high level of prayer so you
43:22
know that God says what you declare and
43:24
decree i will establish unto you
43:26
that's still prayer you're saying
43:28
something believing jesus for
43:30
declaring this is what you're desiring
43:32
from God
43:33
and you can pray this prayer
43:37
i right now take authority over all the
43:39
power of the enemy who would seek to
43:41
hear me
43:42
uh get involved in what i'm saying and i
43:45
put a block
43:46
on them that no demon can hear me they
43:49
can't hear me
43:50
they can't respond to anything that i'm
43:51
saying and i post the angels of God
43:54
around me to prevent them from hearing
43:56
me i will sometimes say that before i
43:59
speak in a meeting so they can't come in
44:02
no demons if people bring them in they
44:04
can't interfere
44:05
you should do that every time you pray
44:07
you should say
44:08
you know i choose with my will and i
44:10
make a declaration no demon will hear
44:12
what i'm saying the devil will not hear
44:14
what i'm saying
44:15
and then they can't hear it but most
44:17
people don't think to do that
44:18
well yeah let me just push you in there
44:20
a little bit
44:22
go ahead go ahead it's important to pray
44:26
out loud okay because when your words
44:28
are released in the atmosphere
44:31
the frequency of God is in them if
44:34
christ is in you he's released into that
44:37
situation immediately
44:39
he doesn't ever say to pray internally
44:43
he always says to speak out to declare
44:46
to pray with your voice that would be
44:48
like you singing
44:50
internally it might sound good to you in
44:52
your head
44:54
but it's important to say it out loud
44:56
now if you're ever in a place
44:57
let's say you know whatever you're going
45:00
to sell somewhere and there's other
45:01
things in there
45:02
then in that point i would pray in
45:04
tongues if i were you
45:06
or i would just pray quietly but enough
45:09
for you to hear it
45:10
and you know also what you say about
45:12
let's say you are in a cell
45:14
what are you going to say you're going
45:15
to sit there and just put up with it
45:17
how are you gonna command the host to
45:19
come to begin to form things around you
45:23
to give you favor with judges with the
45:25
cell master i mean you know
45:27
the disciples were praising God when the
45:30
locks fell off
45:32
when the angels came to let them out we
45:34
should always remember to worship God no
45:36
matter what place we're in in our lives
45:39
but yes you can say something to stop
45:40
the enemy from hearing your words
45:43
it's all in us when we receive christ so
45:47
don't be concerned make that statement
45:49
they won't be able to hear what you said
45:51
and you actually will put fear in the
45:53
enemy because he will be shocked that
45:55
you
45:56
know that you can do that wow
45:59
okay that's really good um okay i gotta
46:01
read this one because it's
46:02
it's specific uh patricia says i've
46:06
never had a child
46:08
never had a miscarriage or abortion i
46:11
ended up having a full hysterectomy at
46:13
46
46:14
yet to this day i feel so strongly that
46:17
i have children
46:18
meeting in heaven and although they were
46:20
not able to be born to me on the earth i
46:22
have children in heaven
46:24
is that possible that i have children in
46:26
heaven waiting for me even though i had
46:27
none born to me on the earth
46:30
there's many times the women
46:34
felt like they were pregnant i actually
46:35
know some people that they really felt
46:37
like that they were pregnant
46:38
but nothing came out of it in other
46:40
words there was no physical
46:42
evidence that if there was a conception
46:46
once that conception happens that little
46:48
spirit is sent into that
46:50
dot at the time of conception you create
46:53
like that little dot of flesh
46:55
and that little baby spirit is in there
46:57
if that never comes to fruition
46:59
i don't care if it's two weeks three
47:00
weeks along that baby's
47:03
angel will take it to heaven and that
47:06
baby will be waiting on you
47:08
when you get to heaven so as the father
47:11
said many women would be surprised
47:14
how many times they felt strongly that
47:16
they were but nothing actually came out
47:18
of it there was no evidence
47:20
that the pregnancy actually happened
47:22
most women are right when they feel
47:24
things inside like that
47:26
the other thing is this even if you
47:29
didn't
47:29
create one yourself there are places in
47:32
heaven that God has kept a reserve
47:34
of babies for people just like that
47:38
and you can go pick one out they will
47:40
call you mommy
47:41
it'll be just like that they were they
47:43
were yours they'll always think that way
47:46
so no one has to go without children
47:49
if you didn't have them on the earth you
47:50
never have to be without them
47:52
when you get to heaven it's absolutely
47:54
possible
47:55
to have uh go pick them out and have
47:58
them for yourself
47:59
wow that's really good okay uh okay this
48:03
is a good one and
48:04
people need this when i ask you this
48:05
once this is one of the questions i
48:07
asked you when i first got to know you
48:09
because i wanted to drill down on this
48:12
because see people have read your book
48:13
and it says i've heard many people say
48:14
they were taken to hell
48:16
and christians were there because of
48:18
unforgiveness in their heart
48:19
when they died from your experience is
48:22
this true my husband will not talk to
48:24
her oldest son
48:25
because he refuses to let go of things
48:27
that were said i don't
48:28
yeah so i guess it's her husband that
48:30
won't let it go and i want to add to
48:31
that
48:33
so if this is i guess this question is
48:35
about
48:36
one father who refuses to forgive one
48:38
son
48:39
and then i asked you back then
48:43
well what if i just there's a person i
48:45
just didn't forgive and i kind of forgot
48:47
about it and i moved on
48:48
that's still unforgiveness so i want to
48:51
it's a matter of degrees how much
48:54
how much unforgiveness can i put it that
48:57
way
48:58
is going to put you in hell there is a
49:01
difference
49:02
in harboring uh there's like a spirit of
49:06
unforgiveness
49:07
a lot of people get upset in their lives
49:09
and things were done wrong to them
49:11
that doesn't mean this is what unreal
49:14
true unforgiveness is uh
49:16
you know if you say to yourself i'd
49:18
rather just go to hell than forgive you
49:20
that's unforgiveness to be angry to be
49:22
upset about an issue that you can't
49:24
bring up because it's so painful
49:26
that's not real true unforgiveness that
49:29
means you were angry
49:30
you went through a trauma or something
49:32
because of something
49:33
but i always tell people if you want to
49:35
make sure
49:37
you can just say no matter what your
49:39
feelings are about the situation if you
49:41
say these words
49:42
as a child of God i choose with my will
49:46
to forgive and you say that person's
49:48
name
49:49
even though my heart doesn't feel like
49:51
it or my mind
49:52
i'm making a declaration that i choose
49:54
to forgive them
49:56
even though there's no emotions there
49:57
because you made the declaration
49:59
that will be white that will be wiped
50:01
off of your list that you were angry
50:02
that you couldn't forgive them
50:04
and your own flesh would begin to line
50:06
up with that till you get to a point
50:08
where
50:09
it doesn't hurt to hear their name you
50:11
know hide for them so i know what people
50:13
go through when that happens to them
50:15
but there's a big difference in living
50:18
an
50:18
absolute life of unforgiveness and hate
50:22
usually hate despite
50:25
or some kind of this agony and torture
50:28
that kind of thing God has more grace on
50:31
that
50:32
but someone who in the right mind just
50:33
decides that they hate them
50:35
they'll never forgive them they'd rather
50:37
go to hell and forgive them
50:39
that's more of unforgiveness than for
50:40
saying i was angry at one time i didn't
50:43
want to say anything to them so i was
50:44
just going to let it go
50:46
uh usually the holy spirit will work on
50:48
people that are in that situation
50:51
but just because people say you know i
50:53
went through too much i don't think i
50:54
can forgive
50:56
that's really not the spirit of
50:58
unforgiveness and i'm not trying to give
51:00
people
51:00
leeway to get away with it you know in
51:03
your soul
51:04
how much you despise that person and
51:07
just hate that person don't even care if
51:09
they die and they die and go to hell
51:11
that's more of unforgiveness than just
51:13
saying i don't think i can forgive them
51:15
i'm just not going to think about it no
51:16
more i think that the holy spirit would
51:19
work on them
51:20
or at the time at some time in your life
51:23
it will be brought up probably by the
51:25
holy spirit peter just say
51:27
i forgive anyone i have not forgiven God
51:30
forgive me for all that
51:32
even if you're not emotionally involved
51:34
it's really important to at least say
51:35
those words
51:37
and if you can't remember who it was
51:38
you'll still be covered because you said
51:40
that
51:41
that's good now i a cousin sort of a
51:45
thing to this unforgiveness is i've told
51:47
i think i even said it on the air here
51:48
and i told you recently when you're here
51:51
visiting that i have a sister who who
51:53
said to me
51:54
on the phone a few years ago because i
51:57
said dad had got his heart right and he
51:58
went to be with the lord
52:00
and she said if he's in heaven i don't
52:02
want to be there if she met her with all
52:04
the
52:04
depths of her soul let's say that she
52:06
just has every intent
52:07
never never never to forgive him i can
52:10
still
52:11
stand in for my sister and say i declare
52:14
and decree
52:15
that she will know the lord and that
52:17
kind of thing right so that God still i
52:19
would
52:19
give her more but we both know that all
52:23
that was tied to the torment that she
52:25
went through
52:26
that was just because i got offended
52:28
somebody said something to me
52:29
somebody took something to mind where
52:32
that's coming for
52:33
from and her was a continual torment and
52:37
agony that she faced even thinking
52:41
she didn't want to be around him to
52:42
begin with so that was our inner heart
52:45
that she couldn't stand the agony and
52:46
torment that would cause her to be even
52:48
near him
52:49
and when people that's what i was saying
52:51
that God gives grace in some areas that
52:53
would be one of the areas
52:55
that they were under great torment and
52:57
trauma by an individual
52:59
that that was just it was dug so deep in
53:02
their soul
53:03
it's almost like a terror to be near
53:05
them they couldn't picture being near
53:07
them
53:08
of course that doesn't he doesn't want
53:09
to separate
53:11
her from jesus christ he understands
53:14
that pain that she understands christ
53:16
understands the pain she went through
53:18
he understands why she said that words
53:20
he would take that with a grain of salt
53:22
because he knows what she went through
53:25
because of them
53:26
i believe because of you're staying for
53:28
her and christ
53:30
not willing to lose her to satan
53:33
who caused all that to happen from that
53:36
side
53:37
that God purposed her to be here for a
53:39
reason
53:40
and he loves her even though she went
53:42
through that trauma he didn't cause that
53:44
to happen that was all satan
53:46
but satan's ultimate goal is not just to
53:48
torment people on the earth
53:49
but to drag them into hell with him and
53:51
God's not willing
53:52
it was enough for them to be tormented
53:55
and live in
53:56
agony and have nightmares and then let
53:59
them end up in hell with them God will
54:01
pursue everything he can
54:02
to her his self he will pursue his
54:05
herself
54:06
uh to make sure she gets into heaven and
54:09
she comes to that
54:10
place of at least repentance with christ
54:13
and you know when you repent your sins
54:14
to christ
54:16
there's no sin that he won't include in
54:18
that whole thing
54:19
so let's say she gives a full
54:22
of herself fully to christ and repents
54:25
of every sin committed no matter what it
54:27
was
54:28
that that she said about him will be
54:30
wiped away like it was never said
54:32
very cool very cool all right a couple
54:35
more and then we're
54:36
running on time here um i'm going to
54:39
kind of this is a longer thing so i'm
54:41
going to kind of
54:42
encapsulate the question when people get
54:45
to heaven
54:46
will they ever be realize what rewards
54:48
they missed
54:49
out by what they didn't do that could
54:52
have done well somehow that became known
54:54
to them that they missed out of this
54:55
reward even though they're happy to be
54:56
there
54:57
and then the second question is is it
55:00
okay to be
55:01
on this earth motivated by the promise
55:04
of rewards so
55:05
God said he's going to reward me if i
55:07
help the poor so i
55:09
purposely help the poor because i want
55:11
the reward
55:14
i think that um you know what the bible
55:18
says
55:19
if you think for something for yourself
55:22
to heap it upon yourself
55:24
which is why sometimes God won't give
55:26
great wealth to certain people it would
55:28
ruin them
55:29
not everybody but there's some people
55:30
that would do that and
55:32
and people would uh want to be in the
55:34
ministry so they'd be
55:35
on a big podium and people would uh you
55:38
know love them and
55:39
sort of go after them you know because
55:42
they want to be with them
55:43
some people by the way people need to
55:45
know the difference of worship
55:47
and honoring and love because someone
55:49
has helped you
55:50
which is what most people are doing for
55:52
people who are on a platform somewhere
55:54
but there are some that do it just to be
55:56
seen
55:58
and if they did it for that reason they
56:00
get no reward
56:03
in the bible it says that will be your
56:05
reward your pride of what you wanted to
56:08
do for the purpose of yourself
56:10
you don't get reward for those things so
56:13
you would have wasted your time
56:15
if you do with the right heart to help
56:17
people no matter how small
56:19
you get great rewards God has purpose
56:22
already
56:23
to reward people who do certain things
56:25
for people and i think
56:27
some even start up with that i'll look
56:29
good
56:30
and look good on my resume it'll look
56:32
good if people see me doing this
56:34
normally in the course of doing that the
56:36
holy spirit will get your heart
56:38
and milk on behalf of the people and you
56:41
change
56:42
completely that you're not even thinking
56:44
about what you've earned you think about
56:46
the difference you're making in lives
56:47
for christ
56:49
uh so what i can tell you there are some
56:51
people who will lose rewards they'll
56:53
make it into heaven
56:55
because of selfishness um because of
56:58
selfishness maybe
56:59
you know that was one of the reasons why
57:02
satan fell it was pride he was very
57:04
selfish he still is selfish
57:06
selfish is not a good thing okay you're
57:09
not walking in the spirit you're not
57:11
caring about other people
57:12
you care about only about yourself which
57:15
i could take that
57:16
everybody back to dc right now everybody
57:18
up there right now
57:19
only cares about themselves individually
57:22
they don't even care about each other
57:23
they don't care about anyone here
57:26
and that's why one of the reasons why
57:27
they are going to miserably
57:29
fail so don't ever start out thinking
57:32
i'll do this for myself it'll look good
57:34
for me
57:35
if you're working on stuff like you're
57:36
highly skilled you're working towards
57:38
a job or something that's okay to be be
57:41
happy about how good you're doing
57:43
but when it comes to people's souls make
57:46
sure you're doing things for the right
57:47
reason
57:48
the rewards you can never out give God
57:52
not in your life service not in helping
57:54
people
57:55
not even giving financially to God when
57:58
you give it should be like even though
58:00
you're giving an offerings or to help
58:01
others
58:02
you give it like you're giving it to the
58:04
lord that's what the bible says
58:06
so i can just say this the rewards will
58:08
be shocking
58:09
amazing beautiful exciting that he gives
58:12
in heaven there are so many different
58:14
ones i've seen people get
58:16
even things you never even dreamed could
58:18
be a reward
58:19
because it's in God's heart to bless and
58:22
he wants a blessing to others amen
58:26
and when let's say a person makes it uh
58:28
just barely makes it to heaven and
58:30
they're just
58:30
happy to be there when they're there and
58:33
they're proud to be the will they will
58:34
they realize they missed out on rewards
58:37
when they're there will they go will
58:38
they realize
58:41
but there's no regret it's hard to
58:44
explain
58:45
they know they missed it they know they
58:47
missed it
58:49
and uh and you can't escape that you
58:50
missed it but you know what you don't
58:52
get it and people go man you missed it
58:54
didn't you they won't say that
58:56
you yourself will realize i should have
58:58
done more for christ
58:59
i should have thought more of others but
59:01
this is the overwhelming thing above all
59:03
that
59:04
even if you you won't get a cabin
59:06
because it's not even a little cabin and
59:07
having those beautiful places
59:09
it may not be some extensive massive
59:11
mansion
59:12
but you are so happy that you're
59:15
there and not there
59:18
and one more thing i don't talk very
59:20
much about people don't bring it up
59:23
there's the judgment seat uh the
59:25
judgment uh white great white zone
59:27
judgment but there's another one called
59:29
the judgment seat of christ
59:32
and most people don't know those are two
59:33
different things the father
59:35
is on the throne and all the wicked will
59:38
be taken out of hell at one point
59:40
you know when time is no more and we're
59:43
going on to the rest of our
59:44
lives the wicked will be taken out
59:46
bought before the throne of God himself
59:49
and he will show them when their name
59:51
was taken out of the lamb's book of life
59:54
or what they did to cause them to not
59:56
they didn't accept christ at all
59:58
rejected him
59:59
they will no no no they were guilty so
60:01
that's for the wicked dead that's not
60:04
believers who made it into heaven
60:06
there's a time in heaven
60:08
it's called the judgment seat of christ
60:10
it's at the end
60:11
of our time before probably before the
60:14
new earth and everything
60:15
you'll go before the judgment seat of
60:16
christ it says to judge you for deeds
60:18
done in the flesh
60:21
that's not judging you for sins that's
60:24
judging you for things he
60:25
asked you to do you knew he asked you to
60:28
do
60:29
and you said no and at that time
60:33
you cried and it says all the tears
60:36
it says right here about the judgment of
60:38
your christ your tears will be wiped
60:40
away and those
60:41
former things that you should have done
60:44
and did not i mean
60:45
major things i'm not saying little
60:47
things major things maybe you were
60:50
called to be in the ministry you said no
60:51
i want to be a plumber i'll make more
60:53
money
60:54
or this maybe you decided to put
60:56
yourself
60:57
without God involved in the ministry
60:59
like we talked earlier so you could get
61:01
attention
61:01
and he called you to be the best plumber
61:03
on the earth
61:05
you you need to do what God has asked
61:07
you to do what he called you to be
61:10
because the judgment seat of christ is
61:11
about the gift
61:13
he put in you and you and you don't want
61:16
to do that gift you have no intention of
61:18
doing that gift
61:20
you will be judged for not doing that
61:23
and any rewards you would have made had
61:25
you done it will be wiped away
61:27
you still get rewards from loving people
61:29
and helping them but many people don't
61:31
consider the judgment seat of christ
61:32
that's actually in heaven
61:34
it's not about judging your sins i'm not
61:36
talking about sins
61:37
and so maybe you should go look that up
61:39
everybody and read about that
61:40
but the but the great white throne
61:42
judgment is not for the body of christ
61:45
it's for all those who went into hell
61:48
and the
61:48
sentence is passed and then they're put
61:50
in the lake of fire
61:51
that's why we should all be praying for
61:54
souls we should be praying especially
61:56
for our family members
61:57
all the time declare that it's going to
62:00
make it into heaven that they'll be
62:02
repent of their sins they'll come to
62:03
know jesus christ as their savior
62:05
and be a testimony to what he gave
62:08
himself for
62:09
it's the most important thing you can do
62:10
for any family member that's on the
62:12
earth with you right now
62:15
wow kat that's amazing well listen
62:17

on earth like this
62:36
cup that says i don't do demons
62:41
now this cup doesn't judge anybody
62:44

62:45
probably that means you're not a part of
62:47
hell you're not
62:48
into sin you're not participating with
62:50
the enemy's plans
62:52

you just talked about the steve schultz
64:37
thing
64:38
and i will say this kim clement was one
64:41
of the best prophets that ever lived on
64:43
the face of the earth i will agree with
64:44
you
64:45
i got to hear him several times he was
64:47
so right on
64:48
uh with the words he gave and some of
64:51
them are still coming to pass when a
64:52
prophet speaks
64:54
it could be for that day the next day
64:56
five years 50 years 100 years down the
64:58
road
64:59
so when a prophet says God has said this
65:02
is going to
65:03
happen and they don't give you a date
65:06
don't stick a date on there
65:08
don't give God a time when you think he
65:10
needs to do it
65:11
like what we're about to experience
65:13
because he didn't do things on certain
65:15
dates
65:16
you thought man was going to do
65:18
something
65:19
that doesn't mean God's not going to do
65:21
it in his
65:22
own time that's so good and that's a
65:25
good instruction
65:26
that is really really good all right
65:28

02:29
the people are at a peak of excitement
02:32

02:33
they are so excited about things that
02:35
are going on right now
02:37
uh concerning the election so we can
02:40
start with that
02:40
if you want to we'll start there in just
02:43
a second and cancel
02:44
her focus is a little suck but that's
02:47
because of the connections a little bit
02:48
uh
02:49
the connection's a little bit soft right
02:51
now but you feel bear with us we're i
02:53
think we're just fine to go ahead so
02:55
Kat you do have some things to say about
02:57
the election and i just
02:59
we didn't we didn't debrief i don't know
03:01
you did say you had some interesting
03:03
things to say
03:04
i don't know which things you're allowed
03:06
to say so without further ado before we
03:08
get into the
03:09
the heaven questions tell us what you'd
03:11
like to tell us about the elections
03:13
okay let me find one of the things i
03:15
know that i have to say
03:16
i did make some notes so that's going to
03:19
help everybody
03:22
there's quite a few things going on and
03:24
i first of all want to talk about the
03:25
speech i hope you got to see
03:28
president trump's speech at the cpac
03:31
and it was so powerful and i know hey he
03:34
was an hour late
03:35
i understand that
03:39
no one cared everyone was say celebrated
03:42
from the time they got in that place
03:44
i wasn't there i was up in virginia i
03:46
actually didn't get to watch it till
03:48
like 10
03:48
something at night because i was
03:50
speaking myself
03:52
but i can tell you what the the energy
03:54
level and the excitement
03:55
and the love level for our president was
03:58
out of this was out of the building and
04:01
they had people outside the building
04:03
wish they could get in
04:04
but they had you know they had to meet
04:06
their quota and not go beyond that
04:08
but the people who were there were so
04:10
excited it had been about a month
04:12
since uh they had heard anything from
04:14
president trump
04:16
and i'm just going to keep calling him
04:17
that because you know he is still
04:19
and anyway the words he spoke were so
04:22
powerful
04:23
people were hoping he'd say a little bit
04:25
more and he kind of left everybody
04:27
hanging but there's a reason
04:28
for that i know we always say he's got
04:31
his trump cards which are hilarious
04:33
to even say that but he does and so
04:36
things are going on
04:37
um i can just i can say this arrests are
04:40
being made
04:41
around the world not just here i mean
04:44
you'll be so shocked
04:45
too surprised i can't give names but i
04:47
can say literally they have been certain
04:49
to be made
04:50
concerning with people you know that
04:53
they
04:54
they conspire to interfere with the
04:56
elections and these are people
04:57
overseas leaders overseas
05:01
knew what they were doing didn't care
05:04
some were paid some were not paid
05:06
but they have been see that's i think i
05:08
i can kind of say i haven't hear trump
05:10
say this
05:11
but i know part of the plan is to get as
05:13
many arrested overseas before he starts
05:15
here
05:16
and so i think that's going to bring
05:17
some as it leaks out people are going to
05:19
get more and more excited that hey
05:21
evil is evil no matter where it is and
05:23
then even
05:24
spider to overthrow our country these
05:26
are the terms they're using
05:28
i know in indictments that have already
05:30
been typed
05:31
the terms are this treason insurrection
05:35
conspiracy to overthrow the country of
05:38
america
05:39
conspiracy to overthrow the presidency
05:41
conspiracy to con
05:43
collude and lie with the elections
05:47
so those are the indictments they're
05:49
very severe
05:50
some are federal offenses and the
05:52
treason actually is a
05:54
very very serious that anybody could
05:57
would conspire
05:58
to and i think the arrest that was just
06:00
made
06:01
in italy i will tell you it was in italy
06:03
where it was made because it's already
06:05
leaking out places
06:07
uh i think that was for conspiracy to
06:09
overthrow
06:10
the results of the election so it is
06:12
very serious
06:14
and i will say this that land side that
06:16
God promised on november the 4th he
06:19
didn't give any dates
06:20
he just said it would happen and uh
06:22
there are people out there saying boy
06:24
the cascading of the landslide is is
06:27
actually beginning to start so i can say
06:30
that the other thing i can say is
06:32
that the father has never changed what
06:34
he said to me
06:35
about what would happen what he said to
06:37
me on november the 4th he is still
06:39
saying those things
06:40
so what God wants God gets in this time
06:43
and so many people have prayed and i
06:45
want to thank you for your prayers
06:46
because
06:47
while other people are saying nothing's
06:50
happening because we prayed wrong
06:52
and say that very boldly
06:56
you prayed powerfully the body is going
06:59
to come together to pray on behalf of
07:01
our country
07:02
the freedom of our country our president
07:05
who we actually know actually did
07:07
win the election and those results have
07:10
already been collected
07:11
they have so much evidence i don't know
07:13
how they'd ever present it won't be
07:14
presented in the civil courts probably
07:17
at least not that part i will say this
07:19
what will be presented
07:21
in the civil courts and actually already
07:23
has
07:24
the the first lawsuit has been launched
07:27
uh
07:27
from a county that um that they are
07:31
not withholding the oath of the office
07:33
whether it was governor mayor i'm not
07:35
sure who that was for
07:36
they've already launched our lawsuit
07:39
against
07:40
the things being said by the person
07:43
behind the barbed wire
07:44
who's making their own laws without
07:46
going through the legal course
07:48
there's actually a legal proceeding that
07:50
must take place
07:52
even trump had to do that when trump
07:54
made laws to present
07:57
they had to go through councils it had
07:58
to be approved by different places and
08:00
different people
08:01
well the person behind the barbed wire
08:03
the b person
08:04
uh never did that so what do you mean
08:09
you can't make laws like a dictator and
08:11
that's exactly what's been going on
08:13
okay let me just interject sorry to
08:15
interrupt for people that don't know
08:17
cannot see me i can see her but she
08:19
cannot see me so
08:21
uh our apologies when i sometimes
08:23
interrupt but uh
08:25
when you're talking in code so when you
08:28
say the person behind the barbed wire
08:30
this is someone within the beltway
08:34
or in washington dc who is in that
08:37
inside part behind the barbed wire is
08:39
that what you mean
08:40
i'm talking about those who are in the
08:42
capitol building who have
08:44
have put themselves there uh
08:47
actually illegally no one is allowed to
08:50
withhold
08:51
our public buildings like
08:54
the capitol building like uh the supreme
08:56
court all those places that are for
08:59
us we the people who you know those who
09:01
are in
09:02
office even in the fake office right now
09:05
they're supposed to
09:06
serve the people they're serving
09:08
themselves
09:09
and they're doing it any way they feel
09:10
like it and some of these laws that are
09:13
being made
09:13
like all the terrorists can come in for
09:15
free we're going to start to tear down
09:17
the wall that was built for our safety
09:20
and all kinds of illegal things that are
09:22
against our constitution
09:24
against the wish of the people they're
09:26
causing harm
09:27
to our actual country their cell those
09:30
are
09:31
real legal reasons to put forth lawsuits
09:35
and that is one of the lawsuits it's
09:36
already been put forth i'm trying to
09:37
remember
09:38
which state that was or which county
09:40
that was but it's already that's already
09:42
been made public
09:43
that they're suing the top people
09:47
that have put themselves in an office
09:49
that they didn't earn because they lost
09:51
the election
09:52
those people are being sued because
09:54
they're making illegal laws
09:56
that they think that they can force us
09:58
to have to operate by but we don't have
10:00
to
10:01
because they're against their their what
10:03
they're doing is they're conspiring
10:05
to cause harm to our country by letting
10:08
in terrorists with no
10:10
checks on them uh by doing away with our
10:13
law enforcement which causes harm
10:16
could cause harm to us anything that
10:18
anyone does that
10:19
is is reason number one to kick them out
10:21
of the office
10:23
and to cause them that they're going to
10:24
be sued right now they're actually being
10:26
sued
10:27
uh the ones behind the barbed wire the
10:29
one who calls them our top people that
10:31
are not
10:32
uh they're being sued because they're
10:33
making ill legal laws without going
10:36
through the process of having them
10:38
approved
10:39
you can't do that they're acting like
10:41
they're dictators
10:42
and that isn't gonna work in america and
10:45
so successfully
10:47
in a county court they have allowed this
10:50
one
10:51
organization saying that we don't have
10:54
to abide by the laws being made they're
10:55
illegal according to the constitution
10:58
they're supposed to uphold our rights
11:00
and to protect our country and they are
11:02
not doing that
11:04
so they are now therefore being sued for
11:06
those
11:07
those laws that they think they can make
11:10
without proper procedures that i can say
11:12
that's already been made public like i
11:14
said
11:14
i think in front of me i tell you where
11:16
that was but there's also
11:18
been a lawsuit made against the illegal
11:21
laws
11:22
with no one checking no one having a
11:25
proper say about that
11:26
they cannot do that in america we're not
11:29
a third world country they can't just
11:31
make any
11:31
law they want to and make it happen if
11:34
it's illegal comes against our own
11:35
rights
11:36
as citizens according to the
11:37
constitution if it actually causes harm
11:40
or detriment
11:41
to our country that they could face
11:43
because of them being made
11:45
those are illegal and they cannot even
11:47
enforce them so that is good news that
11:49
that is actually happening
11:50
right now and the other one of course is
11:53
it's already leaked out
11:54
the indictments i just told you that
11:56
there the things that they will be
11:59
uh these people who have been making
12:01
illegal things
12:02
who helped overthrow the elections it's
12:04
all
12:05
the evidence is all there and it's being
12:07
done i might as well just say this
12:09
not through the civil civil courts they
12:12
rejected it which that also was illegal
12:14
and i think whoever
12:16
did that is probably also being sued
12:18
also at this moment
12:20
you cannot reject something that you
12:22
have the evidence for when it concerns a
12:25
federal crime messing with the elections
12:29
that is a federal offense and uh so
12:32
those who were
12:33
involved in that they're they're they're
12:35
having their indictments made out right
12:37
now and i already told you what they
12:38
were
12:39
treason insurrection they are conspiring
12:42
to overthrow
12:43
the country of america conspiring to
12:45
overthrow the presidency conspiring to
12:47
steal an
12:48
election and like i said there's some
12:50
people in italy you've already been
12:52
arrested for that
12:53
that's already been leaked out there so
12:55
it's already out there you may or may
12:57
not have heard about that but you will
12:59
and then the other indictments that were
13:01
actually made
13:02
signed and sealed and when they're
13:05
signed and sealed
13:07
they cannot be changed the evidence has
13:09
been presented
13:10
for these indictments to be made those
13:12
people are about to be arrested
13:14
and i will not give names i will tell
13:16
you that some of them has to do with the
13:18
courts
13:19
and there's already been one person's
13:20
name i'm sure if you search online
13:22
somewhere
13:23
you're gonna find that person's name uh
13:26
their indictment was already sealed and
13:27
ready to be presented that's already
13:29
linked up but that won't stop it from
13:30
happening
13:31
so that that thing that you've been
13:33
waiting on the action to start it has
13:36
actually started
13:38
yeah so everybody should be in a place
13:40
so we should be celebrating
13:42
okay this is not free uh we want a
13:45
country free
13:46
liberty justice and freedom in our
13:48
country and you cannot force
13:50
a free people to be dragged into
13:54
socialism or communism we didn't vote
13:56
for that that's not in any of our
13:57
constitutional papers
13:58
they don't have the right so don't let
14:01
fear uh don't let fear be in your life
14:03
you should all be very excited right now
14:05
these things are literally happening and
14:07
i'm sure as soon as those last
14:09
indictments are sealed signed and sealed
14:13
you'll hear a different message coming
14:14
from trump and uh he's about to play his
14:17
trump card that's what everybody who is
14:19
on the inside
14:20
calls that so yes our lives are about to
14:23
begin to change
14:24
for the good and the better and i also
14:28

16:34
he was told to do
16:36
i was to be here the center of america
16:39
at the close of one day and to the start
16:41
of another and was given the
16:43
to blow the rams horn seven times
16:46
that walls would fall and high towers
16:49
and platforms would be
16:50
destroyed and then the word of the God
16:53
the word of the lord came to him
16:55
the holy spirit said to him the sunlight
16:58
had set for them
17:00
the wicked attempting to overthrow our
17:02
country
17:04
and those in agreement with them uh the
17:06
sun has set
17:07
on their time and then he the holy
17:09
spirit stated it's not by chance that
17:12
saturday night was a full moon
17:13
for what's left is a lesser light
17:17
that's decreasing night by night
17:20
until the new beginnings so they have a
17:22
very short
17:23
decreasing time to come forward and
17:26
either repent or confess
17:28
that is from a prophet not known by
17:30
people very accurate prophet
17:32
and that is the word he got standing in
17:35
the middle of
17:36
making decorations uh for God himself
17:40
and some people are saying or have said
17:43
and they write in and they say
17:45
um okay God's telling you just ask Kat
17:48
they'll say this is not one person but
17:51
many
17:51
okay so when is it they'll say when is
17:54
it and
17:55
and the reality is God doesn't do that
17:57
God doesn't get us gather his prophets
17:59
and say on this day at this time i'm
18:01
coming
18:02
he tells the prophets what he's going to
18:04
do he
18:05
almost ne and he may say it's getting
18:07
close and then he'll show
18:09
signs he'll say you'll see this as a
18:11
sign but
18:12
he just doesn't do dates does he
18:17
no God is not man and i think the thing
18:19
that has probably
18:21
uh affected people the most was they all
18:23
thought in their head
18:25
on these dates set by man the election
18:29
you know the electoral vote the
18:31
recounting of votes
18:32
uh even the inauguration they had never
18:35
had that
18:36
even some profits if it didn't happen by
18:39
these dates
18:40
it wasn't going to happen at all but i
18:41
won't remind you
18:43
two things the father just spoke to me
18:45
number one noah
18:47
okay he didn't give noah a date when the
18:50
ark would be finished he said you will
18:51
finish the ark
18:53
the reigns will come and i will save you
18:55
and your family because there's
18:57
none others on the earth that are
19:00
righteous
19:01
how about that people let me tell you
19:03
it's not as bad as it was about a noah's
19:05
day
19:06
because God's going to rescue a lot more
19:07
than eight eight of us
19:09
okay so days aren't that bad
19:13
but i won't say this some of the same
19:15
evil
19:16
demonic beings and those wicked places
19:19
spirits and wicked places
19:20
were involved in the days of noah uh and
19:24
they can't destroy our country
19:26
this is God's time he has other events
19:28
planned but what he did and he did say
19:30
what would happen he clearly talked
19:32
about what would happen
19:33
he clearly talked about his own plans
19:35
that he would not change his plans and
19:38
God was right
19:39
trump won the election there's no way
19:41
anyone can get around saying that pretty
19:43
soon
19:44
everyone out there will see the hard
19:48
very visible evidence that he did win
19:51
God's going to make sure everybody knows
19:53
trump won and they will have to announce
19:56
that he won so you wait and see that'll
19:58
happen the landslide of fraud will be so
20:00
deep and so vile people will be shocked
20:04
to see who was involved in all of that
20:06
stuff
20:07
and let me tell you justice will be
20:09
given because he also said that would
20:11
happen
20:12
and so he didn't give me a day i'm
20:14
standing on what God has said
20:16
and when God is ready and whenever needs
20:19
to be done
20:20
so trump can be ready you will hear
20:23
and see all of the evidence but this
20:26
country
20:27
is free will remain free it has a
20:30
powerful destiny as does
20:32
other countries because you have to
20:33
understand not only is God
20:35
setting people free here he's literally
20:37
going around the world
20:39
and removing wicked girls who've been
20:42
wicked for probably
20:43
probably generations of time abusing
20:46
their people
20:47
taking advantage of them and God is done
20:49
with that right now he's not going to
20:51
wipe all evil off the earth because we
20:52
still have things that are that haven't
20:54
happened yet
20:55
but these are greater days than ever
20:57
before
20:58
for us and for many other countries in
21:01
the world who also
21:02
run into the streets and celebrate so
21:04
you need to understand
21:06
God is not just winding it up he's going
21:09
to shoot
21:10
and show off exactly what he said and
21:12
make sure you understand clearly
21:14
what he said will happen
21:18
and God does plan things by events
21:21
on his own timeline and you're right
21:24
steve
21:25
he doesn't have to live or operate by
21:27
man's time
21:28
or their dates they have set but when he
21:31
made a promise
21:32
he's keeping that promise that's good
21:35
and you know one last thing and we'll
21:37
get into the heaven things but
21:38
um people have said and i've seen other
21:43
it on youtube and saying okay um
21:47
God can use anything he can use a rock
21:49
okay
21:50
God can use anything he wants but the
21:53
argument continues since
21:55
since biden got in by
21:58
hooker crook mainly crook all only crook
22:02
therefore God we must pray for him
22:06
and bless him so that God can use him
22:10
talk about it i will go back to the
22:12
scriptures as God always takes me the
22:14
scriptures and he actually showed me
22:15
this himself
22:16
no he said pray this is what the bible
22:19
says pray
22:20
for those in authority well they have no
22:23
authority
22:24
when you cheat you don't have authority
22:27
trust me in the olympics if they cheat
22:29
they have no authority they don't get
22:32
medals they don't get rewarded
22:34
they don't get honored they get kicked
22:36
out
22:37
when you cheat that puts that whole
22:39
thing in a different category we pray
22:41
for those in authority
22:42
the ones in authority would be trump
22:44
okay would be those of his
22:46
administration who
22:47
are still there with him and the
22:49
governors right the governors who are
22:51
ruling
22:52
when righteousness and not part of the
22:54
cheating and stealing
22:56
uh but those in the in the in the
22:59
capitol building who are calling
23:00
themselves
23:01
they're giving themselves titles they
23:03
have no right and this is what the
23:05
father says they have no power in
23:08
america they are not
23:09
in authority in america right now so no
23:11
the only thing you can pray is they
23:13
might get mercy
23:14
and not the death penalty wow
23:18
yeah that's big and one last thing on
23:20
you know people
23:22
the media the mainstream media does not
23:24
show this
23:26
uh now but on on inauguration day
23:30
when they went through that foe that
23:32
fake
23:33
inauguration the city
23:36
washington dc was surrounded by
23:40
barbed wire those big old circular
23:42
things i don't know where the limits
23:44
were
23:44
but you couldn't get into that place
23:46
unless you had special permission that
23:48
razor wire
23:50
and folks it's still there ask yourself
23:52
the question
23:53
if he's the duly elected president with
23:56
all the power
23:57
invested in him why is the razor wire
24:00
still up
24:01
what is he hiding from i will tell you
24:04
what he's hiding from
24:05
we the people because he's so afraid
24:08
they're all going to come and overthrow
24:09
him in their cells
24:11
i think only because of the grace of God
24:13
they aren't
24:14
because there are groups that could do
24:15
that right here in our own country
24:18
and they've all had it with the lying
24:20
with the defilement
24:22
all the things that that whole group is
24:23
involved in you're going to know not
24:25
just about the elections people
24:27
you know the other things the wicked
24:28
things they've been involved in in our
24:30
country and around the world
24:32
which will probably leave you speechless
24:34
because it's so evil
24:35
and God's not letting evil take over
24:37
this country but you're right
24:39
what are they hiding and why can't we
24:41
the people have access to the public
24:44
buildings that we all everybody in the
24:47
past paid
24:48
for those to be built that's public
24:50
property we actually have the right to
24:52
go and tour and look at them they're not
24:53
letting anybody in okay they don't want
24:55
anyone in
24:56
they don't want to know what they're
24:57
doing they don't no one who actually is
24:59
trying to give
25:00
orders some of them are coming from
25:02
overseas you're going to find out all of
25:04
this but let me tell you
25:05
if that's true then why is he riding in
25:08
a
25:08
used suv as supposed president
25:12
why does he have an old plane that they
25:14
have spray painted baby blue
25:17
why isn't he in you know air force one
25:20
why is he not in the
25:21
in the vehicle that is uh set aside for
25:24
the president to protect him
25:25
he has access to none of that he still
25:27
didn't have access to the military
25:29
why you need to ask yourself why is that
25:32
that's because these other people
25:34
including the military who are
25:37
uh when the military uh trials start
25:40
they know and have seen all the all of
25:43
the evidence
25:43
they know who's guilty they know who
25:45
doesn't really have power at all
25:47
they're going to go with where the power
25:48
has been given legally
25:51
and that's not going to change okay
25:53
they're probably hoping
25:55
they can make it last as long as they
25:57
can but there's some of their group
25:59
already realizing it's going to fail
26:02
like was said in the past also
26:04
i'm sure some people will be trying to
26:06
get out of the country when they realize
26:07
this whole thing is falling apart this
26:10
is the reason why when you do something
26:13
on a foundation of evil
26:15
and wickedness you have no foundation
26:18
no one in that group cares about one
26:20
another no one is sticking up for one
26:22
another
26:23
they all want something for themself
26:25
they're in it for their self
26:27
everyone they've colluded with paid off
26:29
or in it for their self
26:31
and that's what happens when it's evil
26:33
there is no foundation to hold you up to
26:35
surround you
26:36
there's no groups of people there doing
26:38
marches because they're so happy about
26:39
what's going on
26:41
and that's because nobody wants what is
26:43
there
26:44
we the people didn't vote for it we're
26:47
not taking it
26:48
and yes God is going to intervene along
26:51
with the true president
26:52
of the united states and you're going to
26:53
see all this come out
26:55
so that even the fake news which by the
26:57
way
26:58
i can add this this is truth some of
27:01
their licenses are in jeopardy right now
27:04
because they also colluded with those
27:07
and conspired with those
27:09
to overthrow our country by never
27:12
showing the truth and they may not like
27:15
that sleek doubt that sleeps out
27:17
everywhere
27:18
not just here but i can tell you what
27:21
they'll be
27:21
lucky if they get to keep anything and
27:24
so i can just tell you look forward to
27:26
new networks
27:27
look forward to new social media that
27:29
won't ban you
27:30
block you uh crush your dreams take
27:33
things away from you
27:35
some contracts that people had for the
27:37
businesses that was they just dumped
27:39
them
27:39
without any warning so that is wrong you
27:42
can't
27:43
have a viable business or business
27:46
contract or agreement
27:47
when you do whatever you feel like and
27:48
don't care about what happens to others
27:53
going on and these democratic governors
27:56
and
27:56
the ones who don't want real life there
27:59
they're also controlling their people
28:00
i've already met with people who are in
28:02
those
28:02
states right now they've had it with the
28:05
with the
28:05
lockdowns and the continual uh fake
28:08
stuff about
28:09
the viruses being worse they're not
28:11
worse people
28:13
a virus comes and goes that's what it
28:15
does and i can tell you things are
28:16
getting better in that but they're not
28:18
letting you know the truth about
28:19
anything so legally
28:22
we the people have a right to come forth
28:24
and say this is going to stop you don't
28:26
have the right to do this
28:27
but when it gets to the higher levels
28:30
and those indictments are made
28:32
against the social media and other
28:34
people like that
28:35
not just social media but the actual
28:38
news media have not been showing you the
28:40
truth
28:41
and when they lie it helps to promote
28:43
and continue on what's going on that's
28:45
illegal justice
28:48
is coming to this country and is coming
28:51
in
28:52
in mega waves so that's about all i have
28:54
to say today
28:55
that's good that's good that's really
28:57
good
28:58
very good well okay so now
29:01
any for those of you who may be new we
29:04
get
29:05
tens of thousands of new ones every
29:08
month kat has been to heaven as many of
29:11
our speakers and
29:12
guests have been many times God is doing
29:15
this
29:15
all over the earth i don't know how many
29:17
get to go some people like to know that
29:19
but a number of people including about
29:21
at least four of our
29:23
people i haven't taken a head count but
29:25
trust me there's a lot more
29:26
but kat has been somebody thousands of
29:28
times he said she stopped counting at a
29:30
thousand
29:31
so she comes on wednesdays and after we
29:33
do this part
29:34
then she's here to answer questions and
29:36
you guys have been bringing the
29:37
questions in
29:38
they come through about five different
29:40
ways people hit reply
29:42
people do it under youtube people do it
29:45
on facebook and so
29:47
we've been every time we get as many
29:49
questions as we can fit in so if you're
29:50
ready
29:51
i'm going to give you the next questions
29:53
and uh
29:54
except for one or two rare exceptions we
29:57
do not
29:58
be brief before the show she doesn't
30:00
know which questions are coming
30:02
some of them are light some of them are
30:05
almost funny
30:06
others are extremely serious so without
30:09
further delay i'll get into the next one
30:11
this is coming from
30:12
someone who i think she may be a minor
30:14
still close to 18
30:16
and she says if someone if you're
30:17
passionate about dog training
30:20
or animal training will you be able to
30:22
train
30:24
animals in heaven that's i'm gonna give
30:26
you two she had two
30:28
and then she's question number two is
30:29
she says do sea animals s-e-a
30:32
to see animals who live in the ocean in
30:35
heaven
30:36
have the ability to go up on land in
30:38
heaven for instance could a whale or
30:40
dolphin go up on land so those are your
30:42
two questions
30:44
those are great questions and you know
30:45
what those are new questions
30:47
i love getting new questions and usually
30:48
young people come up with the best
30:50
because their imagination is still going
30:53
strong in them
30:54
uh yes if you're an animal trainer you
30:56
will get to train
30:58
probably people's pets are all going to
31:00
be there in heaven with them
31:01
and they may still need some training
31:04
maybe to learn different things you
31:05
didn't expect to train them in but of
31:07
course
31:08
that's not going to be taken away from
31:10
you God has um
31:11
many different creatures and haven't
31:13
even some you haven't seen before
31:15
and so i'm sure but the one thing you
31:16
will have to face in training them
31:19
is they will have the ability to speak
31:22
so i hope you're ready to handle that
31:26
that the pets themselves that you'd be
31:28
training may have questions for you
31:30
which will make it a little bit humorous
31:33
and yes sea animals do not
31:35
need to be in the crystal sea to
31:38
live they can go on land they actually
31:42
have
31:42
fun places for kids to play and they
31:45
actually have
31:46
carousels where the living animals on
31:48
the carousel
31:50
go through it they're on platforms and
31:53
some of them are
31:54
sharks hey they're not going to bite you
31:56
some would be
31:57
like little baby dinosaurs or something
32:00
and then other things it may be lying
32:01
stuff but they're all alive they're not
32:03
they're not harmful in any way
32:05
but but you in heaven when you go there
32:08
you can breathe the crystal sea
32:10
you won't drown just like the animals
32:12
don't have to be in the water
32:14
to breathe and to live in heaven so
32:16
those are great questions
32:18
very good okay so this must be a parent
32:21
he's asking uh ask Kat if kids
32:25
you know i'm sure she's this is like are
32:27
they always or could some of them be
32:29
because some of my kids imaginary
32:32
friends
32:33
could they actually be angels that
32:35
they're talking to or their guardian
32:37
angel
32:39
i think if they're probably young enough
32:40
that could possibly be true
32:43
uh my angel talked to me when i was
32:45
younger of course i
32:46
was as a seer but as a senior i could
32:49
see them so
32:50
to me that was normal to see angels even
32:53
as a little child
32:54
my angel would have short conversations
32:57
with me
32:59
what would they talk with you about what
33:00
would they talk with you about what did
33:02
your guardian angel talk with you about
33:04
my guardian angel would encourage me to
33:07
to continue to know jesus christ to
33:11
pursue to know him
33:13
that he loved me that the father loved
33:15
me the holy spirit was real
33:17
they would say when i was like four they
33:20
would say things like that to me
33:22
and then they would come they would wrap
33:23
their wings around me sometimes if i
33:25
wasn't having maybe a good day maybe i
33:27
got upset you know kids get upset
33:28
sometimes they get over it quick
33:30
but they would just sit there and put
33:32
their wings around me like and uh
33:34
if i wasn't feeling good maybe or
33:36
something you know and then the presence
33:37
of God would go into me so
33:39
that is possible for any little children
33:42
i know babies see angels all the time
33:45
because if i hope when they look behind
33:46
me and stare at my angel
33:48
my own grandkids did that so to other
33:50
children your pets
33:52
also know the presence of angels too
33:55
so i think it's because their mind
33:57
hasn't gotten to the place where they
33:59
have to have
34:00
proof or they're not going to be
34:02
judgmental
34:03
they're not going to go by head
34:04
knowledge they know what they're seeing
34:06
so they will respond to that and so yes
34:09
i do know that little children uh even
34:12
my own greens but i've had other
34:13
children come up and say i saw my angel
34:15
today
34:16
you know they had orange and blue wings
34:19
and they made me laugh that's something
34:20
they do a lot they would make me laugh
34:22
they would say funny things angels also
34:25
sometimes tickle you
34:26
when you're young really all right i
34:29
i've been knocked on the shoulder by my
34:31
angel this is like a year ago or so
34:34
oh and i've seen i don't know if it's my
34:36
one guardian age or one of my guardian
34:38
angels if i have more than one
34:40
you know but i i think i told you when
34:42
you were at our house that i
34:44
a guardian angel kind of or an angel i
34:46
don't know he's my God
34:47
corrected me on something he was a bit
34:49
stern and so i
34:50
complied and i never saw him again
34:53
and then i took a trip a few months
34:55
later into france
34:56
and i shouldn't have traveled alone and
34:58
i wasn't
34:59
and i didn't know what to do i stuck in
35:01
the paris airport i didn't have a cell
35:03
phone
35:03
i think how am i going to get my friends
35:06
to know where i am
35:07
and over there was a man with a
35:09
newspaper he dropped the newspaper
35:12
and looked at me and it was him it was
35:14
the angel
35:15
that had given me a third warning it was
35:17
like he was watching a couple of minutes
35:19
later my friends
35:20
showed up is that my guardian angel or
35:22
is that
35:23
that is probably one of your guardian
35:25
angels we actually have more than one
35:27
um sometimes they need a break so we
35:30
actually do have more than one
35:32
and i can tell you when you get a little
35:33
bit older sometimes you do get
35:35
corruption that thing on the shoulder i
35:36
have felt that many times sometimes i've
35:38
even seen my angel walk by and just
35:40
touch my shoulder
35:42
and i would just say well what is it and
35:44
even either he would say something or
35:45
holy spirit would say something to me
35:47
even the father has come to the room and
35:50
he actually just
35:50
brushed my shoulder and said don't
35:52
tolerate or participate anymore with
35:54
things in your life
35:55
uh what he meant was don't think this is
35:58
before all this stuff started i still
36:00
would see them i mean i saw them most of
36:01
my life
36:02
i don't participate with what the enemy
36:05
is saying
36:05
make sure you cast it down uh don't be a
36:08
part and whatever you do don't help him
36:10
advertise he said that to me directly
36:12
don't help hell advertise by talking
36:14
about things that are
36:15
not right or things like that all the
36:17
time so
36:18
i think that's the thing they do i think
36:20
messenger angels you could have seen had
36:22
you not seen the same one twice
36:24
the fact that you saw him twice in
36:26
different places that tells me he
36:27
probably is one of your guardian angels
36:30
but there are messengers sometimes just
36:32
sent to give us a message or a word
36:34
from God and they'll do it once and then
36:36
leave and then you won't see them again
36:37
but
36:38
you're seeing your guardian ninja yeah
36:40
that's fascinating
36:42
you know it scared me the first time
36:43
because he was stern
36:45
he said i wasn't doing something right
36:46
and so i started doing it right
36:49
so actually when i saw him the second
36:50
time it was good to have a stern angel
36:53
there because i knew he's going to take
36:55
care of business
36:56
which means there's another view there's
36:58
a i don't know there's a follow-up from
37:00
the same person or not
37:02
is it okay to talk to our guardian
37:05
angels now you said as a kid
37:07
but i'm let's say i'm walking around and
37:09
i know my guardian angels around
37:11
can i say you know i i it's not a joke
37:14
i've named my angel stan since he's not
37:17
telling me what his name is
37:18
is it okay if i say hey stan i'm glad
37:20
you're here
37:21
hey can i ask you a question blah blah
37:24
blah or are all those supposed to be
37:25
directed only to the lord okay that you
37:27
can ask a question if they have
37:29
permission they'll answer if they don't
37:30
have permission they won't answer it
37:33
but i i know actually other people that
37:35
don't know their angel's name
37:37
and they give them nicknames it's always
37:39
okay to say
37:40
because i do it on a continual basis i
37:43
do know my angel's name and i'll say hey
37:45
and i'll say
37:46
i'll say his name i say thanks for being
37:48
there for me
37:49
thanks for saving my life which she's
37:51
done several times
37:53
uh thank you for putting up with me if i
37:55
don't know what that
37:56
was right uh maybe i say things not
37:58
exactly
38:00
i'm not talking about words from God i'm
38:01
talking about just in my normal life
38:03
maybe i'm not happy with somebody i say
38:05
something not mean to them just say
38:06
something maybe not the best thing
38:09
and then i'll actually realize my angels
38:11
hearing everything i'm saying and
38:12
watching me
38:13
and i'll say i'm sorry i said that and
38:15
then sometimes i'll hear like a short
38:17
laugh
38:19
if i see them that they'll roll their
38:21
eyes at me no i don't mean
38:23
not in a good way they're kind of like
38:25
you know hey
38:28
so i would tell people there's coming
38:30
days on the earth
38:32
where because the the veil from the
38:34
spirit around the physical realm is
38:36
actually getting
38:37
thinner and the enemy will get away with
38:40
less things because people actually be
38:42
seeing operations the enemy this may be
38:44
several generations down the road but i
38:46
do know it's going to happen
38:47
but will begin to happen in that time
38:49
people will see
38:50
their angels and i'm sure it'll be up to
38:53
God how much conversation we can have
38:55
the bible says do not worship an angel
38:58
right and i think people from the past
39:01
because that was always passed on down
39:03
don't talk to one you can't talk someone
39:05
they have nothing to do with them
39:06
but i happen to know in the bible in the
39:08
old testament in new testament
39:10
uh people in the bible had conversations
39:12
with them and abraham
39:14
even ate with them and i think other
39:16
ones isaiah and ezekiel knows they had
39:18
conversations with angels if they were
39:20
sent from God
39:21
and they were a scribe or a career or a
39:23
messenger
39:25
then you know you will know that usually
39:27
if that happens
39:29
but we're entering into new times of
39:31
greater glory
39:32
in the power of God being seen angels
39:34
working alongside us is actually going
39:36
to be happening
39:37
and so you may end up by knowing your
39:39
angel's name
39:40
and i always say i say it's up to the
39:43
father he made them
39:44
right he made them sent us from himself
39:47
so it's kind of
39:48
up to him and i think that his choices
39:51
are always better
39:52
than ours just look forward to new
39:54
things happening that haven't happened
39:56
before
39:56
that's really good now that that's this
39:59
reminds me of a question that i
40:01
once in a while have asked no i actually
40:03
i've never i remember the question
40:05
i remember you saying something so don't
40:07
let me just jump in here years ago
40:10
i heard you say that when we get to
40:12
heaven our angels have some questions
40:14
for us do you remember saying that
40:16
and what kind of person what kind of
40:19
questions do they want to ask
40:21
us you got me really curious about it i
40:23
never asked you one of the questions
40:24
they will ask you is what were you
40:26
thinking when you did that
40:30
that's what i figured they'd probably
40:31
have women have such
40:33
amazing senses of humor
40:36
and remember now they were with you if
40:39
it was your garden
40:39
they've been with you since uh actually
40:41
since the time of conception they're
40:43
there they're sent
40:44
then they wait outside the mother so the
40:46
minute you're born that's it their
40:47
assignment starts
40:49
they will be with you your whole life
40:52
they
40:52
are probably some of the first ones
40:54
you'll see when this body dies and your
40:56
spirit man steps out the probably the
40:58
first one you'll see will be your
40:59
guardian angel and they'll be going like
41:00
this come on we gotta go
41:02
i've been there when people were leaving
41:04
come on no it's okay
41:06
it's okay we gotta go and you're undone
41:09
that you're seeing and i
41:11
never forget the time that somebody was
41:13
a comedian this guy was a comedian
41:15
and everybody loved him but he always
41:18
got kind of picked on
41:20
he was a young budding comedian actually
41:23
in our church
41:24
and he would always wear this clown nose
41:26
just to make people smile
41:28
you know some of the other people didn't
41:31
like it i thought it was not in the
41:32
right place to do it
41:34
his job was to make people smile laugh
41:36
and i have to tell you this
41:38
that i was not in the room when he
41:40
passed he became ill
41:42
people loved this person in our church
41:44
and that he was still
41:46
young not real young maybe in his teens
41:48
by this time
41:50
and uh i wasn't there but God allowed me
41:52
to go
41:53
into his room in the spirit and see him
41:56
when he was passing and he started to
41:58
pass
41:59
and his little clown nose was next to
42:01
him because he loved he kept it with him
42:02
all the time even i think it was in icu
42:04
or something
42:05
and when he began to come out of his
42:07
body he wasn't sure so he kind of
42:09
hesitated
42:10
and his angel was there he couldn't see
42:12
he didn't look up to look at his angels
42:14
he was tall
42:15
and he could see his anger going no come
42:17
on it's time to go it's going to be okay
42:19
come on you got to come
42:20
and find me he kind of sat up in his
42:22
body which
42:24
you know it died and he looks up
42:27
and there is his own guardian angel
42:30
wearing
42:30
our clown nose
42:35
this is truth this really happened the
42:38
biggest
42:38
grin came over this young man and
42:41
although his physical remember now
42:44
this angel's a spiritual being his his
42:46
clown knows it's the spiritual clown
42:48
noise
42:48
and he opens his hand to the young man
42:51
the other hand
42:52
and in it was a clown nose for him to
42:54
wear
42:55
and he grabbed it and put it on his nose
42:57
and they left in a chariot
42:59
to go up to heaven and there they were
43:01
together in the chair there was this
43:02
guardian angel wearing the clown nose
43:04
and there was he
43:04
that totally threw any apprehensions out
43:08
that's amazing there's his angel and i
43:11
was able to tell his parents that they
43:13
were so undone
43:15
that God allowed me to see that but
43:17
that's the relationship
43:19
they really become attached to you and
43:21
so
43:22
they're they're grateful to God when
43:24
they actually can take you home to
43:25
heaven
43:26
and so here's this young man not knowing
43:29
what to think that he knew that he was
43:31
dying he knew it
43:32
but when he decided to finally sit up he
43:34
looks up and there's his angel
43:35
wearing that clown so i mean if he goes
43:38
to heaven he
43:40
shows up wearing the clown nose
43:43
might he have greeted the lord with that
43:45
clown nose on
43:48
oh yes i wouldn't be surprised if jesus
43:50
had one on himself either because jesus
43:54
i will tell you what he's doing in
43:55
heaven because God did let me see more
43:57
about that
43:58
he also was one of the camera people in
44:01
our church he did mostly all the taping
44:03
of people
44:04
and he always made them feel at ease
44:06
he'd wear his clown nose
44:08
and so he was always on this the other
44:10
side of the camera you know operating it
44:12
in heaven he has a comedy show
44:15
and he does his comedy jokes he was so
44:17
funny so now he's not
44:20
operating the camera he's the person
44:22
doing the show
44:24
and that was lord to God that even in
44:26
all his life even when he went feeling
44:27
well he still tried his best to make
44:29
people laugh and smile so
44:31
he didn't miss his destiny so he's doing
44:34
a funny show in heaven right now uh
44:37
wearing his clown knows that his angel
44:39
gave him
44:40
so and one more because this is just
44:42
generating more questions for me
44:44
so there's clown shows he's not the only
44:47
one there must be all these places that
44:48
do
44:49
funny shows so are you saying
44:52
that a person who's gifting an anointing
44:55
on earth was a comedian and
44:56
comedy are they going to come up with
44:59
with humor that's going to make the lord
45:01
bust a gut if i can put it that way
45:03
that's going to make the lord bust up
45:04
laughing
45:06
absolutely because i tell you what jesus
45:09
laughed a whole lot more than he ever
45:11
cried on the earth he laughed he made
45:13
people laugh
45:15
he was captivating i mean if the sinners
45:17
want to be around you you got to be
45:19
pretty good right
45:20
so he would captivate them with i'm sure
45:22
with um
45:23
revelation they never heard it before
45:25
but he also made them laugh
45:27
jesus loves to laugh and i'm sure that
45:30
he visits these places that people have
45:32
as part of his mansion this young man is
45:34
part of his mansion
45:36
has his whole place where he does his
45:37
show everyone comes to see
45:39
and they laugh and laugh and laugh and
45:42
yeah you're gonna laugh in heaven but
45:44
there's many places like that
45:46
that's a gift now you have to understand
45:48
some people well their natural mind will
45:49
go to the other side
45:51
there's nothing indecent there's no
45:53
profanity
45:54
there's nothing disgusting ever said
45:56
anywhere in heaven not in the comedy
45:58
shows
45:59
not in any of the songs or the concerts
46:01
you go to
46:02
uh not and anywhere in the amusement
46:04
park or anything like that
46:06
that part of the devil is not there
46:09
there's no darkness there
46:11
so everything you have and enjoy the
46:12
movies they create will never have
46:14
profanity or sexual content
46:16
or graphic violence in them but exciting
46:19
intense
46:20
funny amazing that's what's in heaven so
46:23
all those comedy shows
46:24
would be on that line not what most
46:26
people do
46:28
so good well we've got a few more
46:29
minutes here um what role do the people
46:32
in the bible have in heaven like moses
46:34
paul peter these guys are like serious
46:37
characters
46:38
so maybe we're going to the other side
46:40
of the serious sober
46:42
profound what do they they do what do
46:45
they do in heaven
46:47
well i can let you know they've been
46:48
there for quite a while
46:49
[Laughter]
46:51
the heaven culture which is joy
46:53
celebration uh profound
46:56
and laughter half of all of heaven
46:59
is fun i have learned that the father
47:02
told me that i've been to so many places
47:04
profound beautiful
47:06
just so undone with the beauty and
47:09
splendor
47:10
that like in the throne room or other
47:11
places in heaven the
47:13
all that is there you get that too but
47:16
there's other places to go where you
47:17
just
47:17
laughed you just want to fall over
47:19
things are so funny
47:21
or fun either way they're there
47:24
and so i i can promise you that
47:27
everyone's going to enjoy even paul
47:29
now i've seen paul many times he's
47:32
always in the same garden i'm sure that
47:34
garden is outside his mansion
47:36
and he's sitting in different places and
47:38
people are all around
47:39
asking him they're always asking him
47:42
questions about what it was like to be
47:43
on the earth
47:44
what happened in these certain
47:46
situations like when he was cast into
47:47
the sea you know all these things that
47:49
happened to him
47:50
they asked him those things but you have
47:52
to understand
47:53
since they got to heaven and that would
47:56
include
47:56
anybody abraham moses noah paul the
47:59
disciples
48:00
they have understood and been shown what
48:02
was going on in the spirit realm
48:05
all around them in their life so they
48:07
have more to
48:08
add than just what they saw with their
48:10
eyes or experience
48:12
their stories they share that's what
48:14
they talk about a lot
48:16
powerful things that God did for them
48:18
what was going on like you know when
48:20
they were ready to cross the red sea
48:22
what was happening in the heavenlies
48:23
what was happening in the spirit realm
48:25
you see a whole new picture
48:27
of that whole red sea experience the
48:29
same thing with with abraham the same
48:31
thing with moses
48:32
they got to see all these activities
48:34
that are now part of them
48:36
sharing their testimonies so a lot of
48:38
them that's what they do
48:39
and paul actually still makes beautiful
48:42
things with fabrics because that was a
48:44
natural gift he was given he makes
48:46
banners he makes
48:47
beautiful things to hang in your mansion
48:50
uh that was
48:51
what did you say he made he makes what
48:53
he makes what
48:55
paul was a tent maker yeah what did he
48:57
make you said he makes
48:59
something else
49:10
yeah people like in the church right now
49:12
they have flags and they'll wave them to
49:14
the glory of God
49:16
well in heaven whatever you create on
49:18
that banner comes to life
49:20
let's say paul who's such an artisan
49:23
with fabrics and
49:24
and and colors he was on the earth and
49:27
he was part of a group that did that
49:29
so in heaven you can go visit this
49:31
mansion and order certain things to be
49:33
made that you've always wanted
49:35
even like robes to wear and stuff like
49:36
that and he is such an
49:38
amazing artisan with fabric he'll make
49:40
some things on purpose that people come
49:42
and say i want a new flag
49:44
we're going to all worship in the throne
49:45
room together me and my friends so we
49:47
would like to have beautiful flags like
49:48
with lions on them roaring
49:50
or eagles and when they start to run in
49:53
the throne
49:53
the lion's head comes off the flag and
49:55
begins to roar
49:58
wow flying off the flag fly around the
50:02
fly back under the flag
50:04
it's heaven it's heaven and so everyone
50:07
even they were on the earth if they had
50:08
a
50:09
natural thing they did as a living
50:11
besides being a disciple or a prophet or
50:14
something
50:15
that is a natural gift and God doesn't
50:17
take that that gift from yourself
50:19
amazing that's right now i uh
50:23
a question popped into my head i'm gonna
50:25
ask this one and one more
50:27
my my questions go forever so i assume
50:30
in my head
50:33
so um someone goes to a
50:37
comedy show let's say they go see robin
50:39
williams because you've seen robin
50:40
williams in heaven
50:42
yeah and let's look at his mention and
50:44
let's say three or four friends said
50:46
let's go see robin at his place and
50:48
watch one of the shows okay
50:50
so they go to see it it's hilarious they
50:52
split the gut they're laughing and
50:54
laughing
50:55
okay now afterwards do those fork
50:58
would those four maybe say that was a
51:01
great show let's us
51:02
four go out to eat
51:06
absolutely yes the biggest thing they do
51:08
in heaven of course is worship
51:11
even greater than what we thought on the
51:12
earth i don't we don't have time for it
51:14
to be going to all the forms of worship
51:16
people do in heaven
51:17
the second most thing done the most
51:20
is fellowshipping and you absolutely
51:24
would be welcome to go out either robin
51:26
williams would make stuff in his own
51:28
place
51:28
for you to just stay there and
51:29
fellowship or there's favorite places
51:32
because people guess what have gifts
51:34
there's people who are chefs who are
51:36
bakers they have amazing
51:38
bakeries and stuff all over heaven none
51:40
of it costs anything
51:42
and yes a lot of them have their
51:43
favorite place and robin would say to
51:46
these people especially if they just got
51:47
there i got a favorite place they go
51:49
come on they'll make room
51:50
for us really really yes
51:53
and then you would get to go and talk
51:54
with him and get to know more of him
51:57
uh where he will have no more fear he
51:59
robin williams and most comedians
52:02
need to be aware of this the enemy will
52:03
hit you with depression don't keep that
52:05
depression you lose that depression or
52:07
oppression
52:08
lose it from your soul because he
52:10
actually
52:11
would go to retreats and stuff like that
52:13
to get help with that with that in his
52:15
life but
52:16
he's free now and he doesn't have any
52:18
now but the enemy
52:20
hates laughter and anyone who helps to
52:23
produce that he's going to try to
52:25
to get them pulled off the track or keep
52:26
them oppressed
52:28
and i know several other comedians that
52:30
face they've even said they did
52:32
so they need to know they can be free of
52:34
any of that but he didn't have any up
52:35
there so he absolutely would invite them
52:37
to go to his own favorite restaurant
52:39
and say yeah let's go here you know they
52:41
got the best barbecue
52:43
they got the best pizza there's an
52:45
italian restaurant i love we need to go
52:47
there
52:48
and because people go home to heaven
52:49
every day and they get to use that gift
52:52
and sometimes it's a baker sometimes
52:54
it's all kinds of different things
52:56
they invite you to go and see things be
52:58
a part of things
53:00
but especially eating when there's no
53:02
weight gain no food allergies
53:04
and if you listen to people's and these
53:06
people have amazing gifts to make this
53:07
delicious food
53:09
they'll serve you with a smile they'll
53:11
have entertainment while they're there
53:13
and i like to add this just because it's
53:15
funny people get taken out all the time
53:17
they celebrate not just your birthday on
53:20
theirs they celebrate the day you or
53:22
time that you came home to heaven
53:24
really like a birthday even though they
53:27
don't keep dates they kind of know when
53:28
to happen they celebrate i say come on
53:30
we're all going to go out and celebrate
53:32
uh you know it's been a while since you
53:34
came and wanted to celebrate your
53:35
homecoming here
53:37
and they have these funny and i had to
53:39
say this in a straight church it was the
53:40
craziest thing ever this is what God
53:42
does to me
53:43
you have to tell them about the greeter
53:45
squirrels the greed greeter squirrels
53:48
and then i was caught up standing at the
53:50
platform and shown
53:52
these people celebrating somebody's uh
53:54
homecoming
53:56
and these squirrels came running in on
53:58
their table
53:59
and they had top hats and canes they
54:00
began to sing and dance to this person
54:03
you know who was celebrating them it was
54:05
absolutely the most hilarious thing i've
54:07
ever seen
54:08
and so it's different than having a
54:10
birthday card there trust me
54:11
and so they do that and i've seen them
54:14
several times in heaven
54:15
so you get to laugh and have enjoyment
54:17
even if you're eating
54:19
somebody it's not going to be normal no
54:22
matter how not at all
54:24
okay so last question i i've never heard
54:27
anyone ask this because we're not
54:29
married we don't date in heaven but you
54:32
said we're best friends with our
54:34
uh why of course that's easier in a
54:36
picture if there's only one
54:38
wife if someone's been married multiple
54:39
times that's i can't
54:41
i can't figure that one out but uh
54:44
but the question is that someone asked
54:47
me
54:47
is are couples now i don't think there
54:50
are couples
54:51
per se they said are couples able to
54:54
dance
54:55
so that's the question well i will
54:58
that'll be two different answers this is
55:00
why this is
55:01
alone because i have so much detail but
55:03
it helps to understand God wants him to
55:05
understand
55:06
with detail uh there aren't couples like
55:09
you're dating like they do down here
55:11
you will have best friends always
55:13
whether whether you were best friends on
55:15
the earth
55:16
or became best friends in heaven you you
55:19
like to spend
55:20
time with other people certain people
55:21
sometimes sometimes you were married if
55:24
you were married three times guess what
55:25
you got three best friends that's the
55:26
way it happens
55:28
there's no jealousy no coveting like you
55:30
don't have the right blah blah blah blah
55:31
they don't happen up there people so
55:33
happy to be there
55:34
but the thing about the dancing jesus
55:37
holds
55:38
these huge celebrations
55:41
in his own mansion and people go why
55:43
would jesus have one because he had to
55:45
live as a human people
55:46
he deserves it he has his own mansion
55:49
and he's got this massive ballroom
55:51
people
55:52
dress up in these amazing outfits that
55:55
he provides
55:56
and yes they dance all over in
55:59
in in his ballroom and sometimes this
56:02
couples together sometimes it's
56:04
it's sort of like the greek kind of
56:05
dances you know they do in greece all
56:07
the men gonna
56:08
lock arms and they do the little greek
56:10
thing like they sweep one they do that
56:12
right there is dancing in heaven
56:15
and you will so enjoy it's exciting it's
56:19
fun
56:19
it's beautiful so there's nothing on
56:22
this earth although you think you will
56:24
miss it
56:25
you probably won't give it a second
56:26
thought when you get up there
56:28
and and if you have family members and
56:30
friends make sure you pray for their
56:32
salvation
56:33
that they will make it to heaven and you
56:36
will do the most important thing you can
56:37
on the earth
56:38
pray and declare that your family member
56:40
will come to know jesus christ they'll
56:42
become a
56:42
they won't listen to destiny they'll
56:44
become a living testimony of the saving
56:47
power of jesus christ
56:48
whether you are aware of that now or you
56:51
see them when you get to heaven
56:52
but there's such greater more beautiful
56:55
fun things there than you could ever
56:57
imagine
56:58
and that same God who provides all that
57:01
for you
57:01
right now has his eyes on this world
57:04
he's about to change
57:06
many things for him and for other
57:09
countries in this world that people can
57:11
laugh and dance in the streets again
57:13
because God is about to crush a lot of
57:15
the plans of the enemy
57:17
that's so good that's so good kat that's
57:20
always amazing it's amazing amazing
57:22
well let me let me just drill that let
57:24
me give you give me another minute
57:26
so this person is saying uh
57:29
my husband my ex my former husband
57:32
and i are best friends in heaven we go
57:35
to the ball
57:36
that the lord has thrown i can dance
57:38
with him at the ball is that
57:40
what you're saying yes
57:44
good wow that's going to make a lot of
57:46
people
57:47
excited i think for heaven but it's no
57:50
jealousy
57:51
no impurity no
57:54
desire in the flesh i have to add all
57:56
that because people thinking
57:57
wow i'll have all these different
57:58
emotions and stuff going on
58:00
you'll have joy and excitement and
58:03
probably not much beyond that about that
58:05
is so much fun it's about joining
58:06
excitement
58:07
is not being physically attached you
58:10
don't have
58:11
physical desires okay
58:14
you have friendship desires fun you want
58:17
to have fun together
58:18
yes and if you go in a group everybody
58:20
can dance with each other at these
58:22
big events but there's none of this like
58:24
wow we need to get engaged you know we
58:26
need to get married that thought doesn't
58:28
even come to your head because everyone
58:30
there
58:31
is in love with jesus christ but you can
58:34
have friendships you can have special
58:35
friendships
58:36
people you like their company you laugh
58:38
you know friends can all go do things
58:40
together
58:41
and i know i have a huge family like 150
58:44
family members
58:47
stop counting at that like we just
58:48
stopped counting after a while about
58:50
something
58:51
and so my dad worked there probably
58:53
getting his big ranch ready for everyone
58:55
as they come up there to be welcomed
58:57
once you leave the throne room
58:59
you go to your own mansion and all of
59:01
your family and friends will be there to
59:03
celebrate with you there also
59:04
so they celebrate all over heaven heaven
59:08
is probably the chief celebrating place
59:10
there is in existence
59:12
and that's what God keeps saying not
59:14
that we're not you're not
59:16
ignorant of what's going on but you're
59:17
innocent of any of that stuff so guess
59:19
what God's
59:20
got things and the people he needs to
59:23
handle these things that are going to
59:25
happen
59:26
probably aren't things you can
59:27
physically be involved with that just
59:29
stay in prayer and keep thinking God you
59:32
have a plan we're here for your plan
59:34
and we're going to stand with you we
59:36
know that your promises are true
59:38
and that's why he keeps saying celebrate
59:41
like it's already
59:42
happening that's so so good tell people
59:45
how they can get
59:46
your tell people how they can get your
59:49
book
59:50
or books and you've got at least two
59:52
websites tell them that okay
59:54
yeah i have revealingheaven.com which is
59:57
uh
59:57
that's what the father called my book he
59:59
said to call your books revealing heaven
60:01
and i have i have two i've gotten out
60:04
there number three still in the process
60:06
it might be a while for that's done
60:08
uh revealing heaven is a really good
60:10
title for the books
60:11
that's what happens you get heaven
60:12
revealed to you places i've been to what
60:14
happened when i was there
60:16
what happened with people when i came
60:18
back and shared about their family
60:19
members i saw there
60:20
are in those books and uh so
60:23
revealinghaven.com
60:24
is a website where you can buy products
60:26
things like this i don't do demons cup
60:29
right here so yeah
60:31
that tells the devil putting up with him
60:33
and so we we
60:34
create things that represent heaven or
60:36
statements are saying in heaven
60:38
and that's revealing heaven.com you also
60:40
find out about the events there
60:42
and then Kerr.com that's k-a-t-k-e-r-r
60:46
dot com
60:47
is a spiritual platform where you can be
60:50
trained in many things how to pray for
60:52
your family
60:53
how to lose stuff from your soul to be
60:55
free from that stuff
60:56
i think it talks about heaven's army
60:58
we're going to be updating that
61:00
there's probably like 30 some interviews
61:02
that are on there from people who
61:03
interview me
61:05
and then a lot of content there's images
61:08
on there and other things that God has
61:10
to say about stuff
61:11
it is the only place now and i keep
61:13
telling people this
61:14
i don't have other places that you can
61:16
give it to me online it's
61:18
online KatKerr.com you click on the treasury
61:21
and then it shows you how you can do
61:22
that if you desire to do that
61:24
i don't ask for money in any other form
61:27
so these
61:28
fake facebooks or fake youtubes out
61:31
there
61:32
they tell you i'm asking you for money
61:34
oh this missionary needs money send it
61:36

61:37
do that those are fake places
61:40

04:15
and you can go on that it's going to be
04:17
really epic so i'm pretty
04:18
pretty excited about that so one we want
04:21
to remind you quickly that
04:23
three years ago we began developing a
04:25
purposeful
04:27
competitor to facebook where believers
04:29
can say what they want it's called zap
04:31
but there are tens of thousands already
04:32
on there
04:33
you should join it so without further
04:34
ado i'm going to play this a 60-second
04:36
commercial for you so you can see how it
04:39
goes so
04:39
go ahead and play
04:42
[Music]
05:06
[Music]
05:20
i love that commercial chapter that jeff
05:22
is our uh jeff and warren do the online
05:25
engineering jeff put that together
05:27
uh he's got some real clever ideas we're
05:29
gonna do some more clever stuff coming
05:30
up that will
05:31
you'll enjoy the different kinds of
05:32
commercials we'll run for that
05:34
but you can say what you want you can
05:37
talk about plan against planned
05:38
parenthood we're not going to
05:40
um block you you can talk about pro-life
05:42
we're not going to block you
05:44
uh so this is christian owned my wife
05:46
and i own it
05:47
it's will allow anyone on it as long as
05:50
they're respectful
05:52
but uh it's christian owned and
05:54
christian friendly so that's what we
05:56
want to emphasize there one quick word
05:58
of knowledge or actually two
06:00
the lord is giving two of you an
06:02
opportunity to ask a question to kat
06:04
live she doesn't even know that i'm
06:06
doing this but this morning in prayer
06:08
this picture came up before me so i'm
06:09
just going to tell you if this
06:11
if this uh applies to you if you're this
06:14
person
06:14
then you need to go on the eve of the
06:16
chat um
06:18
on um youtube off to the right i think
06:21
it's up to the right or on facebook
06:23
we'll be watching for you if you say i'm
06:25
that person and this is my question for
06:28
Kat
06:28
then they'll let me know by my screen so
06:30
i saw a young woman in their 20s or 30s
06:34
and you had a light blue jacket it
06:36
looked like what you'd wear on the ski
06:37
slopes
06:38
a nice light or baby blue kind of a
06:41
jacket there was a beanie cap
06:42
on i think it was a little darker color
06:45
i
06:46
i saw what i felt like was a blonde or
06:48
blondish hair
06:49
um and i also saw if that applies to you
06:54
you're either wearing that now or you
06:55
just had that on or you're getting ready
06:57
to go somewhere
06:58
like that this person also i saw
07:00
sometimes does a youtube like this
07:03
i don't know if it's your family and
07:04
friends or if it's a larger show
07:06
but if that applies to you pop in there
07:09
and say i'm that person here's my
07:10
question for Kat and we'll ask Kat today
07:12
live if you're on during the live show
07:15
if you get this in a recording we won't
07:17
be able to do that
07:18
the other one i assume is a different
07:19
person it might be the same person
07:21
is a person whose first name is lisa
07:23
spelled l-e-e-s-a
07:26
and the specific thing i heard about you
07:28
was you didn't want your location or
07:30
your last name
07:31
uh ever mentioned and that's one of the
07:33
reasons why you haven't asked a question
07:35
before the lord
07:36
knows that so say i'm that lisa don't
07:38
say my name or location here's my
07:40
question for Kat
07:40
and if one of you answers that or a
07:43
couple of you
07:44
feel like that's you they'll type it in
07:46
and i'll be able to ask Kat
07:48
all right without further ado let's
07:49
bring in kat Kerr here
07:52
here she hey kat how are you doing today
07:54
oh i'm doing great how are you
07:57
feeling so good we got a little bit late
07:59
start but that's okay
08:01
it doesn't matter if we're late it only
08:02
matters if we're on time and right on
08:04
time so
08:05
that's right Kat um i guess we'll start
08:08
we'll start like we always do the lord
08:10
gives you some stuff to say about
08:12
the climate the government the elections
08:15
trump whatever so
08:16
share your heart as long as you want and
08:18
then when you're all done with that
08:19
we'll go into questions about heaven so
08:22
the pleasure i want to go back just a
08:24
little bit
08:25
when the weather warriors were speaking
08:27
against the
08:28
three earthquakes i think they happened
08:31
somewhere off the coast of new zealand
08:33
and it was going to affect the hawaiian
08:35
islands and i think the samoan
08:37
islands i think this was not too long
08:40
ago
08:41
and one of those earthquakes within i
08:43
think six hours
08:44
three major earthquakes happened off the
08:46
coast of new zealand
08:47
one was at 8.1 and they began
08:50
they began to speak about the tsunami
08:53
that was soon to follow
08:54
they said that it would hit any or all
08:57
these islands really hard
08:59
and so we went on and did a weather
09:00
warriors um
09:02
broadcast and we have maybe 4 000
09:05
people now that are a part of that from
09:06
all over the world we all speak against
09:08
destructive weather
09:10
and we did it we were on for about 20
09:12
minutes explaining about
09:15
i think we also talked about something
09:16
that was in the indian ocean
09:18
like a cyclone or something but the
09:20
major thing was the earthquakes because
09:22
earthquakes if they're severe under the
09:25
ocean
09:25
a wave begins to form as a result of
09:29
the earth being unsettled and the plates
09:31
moving the place of the earth
09:33
it causes major tsunamis that can be
09:36
several hundred feet high
09:38
and they travel under the water and then
09:41
they'll hit that first
09:42
land mass they come to and sometimes can
09:44
wipe out like whole islands
09:45
and we begin to speak against it because
09:48
you know christ stopped the storm
09:50
um and let me tell you what it worked
09:53
when we spoke in jesus name we took
09:55
authority over the
09:56
destructive results of the earthquake
09:59
we said we would not tolerate the
10:01
tsunami it would do no damage
10:04
there wouldn't even be one there and let
10:06
me tell you people were
10:08
of course saying not nice things to us
10:10
as we were broadcasting
10:12
within two hours they had already put
10:15
warnings out to those three major places
10:18
to new zealand to the hawaiian islands
10:20
and i think the other one was the samoan
10:21
islands
10:22
but um they had already put warnings
10:25
that this was going to happen
10:26
within two hours of the broadcast they
10:29
canceled the warning to the hawaiian
10:32
islands
10:33
within two hours we were getting results
10:35
back from people in hawaii
10:37
and they said they've already canceled
10:39
the tsunami warning they can't find any
10:41
evidence of
10:42
even forming and guess what eventually
10:44
the new zealand uh
10:46
came in and said no they have minimized
10:49
what they're saying it will affect
10:51
although they were still looking for the
10:52
wave
10:53
it never came and i know the next day we
10:56
had a report
10:58
that said there was a meteorologist in
11:00
that whole area that said they they're
11:02
trying to figure it out in their head
11:04
never in the history of american
11:07
meteorology since they've been
11:08
tracking um earthquakes and tsunamis
11:11
never has that happened
11:13
that that an earthquake that major never
11:16
caused a tsunami the tsunami
11:20
so there's absolutely power in agreement
11:23
when you believe in God
11:25
that is so incredible i've i've heard
11:28
people speak against that
11:30
and part of some we our apologies to the
11:32
people
11:33
can't see me and we also have a delay so
11:35
every once in a while i
11:36
accidentally interrupt her and i don't
11:38
mean to do that but
11:39
she doesn't see me and we have this
11:41
delay so we try not to i try not to
11:43
interrupt her but
11:44
i did want to say that um some people
11:46
have spoken against
11:47
doing that kind of thing and kev is
11:49
exactly right jesus calmed the storm and
11:51
he was our
11:52
our example he said greater works will
11:54
you do than i've done
11:56
so these are the greater works so yeah
11:59
we got we got some great evidence from
12:02
the
12:02
they saved the broadcast of the
12:04
meteorologist and we'll just keep them
12:06
uh stored but we've really been kind of
12:09
keeping track of the different things
12:11
whether it's hurricanes tsunamis
12:13
cyclones we've spoken against fires at
12:16
different times
12:17
even the arctic thing that i know we
12:19
know that hank had said that the snow
12:22
would come and it would mean
12:23
purification all that that did happen
12:25
and it was fine for the snow to come but
12:27
you know what we don't have to be
12:29
putting up with the devil who gets in
12:31
these weather systems and he can do it
12:33
he's the prince and power of the ear and
12:35
bring destruction and so we did
12:37
and even some of the prayers against
12:40
destruction
12:41
through that arctic wave made a
12:43
difference some people's electricity was
12:45
on right away
12:46
some areas didn't have it as bad because
12:48
those people had really great faith
12:50
uh in those areas people need to start
12:52
standing up and doing what christ did so
12:55
anyway that was one that was awesome how
12:58
uh that what came out about that there
12:59
was no destruction
13:01
from a tsunami so oh so so good
13:04
well what is it we're showing you about
13:05
our government these days
13:08
you mean the insanity of the fake
13:10
government because i'm still
13:13
the insanity of the fake government is
13:15
what everybody would be
13:16
living by if God wasn't going to do
13:19
something
13:20
and God's still telling me the same
13:23
thing you did on november the 4th when
13:25
you were a witness
13:26
of those words God said the father said
13:29
that when the ground begins to shake and
13:31
shake
13:32
watch for the landslide of fraud to
13:34
begin and he said the fraud would be
13:36
detailed it would be
13:38
horrific the things that we'd find out
13:40
what the left was doing and all those
13:41
were involved not just here in america
13:43
but around the world
13:45
to take over our country to interfere
13:47
with the elections
13:48
to conspire to come against america and
13:51
our president
13:52
donald trump and i can tell you what all
13:55
the stuff that he said
13:56
they would be found doing we're finding
13:58
out they're doing that
14:00
and if you can't tell by his uh fake
14:02
regulations which he has no power to
14:04
make
14:05
because let me tell you our military
14:08
know
14:08
about the election fraud they know
14:10
everything that went on they already
14:11
know that they're guilty
14:13
the military is still in the hands of
14:15
our president donald trump right now
14:17
i know that there are plans going on
14:19
behind the scenes but i do want to say
14:21
this
14:22
here in america where we are a free
14:25
country
14:26
we're a democracy and even though
14:28
somebody cheated and stole and they're
14:30
sitting illegally
14:31
in that spot as the highest person in
14:33
the land they're pretty lousy at it
14:36
because they're supposed to already have
14:37
given a state of the union address
14:40
they're not doing it i think they're
14:41
afraid they don't even know what to say
14:44
never in the history of our country from
14:46
a presidential election
14:47
has it taken it's i think they said over
14:49
48 days not one word from them about
14:52
what our
14:52
what the condition of the country is is
14:54
because they're afraid
14:56
they're afraid i can tell you a radical
14:58
probably redneck radical group
15:00
not a leftist one the ones in the right
15:03
who are sick and tired of all the stuff
15:05
going on
15:06
up there and they're not putting up with
15:07
it have already started to come against
15:09
the ones behind the barbed wire in the
15:11
capitol building
15:12
and they were going to try to do a
15:13
takeover in a good way okay they were
15:16
going to take our country back
15:17
and they were talked to i'm not sure who
15:20
talked to this head of this group
15:21
to please not do that don't try to bring
15:24
their
15:24
own group against them uh they didn't
15:27
want anybody to be harmed so they
15:29
decided to step back for a while
15:31
but they left their vehicles i don't
15:34
know what kind of vehicles vans what it
15:35
was
15:36
filled with dynamite and stuff right
15:37
there i mean the evidence was left for
15:40
them behind the barbed wire
15:42
that they're fed up with that with a
15:44
defilement and with the illegal
15:46
regulations and laws they're trying to
15:47
make as dictators
15:49
this really did happen and so they found
15:51
they they left the evidence like we're
15:53
tired of this we're real serious about
15:55
this
15:55
so the first real attempt about taking
15:58
it back on their own
15:59
uh this group who's who got themselves
16:02
together
16:02
uh they're tired of it and i'm telling
16:04
you i don't think it'd be much longer
16:06
when that begins to happen more and more
16:08
uh people on their own saying we're not
16:10
taking this we're not living by these
16:12
laws
16:13
and i can tell you over 20 some states i
16:15
don't know which ones they are
16:17
i saw the report over 20 some states
16:19
have sent information
16:21
to those behind the barbed wire they're
16:23
not living by a single
16:25
regulation illegal regulation most of
16:28
those laws they're trying to make
16:30
without due process
16:32
you know when um whenever a president
16:34
makes a a
16:36
recommendation for a new law to put
16:38
forth there is a process that goes
16:40
through
16:41
there are councils that have to look at
16:43
some of it has to be voted on
16:45
they're ignoring every bit of it and
16:47
acting like they're
16:49
they're they're you know they're ruling
16:51
as a tyrant
16:52
and they expect everyone to bow down and
16:55
just roll over
16:56
they're not doing it so we've got 20
16:58
some states saying we're not taking it
17:00
we're not living by it oh i may as well
17:03
add this
17:03
there's mask mask you know the mask
17:06
right
17:07
winning parties everywhere because
17:10
people in different states are saying
17:12
not just a few people a lot of them
17:14
this has been a year we've had it with a
17:16
mask we've had it with the social
17:17
distance they're having mass burning
17:19
parties
17:20
wow you can see them online different
17:22
places so
17:23
i've talked to a lot of people right
17:25
here in my own city and
17:27
they've had it with the mass stuff
17:28
they're gone i've noticed
17:30
some of the buildings and the businesses
17:32
taking the sign off the door
17:34
and i do know this also um i'll pause
17:37
for a minute in case you have a comment
17:39
to make before i continue do you have
17:40
anything
17:41
did you say i was i was going to say
17:44
that you know
17:44
we just went to ohio to see my mom
17:46
because she's getting quite
17:47
up there in age 87 and so it was kind of
17:50
a traumatic trip because
17:52
she's not doing that well but i had to
17:53
wear i've never flown anywhere during
17:55
this pandemic
17:56
or supposed pandemic whatever because i
17:58
just don't want to wear a mask
18:00
the whole time but we did and one time
18:03
i kind of fell asleep and i left my mask
18:06
on the airline
18:07
dropped down and said my nose the tip of
18:09
my nose was sticking out
18:10
out of the mask and i got tapped on the
18:12
shoulder and woken up
18:14
put your mask up here and i'm thinking
18:16
really
18:17
because when we breathe out that air is
18:19
not going nowhere it's going
18:21
out of the mask into the air where do
18:24
they think the air is going if you have
18:26
your mask on
18:27
it's going out of the mask into the
18:29
cabin
18:30
so how is this going to stop that it's
18:32
not if people have lost their minds
18:34
that make up these rules yeah they have
18:37
and i think because
18:38
no one is quite sure what it's going to
18:40
do because we do know
18:42
a lot of it has been made up uh it's
18:45
still a part of the left trying to
18:46
control everybody
18:48
if you don't know that by now i think
18:50
most people have figured that out
18:52
they want us to social distance it isn't
18:54
about the
18:55
the virus which is not a disease by the
18:57
way it's not a disease it's not a plague
18:59
it's a virus
19:00
it doesn't affect mostly 90 of the
19:02
population
19:03
is not in any way affected by it but the
19:06
left is using it because they want to
19:08
keep us
19:09
away from each other seriously
19:12
and we're better together we're not
19:14
better apart
19:15
there's still ways you can make sure you
19:17
know that if you don't have symptoms or
19:18
what all that people are mostly careful
19:20
anyway
19:22
but some states like texas finally made
19:25
the statement
19:26
we're not doing it anymore we're over
19:28
with the masquerade is what they call
19:30
that they're not wearing masks there
19:31
they're not requiring people to wear a
19:33
mask
19:33
they're not requiring social distancing
19:35
and guess what they're doing just fine
19:37
with that
19:38
i agree that if people want to protect
19:41
yourself
19:41
yes let them wear a mask but i also
19:44
agree with if there's nothing
19:46
wrong with you and you don't want that
19:48
you shouldn't have to do it
19:50
and i think that whole thing is coming
19:51
to a spiraling end
19:53
because guess what the americans are
19:55
doing it their self
19:56
like i said we're a free country you
19:59
can't
19:59
take this is the craziest thing i'll say
20:03
the most unintelligent thing since i'll
20:05
try to be kinder
20:06
um the most intelligent thing they've
20:08
ever tried to do
20:10
was you can't go in as communist agenda
20:13
and take over a free country not with
20:16
millions of people loving their freedom
20:19
uh
20:20
wanting their freedom you're the ones
20:22
who will be hurt you're the ones who
20:23
will lose those who's trying to do that
20:26
they're finding out more and more every
20:27
day and i will say this one more thing
20:29
the new york times himself have blasted
20:32
the
20:32
b person the fake president they blasted
20:36
him for all the illegal things they were
20:38
doing with the laws which shocked and
20:40
irritated him i think they said angered
20:42
was the word they use
20:43
because the new york times was saying
20:45
there's no there's ways you're supposed
20:46
to do this
20:47
and where you can't do this and you
20:49
cannot just make a law
20:51
yourself it has to go through due
20:53
process we don't like it that you're
20:56
doing this so you need to check yourself
20:57
out and see what you're doing
20:59
these people not just voted for him
21:03
they supported him through the whole um
21:06
campaign
21:07
and so they're not the only ones doing
21:09
it fox news is starting to step
21:10
up fox news actually
21:14
hired somebody who is part of trump's
21:16
campaign one of the speakers for trump's
21:18
campaign
21:19
and she is blasting that whole
21:23
fake agenda that defiling agenda they're
21:26
trying to come up with
21:27
uh behind the behind the barbed wire in
21:29
the capitol building
21:31
uh yeah they don't like it either this
21:33
is what they're realizing
21:35
what we have said all along if you don't
21:37
stop
21:38
them if you're for them you'll lose
21:40
everything your networks
21:42
your businesses your newspapers you're
21:44
going to lose your property
21:46
they have no plan to prosper america
21:50
that's not their plan okay that's not
21:52
their agenda and more and more
21:54
we will find out really how wicked and
21:57
evil they are with the agendas and the
21:59
laws that they've been trying to make
22:00
but these people we the people aren't
22:04
taking it there's also suing their state
22:07
suing them they're suing mr b
22:11
up there behind the capitol in the
22:12
capitol building suing him
22:14
for making illegal stuff so america's
22:17
starting to wake up and say we're not
22:19
taking this
22:20
you know and when people we weren't
22:22
alive when this all went down
22:24
when the british were tax taxing us
22:28
and it was taxation without
22:29
representation in other words you will
22:31
pay the money we tell you to pay but you
22:33
don't get represented
22:35
your voice is not heard you will do what
22:36
we tell you to do and
22:38
get started the revolutionary war from
22:40
which came the united states of america
22:43
so there's nothing ill-religious or
22:45
sacrilegious or unchrist-like when we
22:48
say
22:48
enough is enough you know with christ
22:52
we stand against here it's tyranny
22:56
it's one nation under God not one nation
22:58
under satan
22:59
okay and i don't mind saying that at all
23:03
but i do know and i'm connected with
23:05
groups that do
23:06
know things are going to be happening
23:10
and again i don't have a date i just can
23:12
tell you this
23:13
God has never changed what he said the
23:16
fraud will be exposed they will all be
23:18
brought to
23:19
justice not their justice but real
23:22
justice and things will be removed
23:25
people lose their seats their properties
23:27
their homes or go to prison it's all
23:29
going to happen people
23:30
uh you can't be ignorant of things you
23:33
can be innocent we're innocent not
23:35
ignorant
23:36
but i can tell you God who this country
23:38
belongs to
23:39
is not tolerating the stuff that they're
23:42
planning to do
23:43
especially since a lot of it comes
23:45
against children
23:46
i'm just saying in the in the weeks
23:47
ahead you better keep your eyes and ears
23:49
open
23:50
because you know what that celebration
23:52
is going to be happening and it's going
23:53
to be powerful
23:56
that's so good it's such good news and
23:58
you know we hang around with the
23:59
prophets we hang around with each other
24:01
mostly online of course that we're all
24:04
hearing the same thing we're all feeling
24:06
and sensing the same thing we get it in
24:08
our own
24:08
ways in our own verbage because God
24:11
speaks to everybody differently
24:13
but we're all hearing the same thing
24:15
this is about over
24:17
you know or it's not over is another way
24:20
to say it this is not over at all
24:21
so well um anything else you want to add
24:24
before we go into
24:25
questions about heaven i want to make
24:27
sure i don't cut anything off
24:28
one one more thing and that is as far as
24:32
i
24:32
can understand and the information i
24:34
have received
24:36
georgia has finally got i don't know if
24:39
they got who they got permission from or
24:40
how that happened
24:42
but they're actually supposed to be
24:43
recounting
24:45
single ballot in the state of georgia
24:48
and we all know that was one of the
24:49
swing states so let's see what happens
24:51
with that
24:53
that's good yeah all those things is a
24:55
lot of people thought this was dead and
24:56
i thought
24:57
all of those battles were probably dead
24:59
weeks and weeks ago and yet they keep
25:01
reviving because there's a trump is a
25:03
fighter his people are fighters
25:05
and uh probably the single most common
25:08
question
25:09
and this is this is going to bridge
25:11
because people keep asking me
25:12
a Kat question but it's about this word
25:15
about pence
25:16
what do you say now or what is God
25:19
showing you about pence is he the good
25:21
guy or the bad guy
25:22
he's not saying anything to me about
25:24
pets i think that's probably going to
25:26
have to come from trump himself
25:29
or pass himself and i think it will i
25:32
think we will know and i i do want to
25:34
say this
25:36
from the beginning of time before the
25:38
earth was made actually before the earth
25:40
was made
25:41
our God he had a plan for all of us
25:45
all those who he would send from himself
25:47
to live on this
25:48
earth he had a plan for all of us and
25:51
some people actually have a commission
25:54
some have a calling
25:56
some even have an anointing to do
25:57
something but they
25:59
still have to say yes because they're
26:02
humans
26:03
sometimes people change their mind
26:06
either they're
26:06
in either their uh you know they're
26:08
being um controlled by people which we
26:11
do know and have found out
26:13
that some of the people who stepped back
26:15
were threatened by death
26:16
and i don't mind saying that either uh
26:19
some people
26:20
some are political figures some are
26:21
business figures figure somewhere
26:23
all kinds of people if they were a
26:25
threat against the left
26:28
and they had a voice to speak many even
26:31
some of the prophets
26:32
were threatened with death and we do
26:34
know that for a fact
26:36
so sometimes we may not know to this
26:38
whole thing
26:39
comes out and all that justice stuff
26:41
happens i think those people will come
26:42
forth and actually give
26:44
a testimony about that happening but
26:46
some were
26:47
um and so that probably maybe encouraged
26:50
them
26:51
or maybe force them to say something
26:53
against somebody
26:55
that maybe against the president or
26:56
somebody that they were standing for
26:59
i do know something did i don't know
27:02
what pence's case was i know people who
27:05
know
27:06
them and know that they're very close
27:08
pence and trump are very close they have
27:10
been very close
27:11
and uh pence was being groomed also to
27:14
be president
27:15
um after trump i do know that is a fact
27:18
and that's even from God himself
27:20
but like i said God calls people
27:23
sometimes they say yes
27:25
sometimes they change their mind we
27:27
cannot control human nature
27:29
i just know what God's plans are i will
27:32
say this trump is our president right
27:34
now because he won the election all of
27:36
our military know that
27:38
and uh so i know that one is for sure
27:41
that will have to be something figured
27:43
out even even because if we find out
27:45
it's a covert thing
27:46
which that could be a possibility or for
27:48
whatever reason
27:49
but i think that will probably come we
27:51
won't know until trump or pence say
27:53
something
27:54
and neither one of them are saying
27:56
anything right now
27:57
because of things still going on behind
27:59
the scenes that we don't know about
28:01
wow well good uh um if you're ready for
28:04
some questions there on heaven i'm ready
28:06
to ask
28:07
um this is really interesting to see if
28:09
i can pull up this other one um
28:11
i had a question i'm just gonna blend it
28:13
together because i woke up this morning
28:15
and i thought i'm going to ask
28:17
i have hundreds of questions don't get
28:18
me wrong but i thought there's some
28:19
questions that are not being asked
28:21
that i want to have asked for myself and
28:24
so i
28:25
i wrote down i got my laptop i'm still
28:28
sitting in bed and i wrote this down
28:30
and no sooner did i come up with this
28:32
question thinking no one had ever asked
28:34
this question
28:35
then a man wrote and asked this question
28:37
this morning
28:38
or it gave me this morning so the
28:40
question is
28:42
if we like to read and i'm not as
28:46
a voracious reader like some people my
28:47
wife loves to read read read
28:49
if a person likes to read will will they
28:52
be
28:53
reading in heaven and if they'll be
28:54
reading in heaven what will they be
28:56
reading and that then begs the question
28:59
will other people be there and write
29:01
books that other people will read in
29:03
heaven
29:04
um i think both of those are yes
29:07
absolutely
29:09
i've i've been to well they have the
29:11
hall of knowledge
29:12
they have the library of the scrolls i
29:14
mean there's all kinds of ways people
29:15
could write in heaven
29:17
if that's their gift it's not going to
29:19
stop when they get there i'ma
29:22
for instance i'm a photographer that's
29:24
my passion that's what he made me when
29:26
he sent me here i'm a photographer
29:28
i already know i'll have studios in
29:30
heaven i'll do photography in heaven
29:32
and i know if someone's an author
29:34
they'll write books in heaven
29:36
now let's say they wrote books that
29:37
weren't so nice they got born again
29:40
they've got to have them they'll write
29:41
books but they won't have any some of
29:42
the maybe
29:43
the colorful language won't be in there
29:46
or just say profanity
29:47
nothing in heaven not the movies not the
29:50
cartoons not the videos kids play
29:53
not any books not anything they have no
29:56
profanity no sexuality they
29:58
have no graphic violence in them because
30:01
that's
30:01
part of the darkness and there's no
30:03
darkness in heaven
30:05
but the intensity the excitement the
30:08
amazing things the
30:09
the wonder that are in some books people
30:12
will read books but they have two ways
30:14
they can do that
30:15
you can either just go get one off of a
30:17
shelf or if you meet an
30:19
author they'll have them available for
30:20
everybody for free because nothing costs
30:22
anything in heaven
30:24
some books you will take that book and
30:26
open it and when you do
30:28
you'll see a hologram and you watch
30:32
you will watch what's in the book you
30:34
don't have to read it if you don't
30:36
want to and so that's another way that
30:38
you can still see
30:39
an author's work in heaven that's really
30:42
really good
30:43
now awesome that's really that answers
30:45
that question um
30:46
so i haven't you had said that heaven
30:48
was like 50
30:51
fun which means doing whatever playing
30:53
sports uh good
30:55
uh going to the amusement park the
30:56
anointed
30:58
christ-oriented amusement park and and
31:00
then the other 50
31:01
was worship so my other question related
31:04
to that is
31:05
what percentage of time would you guess
31:08
people are in their own mansions
31:10
versus out and about for lack of a
31:12
better word
31:14
because and that might that the
31:16
follow-up question is
31:18
i'm not so much a loner but i know
31:20
people who love
31:21
alone time they like to be with the
31:23
group and then they love to be alone for
31:25
a season of time
31:27
and will that person still love to be
31:30
with people and then
31:31
feel that need to be alone because
31:32
that's the way they were on earth
31:35
i think that it says you'll be known as
31:38
you are known
31:39
in the bible i think your personality
31:42
gets enhanced in heaven i do know that
31:45
your gifts
31:46
are enhanced they they're greater even
31:48
than they were on the earth
31:51
i think people who like to still have
31:53
some alone time
31:54
absolutely can have alone time if you
31:56
want a long time with God though you can
31:57
just go be with him it's not like you
31:59
have to sit
32:00
alone somewhere hoping you'll hear him i
32:02
know people go somewhere they want to
32:04
meditate on God or meditate on the word
32:06
you live it you live that kind of life
32:08
in heaven and the thing about worship is
32:11
it's 50 fun 50 percent
32:14
um splendor and wonder and part of the
32:17
splendor
32:18
is the worship the worship is called
32:20
living worship in heaven
32:22
everywhere you go when you see what he
32:25
has made
32:26
for those in heaven when you see what he
32:28
has blessed those or rewarded those in
32:29
heaven
32:30
you will always worship him the worship
32:33
in the throne is a whole separate event
32:36
in the throne room like there's no time
32:38
and let me tell you that is
32:40
wonder and splendor you begin to worship
32:43
you're caught up off the floor in the
32:44
throne room you can worship in the sky
32:46
of heaven
32:47
no matter where you are and you're
32:49
worshiping in heaven with everything the
32:51
trees
32:52
the flowers the ground the pebbles
32:56
of the creatures it's like waves of
32:59
worship everywhere i think that's
33:01
probably a better way to say it
33:03
but the splendor and the wonder could be
33:05
just standing before his throne seeing
33:07
life coming in and out of him uh seeing
33:10
uh the glory coming from him the
33:13
seraphim who dipped down
33:14
out of the glory cloud over the throne
33:17
in
33:18
in heaven and their hair is on fire with
33:21
their passion for him
33:23
it's something like you'll never forget
33:25
people love to be there especially when
33:27
they first come
33:28
sometimes their family members will
33:30
finally come and say
33:32
can we all go see your mansion you
33:33
haven't you don't see your mansion first
33:35
you go to the throne room first
33:37
where you're welcomed by the father
33:39
christ walks you back up the steps
33:41
there's quite a few steps going up to
33:43
the throne
33:44
and he gives you back says father i have
33:46
brought back your son or your daughter
33:48
whichever one it is
33:49
and then the father greets you he'll
33:51
hold you
33:52
he gives you rewards right there that
33:55
time for
33:56
what you've done in your life on the
33:57
earth and then he has more in your
33:59
mansion or around your mansion it's like
34:01
it's this unending love and
34:04
uh it's something it's really almost
34:07
hard to explain but
34:09
the wonder some place there's places
34:10
you've made just for
34:12
wonder the amazement that rolls over you
34:14
and
34:15
waves when you go into certain areas and
34:17
see what God has designed just to enjoy
34:20
the beauty of his creativity it's
34:23
it doesn't end so it's wonder splendor
34:26
and 50 fun that's really the way it is
34:29
so
34:30
no one living in heaven is sad no one
34:33
has any regrets there's no jealousy no
34:35
coveting no
34:36
anger uh there's no um
34:40
um you know nobody feels small or little
34:43
or forgotten
34:44
no one's rejected in heaven it's the
34:46
place everybody
34:48
should want to go when you leave this
34:50
earth you move
34:51
okay you don't stop existing your body
34:54
is here sleeping but you the real you
34:57
that steps out of this body
34:58
looks like you but better it's you but
35:00
you look younger you look better
35:02
that lives forever and you live a real
35:05
life
35:06
in heaven it's a literal life you walk
35:08
the ground
35:09
you smell the flowers you taste the food
35:11
you live in your mansion
35:13
and the other part of that question i
35:14
was asked was
35:16
if you want to be alone time do you want
35:19
to still be alone well part of that yes
35:21
because that's you
35:22
but let me tell you most people are not
35:25
in their mansions
35:26
most people are out going all over
35:29
heaven going on
35:30
tours of heaven with family with friends
35:32
sometimes the prophets invite you
35:34
to come to their places i mean there's
35:37
shows
35:38
being put on everywhere and having
35:40
extravagant beautiful shows some are
35:42
worshipped some are for fun
35:43
so people are always going places in
35:45
heaven
35:47
wow so well you know that that another
35:49
woman wrote this question
35:51
i had the same one written down it's
35:53
hard for me to visualize a mansion
35:55
without a what we call a bedroom and
35:59
then a bedroom has a bed
36:01
is there no sleep nobody says i'm just
36:03
going to go and lay down and have some r
36:06
and r
36:07
with the lord or do beds not exist in
36:09
heaven at all
36:11
i know this for fat because he's your
36:13
father
36:14
he loves what you love he will create
36:18
bedrooms for some people just because in
36:20
their mind and in their heart
36:22
they always pictured having some
36:24
glorious kind of a bedroom with some
36:26
special kind of a bed
36:28
you'll sit on that you'll recline maybe
36:31
maybe you'll be reading or watching
36:33
things on
36:34
in these video books or whatever mostly
36:37
people have things to recline
36:39
on i wouldn't say it's like a bed bed
36:42
it's probably more something you would
36:43
recline against you've seen
36:44
some of those beautiful i don't even
36:46
know what they call them like they have
36:47
a back and they come down
36:50
like that mostly people would have a
36:52
room to
36:53
meditate in to if they want quiet time
36:56
it'd be hard to have quiet time your
36:57
angels there
36:58
talking to you all the time really
37:01
i don't want to take you places but
37:03
there's beautiful places like butterfly
37:05
meadow uh the friendly forest
37:08
the valley of the falls where people
37:10
love to go and just enjoy the beauty
37:12
that's there
37:13
uh i think people who even didn't want
37:15
to be around people
37:16
will fall in love with people in heaven
37:18
everybody likes to be
37:19
together and do things together now you
37:22
just said
37:23
your angels would visit i don't think
37:25
i've ever heard you talk about that
37:27
are you saying our angel stays with us
37:29
forever
37:30
is your angel always with you i don't
37:33
know that they stay with you forever
37:34
they spend time with you
37:36
they'll come in and out just to say hi
37:38
and
37:39
uh because they're you know they have a
37:40
special connection with you they've been
37:42
with you since
37:43
well since the time you actually were
37:45
conceived
37:46
they were sent to wait outside the
37:48
mother
37:49
to watch over you from that moment
37:51
they're with you except the times they
37:53
get a break to go to heaven
37:54
and you most people have at least two
37:57
because they do get a break to go back
37:58
to
37:59
heaven not from you
38:02
but you know what they're connected and
38:03
they're with you they're the ones who
38:05
the first ones you'll probably see
38:07
when you when you pass when your heart
38:09
stops when your brain stops
38:11
and you step out of this body usually
38:13
the first one you see is your actual
38:15
guardian angels and they will escort you
38:17
to heaven in many
38:18
different ways and then they'll take you
38:20
into the throne room and then you will
38:22
from that moment
38:23
jesus will take you and be with you for
38:25
quite a while and then you'll be with
38:26
the father then you'll be with everyone
38:27
in the throne room then you go back to
38:29
your own mansion and see it for the
38:30
first time
38:31
your angel will come for that because
38:33
your angel will want to see the
38:35
expression on your face and see
38:36
what you have yeah so it's not like they
38:40
live with you forever but they'll
38:41
definitely be coming to spend some
38:42
different time with you
38:44
so good now um i've heard a lot of
38:47
people say
38:48
they've read books on heaven this person
38:50
went and then
38:52
they went on a visit they wrote a book
38:53
about it but when they came back they
38:55
they went through a period of almost
38:57
depression because it was so dark on
38:59
this earth compared to heaven
39:00
and so i keep being asked this question
39:02
this ask Kat
39:04
how come she does she feel that way does
39:07
she feel at first depressed
39:08
or if not why don't you when others do
39:13
i was given a commission i don't just
39:15
take myself up there
39:17
i'm taken all the time and so
39:21
um the father and jesus put something in
39:24
me they actually put their hand in me
39:26
and they said we're putting something in
39:28
you so you won't want to have a desire
39:30
to stay now
39:31
and you won't be effective when you go
39:33
back because you have to share
39:35
that's what my commission is to see
39:37
heaven and share heaven
39:39
to see the trinity to share the trinity
39:42
to if they take me forward in time i
39:44
have to share that back in time i have
39:45
whatever i see i have to share i share
39:48
what they show me
39:49
or i say what they told me that is my
39:51
commission
39:52
and so i wouldn't be a very good
39:54
ambassador for heaven
39:56
if i was always dreaming to be there so
39:58
i literally have something in here
40:01
i love seeing it i can't wait to come
40:03
back and share it
40:05
so i don't experience that i do know
40:07
some people that actually
40:08
are i've seen him at the throne saying i
40:10
don't want to go back please don't make
40:11
me go back
40:12
and the father would say you're here for
40:14
a glimpse i'm not done with you i need
40:16
you to go back
40:17
and i understand about the light it's
40:20
not just like the physical light like
40:22
the shining on my face right now
40:24
it's the light that comes from him the
40:26
glorious light
40:28
radiates all over it's the life of God
40:30
it's the love of God
40:32
and you go from that back to this earth
40:34
it would seem dark the atmosphere would
40:37
even the light itself is on the earth
40:39
would seem much dimmer than it is in
40:41
heaven
40:42
and the joy also you know but you know
40:45
what i live
40:46
i i have as much of God every day that i
40:48
want i bind every day the love and the
40:51
life of God to my
40:52
soul it will help to change you if you
40:54
do that number one make sure you don't
40:56
have any darkness lose all the darkness
40:57
from your soul
40:58
any fear any grief loose it off from
41:02
your soul
41:02
it's the keys to the kingdom and then
41:04
you bind and you say
41:06
i choose my will divine the life of God
41:08
the love of God
41:10
the presence of God his plans
41:13
his will his celebration
41:16
i bind it to my soul ye will not be the
41:19
same
41:20
person if you if you do that on a
41:21
continual basis because as your soul
41:24
prospers and that's what it was your
41:27
soul prospered by what you put in there
41:28
what you get out what you put in there
41:30
your soul will begin to prosper and then
41:32
you will live in
41:33
hell so make sure that's what you're
41:36
taking care of guard it
41:37
keep the junk out make sure you let God
41:39
in uh i do it all the time but i do have
41:42
a commission
41:43
so it makes it a little bit different
41:44
for me yeah oh
41:46
that's a good answer thank you for that
41:48
that was very detailed and
41:49
sure helped me too um so i asked this
41:53
question another way but this lady's
41:56
asking
41:56
in a different way she said i really i
41:58
understand there's no
42:00
need for the sun because the God is
42:03
there in heaven
42:04
and i understand there's no night but
42:06
she says but i
42:07
love the night sky i love the moon i
42:10
love the stars she says is there not
42:12
anywhere in heaven
42:13
we could go to see something like that
42:17
absolutely yes because he made them now
42:21
it
42:21
is if you ever travel through the spirit
42:24
realm
42:25
up to heaven you would see light
42:27
everywhere out there
42:28
in the spirit realm physical realm is
42:30
wrapped around the spiritual realm
42:32
it doesn't take it away it's there okay
42:35
the spirit realm is all around us that's
42:37
how the angels are here that's how the
42:39
other
42:39
ones are here uh but i can tell you that
42:42
um
42:43
yes there's a place in heaven he made
42:45
there's always going to be a place
42:46
you go to this place called the
42:47
observatory now you don't get a ticket
42:50
or a pass and a picture of picturing an
42:52
observatory with a big telescope that's
42:53
not what i'm talking about
42:55
i'm talking about there's a place you
42:57
entered these ancient
42:58
doors i mean ancient there's no door
43:01
it's just an
43:02
archway you go into this beautiful place
43:04
you step out and you're
43:05
in the middle of the galaxies and the
43:09
stars
43:10
and you like it and you'll probably
43:12
visit there
43:13
and when you're done you just step back
43:15
in it's not like
43:16
i'm not saying you're stepping inside
43:18
like you open the door and step right up
43:20
there
43:20
that's not that you're out in it and you
43:23
see the beauty and the splendor of all
43:24
that he made
43:26
every star has light every nebula has
43:29
light
43:30
some you'll recognize or recognize some
43:33
you will not recognize
43:34
but from heaven itself the light is so
43:37
great coming from the glory but in the
43:40
sky of heaven
43:41
in the sky there's beautiful things you
43:43
see even as much light there is here
43:46
he made things you can see like things
43:48
that look like stars groups of stars
43:50
will come and
43:51
sing in the sky and
43:54
they'll have faces on them there's waves
43:57
of beautiful light
43:59
that that come from him that he has
44:01
there's times when certain parts of the
44:03
sky
44:04
are dimmer than normal because these
44:06
waves of color that come in well they'll
44:08
consume
44:09
whole groups or whole mansions or whole
44:10
parts of heaven
44:12
and it's like a light show so you're not
44:14
going to miss it
44:16
i have never i've never heard anybody
44:18
describe that
44:19
so you're saying you you will be able to
44:21
look out and see some stars that will
44:23
have faces
44:24
they're like we think of the man and the
44:25
moon you can always see a man and then
44:27
this is like stars that have faces that
44:29
will sing to you is that what you just
44:31
said
44:31
yes yes yeah that's pretty good
44:35
okay here's my question i have a bunch
44:38
of prophetic friends
44:40
who have already gone home to me at the
44:41
lord and i have family
44:44
does anything like this ever happened
44:46
where some family members get together
44:47
and some prophets get together and they
44:49
say
44:50
you know what steve's having a rough
44:52
time now let's have
44:53
let's have a prayer meeting and let's
44:54
intercede for him does anything like
44:56
that go on in heaven i'm talking of
44:57
course this is i'm not just talking
44:58
about myself
44:59
talking about anybody does anybody have
45:02
groups of people in heaven that decide
45:04
to stop and intercede for them
45:06
i think the intercession is totally
45:08
different than it would be on this earth
45:10
i think more like declarations they will
45:13
make declarations over you
45:15
and also uh they probably go to the
45:18
places that he calls the portal
45:20
it's a building it's his beautiful
45:22
facilities he's made if people go to
45:24
KatKerr.com i think they can see see
45:27
some of those pictures or maybe even to
45:30
heaven.com i think in our photo gallery
45:33
we may have some
45:35
there's a place called the portal that
45:37
God created where people in heaven can
45:39
go to they walk upstairs they look
45:41
down they can see their family members
45:43
on the earth they declare things over
45:45
them
45:46
one thing they do is every day on your
45:48
birthday they'll go sing they literally
45:49
will sing
45:51
next to where they stay in are these
45:52
beautiful vases and urns they may be
45:55
like
45:55
three foot four foot high some are
45:57
shorter and there's
45:59
petals like flower petals some are
46:01
saturated with peace
46:03
some are saturated with joy some are
46:05
saturated with his presence
46:07
some are saturated with wisdom and
46:09
whatever it is that you're needing
46:11
at that time they'll make declarations
46:13
like let's just say
46:14
i declare father that steve will have
46:17
peace in his life right now i declare
46:18
that you'll give him the wisdom to know
46:20
what to say
46:21
i declare that he will be successful in
46:24
what his desire is
46:26
concerning his mother i declare that he
46:29
will have the very presence of God on
46:31
him
46:31
then they lean over and pick up
46:33
beautiful these petals
46:35
with wisdom or with peace and they'll
46:37
throw them over
46:38
this balcony and if you're if you're
46:40
real sensitive
46:42
i feel like every time one of my family
46:43
members usually my dad
46:45
i'll feel the peace of God come over me
46:47
in ways that really
46:49
the peace that surpasses all
46:51
understanding
46:52
are real these petals of peace
46:55
and they will throw them over you and
46:57
you begin to be consumed with peace even
46:59
in the midst of situations
47:01
yes they don't forget you they know what
47:03
you're kind of going through
47:04
but it doesn't pierce them like great
47:07
sadness or grief does not come over them
47:09
they can see the activities of the holy
47:11
spirit they can see the angels already
47:13
around you
47:14
and beginning to be involved in the
47:16
situation like
47:17
they could they could take and go to
47:19
your mother and release the life of God
47:22
on her
47:22
if you've got people praying for you
47:24
sometimes he'll send angels
47:25
will be sent on assignment to impart
47:27
peace
47:28
or even joy when there wasn't any
47:31
they'll bring that to that situation so
47:34
that's what i mean when it's a different
47:35
life to be up there but certainly people
47:37
are going to say things for you
47:39
over you wow wow now i have a question
47:42
from christy she may be one that i gave
47:44
a word of knowledge to she has two quick
47:46
questions one is
47:47
she says i'm a violinist so i was
47:49
wondering about
47:50
a heavenly orchestra are there heavenly
47:52
orchestras where she might play the
47:53
violin
47:55
absolutely yes i actually
47:59
within my second or third encounter i
48:01
had in heaven i was
48:02
actually taken to see their or their
48:05
orchestra
48:06
their symphonic orchestra they had
48:08
people playing the instruments
48:11
they had people singing it was the most
48:14
glorious glorious thing
48:16
the one thing that was different that
48:18
really surprised me and i actually got
48:20
to share this at some
48:21
of the intercessors at bethel very soon
48:23
after that i got to visit bethel i
48:25
wasn't invited by
48:27
them to come and speak some of the
48:28
intercessors brought me there just to
48:29
share heaven with them
48:31
and something i actually gave is a tip
48:34
to somebody there
48:35
um the ones who you know they have a
48:38
maestro right who's usually there like
48:40
this
48:41
and what they're encouraging the people
48:43
to play at different tones or different
48:45
times i i'm not really musical at all
48:47
but i understand that's how that happens
48:49
you know who the ones are they're
48:51
actually directing this
48:52
orchestra it's the artist this is really
48:55
going to get you
48:56
really all of the orchestra was standing
48:59
like the orchestra if i was an artist
49:01
and i was
49:02
leading this symphonic or this uh
49:05
whatever it was that they were doing
49:06
singing concert or whatever i would be
49:09
here with my
49:10
easel in front of me and what i painted
49:13
as the artist
49:14
would be what they played on their
49:16
instrument
49:18
that's incredible but the thing is this
49:20
we do it backwards down here
49:22
we'll have beautiful uh worship and
49:25
we'll invite artists to come and paint
49:26
you know down here
49:27
everyone's up here and they're all
49:29
singing down here the artist painting
49:31
what they're hearing
49:32
it's the opposite in heaven what you
49:35
paint
49:36
as an artist that orchestra will sing
49:39
and play
49:40
wow so yeah in order to do to be doing
49:43
it like heaven
49:44
the the worship people would stop stop
49:47
and wait to
49:48
see what the artist was going to paint
49:49
and then they would go interesting okay
49:51
here's our next
49:52
second question since my mom has
49:54
symptoms
49:55
that move around her body and just
49:57
plague her we do all the declaring and
49:59
all of that
50:00
what else she's asking what else can she
50:02
do
50:03
she doesn't say which symptoms they are
50:05
she just says he has symptoms
50:07
it would depend on what that was if it's
50:09
activity the enemy
50:11
that would be one thing you would do if
50:13
it's actual
50:14
like medical things affecting her body
50:17
physically
50:18
it i would have to know if it was a
50:20
spiritual thing or a physical thing and
50:22
maybe they don't know
50:24
the first thing i would do is i would
50:25
actually come together and ask God
50:27
show me what it is make sure you're
50:29
asking that
50:30
and sometimes you'll just hear him say
50:32
it this is just an attack of the enemy
50:34
this is something that's not actually
50:36
physically wrong with her
50:37
take authority over that in jesus name
50:40
and cast the enemy
50:41
out of the situation i would totally do
50:44
that first if
50:45
if i know any number of calls i'll say
50:48
well i'm taking authority i'm laying the
50:49
phone on their body literally i haven't
50:51
put the phone out
50:52
really yeah you can send things in the
50:55
spirit realm
50:56
you can send it you can send the
50:58
lightning power of God that destroys any
50:59
operations of the enemy in somebody's
51:01
life
51:01
that's what john g lake did he operate
51:04
in the lightning power of God but see
51:05
most of the body don't know this
51:06
you can also release the anointing you
51:08
carry that breaks every yoke of darkness
51:11
so if they're there with her you release
51:14
the anointing you carry
51:15
first john 2 27 when you receive jesus
51:18
christ as your savior you get a deposit
51:20
of the anointing
51:21
the anointing breaks every yoke every
51:24
yoke of what
51:25
whether it's sickness whether it's grief
51:27
whether it's laugh whether it's poverty
51:28
where it's fear
51:30
it breaks the yolk of the enemy that's
51:32
trying to bring that on you
51:33
there's so many different things that
51:35
that could mean but for sure
51:37
make sure you take spiritual authority a
51:39
spiritual authority over
51:41
anything that might be doing that to
51:43
convince them there's something wrong
51:45
with them
51:45
and then after that lay hands on their
51:47
body or teach
51:49
them if they're a believer they carry
51:51
the anointing
51:52
they carry it their self i would say lay
51:54
your hand on
51:55
on the person if the christians say uh
51:57
have them say
51:58
i choose to have the anointing stirred
52:00
up in me they can
52:01
every time it happens they can say let's
52:03
say a pain hits here i release the
52:05
anointing
52:06
to break the yoke of darkness trying to
52:07
attack my arm it moves over here i
52:09
release the anointing the anointing
52:11
breaks the yolk
52:12
now this might sound extreme but this is
52:14
the way we actually should be living
52:16
i'm not saying don't go to your doctor
52:18
that's what you have peace to do do it
52:21
but make sure you're taking authority
52:23
over it yourself
52:25
so good so so so good yeah and i
52:27
remember hearing uh even years ago in my
52:29
prophetic training they would say
52:32
and this was this wasn't even just
52:34
discerning it was saying
52:36
with knowledge if something is always
52:38
moving around
52:39
it's probably a demonic thing as opposed
52:42
to medical condition so that you would
52:44
go there first
52:45
if something's moving around but
52:47
discerning is even better
52:49
so some people walk in the room and know
52:50
exactly what it is yeah
52:52
so if you if you don't hear anything i
52:54
would totally dislike
52:55
like what steve said a lot of times if
52:58
something is literally moving around
52:59
especially if you feel it moving around
53:02
make sure you cast out every evil spirit
53:04
attacking you trying to affect you in
53:06
jesus name commanded to go
53:09
we have been given power over the enemy
53:11
to cast out
53:12
devils if the person who's sick is too
53:14
weak get people in there who know how to
53:16
take authority they don't have to be in
53:18
our deliverance team or something
53:20
they know their authority in christ they
53:22
know that we've been given that and have
53:23
them go with them lay hands on her and
53:24
cast out every evil spirit
53:26
that's trying to attack her in any way
53:28
and make sure
53:30
this is the last thing make sure there's
53:33
no
53:33
doors being open in that place to let
53:36
something in
53:37
if someone in that home is watching
53:39
extreme violence
53:41
that gives a right for the enemy to
53:43
bring violence in there i'm serious
53:45
about that
53:46
if you want to inspect yourself that's
53:47
extreme i i tell people a television a
53:50
computer
53:51
your screen on your phone those are
53:53
portals for things to come in and if you
53:55
watch the wrong thing
53:57
you yourself are allowing things to
53:59
enter into the place where you live to
54:01
affect you
54:01
so make sure you cast all that junk out
54:05
and like steve said take authority over
54:06
the enemy first
54:08
and that might eliminate it all together
54:10
yeah that reminds me of uh
54:12
in jennifer eva's book which um i
54:15
endorsed that book
54:16
she's become a good friend she's a seer
54:18
as you are
54:20
um and so she and she can feel things so
54:23
there was this guy that
54:24
couldn't get set free from whatever it
54:25
was i don't remember what the condition
54:27
is
54:28
she walks in his house and immediately
54:30
feels
54:31
something dark back there he goes back
54:33
in the back
54:34
with his permission goes into his closet
54:37
pulls out a stack of heavy metal
54:39
records that are filled with violence
54:41
and sex and she says here's your problem
54:44
right here he disposed of those and the
54:47
condition went away
54:48
so that's what Kat means is get rid
54:50
of stuff that's that's welcoming in your
54:52
home
54:53
yeah whenever you don't ever ever have
54:55
any palm reading stuff
54:56
don't have crystal balls do not have a
54:58
ouija boards
55:00
don't have anything that has witchcraft
55:02
in it even um
55:03
pokemon is a spirit of violence
55:06
and i will give this as our own true
55:08
testimony we when we
55:10
move if we move we we cleanse the entire
55:12
place we're moving into if we didn't
55:14
have that built we have it cleansed we
55:16
look around for anything left behind
55:18
and when we moved in and we we love each
55:20
other but we started this was maybe 10
55:22
years ago we started
55:23
fighting with each other maybe 15 years
55:25
ago we were bickering and finding
55:27
continuing said okay
55:28
stop we're stopping we're going to go
55:31
and look everywhere we can to see what's
55:33
there
55:34
and so everybody want everyone they were
55:36
empty and somebody went in this child's
55:38
closet and
55:39
in the in the um what do you call the
55:41
footboard that goes around
55:43
i don't know what you call it yeah the
55:44
wall board or something that put yeah
55:47
molding
55:47
was stuck one pokemon card one
55:51
one that was the one thing that was
55:53
causing us all to war because
55:55
in that cartoon thing they wore that's
55:58
what pokemon does it wars against other
56:00
ones to see who has greater power
56:02
and so that's not a good thing to have
56:05
we
56:06
burned that card outside we took
56:08
communion and we poured on the ground
56:10
outside to cleanse the whole place
56:12
it never happened again isn't that
56:14
amazing and sometimes i'll tell you this
56:16
story real quick a 30-second version of
56:19
it i had a dream with there was a demon
56:20
around the
56:21
back side of my walk-through closet he
56:23
was hiding in
56:25
behind the clothes and so rather than
56:28
doing anything about it i called my
56:30
friend
56:31
paul who is a seer and he can feel he
56:34
helps me over the phone
56:35
so i said i'm going to walk through some
56:38
place and i'm going to
56:39
see what you feel and and so i walked
56:42
through and i put my hand
56:44
right close to the clothes he goes
56:46
there's nothing there steve
56:48
and without telling him i went like this
56:50
i put my hand about 12 inches with this
56:51
further right into where i've seen the
56:53
demon in my dream
56:54
he goes ooh what's that i said well
56:56
that's what i just saw in my dream he
56:57
said well tell him to leave
56:59
every time i've ever used him and you
57:01
need to identify something that i knew
57:03
was there he says
57:04
tell it to leave which is kind of like
57:06
crazy just tell it
57:08
to get out of there i'm thinking i'm
57:10
waiting for some sort of magic formula
57:12
no he said tell it to get out it says we
57:15
have the ability to cast out demons that
57:17
doesn't just mean any person that means
57:19
in places too
57:20
and i'll come back sometimes and there's
57:23
been visitors here
57:24
other stuff going on and i'll feed them
57:26
feel the presence of something that i
57:28
knew didn't belong there if i don't see
57:29
it i feel i'll open my front door and
57:31
say i evict you in jesus name
57:33
get out and it leans
57:36
just like that yeah you should do that
57:39
every night before you go to bed
57:41
let me ask one more question and we're
57:43
about at the time here
57:45
um people have been saying i've been
57:48
hearing this reported i don't know how
57:50
carmen this is Kat but people have been
57:51
commenting on
57:52
booms and explosion sounds around the
57:55
world
57:56
and wondering if you knew anything about
57:57
the booms that
57:59
you talked about military being but have
58:00
you heard anything about people hearing
58:02
mysterious booms
58:05
yes i have i've have not just heard them
58:07
hearing about the booms i've heard them
58:09
hearing
58:10
like um rumbling sounds like something
58:13
was rumbling and rumbling and rumbling
58:15
that's usually the activity of the army
58:17
of God
58:19
come in if there's a lot of them coming
58:21
into an area to deal with stuff
58:23
sometimes you you you will just pick
58:25
that up
58:26
that happened in florida that happened
58:28
from mid florida lower florida
58:30
and that happened to be the day that
58:33
that was
58:34
when i was releasing billions of the
58:37
host to head
58:39
out to dc on the very day people heard
58:41
it they didn't know what it was they
58:43
could hear all over in this whole area
58:45
and down south floor they could hear it
58:47
they were looking for things in the sky
58:50
they couldn't find it there they were
58:51
hearing the spirit around the army of
58:53
heaven's activity
58:55
wow wow i had no idea i did not know
58:57
that
58:58
well let's do this we're at the time
59:01
would you pray
59:02
can we do something where you pray where
59:06
people are
59:06
right now in their houses and where you
59:09
where you command
59:12
things to leave yeah i'll do that also
59:15
i'll i'll do yeah i'll do an eviction
59:18
and i'll do the implementation at the
59:20
same time when you command stuff to
59:22
leave you need to fill it with God
59:23
right so father i think authority over
59:26
anyone's
59:27
home that they're living in right now or
59:29
the place they're living in it may not
59:31
be their home father
59:32
if there's any darkness there and they
59:34
don't want it
59:35
and they haven't caused it to happen
59:37
right now are you evicted
59:39
in jesus name you will go from those
59:42
places
59:42
you will no longer plague people attack
59:45
people your presence will not be known
59:47
i command the host of heaven to go in
59:49
there right now and crush and push back
59:51
and kick into a dry place every evil
59:53
spirit shred the platforms over those
59:56
people's places right now in jesus name
59:59
will no longer have the presence of the
60:00
enemy no fear no grief no
60:03
laugh no sickness get out in jesus name
60:09
now i impart the life of God into the
60:11
same place as God the
60:13
love of God the presence of God his
60:16
joy his celebration his expectation of
60:20
greatness in their lives
60:22
i thank you God that you love your
60:23
people you want to be free
60:26
in jesus name be filled with God
60:29
and go live your life for him amen
60:33
that was powerful i felt that thing wow
60:36
that was anointed
60:37
thank you again we put your uh what you
60:39
can't see it probably but we put
60:41
revealingheaven.com
60:42
on the bottom of the screen and then
60:44
tell people how to get to your other
60:45
website as well
60:47
yeah my my one website
60:49
revealingheaven.com is about my
60:51
corporation one quest international we
60:54
create and release
60:55
we release heaven on earth and create
60:57
things and put on
60:58
the earth that represent heaven and then
61:00
i have KatKerr.com
61:02
and that's where you go it costs nothing
61:05
to go there
61:06
there's so many hours of videos that
61:08
were made
61:09
from interviews like with patricia king
61:11
and other people
61:13
there's a lot of help to teach you how
61:15
to declare over your family members who
61:17
were not born again
61:18
i think how to lose stuff from your soul
61:20
which we kind of did a little bit
61:22
earlier it teaches you to be great in
61:25
christ
61:25
you were never meant or put in this
61:27
earth to be crushed down and pushed back
61:29
to be controlled to be beaten up you
61:31
were meant to rule and reign with jesus
61:34
christ
61:34
KatKerr.com is a spiritual platform where
61:37
the father son or holy spirit are
61:39
allowed to say whatever they want
61:41
sad that's what's on there it's also the
61:44
only place
61:45
in existence that you can actually go
61:47
and give to me online
61:49
if you find any other facebook any other
61:51
youtube there's a lot of fakes if
61:53
they're out there saying
61:54
send me money i need if they're saying
61:56
it's me it's not me
61:58
they're saying give to this person for
61:59
this cause over here that's not me
62:01

62:02
i do that personally myself i give to
62:04
places like that so katper.com
62:07
and revealingheaven.com my public
62:09
facebook page which i think they took
62:11
the word public alpha
62:12

62:15
youtube channel
62:16
and i can tell you God has greatness for
62:19
every believer on this earth it's up to
62:21
you to choose it
62:23
you have to choose it and say i'm
62:24
willing to do what you need me to do i'm
62:27
willing to go where you want me to go
62:29
and it says those who are willing and
62:31
obedient shall eat the fat of the land
62:33

01:51
green on

01:59

02:07
alliances 24 years ago
02:09
um this month 24 years ago well in april

02:14
and then a few years ago we started
02:16
elijah's streams which you're about to
02:17

02:18
with the next prophetic guest which is
02:20
kat Kerr so uh

02:25
if you are ready to run that zapa
02:28
commercial can we run that
02:29
for people to see if not we can go on
02:32
past but you need to let me know
02:34
one way or another he may have stepped
02:36
away
02:38
we have to say you cannot step
02:51
[Music]
03:05
[Music]
03:20
very good thank you jeff i appreciate
03:21
that that was very good yeah
03:23
we i don't want to run that every single
03:25
time but that is our organization
03:27
zap it is very facebook like friendly
03:30
and you can say what you
03:32
want to say we're not going to censor
03:34
you you can talk about
03:35
you can speak against planned parenthood
03:37
you can talk about vaccinations you can
03:39
do whatever you want to do
03:41
on that channel and we won't take you
03:43
down and
03:45
i don't see ourselves um
03:48
becoming like some of the others where
03:50
we're gonna edit all the news and say
03:52
this is fake
03:53
we're gonna i see ourselves uh trusting
03:56
the viewers to determine whether
03:57
something is fake or not i don't know
03:59
what maybe maybe time will tell
04:01
something else but uh let's see i think
04:03
that other than that make sure you
04:05
subscribe to elijahs.com
04:07
and when you go to the youtube channel
04:09
to subscribe what you
04:10
do do these there's a thumbs up a
04:13
subscribe
04:14
and a bell so you go to youtube.com put
04:16
in the largest streams as one word
04:19
and then when it comes up you do the
04:20
thumbs up the subscribe
04:22
and the bell and you will be notified on
04:25
your devices
04:27
when we're coming on or when a new
04:28
episode is either doing live or is about
04:30
to come on
04:32
and that will keep you in the know all
04:34
right so without further
04:36
delay let's bring on kat Kerr
04:39
she comes in there you go hi kat hi
04:42
happy st
04:43
patrick's day thank you say to you what
04:45
does your shirt say
04:46
read it read it to us it says you have
04:49
me at
04:50
uh shenanigans i'm gonna stand up for
04:52
just a minute there you go
04:54
you have me at shenanigans all right
04:57
and then of course it's a cat that's a
04:59
picture of a cat so that's where there's
05:00
a double
05:01
double wordplay you had me a cat yes yes
05:05
that's really funny it was a funny shirt
05:07
i think jen probably found it she finds
05:08
all the fun stuff
05:10
but just a minute before i start on um
05:14
america and i'd like to do a little
05:17
focus on st
05:18
patrick and before people get in their
05:21
mindset
05:21
it's so weird isn't it how people get
05:24
something stuck in their head and think
05:26
this is wrong or bad or maybe they were
05:28
told that or show that
05:29
i think it's important to share truth
05:31
whenever i can if i have truth on it
05:34
and number one the word say i'm going to
05:37
talk about that first for a minute
05:39
st patrick saint thomas you know saint
05:41
paul all these
05:42
words about calling people saints i do
05:45
know in the catholic church they
05:46
saint people but they weren't the first
05:48
ones guess who calls us saints
05:50
God in the bible it's called the saints
05:53
of God that's
05:54
all of us who belong to jesus christ so
05:57
you just can kind of let that thing go
05:59
it's something that kind of stuck in
06:01
different wet places but
06:03
um st patrick actually was a
06:06
great man of God who had received jesus
06:09
christ as a savior
06:11
now as a youth st patrick and i'll just
06:13
give you the dates
06:15
somewhere between 320
06:18
and 420 something that's when he lived
06:22
now that was still pretty close to when
06:24
christ was on the earth we're talking
06:25
about
06:26
300 some years after christ had died
06:29
or had been gone to heaven moved to
06:32
heaven let's say that
06:34
so he was still around pretty close to
06:36
when jesus had been here
06:38
and that was very uh stuck in his heart
06:42
so he was raised in a great family but
06:44
as a youth he was kidnapped
06:46
taken to ireland he was a laborer for
06:49
several years there
06:50
i think he worked the land or something
06:53
but he was a laborer he wasn't a
06:55
minister he wasn't a priest or anything
06:57
at that time
06:58
and so he fell in love with ireland he
07:01
fell in love with the people of ireland
07:03
so when he was finally uh set free
07:06
he went back to uh where he was from i
07:09
i'm not quite sure where that was i
07:11
think it was maybe britain or something
07:13
like that
07:14
he was from another country when he went
07:16
back found his parents let them know you
07:18
know he was okay
07:19
he decided to go back and preach the
07:22
kingdom
07:23
gospel to the people in ireland now at
07:26
that time
07:27
ireland had a lot of druids and wizards
07:29
and all that kind of stuff was going on
07:32
as it was in many places during that
07:34
time and so you can see even now
07:36
darkness raises up its ugly head
07:38
wherever the light of God is
07:40
to try to take over it didn't work back
07:42
then either
07:44
so patrick started going around just
07:46
preaching the gospel
07:49
he was not at the beginning in any part
07:51
of life the catholic church whatsoever
07:53
he went around preaching the gospel and
07:55
sometimes he would actually use
07:58
the um what is the three
08:01
gen the three leaf clover he would
08:05
use that to represent the trinity yeah
08:07
yellow oh the three leaf
08:09
he would pick a three leaf clover huh
08:10
okay clover he would use that to teach
08:13
people about the trinity
08:16
awesome jen's giving me pointers over
08:18
there
08:21
so we would use that to represent the
08:22
trinity and that's one of the reasons
08:24
why
08:25
it really does represent a lot about st
08:27
patrick it was something he used in his
08:30
ministry
08:31
so don't go saying it represents some
08:33
evil wicked thing people
08:35
you need to focus on what is the light
08:37
of God
08:38
and so he won many kings and then
08:40
eventually became
08:41
a part this is a funny part he became a
08:44
part of the catholic or catholicism
08:47
but he didn't teach catholicism i mean
08:50
he actually got into trouble at one
08:51
point
08:52
he would go win these kings these druid
08:54
kings to christ
08:56
and every time he won another one they
08:58
would light
08:59
a fire on the hill uh where that king
09:02
ruled where the druid king ruled
09:04
because that whole group would come to
09:06
christ and he
09:08
lit up a lot of ireland by winning these
09:10
kings to christ
09:12
and so finally some of the a normal
09:15
priest
09:16
and then the parishes got upset because
09:18
he wasn't collecting money to send back
09:20
to rome you know what you normally would
09:22
do
09:22
he wasn't establishing parishes so he
09:25
actually was called back to rome to see
09:27
the pope how about that
09:29
and these priests were hoping that pope
09:31
would say you can't do that anymore you
09:33
have to line up
09:34
with what we're teaching that's not what
09:36
the pope said to him
09:37
the pope told patrick you go back and
09:39
keep doing what you're doing
09:41
because you're making a difference for
09:44
jesus christ
09:45
and that knocked a lot of them so he
09:47
continued ministering and preaching and
09:49
winning these kings
09:51
to christ and he was at one time in
09:53
bangor
09:54
uh there was like a whole area called
09:56
bangor um
09:58
that's not like bangor maine bangor
10:00
island
10:01
and so much did he win the the loss
10:04
there
10:05
that they had luminous angels this is
10:07
all true
10:08
luminous angels began to show up with
10:10
patrick when he was going easter
10:12
or after he administered even to this
10:14
day in ireland in bangor
10:16
people still see those angels those
10:19
luminous angels which i can understand
10:20
because
10:21
like when i was in israel i saw the same
10:24
two angels who were in the tomb of
10:26
christ
10:27
when when mary questioned them and
10:29
another saw them
10:30
uh something remains where something was
10:33
done for jesus christ so patrick was a
10:35
great
10:36
winner of souls and he is uh i can tell
10:39
you he's in heaven
10:41
i've seen his mansion and because jesus
10:43
also has a sense of humor
10:45
he built patrick's mansion in a field of
10:48
five foot tall shamrocks
10:51
wow really yeah you see what in heaven
10:56
he did i did i saw him in heaven and uh
10:58
somebody's got all these shamrocks that
11:00
sing to him
11:01
and jesus christ because God has a sense
11:04
of humor
11:05
so there's your little tip on saint
11:07
patrick it's okay
11:08
you know to recognize who he was and uh
11:12
a lot of people are so lo love patrick
11:15
in heaven a lot of people want to talk
11:16
to him and share about
11:18
when the luminous angels would come and
11:20
we ran we
11:21
i did the story but i don't know if it
11:22
ran today or yesterday but
11:24
look on the elijah list elijah.com or
11:27
facebook we ran a story in saint patrick
11:29
that kathy walters wrote
11:30
and it talks about patrick raising the
11:33
dead
11:34
druid king and then the druid king
11:37
came to the lord but because he raised
11:39
his two children that had just died
11:41
apparently they died at the same time in
11:42
two different greek accidents so
11:44
and you know um i want to add that she
11:47
actually wrote a book i've never seen
11:49
anywhere else called the celtic
11:51
flames that talks about these uh
11:54
celtic uh men women of God that did
11:57
great things way back in that day and we
12:00
actually found out that
12:02
my husband has a in his family line
12:05
connects with one of those i think was
12:07
manuscr
12:08
which we didn't know about what a
12:10
powerful heritage
12:12
so celtic flames by kathy walters is
12:14
powerful
12:15
you need to get that if you want to know
12:17
more about these celtic uh
12:18
saints and great men of God that's good
12:21
thank you awesome
12:22
well we got to we're going to do at the
12:24
end at the last part uh
12:25
last half whatever all questions about
12:27
heaven we got a special treat for you
12:29
in that vein but before that what do you
12:31
have anything you want to add or
12:34
or tell us if anything new from the lord
12:37
regarding the whole trump
12:38
yeah i'm still hearing celebrate but
12:41
until i'm hearing this that
12:44
it is so much closer of course obviously
12:46
if it's been this long with all the
12:48
stuff going on
12:49
um of course any reports you get on the
12:51
fake news
12:52
that is still fake most of it's um still
12:55
made to support
12:57
the left and their wicked agenda maybe
13:00
you didn't even know that but there is a
13:02
battle
13:02
in the spirit right now not just for our
13:04
country but for the world
13:06
and it's not going to work this is what
13:08
the father says it won't work
13:10
these are not the perilous times it's
13:11
not the tribulation evil will not take
13:13
over at this time and i can tell you
13:15
what God is doing
13:17
is exposing what he must remove
13:20
because what we're going to step into is
13:22
so powerful
13:23
the greater days of glory the manifested
13:25
sons and daughters of God
13:27
us moving so freely not just in america
13:30
but around this world to take the gospel
13:33
to demonstrate manifest signs and
13:35
wonders never seen before
13:36
God has to deal with the evil in the
13:39
darkness
13:40
to give us the freedom to do that so if
13:41
you want to know what's going on
13:43
that's exactly what's going on and God
13:46
is still telling me the same thing he
13:47
has not changed since november the 4th
13:49
that he is going to deal with it their
13:51
justice will be brought i do know that
13:53
they're
13:54
still working on some of the um
13:57
indictments i can't talk a lot about
13:59
that but this definitely working on
14:01
indictments
14:02
uh so there's things going on you don't
14:04
know about that nobody can talk about
14:06
but yeah this is definitely it's not
14:08
over this is the beginning of something
14:10
powerful and it is powerful for God
14:14
God is over everyone he holds the air
14:17
all of us breathe
14:19
and in these days of his time on the
14:22
earth
14:23
guess what he's going to have his way so
14:24
keep thanking him
14:26
keep speaking against any darkness every
14:28
time i will say this every time you hear
14:30
another
14:31
illegal unconstitutional
14:34
wicked uh regulation or law being made
14:37
from up there behind the barbar you
14:39
yourself say i nullify those bills i
14:43
will not
14:44
live according to that way i believe God
14:46
is bringing freedom and liberty
14:48
but i will not participate with darkness
14:50
please say those words that will make a
14:52
big difference
14:53
in the atmosphere of your home and even
14:55
releasing things out into the atmosphere
14:57
of our country
14:59
so good so good well okay well we have
15:02
some questions for you we're going to do
15:03
something a little different with these
15:04
questions
15:05
last week at this time in fact they they
15:08
tell me it's on episode 15 at the 6
15:10
minute and 25
15:11
mark i began to have a word of knowledge
15:13
about a young woman i said you're in
15:14
your 20s and 30s
15:16
i said i see a ski cap on i see at the
15:19
end and the word the specific word that
15:21
i had you had a light blue
15:23
ski jacket on as if you were on the
15:25
slopes
15:26
and i said God wants you to be able to
15:28
ask your question
15:29
or questions of Kat i said i also see
15:32
that you have your own channel
15:34
and you're going to you're doing your
15:35
own videos now and so what happened is
15:37
she didn't get to us during the show but
15:39
after the show either on the replay
15:41
or we missed it by a few hours she said
15:43
i think i met
15:44
one and jeff go ahead threw up a photo
15:47
of her now
15:48
and that's a photo that's the exact face
15:50
i saw
15:51
the ski cap was like that now this is
15:53
one that she was in the books
15:54
because she said her name is ellen and
15:57
she said ellen said that
15:59
i just came off from the slopes of
16:01
norway she lives in norway
16:02
and she says i was wearing something
16:04
like that yesterday
16:06
before i came off the slope so so i
16:09
don't know if it's an exact match
16:10
because i don't have a photo of that
16:12
but this is ellen and that's the exact
16:14
face that i saw so
16:16
what i did is i've gotten to know her a
16:19
little bit and she actually
16:21
tells her testimony in one of her videos
16:23
it's the only one she's done in english
16:25
everything else is in norwegian
16:26
so we're going to play two minutes of
16:28
her testimony she really loves Kat by
16:30
the way she's been teaching all of Kat
16:31
stuff so
16:32
play her testimony there jeff it's about
16:34
two minutes
16:36
hi my name is norway and i just want to
16:39
share my testimony with you
16:41
i love jesus with all of my heart do you
16:44
know he loves you so much
16:45
more than you can ever know and he
16:48
exists he is there i had the privilege
16:50
of actually seeing him
16:52
so i had this great hunger for jesus
16:55
since i was a young kid really i just
16:58
longed for him i wanted to see him
17:00
i want to be with him i just longed to
17:02
live the way i saw people live for him
17:04
in the bible
17:05
and but i was not there and i didn't
17:07
know how to do that i didn't find him as
17:09
i just
17:10
i just did what he said in the word it
17:12
says that you can seek me
17:14
and you will find me if you seek me with
17:16
all of your heart so i decided to do
17:18
that and and i found him
17:21
so but a lot of stuff happened before
17:23
that so i got really sick
17:25
and i had over 37 symptoms in my body
17:30
and the doctors couldn't do anything to
17:32
help me and they just said
17:34
call if you're about to die you know so
17:37
i
17:37
i was bedridden and i couldn't i
17:40
couldn't do anything i had no strength i
17:42
have seizures
17:43
i had constant pain in my body i you
17:46
know i was dizzy
17:48
nauseous i couldn't eat properly i
17:50
couldn't sleep
17:51
probably and i i just had a lot of
17:54
things going on in my body and nobody
17:56
could help me
17:57
so but i knew that God could help me i
17:59
knew that he's real
18:01
and that he sees me and i started to
18:03
experience so
18:04
much with jesus when i was like i
18:06
started to see dreams
18:08
and visions he started to give me a
18:10
revelation he came with his presence
18:13
into my living room and one day
18:15
i was just seeking him and crying out
18:16
for him God i want more of you i want to
18:18
see you i want to be with you
18:20
and one day he just showed up in my
18:22
living room
18:24
and i saw him and he he did like this
18:28
on my face and and he smiled at me and
18:31
the whole room just
18:33
was filled with his glory and
18:36
his love it was just like liquid love
18:40
just going through my whole body and i
18:42
was completely
18:43
changed from that day on he was not
18:44
speaking to me with words
18:46
but he was speaking a whole book to me
18:48
just with his mind with his presence so
18:51
he could actually just say something in
18:52
his mind and i could hear it
18:54
and he just said like and i love you so
18:56
much nobody can love you like i am
18:59
loving you you know you came for me i
19:01
created you i have a great plan for your
19:03
life he just started to
19:04
just say all these things that i
19:07
actually knew
19:08
but when he said it it was like then it
19:11
really
19:12
hit me you know and it became my words
19:14
it just came
19:15
became so real you know that wow he
19:18
loves
19:19
me he sees me i am created by him
19:21
everything that is in the bible is true
19:24
and i was so amazed by his love
19:28
so good i'm sitting here smiling from
19:30
ear to ear she's just got such a sweet
19:32
presence and all that
19:33
so you said you've been in norway uh Kat
19:36
is that right
19:38
yes i did i get to speak there i went on
19:40
um
19:41
a scandinavian cruise where we went to
19:43
all the different countries
19:45
i got to speak in a dif a couple of the
19:47
different countries but norway was my
19:49
favorite because
19:50
the hunger that was there was amazing
19:54
and there's probably well over a hundred
19:56
young people that were going to start a
19:57
brand new network
19:59
this was probably maybe what maybe three
20:01
years ago and
20:02
they found out i was on the ship so they
20:04
sent a
20:06
message saying could she please come off
20:08
the ship we'll pick her up and
20:09
bring her here this is the beginning of
20:11
our studio we'd love for her to pray
20:13
over or prophesy
20:15
over the studio and of course i said yes
20:18
it was just amazing the beauty of the
20:21
presence of God that was in that place
20:23
and i loved it that their building was a
20:25
major building in the business district
20:27
which has beautiful artistic
20:30
it's so artistic the whole area was but
20:33
it was a round building i love round
20:35
the throne room is round i think
20:37
probably people's homes maybe end up by
20:39
reflecting that i used to say that but
20:41
the people in norway were not like what
20:43
people had told me
20:45
they're cold they don't care that was
20:47
not true
20:48
wherever God is working there's going to
20:49
be people who love him and love people
20:52
so it was a great time i really did
20:54
enjoy that very much
20:55
wow well you know and then i offered uh
20:58
ellen
20:59
a chance to ask her a question or two
21:00
and i got about seven of them so i
21:02
decided okay that's our show today
21:04
we're going to do her questions if we
21:05
run out which i doubt we will run out
21:07
but i've got other questions
21:08
beside if we finish up so with your
21:10
permission i'm just going to go for it
21:12
i'm going to i'm going to give you the
21:13
questions
21:13
ellen gave me in the order she gave him
21:16
to me okay okay that's great
21:18
question one does God the father and the
21:20
holy spirit have
21:21
their own house like jesus does
21:24
you know what she's the first person who
21:27
ever asked that of me
21:29
i can tell that she's really had uh time
21:32
with him
21:33
because the more time you spend with him
21:35
the more possibilities
21:36
open in your own soul
21:39
about these things and absolutely i know
21:42
the father does the father has
21:44
a place called his chambers and i've
21:47
seen that place it's just for him it's
21:49
just his spot
21:50
and people think he's super glued to the
21:52
throne he's not
21:53
jesus has his own mansion a father has
21:56
his chambers which would be his face
21:58
holy spirit usually is all over heaven
22:01
uh
22:01
seeing people and i know you say how you
22:04
can you see the outline of the image of
22:06
him you know it's him
22:07
he usually is normally right to the left
22:10
side of the throne we know jesus sits
22:11
next to the father on the right side
22:14
about holy spirit i've never seen an
22:16
actual place it's his
22:17
i think he takes all of it i think he
22:20
just claims
22:20
all of it and he's everywhere all over
22:23
the place so
22:24
yeah he's not usually like necessary i
22:27
would have said
22:27
holy spirit's not a loner he's a very
22:30
much engaging he wants to be with you
22:32
hello he has to live in us he better
22:35
like being with people and he does he
22:37
really does so
22:38
but i have seen the father's amazing
22:41
place
22:42
where i was invited to go there and this
22:44
this whirlwind
22:45
of glorious blue like with
22:48
eyes all in it this whirlwind came to me
22:51
when i was taken here
22:52
and it totally engulfed me and when it
22:54
stopped he was standing beside me which
22:57
i just got so undone again at that time
23:00
i looked like i
23:00
was eight he always takes me i look like
23:02
a little girl it was the most beautiful
23:04
time in the most beautiful times i ever
23:06
remember so i do know the father has his
23:08
own space
23:09
i'm sure he needs it like all of us do
23:11
sometimes and i'm sure he takes
23:13
others there but so that that's the
23:15
answer to that question
23:16
that's very very interesting well i'm
23:18
gonna get cover every one of our
23:20
questions we're gonna skip ahead to a
23:21
couple because you see this one's about
23:22
the holy spirit she says
23:24
what will our relationship with holy
23:25
spirit be like in heaven
23:27
will he still live in us will we have
23:30
one-to-one fellowship with him too
23:33
i don't think i don't i don't think that
23:35
relationship will
23:36
ever ever stop i don't think it's ever
23:39
going to stop
23:40
it just gets greater he has such a
23:43
personal one-on-one
23:45
with us because he lives in us and we
23:47
know christ in us
23:48
i know christ steps in and out a lot of
23:51
us and
23:52
christ will step out sometimes for me
23:54
when i was a little girl and i got born
23:55
again at four i literally saw him step
23:57
into me the holy spirit is different he
24:00
has a commission from
24:01
jesus himself and he was sent to this
24:04
earth to help guide us
24:06
to come alongside us but when we invite
24:09
holy spirit to indwell us
24:11
holy spirit does send a layer of himself
24:13
that's
24:14
elohim he moves right in and he will
24:17
speak to you 24
24:18
7 if you encourage that and he's like
24:21
i call him my best friend and i know
24:24
that's not going to stop when you get to
24:25
heaven he may continue to step
24:27
in and out of you but i think when
24:29
you're there you can see him whenever
24:30
you want to he may be outside of you
24:32
more than inside
24:34
uh that was necessary for us on the
24:36
earth and heaven we don't need so much
24:38
guidance and making sure that we stay on
24:40
the path
24:41
but i know that relationship that
24:43
friendship with him is going to grow
24:44
when we get to heaven
24:46
really really good good question okay
24:48
and she's got several that i've never
24:50
heard
24:50
um anyone asked so people say might be
24:54
saying well i hope they don't get
24:55
repetitive just so you can cover her
24:56
no these aren't repetitive so okay do
24:58
angels feel
25:00
cold and hot weather when they're with
25:02
us and do they get wet from rain or snow
25:05
or feel the wind it's a lot of storms
25:07
where i live so she wants to know
25:09
if the angels feel that i don't think
25:12
it affects him whatsoever i have never
25:15
seen my own angel
25:16
get wet even when it's raining
25:20
they're spiritual beings now i will say
25:22
this
25:23
there's a whole tribe of angels that
25:24
have flesh on their body before we were
25:27
even made
25:28
God made them for specific purposes if
25:31
they're
25:31
here they do feel the wet it doesn't
25:34
bottom they do feel the wet
25:36
they will feel the wind because they
25:37
have flesh on them it's not quite
25:40
like our flesh but he did put flesh on
25:42
them so they would be
25:43
seen on the earth they used to help
25:46
guide people
25:47
and teach people at a time in the earth
25:49
when knowledge was going to increase
25:51
and they're called watcher angels now i
25:54
do know this a couple of them were
25:56
some of the ones uh i've heard different
25:58
messages from different people or
26:00
prophets
26:01
i know that there are a tribe of them
26:03
some people have seen maybe 200 some
26:05
have seen maybe 30 40.
26:06
i do know that some of them did decide
26:08
to fall
26:10
back in the day when it says God set
26:12
boundaries for them when he sent them
26:14
that they would not
26:15
mix with humans they would only help to
26:17
inform them and give them information so
26:19
they could learn and grow on the earth
26:21
and then we all know that some of them
26:23
did mix with the women they created the
26:25
nephilim
26:26
and then they became wicked now those
26:28
are bound in chains the ones you create
26:30
in their form are bound in chains
26:32
they're not even here on the earth right
26:34
now there's still some
26:35
a lot of the good ones a lot of them um
26:37
their their leader is melchizedek who
26:39
also has flesh on him
26:41
and i know this is a little bit long
26:43
description but she asked so
26:45
if they're here in the flesh you would
26:47
see them you may not know that's who
26:49
they are
26:49
but they will experience the wind and
26:51
the rain
26:53
it doesn't affect them like they
26:55
wouldn't get roasted they wouldn't get
26:56
sunburned or something
26:58
but normally a spiritual angel made
27:00
spiritually
27:01
they're in the spirit realm and they
27:04
allow themselves to be seen sometimes
27:06
and in the spirit realm you wouldn't be
27:08
touched or affected which is the spirit
27:10
realms
27:10
all around this earth if you step in
27:12
there it'd be like a whole different
27:14
place they
27:15
are living there they're sending an
27:16
assignment from there so it's a
27:18
different kind of life
27:20
but the flesh would definitely feel it
27:23
you mean let me uh let me parlay off of
27:25
that you may remember i told the story
27:27
about seeing an angel for the second
27:29
time
27:29
i'd seen him over here in the states and
27:31
he corrected me
27:32
firmly i don't know if he's a guardian
27:34
age or one of these watchers
27:36
when i got lost in paris and at the
27:38
airport i had no phone no ability
27:40
anything i was saying lord how are you
27:42
going to help me and this
27:44
person put the newspaper down and it was
27:46
that person that i now recognize as an
27:48
angel
27:49
so could that have been any angel taking
27:52
the form of a human and looking at or
27:54
if i could see him does that mean he was
27:56
a watcher angel i'm
27:57
pretty certain well see even the ones in
28:00
the spirit
28:01
spiritual ones God can allow them to be
28:03
seen
28:04
they can appear a God can let them
28:06
appear they can even look like they are
28:08
human i will say this
28:10
most guardian angels look like us
28:13
uh they don't look like the army of the
28:15
army in heaven has a lot of creatures
28:17
and strange-looking things
28:20
they fight in war our guardian angels
28:22
don't usually fight in war
28:24
usually there's some of the hosts with
28:26
them when they go places
28:27
that was probably one of your guardian
28:29
angels and most of them would not
28:31
kind of corrupt you unless it was
28:34
probably your guardian angel
28:36
so you probably saw one of your guardian
28:37
angels oh interesting
28:39
fascinating all right this one um this
28:42
was really good i'm
28:44
again i never heard this question she
28:46
says
28:47
ellen can we create stuff with our own
28:50
words in heaven like God
28:51
if i said i want a necklace like this
28:54
and this
28:55
would it be created right in front of me
28:57
because i said it
28:59
now is she talking about when she goes
29:04
when she's talking about in in heaven
29:06
once she goes to heaven
29:08
will she will she speak things into
29:10
existence
29:11
to create them basically what she uses
29:13
the word create
29:14
or is that or does only God create and
29:17
you express the need
29:19
no we are his sons and daughters we're
29:21
supposed to be just like him if you will
29:22
remember he said
29:24
you're talking about mankind at that
29:25
point let us make man in our image and
29:27
let them
29:27
operate like us now it says let us
29:30
create men in our image and
29:31
after our likeness that word likeness
29:34
means crea
29:35
it means operate so God made us
29:38
to actually look or simulate him
29:42
and to act or operate like him
29:45
that kicks in so strongly
29:48
even now as believers this sounds wild
29:52
to y'all
29:52
even as believers when we call things
29:55
that mean as though they were you're
29:56
actually that's called a form of
29:57
creativity
29:58
you create things in the atmosphere in
30:00
your home places that you go
30:03
all the time uh by you speaking that's
30:06
what the manifested son and daughter is
30:08
that's why the earth is crying out for
30:09
us to stand up and say
30:10
no this is not going to happen no i need
30:13
that earthquake to go back the way it
30:14
was before it came
30:16
uh no i need to create and call forth
30:18
rain and crops out of the land
30:20
immediately those are some of the
30:22
greater works that we'll be doing on the
30:24
earth so absolutely yes
30:26
i was shown that we will actually get to
30:29
create
30:30
like God the one thing we will never
30:32
create is people
30:33
we will never create another tribe of
30:35
people or groups of people
30:36
God wouldn't do that to us okay
30:40
that will never happen but he actually
30:42
showed me like worlds that were blank
30:45
canvases and he said i'll send you there
30:47
you can create the you can create the
30:49
type of
30:50
uh like earth like is it mountainous is
30:53
it lakes
30:54
are there trees even some of the little
30:56
creatures we will so yes she's
30:59
absolutely right we will get to create
31:01
things
31:02
in heaven there's no wickedness in this
31:05
no evil no coveting no greed because
31:07
people in their natural mind think well
31:09
somebody could become like a lucifer
31:12
again that won't happen
31:13
but his ultimate goal is really for us
31:16
to be
31:17
like him we're not him we'll never
31:19
replace him
31:20
we won't ever be God but i'm telling you
31:23
we'll have great authority in heaven
31:25
that's why you need to be accountable
31:27
for your life right now the more
31:28
accountable you are now the more he can
31:30
give you
31:31
and as God told me the way you live your
31:33
life right now in the earth
31:34
determines your position not that you
31:37
won't go to heaven
31:38
but we will have levels of rulership and
31:40
creativity
31:41
according to how we were accountable for
31:43
our life here
31:45
that's good now ellen asked about
31:47
creating necklaces
31:49
and at the same time another
31:52
question came to me that was a similar
31:54
thing online asked about animals
31:56
it says might we be able to create
31:59
a life form like an ant like animals in
32:01
heaven so that i'm just gonna throw that
32:03
i came to me the same day
32:04
but not from airline or different i
32:06
think i mentioned that uh when he showed
32:08
me these blank worlds that he called a
32:10
canvas this is after everything's over
32:13
we're in the new heaven right we're on
32:15
the new earth i mean the new earth
32:16
that we won't just do normal things we
32:19
won't be bound just to the new earth
32:21
we'll have all of creativity that'll be
32:24
out there that he can go and take us and
32:25
say okay
32:26
see what you can create here what kind
32:28
of buildings
32:29
what kind of creatures now he's not
32:31
talking about
32:32
creatures that will look like humans and
32:34
act like humans he's talking about
32:35
little type of creatures that might be
32:37
kind of fun to do things with or stuff
32:39
like that
32:40
we can't the reason for that is this we
32:43
cannot create a soul
32:44
we never will create a soul a soul is
32:47
what makes you
32:48
operate in here uh but just to bring a
32:51
life to a little thing like something
32:53
i've already told people that when you
32:54
go to a christmas town in heaven you
32:56
build a snowman that snowman comes alive
32:59
for a certain time because the snow
33:02
itself
33:03
has life in it so wherever he takes his
33:06
life will already be put there by him
33:09
and we won't be left there alone because
33:11
i know someone's going to think that no
33:12
no angels will go with us the father
33:14
will be visiting holy spirit
33:16
we'll be going back and forth from the
33:17
new earth to whatever we're working on
33:19
it'll be like a project but absolutely
33:23
God says this day i offer you life and
33:24
death and it says life
33:26
does not say that power is in the tongue
33:29
life is in the power of the tongue
33:30
you need to be speaking life now and
33:34
bringing hope and joy if you expect to
33:36
do something
33:36
later on even in into the new
33:40
earth but we will absolutely have
33:42
creative ability but not for humans
33:44
not for things that have a soul in them
33:47
so
33:48
but the but the possibilities are almost
33:50
endless of what we can create
33:52
because our father is a creator he's a
33:55
commander
33:56
a creator um and those things that he
34:00
does and he said we operate similar to
34:02
him
34:02
that's why in the scripture God says
34:05
know ye not that ye are Gods but it's a
34:07
little g
34:09
most pastors won't even touch that
34:11
scripture they don't know what that
34:12
means
34:13
but we're made in their image the father
34:15
son and holy spirit and after the
34:16
likeness we will operate similar to them
34:19
more in heaven more on the new earth
34:21
than right here because
34:23
it'll be much freer there there's no
34:25
evil that's been done away with forever
34:27
but even in this time we're stepping
34:29
into such a powerful time which is why
34:32
all the stuff's going to be white a lot
34:33
of it will be wiped away right now
34:35
we will begin to call those things as
34:37
though they're not and then they will be
34:40
do you by the way do you know where that
34:42
i've heard that scripture
34:43
and pastors won't touch it because they
34:46
don't want to sound
34:47
mormon doctrine or something like that
34:48
so they'll say but it says don't know
34:50
you not that you are God's it's a little
34:52
g
34:52
where do you know remember where that
34:54
passage is by chance no i usually don't
34:56
once holy spirit tells me they they'll
34:58
quote
34:58
me i know it's there but it's not only
35:01
that the other scripture they don't
35:03
understand is when God himself says
35:05
command ye me
35:07
and they don't want to touch that when
35:08
they want we can't tell God what to do
35:10
you have to turn some scriptures this is
35:12
what the holy spirit tell me
35:13
sometimes you have to flip that
35:15
scripture he said that scripture
35:16
revelation on commanding me is
35:18
showing me you can command
35:22
like we command the weather we're over
35:24
the weather not under the weather
35:26
we have been given power over all the
35:28
power of the enemy
35:29
when we speak words forcibly and we have
35:32
pure hearts
35:34
something happens and so when God said
35:37
commanding me he wasn't saying
35:38
tell me what to do he's saying you say
35:41
what should happen
35:42
okay that's declaring the decree so i'll
35:45
find out where it is again can look it
35:47
up right now maybe she can tell us
35:48
before this yeah
35:49
if they tell it and and if my team finds
35:51
it they can type it on my screen and
35:53
then i can share it that way too yeah
35:55
um okay here's what she said i've heard
35:57
kat saying that jesus dances a lot with
35:59
people in heaven
36:00
does the father does God the father and
36:03
the holy spirit dance with people
36:04
in heaven like jesus does you know
36:07
you're probably gonna have to look up
36:08
look up another scripture it says in the
36:12
bible
36:13
i do know this absolutely he does
36:15
because this is
36:16
God this is the father of jesus christ
36:19
we
36:20
lived in him that's where everyone came
36:22
from we lived in him we played in the
36:24
river of life we jumped down the stones
36:25
of fire
36:26
it says very clearly in the bible he's
36:28
saying over us
36:29
and he danced it says he danced
36:32
and what that means is he can make
36:34
himself while he's sitting on the throne
36:36
people
36:37
this is the one who's over everything
36:39
that's why i'm not concerned about
36:41
anything
36:42
the one who's over everything can make
36:44
himself while he's sitting on the throne
36:46
make himself small enough to step inside
36:49
himself and
36:50
play with all those who are still in him
36:52
and that's what he would dance with us
36:54
he would sing
36:55
sing over us so absolutely he does do
36:58
those things
36:59
that's really really good all right now
37:00
this one
37:02
uh this one now she ellen heard
37:05
us talk about i had asked the question
37:09
and several people asked the question i
37:10
asked it for them if
37:12
if husbands and wives are having marital
37:14
relationships or people are undressed or
37:17
exposed
37:18
you know as far as you do they want to
37:20
know and you said well
37:21
at that case the angel waits outside the
37:24
door
37:24
but could come in to rescue you if there
37:26
was an issue right remember that
37:28
yes okay so she's following up on that
37:32
and she's talking about abuse and she
37:34
was very clear to me she said this is
37:36
not
37:36
my situation i didn't have this happen
37:38
to me but i'm going to read it she says
37:40
i heard Kat
37:41
say a few weeks ago on your show the
37:43
angels will not stay in the room when
37:45
people
37:45
make love but would rescue them if need
37:47
be so my question
37:48
is what do the angels do when people get
37:51
abused why do they not do anything i met
37:54
i once met a girl that said she prayed
37:56
every night for God to help her
37:58
but she was still abused a lot why do
38:00
angels not help them
38:01
which is a i mean that's got to be one
38:03
of the hardest questions you ever get
38:05
asked i would think probably
38:06
that's one of the ones i don't have an
38:08
answer to i do know God cares i know
38:10
this is a thing
38:11
this is what he actually did say this to
38:13
me there's evil on this earth
38:15
okay God does not ever promote evil
38:19
he never intended us to be abused
38:22
it's when people it's when the people
38:24
see we can't necessarily control the
38:26
soul of a person
38:28
when God sends you here he sends you
38:30
here to grow to be nurtured to know him
38:33
that was the purpose of why he made the
38:35
earth and by the way
38:36
for whatever reason he has rescued
38:39
different ones at different times
38:40
i don't understand why that happens but
38:42
i can tell you this he can
38:44
heal you from all of it he can make it
38:45
like it never happened to you
38:48
uh you can lose all that abuse from your
38:50
soul and he
38:51
jesus will come take it out so he made a
38:53
way to not have to hold it in your soul
38:56
but his answer was similar to that was
38:59
when he made this earth it was made for
39:01
us to come to earth and we have a body
39:03
so that we could have a body
39:05
not just remain a spirit so we could be
39:08
with him through all eternity even
39:09
christ
39:10
came to the earth out of body and then
39:13
return to heaven that's his purpose his
39:15
purpose is not evil
39:17
but we know how much wickedness is out
39:18
there right now well God didn't intend
39:20
that
39:21
God didn't create it people have a will
39:25
and there's a certain place that he that
39:27
he will not go
39:28
past her will and i don't know why
39:30
sometimes he does
39:31
unless there's more people praying for
39:33
them
39:34
that may have made a difference about
39:37
that if
39:37
that people outside strongly praying for
39:40
her
39:41
lots of times or they could send about
39:44
ask the angels to go and intervene i do
39:47
know sometimes that makes a difference
39:48
so it's important for you
39:50
to raise your child up to know how to
39:52
declare over those things and understand
39:54
things
39:55
don't always happen right that they
39:57
themselves can tell their angel i'll
39:58
give you permission to rescue me to
40:00
intervene at any time
40:02
it makes a difference how much you're
40:04
operating in it's not because God
40:05
doesn't care
40:06
it's how we establish the earth to
40:08
operate and if he
40:10
he's coming in to change and stop
40:12
everything
40:14
things some things just won't ever
40:15
happen and i don't know how to explain
40:17
that i can just say this God loves you
40:19
he despises evil and i will let you know
40:22
this
40:23
those people will not escape
40:26
punishment if they don't get born again
40:28
and repent for that
40:29
they will be punished more in hell than
40:31
others will so they won't escape their
40:33
punishment
40:34
ken i was trying to remember if you had
40:36
asked answered a question
40:38
similar to this um
40:41
someone said this and i don't remember
40:43
it was you as it talked about
40:45
God can
40:48
uh is patient wherever that sin
40:50
sometimes allows these things to happen
40:51
where he doesn't
40:52
intervene knowing full well that that
40:55
that is a tiny tiny tiny blip on
40:58
eternity where we will spend eternity
41:00
with him
41:00
is there anything to that did you ever
41:02
say that or where am i thinking of that
41:04
kind of a
41:04
no i don't think i'd said that but um
41:07
i got i can say this so whatever you
41:10
allow God to use for glory
41:12
even the hard things that you went
41:14
through uh
41:15
he didn't send you hear from him himself
41:18
saying well i'm gonna send them and all
41:19
these bad things
41:20
will happen when you know what it says
41:22
in heaven he wrote every day of your
41:23
life in a book
41:25
that didn't mean he wrote every evil
41:27
book of thing that would happen
41:28
he wrote everything he purposed for you
41:31
in your life
41:32
to become and to get to experience those
41:35
were good things those weren't
41:36
horrible things but because we have a
41:39
devil who's on this earth
41:41
and we ourselves and this is a real
41:44
serious
41:45
we have been tolerating it
41:48
our job here is to have power over all
41:50
the part of the enemy we
41:52
start declaring and taking authority it
41:54
says if you submit yourself under the
41:55
hand of God
41:57
is this right if you submit yourself
41:58
under the hand of God and resist him
42:01
that would resist him means you take
42:03
authority over him saying you're not
42:04
tolerating it i'm not putting up with it
42:06
you know i evict you right now when you
42:09
do that he runs from you
42:11
so this is the whole purpose for that
42:13
scripture
42:14
we've just been kind of sitting around
42:16
letting it happen
42:17
we're clueless to our authority and
42:19
dominion he gave us
42:21
on the earth christ died for us he
42:24
fought in hell
42:25
so that we could have all this given
42:26
back to us that's what we're supposed to
42:28
be living like and i can tell you what
42:30
starting now
42:31
two or three generations from now will
42:33
look so different because we'll be
42:35
walking in this great power and
42:37
authority
42:38
crushing darkness pushing it back those
42:41
attacks are going to be minimized
42:42
because we are
42:44
finally stepping in to what christ
42:47
gave to us okay good
42:50
that's good you know and i have to just
42:53
you know you just see
42:54
hear the breaking of glass like is these
42:56
old thought patterns that
42:58
people like us have were raised that
43:00
things are going to get worse and worse
43:02
and worse and finding the lord comes
43:04
only in the last number of years has the
43:06
seven mountain teaching come out that
43:07
we're now
43:08
supposed to invade society and bring
43:11
it back to God's yes his kingdom in
43:14
earth in heaven as
43:16
on earth as in heaven that just goes
43:18
against everything i was i was ever
43:20
taught by the way they gave me a couple
43:21
scriptures
43:22
psalms 82 6 i have said ye are Gods and
43:26
all of you
43:26
you are children of the most high that's
43:29
psalms 82 6 and
43:30
john 10 34 jesus answered them it is not
43:33
written
43:34
is it not written in your law i said ye
43:37
are Gods
43:38
so it's in the law itself and psalms is
43:41
part of the torah
43:42
it's like the the first five books in
43:45
psalms and proverbs is probably
43:46
considered the law
43:48
um and jesus said is it not written in
43:50
your law i said your God
43:51
and i'm thinking boy wasn't that a
43:52
little bit risky think of all the
43:54
other false theologies that are going to
43:57
come from that but
43:57
God can protect his own reputation yes i
44:00
guess
44:01
so he can say what he wants to say okay
44:06
jen did give me the john 10 34 also
44:09
um no you're not the er Gods but it's a
44:12
little g
44:12
it's not like you're him okay
44:16
yeah and can i i want to ask you one
44:17
more clarification on that
44:19
um because we talked about creating so
44:21
you could do the necklace you said
44:22
in heaven and he said he's not going to
44:24
have you do something that has a soul
44:26
but if if someone said well i want to do
44:28
this i've always wanted to have a
44:30
kitten that this characteristic could
44:32
they speak that in
44:33
existence or as a cat something that has
44:36
a soul so that's
44:37
not going to be something they can do i
44:39
think in the city
44:41
you talk about in heaven right yes all
44:43
in heaven
44:44
in heaven that depends on if you are
44:46
creating with the father
44:48
i think i do know that there's creation
44:50
lab that's a learning place in heaven i
44:53
was taken to you
44:54
and also that's where you when you go to
44:56
heaven you get to see him actually
44:57
making him in the word making the
44:59
heavens and the earth seeing how they
45:00
did that
45:01
there's another thing that goes on there
45:03
which i haven't spoken about where you
45:05
actually
45:05
learn how to do those things if the
45:07
father is with you
45:09
or if the lord is with you and you're
45:11
doing those things
45:12
they then can help create those other
45:15
things you said you always wanted
45:16
so i left that out so it's going to
45:18
share that another time but since you
45:20
brought that up
45:21
and if they're involved in it then yes
45:23
they actually and yes cats have souls
45:25
dogs have souls your soul is what you
45:28
vote
45:29
think with what you choose with uh
45:32
if if they're if they didn't have a soul
45:34
they couldn't decide what they were
45:36
going to eat who they were going to
45:37
trust
45:38
where they were going to go see if they
45:40
didn't have those and i'll take you back
45:41
even further to genesis where God told
45:44
noah put every animal on the ark
45:46
that has a spirit of life in it that
45:48
spirit of life is
45:50
their soul so therefore that when they
45:53
all came off the yard these
45:54
all these ones that were on there they
45:57
they have a soul they can think they can
45:58
make decisions
46:00
um that's why animals can be different
46:03
personalities
46:04
they would not be they'd be like robots
46:06
if they didn't have one so
46:08
i think yes i do know that when the
46:10
father and or the lord is with you in
46:12
this place called creation lab you won't
46:14
create people
46:15
i want to make that clear but there are
46:17
things you'll be able to create and if
46:18
anybody can actually give them that life
46:20
in there
46:21
it would be the father or the son
46:24
so that little spirit of life comes from
46:26
him
46:28
yeah good okay here's the next one from
46:31
ellen she says how many times
46:34
should i send the host out because you
46:35
teach people how to send the host the
46:37
warrior
46:38
the armies of God how many times should
46:40
i send the host out
46:42
in a day is there a question you can do
46:45
it 20
46:45
hours a day if you can stay up that long
46:48
okay
46:49
because and one of her things was she
46:51
said uh and there might be another part
46:53
here she said i'm not a seer i don't see
46:56
things happen although she has had
46:58
senior experiences because she saw the
46:59
lord walk into the room and touch her
47:01
face
47:02
that testimony but she says i'm not i
47:04
don't see things normally
47:05
so she's saying you know
47:09
after a while it's taxing because i
47:11
can't see i don't see them go
47:13
so it's kind of exhausting because you
47:16
don't see it
47:17
the results or you don't see them go
47:18
whereas you can't
47:20
get to see them take off right it's
47:22
called faith but there's
47:24
actually hundreds of thousands of people
47:25
right now doing it and they don't see
47:27
them
47:27
they know they go this is something God
47:30
gave us to do
47:31
it says right in the bible that our
47:33
weapons of warfare are not
47:35
natural they're not physical they're
47:37
spiritual and they
47:39
clearly says they they are mighty to the
47:41
pulling down the strongholds
47:42
that's the army of heaven they were
47:45
designed
47:45
to war for us they're they're a weapon
47:48
and if you invite them like the father
47:50
taught me i invite heaven's army to be
47:52
my weapon
47:53
just like the father said you get 100
47:55
right then will come to you
47:57
you need to start sending them out and
47:59
your army increases
48:01
and i think um there should be no
48:04
frustration in here
48:06
lose all the frustration or aggravation
48:07
you begin to feel that because that's
48:09
the enemy trying to steal
48:10
that from you saying nothing's happening
48:13
it's called faith you step
48:14
out in faith and do that with joy and
48:17
celebration because let me tell you
48:19
things
48:20
are happening in the spirit realm when
48:22
they go that's why they're designed
48:24
it's called faith i also even though i
48:26
see them
48:27
i still believe i know that God sent
48:29
them for that purpose
48:31
and i have millions now that are part of
48:33
my army because i don't stop
48:35
sending them usually i make a list
48:37
because if i hear stuff or i don't
48:39
usually watch the news if someone tells
48:40
me
48:41
these things are going on i make a note
48:43
and i will literally strategically send
48:45
them i don't randomly send them
48:47
they're strategically set like i have
48:49
started sending them right now
48:51
i say i'm sending a hundred of 100
48:53
million
48:54
to go back into dc to to go to begin to
48:57
pull down every stronghold of satan
48:59
ruling over the capitol building and all
49:03
the
49:03
fake administration i command the host
49:05
of evan to go and shred
49:07
platforms that demons are sitting on
49:09
also i have an authority over that
49:11
to go and pull them down right now and
49:13
when i say go go go what
49:15
happens just as you can have an image
49:17
shafts of light will
49:18
shoot past you this is what they look
49:20
like when they're leaving shafts of
49:22
light
49:24
it's them going trust me they're going
49:26
and they will go there and i can i'll
49:28
even say
49:29
for the next 10 days 24 hours a day
49:33
you will release the terror of God and
49:36
anyone in
49:38
anyone leading promoting or using human
49:42
trafficking against us on the earth
49:44
i want the terror of God to begin to
49:46
consume them 24 hours a day for 10 days
49:48
they'll be crawling around
49:50
at the end of that time so horrified
49:53
and convicted that what they're doing is
49:55
evil and God will bring judgment to them
49:58
so you have to understand what we allow
50:01
we're allowing this because we have
50:03
authority to do it
50:04
God's going to make sure that happens
50:06
those angels are waiting
50:08
to go do it but they don't have
50:10
authority they don't have power over all
50:12
the part of the enemy they've already
50:13
gone and wiped everyone out
50:15
they have to have orders we are
50:17
commanders because christ
50:19
is the lord of hosts he gave this
50:22
this for us to do you have to step out
50:24
in faith and
50:25
joy should be coming up in you joy
50:28
that's what should be there
50:29
that you're making a difference for
50:31
people in this world
50:32
you're using your authority christ gave
50:35
and so
50:35
as you do it your faith should be
50:37
building i know your army's building
50:40
they'll stand there and stare at you
50:42
waiting for you to send them
50:44
well you know it's just like i wish i'd
50:47
had this teaching much
50:49
when i was much younger but i mean most
50:51
of my life it's been
50:53
what can little old me do uh what you
50:56
know i don't
50:56
that's not my gift i'm not a warrior and
50:59
and i'm hearing you say God
51:01
it doesn't matter if you're a warrior he
51:03
assigned warrior angels to you but you
51:05
have the authority
51:06
they don't have you can send them they
51:09
can't send themselves is what you say
51:12
if i've never been a warrior i'm just
51:13
not good at spiritual warfare
51:15
i'm not good at fighting i can turn to
51:18
my host with all the faith
51:19
and say you go now to be seen this is
51:21
where i want you
51:22
to go and and even though you consider
51:25
yourself
51:26
kind of uh introvert
51:31
i was an introvert almost all my life
51:33
that was who i was it's not about in the
51:35
physical
51:36
who you are you're looking at the spirit
51:38
you're looking the physical who you are
51:40
i'm in the spirit you're a king and
51:43
priest unto God you have been given by
51:45
jesus christ
51:46
he looked at us and said i give you
51:48
power over all
51:50
all the power of the enemy and nothing
51:53
biting me shall harm me
51:54
that was for us he had turned to the
51:56
angels those angels have been waiting
51:57
all these eons to finally have orders to
52:02
be sent you can't send someone else's
52:04
army nobody can send your army
52:06
and that's not like me i don't like
52:08
violence i despise violence i don't want
52:10
to go in the physical and hurt people
52:12
but i have no problem being fierce in
52:14
the spirit realm
52:16
against the evil that's making all this
52:18
stuff
52:19
happen and let me tell you it will rise
52:21
up in you
52:22
and you will begin to understand when he
52:25
said we
52:25
rule and reign with christ we have that
52:28
authority we have to receive that
52:30
authority even if you
52:32
even though you don't feel it yourself
52:34
and in the emotions
52:36
you step out and declare what God has
52:38
said about you
52:39
and that's going to eventually come into
52:41
you
52:42
wow wow well there's one last question
52:46
regarding the host and i think i've
52:48
heard
52:49
uh variances on how this can be answered
52:51
she says can
52:52
everyone because she means believers
52:55
have a host in other words their own
52:57
army
52:58
no matter their age or maturity in
53:00
christ let's say they're very i guess
53:02
you're saying what if they're really
53:03
young and very immature
53:04
or very immature in christ do they still
53:07
have hosts to send
53:09
we have eight-year-olds at command
53:11
armies we have eight-year-olds we have
53:13
10 year olds that do
53:14
it all the time uh they'll make little
53:16
notes in a journal
53:18
something angels oh absolutely they're
53:20
the ones who have no problem believing
53:22
it
53:23
our natural mind or our physical mind
53:26
will
53:26
fight against it i'm nobody i'm not
53:29
worthy
53:30
even though the word clearly says what
53:32
jesus said
53:34
clearly if you are a believer born again
53:36
believer
53:37
and you're not actively you have to add
53:39
this if you're not actively sinning
53:41
if you're not actively partnering with
53:43
darkness because they won't listen to
53:45
you
53:46
if you're out there using profanity all
53:48
the time guess what you attract hell's
53:50
army to you
53:51
hell's language is profanity you can't
53:54
be swearing up a storm and then tell the
53:56
angels to go somewhere they won't go
53:58
anywhere
53:59
so you have to be accountable for your
54:01
life for your words
54:03
in order for this to operate you can't
54:05
think you're sending an army if you're
54:06
shredding your wife
54:08
if you're sweating your husband they
54:10
hearken under the word of the lord
54:12
that means when you speak you sound like
54:16
him okay you're taking authority over
54:17
darkness not letting it in your house
54:20
what are you watching are you watching
54:22
r-rated movies all the time
54:23
they're not going to listen to you
54:25
because those things have a right to
54:27
invade your life
54:28
this is the way the holy spirit says
54:29
what you enter into
54:31
will enter into you so there are
54:35
guidelines and there's places you can go
54:37
and listen to me say that
54:39
um i've already i've made a cd called
54:42
invite heaven's army
54:43
uh it's in our store if you want to see
54:45
that but all the videos i put out there
54:48
i actually teach whole congregations how
54:50
to invite heaven's army what that means
54:52
what the protocol is what your uh
54:54
what your accountability is with them so
54:57
there's
54:58
guidelines you can't sound and look like
55:00
the world and think the army's gonna
55:02
listen to you but if you're
55:03
living your life for christ they were so
55:07
happy to go and pull down the
55:08
strongholds of darkness
55:10
and begin to shift things and this is
55:11
what the father said
55:13
one of the number one ways you will keep
55:15
your life
55:16
in these days is to have an army to come
55:19
in because their number one job
55:21
if you're operating correctly is to
55:23
protect you
55:25
good good you know i have one other
55:27
question that occurs to me
55:29
donald trump you could say he's a newbo
55:31
he's like a baby christian he's been at
55:33
it probably
55:34
for four years when he's really
55:36
dedicated his life to the lord
55:38
so you would say well maybe he's an
55:39
immature christian or a baby
55:41
would he have either the same authority
55:44
if not more authority to command
55:46
host of heaven to go fight on behalf of
55:48
the u.s and different countries
55:50
um because he's a literal king on the
55:52
earth
55:53
um would he have the same authority if
55:56
he knew
55:56
what authority could he get even more
55:58
done with less armies
56:01
on the earth could he do that i think he
56:03
has the same authority that i do
56:05
or you do as a believer um
56:09
he is the president and i still call him
56:11
that because he actually did win the
56:12
election
56:13
that's one of the plans i have when i
56:15
finally get to meet him is i'm going to
56:16
teach him how to invite heaven's army
56:18
and send them because i think
56:20
he'll be one of the most fierce people
56:22
on the earth i know that when he finds
56:24
true believers who operate the way God
56:27
gives us to
56:28
he gets excited he wants to know
56:31
he wants to learn and i can tell you
56:33
right now if anybody right now is
56:35
disgusted
56:36
it's him because he came under the
56:39
commission of God to make america great
56:41
which he did do
56:42
and even though someone stole this last
56:45
election it won't interfere with him
56:46
completing the call God gave him to be
56:49
president here
56:50
he does not know about that he knows
56:52
angels intervene
56:53
he asks the christians or the people he
56:55
knows to pray all the time please pray
56:57
he's even said that publicly
56:59
he understands that prayer does do
57:01
things but when he ever
57:03
gets this thing about the army trust me
57:05
he's going to invite heaven's army to be
57:08
with his weapons and he will use that
57:10
weapon yeah
57:11
and you know i couldn't even imagine him
57:12
in the natural he would have to send
57:14
armies
57:14
for this and that that he could never
57:16
talk about but in this private time he
57:18
just goes now lord
57:19
i just sent the troops i'm sending the
57:21
host to go along with them right
57:23
yes oh absolutely we i actually all the
57:26
time my husband especially
57:28
has a call by God to speak on behalf of
57:30
the first uh
57:32
responders whether it's firemen or
57:35
policemen or the military
57:37
he was in the marines that's still in
57:39
him he declares over them he sends the
57:41
host with them all the time
57:44
um to to be with them so absolutely that
57:46
could be somebody's assignment man i'm
57:48
going to watch what they're doing
57:49
and i'll always send the host where i
57:51
hear things going on
57:52
uh you know to go in there and help them
57:54
they absolutely will go and do that
57:56
and and to finish this point what you're
57:59
saying is
58:00
God could send uh the host of heaven
58:03
and probably does but primarily he's
58:06
made the host of heaven to respond to
58:08
to us to our orders right is that what
58:11
you're saying so it's
58:12
so you say well nothing's happening well
58:14
maybe not enough people are sending
58:16
their armies
58:19
i would say this it will accelerate
58:21
things if they were doing that instead
58:22
of like
58:23
complaining or just dropping on you know
58:26
i just think nothing's happened you know
58:28
enough time has gone by that's what a
58:30
lot of the christians are doing not all
58:31
of them
58:32
well God had enough time to do something
58:34
so he's mad at us
58:36
or is too evil it's not to evil people
58:40
this is the thing you need to focus on
58:42
what God wants and what God says and
58:44
what his word says
58:45
but God does send in the past and i will
58:48
say in the past
58:49
he would send the army when israel even
58:52
says so in isaiah it might be isaiah 13.
58:54
when israel cries out for God to come
58:57
and defend them
58:59
at that time he would literally send the
59:01
army of heaven to fight
59:03
on behalf of israel and there's stories
59:05
in there
59:06
one angel killing so many of the wicked
59:08
evil people
59:09
won okay and God sent them at the
59:12
request of this
59:13
group who were in agreement who
59:15
represented him on the earth he
59:17
absolutely
59:18
will do that and he still does in some
59:20
groups
59:21
who pray and cry out to God to do things
59:23
for him he does answer that
59:25
but that army was made for one reason
59:28
they don't defend heaven they don't
59:29
defend the trinity
59:30
they're here to war with us and that
59:34
scripture clearly says that so yes
59:35
we have a great authority christ himself
59:38
was the lord of hosts
59:40
he said walking as a man if i wanted to
59:43
i could call the army of heaven to come
59:45
and fight
59:46
on my behalf but i'm not going to do
59:48
that and he said that to the sanhedrin
59:50
when he was standing before them
59:52
you know they were spotting off we'll
59:53
just do what we want to to you he
59:54
actually made those words so that was a
59:56
that was a clue
59:58
if he walked as the son of man and the
60:00
son of God
60:01
he could have called the army himself
60:02
said get down here right now
60:04
fight these individuals i'm not going to
60:06
be killed i'm not going to be crucified
60:08
they would have come and wiped them all
60:09
out but he couldn't do that because he
60:11
had to die for our sins so there's
60:13
there are scriptures that talk about
60:15
this and most people don't understand
60:17
but i promise you right now since 2014
60:22
a scroll was opened in heaven and i saw
60:24
it
60:25
and the scroll read itself it is time
60:28
for the host of heaven to complete their
60:30
destiny
60:30
being commanded by the believers on
60:34
planet earth and when that happened that
60:36
we entered it in a whole new time in the
60:38
spirit realm
60:39
for us to be commanders like christ
60:43
wow wow wow wow that's so good
60:46
that's our time um tell people how they
60:49
can get ahold of you i see we have
60:51
revealingheaven.com up on the screen and
60:53
then you have another you have another
60:55
site too
60:56
yes i have a revealinghaven.com is
61:00
about my corporation i'm a ceo of a
61:02
corporation one quest international
61:05
and God commissioned us to reveal and
61:07
create heaven on earth with products
61:09
that represent heaven instead of the
61:10
darkness
61:12
and then i have Katker.com which is
61:15
uh my spiritual platform for God to save
61:18
whatever he wants there's a lot of
61:19
revelation on KatKerr.com
61:21
and if you want to give to me online
61:23
that is the only way you can do it
61:25
online
61:26
there's no other if there's other things
61:27
out there there's fake
61:29
uh there's a lot of face fake Kat
61:31
facebooks
61:32
and there's a lot of fake youtubes but
61:35
but
61:36
my actual websites are the only place
61:38
where number one you can get
61:39
products on revealingheaven.com or sign
61:42
up to become a part of our guardian zone
61:44
on KatKerr.com
61:46
and you know people are always going to
61:48
fake things to try to use them
61:50
i know some of the fake facebooks will
61:52
say give money to these missionaries i'm
61:54
collecting it and it looks like
61:56
me saying that there's my face on and
61:58
everything but that's not me
62:00
i don't i don't do that i will always
62:02
come separately
62:03
to do that uh maybe at an in-person
62:05
meeting i may take up stuff for other
62:07
people or other groups but
62:09
i'm not going to do that online because
62:11
then everybody else would be would be
62:13
getting away with it so i think we even
62:14
have a brand new fake facebook page and
62:18
this is the way you can tell if it's
62:19
mine
62:20
if it has a proper date when i open my
62:23
facebook they
62:23
the only facebook puts the date you
62:25
started on there
62:27
so anything that's got a new date saying
62:29
that's me
62:30
it isn't me i think you can go in
62:32
somewhere how do you find that jen
62:34
you have to go in to where it says about
62:37
and there's a place on the facebook page
62:39
it says about
62:40
me and if it when is the date it says it
62:43
um
62:43
your facebook page was created in april
62:46
of 2016.
62:47
april 2016 that facebook page
62:50
better say and about me it better say
62:52
that's when my facebook page was created
62:54
that
62:54
proves that that's my personal one
62:57
people are creating them right now and
62:58
it's saying this year
63:00
you know this year this page was created
63:01
this year that's not me
63:03
and that's probably a tip for you also
63:05
steve that if people go in and they want
63:07
to try to pretend they're fake that
63:09
they're you so they can get
63:10
money they're getting money for their
63:11
self and i will not tolerate that i
63:13
don't charge for people to watch my
63:15
videos
63:16
i don't put commercials on those that's
63:18
youtube or facebook
63:19
so i can't control when they do that
63:22
it's not on my own
63:23
it's on the other on these other ones
63:25
and people get paid for that so you know
63:27
what we have to continue
63:29
our life and our race to do what God
63:31
wants us to do
63:32
but there are things that you can do to
63:35
uh
63:35
to stop those people from doing that
63:38
okay
63:39
well kat thanks again and very very much
63:41
let's see tomorrow
63:42
folks uh timothy dixon i've been calling
63:44
him
63:45
truck driver and prophet timothy dixon
63:47
he's about to now be a truck driver the
63:49
lord's pulling him off the road it
63:50
sounds like
63:51
which is good because he's just he's
63:53
devoting himself to the lord
63:54
and then on friday is yvonne yvonne
63:57

01:48
look similar to this so
01:50
the swirls are different and the flags
01:52
are different places but
01:54
there's another one that arrived the
01:55
other day a different kind of a
01:57
patriotic pattern that someone sent me
01:59
and it got separated from the envelope
02:01
so
02:01
next time when i wear it the first time
02:02
i'll point that out but i'm not sure if
02:04
i know who to thank for it because it
02:06
got separated by
02:08
accident uh anyway welcome to uh

03:08
tells me how long it is and so it's a
03:10
lot more
03:11
intuitive and easy to grasp and if
03:14
you're trying to find one show at a time
03:16
from
03:16
days and days ago on facebook that's so
03:19
that's a hard task
03:21
um jeff i forgot to prepare you for this
03:23
but do you want to run the zafa
03:24
commercial this is our
03:26
uh social media if you if you're
03:28
prepared for that
03:29
we'll run
03:32
[Music]
03:56
[Music]
04:09
all right i love that commercial we'll
04:11
do some more clever ones along the way
04:13
we're just having
04:14
fun growing it be sure to try and uh i
04:16
should say try i would get
04:18
sign up and register for zap but we're
04:20
very facebook like
04:21
it's very intuitive we're fixing bugs as
04:24
we go we hired a new coder
04:26
yesterday to help us with our app the
04:29
app
04:29
you can find zap it in the app store for
04:32
um either
04:33
android or iphone technology
04:36
and you can say what you want of a
04:38
conservative nature you will not be cut
04:40
off
04:41
or censored if you say i don't like
04:42
planned parenthood they're killing
04:44
babies
04:44
we're not going to cut you off for
04:45
saying that so uh
04:47
i want to say one thing real quick about
04:49
the facts is we get
04:51
hundreds of requests demanding that we
04:54
tell you whether God says you can or
04:56
cannot shoot or should not take the
04:57
vaccination
04:58
i have to tell you that there are fine
05:00
christians on both sides of this issue
05:02
people that love the lord with all their
05:04
heart
05:04
there are people who totally believe
05:06
this is science is good the science of
05:08
the facts is good they say
05:10
they're not worried about the mark of
05:11
the bees and they're going to take them
05:12
back so we don't
05:14
cut there are people on this list who
05:16
are that way there's other people on
05:17
this list who
05:18
who will never take it i'm the one i'm
05:20
among those i'm not going to take the
05:22
vaccination
05:23
i don't trust it i don't think it's the
05:25
mark of the beast but i don't trust it
05:26
i'm trusted for health wise
05:28
and i don't know if they put things in
05:30
it that they shouldn't put in it so
05:33
we don't ask Kat every other way people
05:35
are
05:36
writing and they're kind of twitter
05:38
painted to use a word
05:39
and they'll say please don't ask Kat if
05:42
if it's a sin to take
05:43
the vaccination she answered that a long
05:46
time ago said no it's not
05:47
they've asked if if it's the mark of the
05:49
beast he said no it's not
05:51
they've asked her if she's going to take
05:53
the vaccination and she said no i'm not
05:55
i'm not Kat's not my wife's not probably
05:58
most of you are not but we don't we're
06:00
we're not medical doctors we don't
06:03
have the right to tell you that it
06:06
doesn't work or that will harm you
06:08
we are um ministers of the gospel and
06:12
prophetic people so
06:14
uh what's your way to get a shutdown is
06:16
if we took one hard stance on it and
06:18
said you must do this and we must not do
06:20
that
06:21
we could be shut down and then then
06:22
people say well you should be brave
06:24
enough to say
06:25
this or that well we could be brave
06:27
enough and then be shut down
06:28
what but what good did that do us so let
06:31
your conscience be your guide it's not
06:33
taking the mark of the beast if you try
06:35
and stay healthy
06:36
i don't intend to take the vaccination
06:38
others of you watching
06:40
are perfectly happy to take it um
06:43
you know we just have to do what we what
06:45
we feel to do the bible talks about
06:48
don't don't i'm going to paraphrase it
06:50
but to stay out of disputable matters
06:52
don't
06:53
don't get into each other's face about
06:54
disputable matters of the law or
06:56
anything else so that's a disputable
06:59
matter
07:00
because fine christians are on both
07:02
sides of that issue so we don't tell you
07:03
what to do
07:04
on that okay
07:08
i think oh one one last thing today
07:10
we're pushing out in fact
07:11
it may be in your um inbox right now
07:14
here on elijah list
07:16

07:39

07:47
best revelation for this hour so it's
07:49
going to be really good at 69
07:51
and that helps pay for the people to and
07:53
we spent weeks and weeks and weeks weeks
07:55
getting ready for this so
07:58
that helps us pay the bills and all of
07:59
that all right so without further ado
08:02
let's bring in kat Kerr
08:04
the pink revelator hey how are you kat
08:07
i'm great thanks good to see you
08:11
so i don't know if you wanted to add
08:14
anything else that i said about did you
08:15
hear what i said about the vaccinations
08:18
yeah i will add a little bit if that's
08:19
okay sure go ahead
08:22
i also know people just like you said on
08:25
the list
08:26
some are adamant we need to take it it's
08:29
going to help everybody be safer
08:31
uh then we have them to say i'll never
08:33
take it they can't force me to take it
08:35
well i will confirm what you said i'm
08:38
not taking it
08:39
why would i okay my first question is
08:41
why
08:42
i have nothing wrong with me i'm not in
08:45
any kind of a
08:46
place that i might be compromised my own
08:48
life right now i'm extremely healthy
08:50
happy
08:51
and i'm listening to what God says and
08:53
so well i'm not taking it
08:55
my family my immediate family is not
08:57
taking the vaccine
08:59
and again i know people on both sides
09:02
friends
09:02
good friends who know somebody they know
09:05
a family they had
09:06
a lot of people in it one died and it
09:10
didn't even necessarily was
09:11
from the vaccine everyone else who took
09:13
it was fine
09:14
on the other side i know somebody who
09:17
had a husband and wife both took it and
09:19
one died and one did not
09:20
now the thing is this i know that
09:23
there's many different
09:24
types and forms of that vaccine which is
09:26
true
09:27
there's about four or five different
09:29
versions of it this is the thing
09:31
i may have trusted it when trump was
09:34
sitting
09:34
where the villain fraudulent person is
09:37
sitting
09:38
but because they're not i won't trust it
09:41
i'm like steve i don't trust it i don't
09:42
know what's in it i don't know the
09:44
makeup of it
09:45
i know there's sources that have so many
09:47
conspiracy theories almost about
09:49
anything you can think of today
09:50
there's a theory for it i'm not taking
09:53
it that's my answer and i will not take
09:55
it
09:56
and i would suggest if you are not in
09:58
any way prone to thinking
10:00
you have symptoms why would you all
10:02
right i don't think putting anything
10:04
extra in your body
10:06
is necessary if you're already healthy
10:08
so that's my answer on that i've had
10:11
things from both sides say both things
10:13
you have to do it gives you peace
10:16
seriously
10:17
if you're very concerned about it then
10:19
don't do it
10:20
if you think maybe this might help me
10:24
pray again before you go make sure you
10:25
still have that peace but
10:27
my recommendation for myself and my
10:29
family is
10:30
we are not even considering it and if
10:32
they demand i take it before i travel
10:35
then i won't be traveling
10:36
and for an example the royal caribbean
10:39
cruise lines which i always speak on i
10:41
will not be speaking on them until it's
10:43
changed because right now they're saying
10:45
that you must have the vaccine and proof
10:48
of the vaccine
10:49
to come on board that means even the
10:52
speakers
10:53
or you have to have a an exam that says
10:55
you're perfectly clear
10:57
from any symptoms whatsoever but i think
10:59
right now they're
11:00
changing that more and more as we go
11:02
along for the protection they say of
11:04
everyone on the ship so i will not be
11:06
speaking on royal caribbean
11:07
not this year anyway so here's my
11:11
my say in all of that do it gives you
11:13
peace
11:14
but i say if there's nothing wrong
11:16
you're healthy why bother
11:17
that's good now some of you may remember
11:19
manuel johnson came on and said God
11:21
transported him into 2022
11:23
he was in california he said in
11:25
california in 2022 there were no masks
11:28
anymore it was gone so if that's if that
11:31
was accurate and we have no reason to
11:33
believe it's not
11:35
uh things are going to look good and to
11:37
that end let me just add more
11:38
one more quick thing we are so confident
11:40
that that's about to go away that we
11:42
have been
11:43
arranging an israel trip uh for those of
11:46
you watching
11:47
kat Kerr is going to be our featured
11:48
speaker on that trip
11:50
uh we did this about two years ago well
11:52
it'll be three years ago by the time
11:54
it's a year from now it's april april of
11:57
2022 i think is the day
11:58
i think it bridges april may we're going
12:00
to do a Kat Kerr's
12:02
steve schultz elijah's dreams tour of
12:04
israel
12:05
uh it'll be a big one because we have a
12:07
real loyal following here through a live
12:09
stream so get ready
12:10
we'll announce it officially in the next
12:12
couple weeks to give you a link to sign
12:14
up with so
12:15
that'll be fun i want it oh yes it was
12:17
really a life-changing experience in
12:19
every way
12:21
and uh the other thing i probably should
12:23
add also
12:25
is that God did tell me himself that he
12:28
would take the virus
12:29
off the earth so that would not and not
12:32
exist anymore i also do know
12:34
like manuel the mask will be a thing of
12:37
the past
12:38
and i in the in the near future i saw no
12:41
mass
12:41
no i don't know if that was a year two
12:43
years three years but i know there were
12:44
no masks at the time that i was taken
12:46
there
12:47
the virus was not even mentioned and
12:49
just so you know this the numbers are
12:51
literally
12:52
going down and continue to go down on
12:54
that
12:55
i think the other side the left would
12:56
like for us to stay masked and so
12:59
distant so that we can't communicate
13:00
with each other we all know that well
13:02
most of you should
13:03
know that by now but even that's ending
13:06
i think people americans will wait just
13:08
so long for something they'll start
13:09
doing what they know is their freedom
13:11
right
13:12
many of them are going back to work full
13:14
time many of them are stepping out and
13:15
just doing what in their normal life
13:17
they would do
13:18
so that's all a great sign even if the
13:21
left doesn't like it
13:23
you just can't trust any of those in
13:25
leadership right now not
13:26
not the ones in the in dc right now
13:29
because their whole agenda is against us
13:32
against america and if this is the first
13:34
time you've heard it you've probably
13:35
been hiding yourself in a hole
13:37
uh all the things that they want to
13:39
happen are all very negative
13:41
act some of them actually break and
13:42
misuse our constitutional rights
13:45
so i don't trust them at all in any way
13:47
i do know they will be replaced again
13:49
i might as well start right now trump is
13:52
actually at this moment our actual
13:54
president he won the election
13:56
many things are still going on behind
13:58
the scenes and you may hear about some
14:00
of them coming up
14:01
really soon especially about
14:02
communications yay
14:06
but then they're definitely starting to
14:07
happen in the country in the people
14:10
and and the plans to uh take back our
14:12
country
14:14
that's good now one lady wrote and she
14:16
said could you ask
14:18
Kat uh next several have written but
14:20
maybe two or three and one of them said
14:22
can you be sharing house Kat to tell us
14:23
which things
14:24
she's getting from the lord and which
14:26
things she has natural knowledge of
14:27
so i don't know if there's a way you can
14:29
address that because as prophets the
14:31
bible says
14:32
we know in part we can't not know what
14:34
we know
14:36
and then we are we're prophesy apart so
14:38
God's told you
14:39
so God took you into the future and
14:41
showed you
14:42
being president that's not natural
14:45
knowledge that's
14:46
supernatural knowledge right that's
14:48
called revelation and
14:49
almost everything i say
14:52
is revelation i'm here to share
14:55
revelation that comes from the mind of
14:57
the father
14:58
it's what he says over what man says a
15:01
very few things number one
15:03
i never will research anything he
15:05
doesn't let me research
15:07
i don't listen to other people's things
15:09
sorry out there i don't listen to their
15:10
blogs i don't watch
15:12
their other stuff that's going on i
15:14
don't read other people's books
15:15
he won't let me do that he wants my soul
15:18
to be free
15:19
of any kind of clutter other than what
15:21
he says
15:22
so i'm not online looking to see what
15:24
everybody else is saying doesn't
15:26
happen i don't do that it's really good
15:28
there's a lot of
15:29
directly from him and when he said he'd
15:31
take the virus off the earth that was
15:33
him
15:33
when he said the mask would be a thing
15:35
of the past that was him when he said
15:37
trump would be put right back as
15:38
as sitting as their president that was
15:40
him that income from anybody else's mind
15:43
that came from him that's good and i
15:46
think
15:47
one more thing today is march 24th i'm
15:49
going to start
15:50
saying that because so many people are
15:52
taking videos and saying they're from
15:53
two years ago
15:55
or some from two years ago they're
15:56
saying they're for now and that happens
15:58
a lot to me so i've had probably so many
16:00
requests
16:01
please give the date so today is march
16:03
24th 2021
16:06
that's good that's good yeah that
16:08
there's an unethical behavior out there
16:10
it's
16:10
basically against the law but people are
16:12
getting away with it they download
16:14
this video they did it to me they've
16:16
been doing it almost every day we have a
16:18
new report
16:20
and it's illegal it's illegal to do that
16:22
but they download it they cut it down to
16:24
some of the parts they cut off the
16:25
beginning
16:26
they cut off the end and they make it
16:28
look like it's their own production that
16:30
they did this video
16:31
and they're making money by putting
16:33
advertising on is extremely unethical
16:36
we record it every time we can because
16:39
uh it's not that we don't want it out
16:40
there but it's the ministry that's
16:42
putting it out we want the ministry to
16:43
be responsible for it
16:45
and we want people to know the date
16:46
that's why i said the date at the
16:48
beginning of every show as well yes
16:50
the same thing i mean i think we make it
16:51
to the point where we put it on a
16:53
subscript
16:54
where it's always on the screen where
16:56
they can't take it off that way
16:58
that would be a good idea i actually was
17:00
thinking about that myself
17:01
to have a way to do that and then
17:03
there's no way they they just wouldn't
17:05
have the video right
17:07
they wouldn't be able to say that but
17:08
it's happened almost from the beginning
17:10
of me speaking
17:11
there's like four or 500 hours of me on
17:14
youtube talking about heaven
17:16
and that's because a lot of people of
17:17
course have have shared in senate places
17:20
but i think i've probably talked that
17:21
many times
17:23
and there's so many different dates
17:25
people don't know if it's for now if
17:27
it's four years ago
17:28
and so i'm going to start doing
17:30
something i will come up with something
17:31
also so that people know the actual date
17:33
that we're doing
17:34
which i think is important if you're
17:36
making prophetic statements
17:37
it's very important to know what day
17:39
you've said that yeah it is i mean
17:41
there's people
17:42
i've stumbled on this three or four
17:43
times someone did it and i didn't know
17:45
at the first
17:46
that they were copying i thought this
17:48
must be their channel because you have
17:50
to look closely sometimes to find out
17:52
and then they'll begin to prophesy and
17:54
this has happened the other day and some
17:56
one of the prophets said
17:57
i'm telling you this is what's going to
17:59
happen um next year in 2021
18:02
i thought wait a minute this says was
18:04
this was
18:05
put online five hours ago it was from
18:07
last year so be
18:08
very careful about when you're watching
18:11
our stuff it should say either from
18:13
character or theKatKerr i think it's
18:15
facebook
18:16
yeah the same thing also people do it to
18:19
make money
18:20
they put it on their own youtube channel
18:22
or create a new youtube channel and
18:24
youtube
18:25
pays you for putting commercials on
18:27
there if you watch a video of me and
18:29
it's got like eight commercials
18:31
that is not for me i don't do that i
18:33
don't allow commercials on my own
18:36
and people are making a lot of money
18:37
doing that so either report it as a fake
18:39
or just don't watch theirs okay because
18:42
the Kat Kerr uh that's what it's called
18:45
but we found someone who put
18:46
the hyphen Kat Kerr and almost nobody
18:50
notices it and that's a fake one so it
18:52
says the
18:53
Kat Kerr no other punctuation marks no
18:56
other words in there
18:57
and so you're right steve you have to be
18:59
careful about what you're watching
19:01
but like i don't um i myself don't
19:04
like commercials but i know people are
19:06
making i mean i wouldn't want to watch
19:08
somebody for two hours and have 16
19:10
commercials definitely not my
19:13
site okay that's you yeah and we are
19:16
we are one of those that do allow the
19:17
commercials because it brings some good
19:19
income to the to the ministry
19:21
but it's i don't i hope it's not 16 in
19:24
in
19:24
two hours i think it's probably like
19:26
five or six but i don't know for sure
19:28
i watch other people's and the
19:30
commercials pop up and i think oh a
19:32
commercial
19:32
and then seven seconds later i'm back on
19:36
i don't even miss a syllable
19:38
so i i've allowed it to go
19:41
because the income and by the way i'll
19:42
just say this to those that are watching
19:44
and even to you
19:45
i understand that they're not watching
19:46
the commercials but we've theorized
19:50
that the reason we're still on of course
19:52
you have your channel too
19:54
so this that would not we've theorized
19:57
that one of the reasons they haven't
19:58
just shut us down because we've been
19:59
pretty well
20:00
and they're faced with what we say is
20:02
because youtube is making money off of
20:04
our channel
20:06
so then we thought well this may be why
20:08
everyone else is getting booted off and
20:09
we're not
20:10
you're right because we talk so much
20:12
about heaven i think it kind of i don't
20:13
know i think it kind of maybe softens it
20:16
but you're right about the views i mean
20:18
it's going to a million views a week
20:20
and they're totally making money on
20:22
other people
20:23
even if not me they're doing it with
20:26
other people because of the content
20:27
and they do know that it draws people
20:30
why would they cut off their own
20:32
sub their own substance if they're able
20:34
to have commercials and i'm not against
20:36
all commercials i know some were so
20:39
ridiculously
20:40
disgusting not on yours but i don't know
20:43
if you get to pick or choose which type
20:45
there's some choice i think there's some
20:47
choice but i don't
20:49
know when they started all this it was
20:52
anything and everything and i don't see
20:54
them doing that now but in the beginning
20:55
when they had the commercials
20:57
it was like they were you know showing
20:59
them from hell no
21:01
that's not good at all so far i think
21:04
we're okay but we'll find out yeah
21:05
listen we're where uh we let a lot of
21:07
time go by well let's ju
21:09
did you say anything else you want to
21:11
say about sharper did you get that in
21:12
no i just know new things are going on
21:15
and i might as well say this because
21:17
it's being passed all over right now
21:19
he is considering trump literally is
21:21
considering
21:22
this is true came from his
21:23
administration he's considering having
21:26
his
21:26
own a network or someplace or create
21:29
something where it can't be booted off
21:31
where instantly you know instagram cuts
21:33
them off facebook youtube they all cut
21:35
them off they're so afraid why do they
21:37
do that they're afraid of his words
21:38
they're afraid of getting all of us
21:40
inspired and empowered and excited about
21:42
our lives so he's going to do something
21:45
about it and i will tell you that
21:46
is truth that is true that that is from
21:49
here
21:50
from earth it is from his own
21:51
administration that he is going to come
21:53
up with some type of
21:55
network or way that he can uh send
21:58
things to anybody everybody the millions
22:00
of people who used to follow him
22:01
uh i miss him myself because number one
22:04
he was quite entertaining
22:05
and i think that was the only one but
22:07
they came to me on they came to me
22:09
automatically it doesn't
22:10
not i i don't go and look for other
22:12
people's stuff so
22:14
i don't want what God gave me i'm
22:16
talking about the prophet
22:17
prophets now or anybody any five of
22:20
anybody i don't want what they're saying
22:22
if it doesn't line up with God i don't
22:24
want it in my soul
22:25
and therefore what you hear from me is
22:27
99
22:28
is what God has said that's good good
22:31
very good
22:32
well let's jump into questions about
22:33
heaven if you if you all or anyone on is
22:36
brand new and there are always brand new
22:37
people every show uh
22:39
Kat's been to heaven thousands of times
22:41
God sometimes walks to the wall and
22:43
on the earth and so she has a lot of
22:45
revelation she calls herself a revelator
22:48
as much as a prophet right
22:50
yes actually that's the title that God
22:51
gave me when he told me to write the
22:53
book he said you'll call
22:54
yourself a revelator he said the those
22:56
who don't like you won't know what to
22:58
say about you because
22:59
i'm not calling you a prophet they can't
23:01
say you're a false revelator because
23:03
they don't know what it is and that was
23:04
his purpose for doing it
23:06
a revelator is someone who's like a high
23:08
level prophet
23:09
who receives directly from God detail
23:13
like john did in the book of revelations
23:16
himself
23:17
he was called a revelator and that was
23:19
someone who gives direct revelation
23:21
from God to the earth and that was the
23:24
title he gave me
23:26
that's good that's good well let's jump
23:28
in these questions and i'm going to
23:29
the first one's going to be something we
23:31
might little take a little chuckle with
23:33
but i'm going to
23:34
go ahead and hear this lady she's been
23:35
asking me for a few weeks now
23:37
he says please ask my niece and nephew
23:41
my niece and nephew this is not really a
23:43
question about heaven but it may be
23:44
something that you know or don't know
23:45
because my niece and nephew love bigfoot
23:48
and she wants to know
23:50
is there really a bigfoot and i'm going
23:52
to add to that question this is my part
23:54
i'm going to say whether or not there is
23:57
is
23:57
there any creature in heaven that looks
24:00
like
24:01
standing up on two feet with long hair
24:04
like someone would see a big thing have
24:05
you ever seen anything like that in
24:06
heaven so i'm going to ask those two
24:08
questions together i've never heard of
24:11
one being on the earth
24:12
i think and i do know for sure this is
24:15
head knowledge everybody
24:17
the people do that for a living that
24:19
live up in the mountains in the area
24:21
where there's been
24:22
sightings and people have photographs or
24:24
they have an encounter some say they can
24:26
talk some say they can't talk it always
24:28
changes around
24:29
but they're trying to lead to one thing
24:31
that they're really here
24:33
and they're actually people who dress up
24:36
and that's what they do for a living
24:37
they go up in the hills and the
24:38
mountains and
24:39
and um do these kind of crazy things
24:41
just like people
24:42
try to pretend like there's real aliens
24:45
and uh
24:46
that goes in that whole thing okay i
24:48
know there's unicorns in heaven
24:50
we know there aren't any on the earth
24:52
right now God had them all in heaven
24:54
but i have never seen bigfoot down here
24:57
i can't confirm
24:58
well i can confirm to you is what i have
25:00
been shown
25:02
and most of what have been shown is in
25:04
heaven and yes
25:05
yes absolutely yes there are creatures
25:07
that you would call
25:08
bigfoot or sasquatch or whatever they
25:11
want to call them
25:12
i absolutely have seen intelligent
25:14
creatures
25:15
why because there's creatures there we
25:18
don't have here
25:19
why because God created them for up
25:21
there
25:22
and so like i've said i've seen unicorns
25:25
in heaven they're really there i've seen
25:26
little tiny beings that you would call a
25:28
fairy but they're small
25:30
angels and all those things up there
25:32
haven't seen a leprechaun yet or a
25:34
mermaid
25:35
because we'll always get those questions
25:37
after i talk there are creatures
25:40
huge creatures i would say probably
25:41
close to 20 foot tall
25:43
that looks like that and most of them
25:46
are part of the army of heaven
25:48
the army of heaven is mostly made up of
25:51
super intelligent
25:53
creatures designed by God to fight
25:55
against the army of darkness
25:57
and that's where i saw them i saw them
25:59
in the in the area where michael's
26:00
headquarters are in heaven
26:02
and i saw some that were like not that
26:05
that being but i've seen some beings
26:07
that would be like 200 feet high and the
26:09
barracks they stay in or the areas they
26:11
stay in
26:12
the doorways are that high for them to
26:14
go through so yes there are creatures
26:16
like that in heaven you'll be delighted
26:17
when you get there
26:19
to find out exactly what's there that's
26:21
good good good good
26:23
okay now this is a follow-up and we
26:25
talked last night
26:26
last time last weekend ellen out of
26:28
norway had a series of questions here's
26:30
a follow-up
26:32
you had said on the show that someone
26:33
could create like if they're in heaven
26:35
they said i want to have a necklace they
26:38
could
26:38
kind of speak that into existence or it
26:40
would appear
26:41
and then that became a question about
26:43
can can they create anything can we
26:45
once we're in heaven create anything and
26:47
you said you can't create anything
26:49
with a soul but there are things like
26:52
you said everything is alive pictures
26:54
are like grass is alive snow's alive
26:56
so this person's saying well what's the
26:58
difference if it's alive
27:01
they understand the soul part but how
27:04
what is life
27:06
if it doesn't have a soul i mean she
27:09
didn't even know how to ask this
27:10
question you'll probably find that out
27:11
when you get to heaven what the under
27:13
there's things i talk about that there's
27:15
no way
27:15
in the human mind you cannot grasp or
27:19
understand it
27:20
if you aren't in heaven when i said
27:23
let's use the snow for an example
27:25
the snow is everything in heaven is
27:27
alive there's
27:28
life in it why because God is there
27:32
his life flows through everything and
27:34
into everything
27:35
and so everything creates a frequency it
27:38
has an existence
27:40
that's probably the best i can do for
27:41
you so if you take snow
27:43
that is alive and you create something
27:45
from it like you're going to play with
27:47
it or something
27:48
then for that short amount of however
27:50
that time as you're playing
27:52
that snow if you made a snowman would be
27:54
alive it would play with you
27:55
throw snowballs at you laugh and play
27:58
but when your playtime was over it would
27:59
just go right back down into the snow
28:02
because it is the snow and it has life
28:05
so that's probably the best way i can
28:06
explain to you about that
28:10
experience that you can't have on the
28:12
earth
28:13
and uh i would encourage everybody to
28:15
make sure you receive jesus christ so
28:16
you go there
28:17
there's a plug for jesus well i got to
28:20
see that stuff
28:20
and i know so much more about having
28:22
these things okay um
28:24
this question is can you tell anything
28:26
about
28:27
what you've seen someone said you said
28:29
you'd been back in time when jesus was
28:30
younger
28:31
i hadn't heard that but if you have what
28:34
what can you tell us about jesus as a
28:36
kid or as a youth
28:37
what was he like did he have lots of
28:39
friends did he have no friends
28:41
did he work miracles for other kids what
28:44
can you tell us about jesus
28:45
he didn't really work miracles except at
28:47
home and they weren't called a miracle
28:50
and i was explained it great um
28:53
extensively by jesus himself about that
28:56
he said once he realized or God gave him
28:59
the father gave me an understanding of
29:01
who he was so he knew
29:02
clearly remember in the caravan when
29:05
jesus wasn't
29:06
with them after a couple days they
29:07
couldn't find him he was back where they
29:10
had been visiting in the temple
29:12
talking to the priest now probably
29:14
possibly around that time he could have
29:16
gone like eight or nine
29:17
something like that uh he had freedom to
29:20
run through the caravan to play
29:22
i'm sure that he jesus was always a very
29:24
responsible
29:25
child and uh but he remember what he
29:28
gave the answer when his parents said
29:30
where were you when he said i had to be
29:32
about my father's business
29:33
he was talking about the father of God
29:35
so at that point he knew who he was
29:38
and i do know that he worked things in
29:41
what you call a miracle
29:42
at home it was normal for him to turn
29:45
the water into wine that was
29:47
normal mary would not have known to tell
29:50
those people at the wedding
29:51
you know that jesus knew what he was
29:53
doing when he said do whatever he says
29:55
you know she knew he was going to make
29:56
wine out of water
29:58
how did she know that he did it at home
30:01
how did they know he could multiply food
30:03
he did it at home okay i'm sure that
30:05
none of them were ever sick because of
30:07
his very
30:07
presence in the home and you also
30:10
realize in the scriptures when he came
30:11
when they came looking for him if you
30:13
remember that
30:14
he was ministering somewhere and then
30:16
his mother
30:17
and his siblings came and started
30:19
calling him to come outside and i'll
30:22
tell you why they were doing
30:23
they were ready for him to come home and
30:24
that's the honest truth is what jesus
30:26
said they were ready for me to come home
30:28
they wanted back there where they had
30:30
the food made
30:31
and they had the wonderful wine from
30:33
heaven and he looked to all of them and
30:35
said
30:36
now you are my mother you are my brother
30:38
you almost says in other words his time
30:39
was now to give to them
30:41
to give to all of us and so he did know
30:44
how to do those things and as God
30:46
revealed those things to him he began at
30:49
one time to meet him
30:50
at the mountains it said he went away to
30:52
be with the father that i mean back to
30:54
heaven
30:55
but he did it one time start going to
30:57
meet him to be have time with him but as
30:59
a child
31:00
he grew up in egypt and that's actually
31:02
scriptural
31:04
when this when the um when the wise men
31:06
came to bring the treasures
31:07
jesus was not a little tiny baby at that
31:10
time
31:11
i know in every every sunday school
31:13
christmas program you've ever been a
31:14
part of
31:15
i don't know if they still do that but
31:17
back in the day every year we knew it
31:19
was going to happen
31:20
they would know a manger scene they
31:22
would have baby jesus
31:23
someone playing mother mary mary and
31:27
his mother mary and joseph and they'd
31:29
have the sheep
31:30
maybe sometimes that was crazy
31:33
the shepherds were there but then they
31:35
would show the wise men come to the
31:36
manger
31:37
that's not what happened jesus was about
31:39
two years old
31:40
it took him two years to cross the
31:42
deserts these three different kings
31:44
or magi which are wise men bringing
31:47
treasures
31:48
treasures plural gold frankincense and
31:51
myrrh
31:52
fabrics all these beautiful things why
31:55
so he would have his life pretty much
31:57
already paid for
31:58
and they needed it because soon after
32:00
that happened
32:01
was when word came the angel came and
32:03
said leave here
32:04
and flee into egypt because you know the
32:07
wicked king was looking for them to take
32:08
them down
32:09
he was educated in egypt by the best
32:12
scholars why they had the money
32:15
they had supply jesus was popular
32:18
even then because he had the ability to
32:21
influence he had that as a gift in him
32:24
to to share things beyond their own
32:26
wisdom or understanding
32:28
he captivated them and so they did like
32:31
they liked him very much jesus even
32:33
growing up i do know this also in his
32:35
schooling
32:36
like any other child you had to learn to
32:38
read and write
32:39
i'm sure he went to torah school that's
32:41
where they taught you the torah
32:44
i'm sure they were earmarking him to
32:46
probably do that for his life
32:48
although God had the plans so he knew
32:50
the torah better than anyone else
32:52
because he had these great educators
32:54
but i can say this for sure the holy
32:56
spirit told me one time
32:58
as to be funny but was truth that
33:01
jesus's favorite subject
33:03
in schooling in his schooling was
33:06
reading
33:06
he loved to read he loved to see and
33:09
understand
33:10
things he loved stories you know even
33:12
the father loves stories
33:14
and that's why jesus told so many
33:16
parables because that was in him
33:18
what he didn't care too much for was
33:20
writing and i do know that for a fact he
33:22
would prefer reading over writing
33:24
and he said that's why there were 10
33:27
commandments and not 20.
33:30
that's good hey count what uh you know
33:33
nowadays
33:33
with people like yourself there's a and
33:36
i know probably a handful now
33:38
people who have got caught up to him
33:39
many times you're the one that as far as
33:41
i know has gone the most
33:43
from my knowledge so jesus had the
33:45
ultimate anointing on his life
33:48
do you think throughout his young
33:49
boyhood and even during his three-year
33:51
ministry
33:52
he was caught up to heaven to to to have
33:55
meetings with the father during that
33:57
time or even
33:58
as a child i don't know that he was
34:00
caught up to heaven i do know that he
34:02
went to the mountains to be with him
34:04
that's where he went to be with him
34:06
uh just like you remember moses right i
34:09
mean moses went there and um
34:11
that's where he got the ten commandments
34:12
remember that okay
34:14
it was a place it was in a high place
34:16
and so i'm sure that's where jesus went
34:18
to meet with him the father did share
34:20
things with him
34:21
things that were going to be happening
34:23
in his life and
34:24
i do also know this when his name was
34:28
the word
34:29
the word was with God and was God and
34:31
there wasn't anything that was made
34:33
except that he made it that was the word
34:35
that was the father the word and holy
34:37
spirit in the beginning
34:38
the word was willing to come to earth
34:40
and die for us
34:41
and that's when he began to be called
34:44
jesus christ
34:45
yahshua messiah all those other things
34:47
began to be attached to who he was
34:50
but when he was the word and they
34:52
created everything God would speak
34:54
something and the word would step out
34:56
and make it that's how they did it
34:58
i know that before the word ever came
35:01
and died on the cross before God made
35:03
him into a seed that's what he did
35:06
made him a new seed and then the holy
35:08
spirit brought him down planted him in
35:10
the womb
35:11
of mary that's how that happened that he
35:14
knew all the things that would happen he
35:16
knew before he came
35:17
he was told everything that would happen
35:19
before he ever came
35:21
but being born as a baby in the earth is
35:24
called the son of man
35:25
there were times growing up this little
35:28
tiny thing he had to begin
35:30
to learn himself to hear God
35:34
so crawling around on his hands and
35:36
knees and being a little baby
35:37
i think that's mainly what he did and he
35:40
began to speak
35:41
but there was a point in his life where
35:44
he had great understanding he knew he
35:46
was the son of God he knew the father in
35:48
heaven was his father
35:49
his life began to drastically change
35:52
then
35:53
and so at an early age which is why i
35:56
tell people and go to people talk to
35:57
your children when they're three when
35:58
the four when they're five
36:00
about the things of God where they came
36:02
from who he is who jesus
36:04
is uh i myself got born again at age
36:07
four i knew exactly what i was doing
36:09
as a seer literally jesus stepped into
36:12
me
36:13
as a foolier i did and so i know christ
36:15
had many encounters with the father
36:18
and once he had the understanding why
36:20
would he say it must be about my
36:21
father's business he told him
36:23
he had an encounter with him where he
36:25
told him that things are going to be
36:26
different now
36:27
so there's things we will find out when
36:29
we get to heaven but there are many
36:31
things he did show me and tell me about
36:33
himself growing up he had a wonderful
36:34
life in egypt i will say that
36:37
living in a hovel with nothing uh they
36:40
had plenty to take care of themselves
36:43
amazing i have a question about you said
36:45
he made him a seed and i don't know if
36:47
this is specific
36:48
what you meant but i've always wondered
36:51
many times
36:52
the angel comes and visits mary and and
36:55
says you're going to be with child and
36:57
he's going to be from the holy spirit
36:59
though
36:59
the holy spirit overshadows her and the
37:02
assumption is
37:03
at that moment that's the assumption
37:06
jesus mary was pregnant uh not conceived
37:09
by man
37:09
and that and you can correct me if
37:11
that's not the case but it seems like at
37:12
that moment
37:13
my question is is the lord ever shown
37:16
you
37:17
in the past history jesus saying goodbye
37:19
to his father and the father
37:21
waving his hand and suddenly jesus is
37:23
now a baby without
37:26
uh knowledge of heaven for a season what
37:29
would what i would say a very short
37:31
season i know the angels were always
37:33
around him i mean when he left they came
37:36
with him
37:36
and i i was shown quite a bit actually
37:39
we'll probably be in one of the movies
37:41
we produce one day where people see all
37:42
this revelation i'm talking about but i
37:44
can share it
37:45
i can share this part i did see the part
37:48
where they were saying
37:49
uh they were they were embracing each
37:51
other and
37:52
the lord uh the word knew his life would
37:55
be
37:56
never the same because he only had a
37:58
spiritual body a powerful spiritual body
38:00
filled with creative he was God
38:03
willing to have flesh put on him he'll
38:06
always have the flesh forever
38:08
now he can still be as big a tall or
38:10
small jesus can
38:12
but he knew it would never be the same
38:14
and he knew there'd be a season
38:16
as he was growing he would come to the
38:18
understanding the father shared every
38:19
bit of this he shared the cross with him
38:21
all of it
38:22
he had to say yes before he came so it
38:25
was like anything else when he asked us
38:26
to do something
38:27
he said yes he said yes before he came
38:30
he said yes again in the garden to the
38:32
father that he would go
38:33
that he would drink that cup with all
38:35
the evil in it that he would go to the
38:37
cross
38:38
he was even told by the father on the
38:40
third day in hell
38:41
i will raise you up and they will know
38:45
they can never
38:46
touch or use or harm a righteous person
38:49
hell would have no right to hold a
38:51
righteous person in hell
38:52
and he knew that all everything would
38:54
happen but at that three days
38:56
in hell which we're approaching what we
38:58
represent that time when
39:00
when he came off the cross he descended
39:02
himself into abraham's bosom
39:04
then he crossed over to hell and they
39:06
took him they were afraid the father
39:08
would come and get him so they didn't do
39:10
anything to him for a couple days
39:12
and then satan was going to do a big
39:14
show about torturing the son of God and
39:16
on the morning
39:16
of the third day when christ stands up
39:20
in the midst of all this evil
39:22
and fire starts shooting out of his
39:23
hands and he melts the faces of the
39:25
principalities and powers
39:27
strips satan of all his royal garb takes
39:29
every gemstone out of his wings
39:32
and then takes the keys of hell death in
39:34
the grave why
39:35
that was taking back our authority it
39:37
was on the cross it was done when he
39:39
said it is finished
39:41
christ meant for our for our salvation
39:44
for our salvation he would have never
39:46
gone into hell to take back our
39:47
authority
39:48
that adam gave away and that's what he
39:50
was doing on the third day
39:51
and then he left satan in a heap of dust
39:54
and
39:54
just beat the pieces and then he
39:56
ascended back up
39:58
and that at that point that's when
39:59
miriam saw him at the tomb
40:02
and then after that he said i have to go
40:03
to my father that was the first time he
40:06
was
40:06
with the father literally with the
40:08
father since the
40:10
time that he probably was um
40:14
became from the word into a seed and
40:16
you're right when the holy spirit
40:17
hovered over mary
40:18
the holy spirit planted that seed which
40:21
was
40:22
christ in her womb that's how it
40:25
happened
40:25
it wasn't done by man and then of course
40:28
jesus grew just like any other little
40:30
baby
40:30
and then so it's this is powerful
40:32
revelation to understand when you see
40:34
this whole thing
40:35
especially on the movie screen one day
40:37
you'll be so moved you won't ever be the
40:39
same again
40:40
but there were things he did know a
40:42
point of three days he had to wait
40:44
not not having any contact with the
40:46
father he knows what that feels like
40:48
when you're waiting to hear from him and
40:49
you don't hear he had to trust like
40:52
every one of us and of course we know in
40:54
the third day in colossians it said he
40:56
spoiled and wasted and ruined
40:58
principalities and powers
40:59
in hell he stripped satan one
41:03
of the gemstones that he had when he
41:05
kicked him out
41:06
and then it says he took the keys of
41:07
hell death in the grave and then
41:09
eventually went back before the throne
41:11
of his father to present the keys to him
41:13
that's actually what happened in these
41:15
days approaching that we're going to be
41:16
celebrating celebrate it like you never
41:18
have before because he didn't just die
41:21
for your salvation he went into hell
41:23
and wiped up hell to take back our
41:26
authority as believers
41:28
and that's why we have the right to come
41:30
against all darkness
41:32
it's really really good awesome okay i
41:34
apologize i stepped away that i had to
41:36
sign for a package and no one's here
41:38
that i have no idea how to do this so i
41:40
just got up and did it
41:42
okay so um here's one and it's a little
41:45
bit lengthy i'm going to read it fast i
41:46
might skim it
41:47
just because of its importance i'll i
41:49
don't normally read one that's this long
41:52
my son tyler it's with my tanya my son
41:54
tyler passed away suddenly at the age of
41:56
30 two years ago
41:58
he was raised in the church we had times
41:59
in his life that he lost his way
42:01
i prayed so hard for salvation his whole
42:03
life i don't think you've ever been
42:04
asked this question before i'm not sure
42:06
i'm struggling to praise God after my
42:08
son's passing because i'm afraid
42:10
if he didn't make it to heaven that
42:12
every time i worship God the devil will
42:13
punish my son for this my question is
42:16
what should i do is it okay to ask God
42:18
for a sign
42:20
about where my son is and if i do and
42:22
don't receive an answer is God trying to
42:24
spare me more heartache
42:27
God i am i'm assuring you even as i'm
42:30
sitting here i'm really
42:32
very much assured that his son is in
42:35
heaven
42:35
why because he stood for his salvation
42:39
and he said he did
42:41
jesus won't let your words drop to the
42:43
ground we have a promise that you and
42:45
your household shall be saved
42:47
and the very fact that he took the keys
42:50
what those keys represent so
42:51
terrified satan that christ took those
42:54
keys away from him
42:56
why did satan have him why was he
42:58
terrified he took him away
42:59
it gave christ the right and the
43:01
authority even at the moment of death if
43:04
you have made a stand for your family
43:06
member to know
43:07
jesus christ he has the right to appear
43:10
to them and say
43:11
do you want me now and i've been i've
43:14
been shown several times
43:15
that actually happening with people i've
43:17
been taken into a time where i saw
43:19
people and was actually there watching
43:22
when christ presented himself i've heard
43:24
other people's stories
43:25
especially a story about a jew whose
43:28
parents were very devout jews
43:30
loved God with all their heart and they
43:32
had great friends these great friends
43:34
would pray for their salvation all the
43:36
time to know jesus christ as their
43:37
messiah
43:38
and this young man who did not want
43:41
christ didn't want to receive him
43:43
was suffering because his parents had
43:46
died and he started having nightmares
43:48
and by the way the devil can give you
43:49
nightmares tell them you're not
43:50
receiving them
43:51
show them burning in hell because they
43:53
didn't know jesus now this is the devil
43:55
if he's trying to convince you of that
43:57
then what he's probably telling you is
43:58
just the opposite of what happened
44:00
and so this young man cried out to
44:02
christ himself find me i need to know i
44:05
want to know
44:06
this says this is a real story christ
44:08
appeared to him and said
44:10
because of your parents believing in God
44:14
himself
44:15
they were counted righteous and because
44:16
they were kind of righteous with their
44:18
stand
44:19
that i had the right to appear to them
44:21
they are both they both received me
44:23
they're both in heaven
44:24
i'm here to let you know yourself you
44:26
have the right to receive me also
44:28
but your parents are not burning in hell
44:30
that is a lie from the devil
44:33
and so there's so much other evidence
44:35
that this happened so i would say to
44:37
that father
44:38
you need to go before God and said thank
44:40
you for rescuing my son
44:42
i give you praise and glory and i
44:44
promise you
44:45
waves of the peace of God will begin to
44:48
consume you
44:49
and if you have those thoughts anymore
44:51
you're trying to tell the devil i'm not
44:53
taking your lies anymore
44:55
i know that God because of because of
44:57
the stand that was made
44:59
that my my son is in heaven that's so
45:02
good now that woman's life is going to
45:03
be changed forever
45:04
with that that he just made her day and
45:06
he made my day too
45:08
okay this is the we get these
45:09
unpardonable sin questions from time to
45:11
time
45:12
i have been worried for many years that
45:14
i've committed the unpardonable sin this
45:15
is from ann
45:16
it worries me so much that i feel like i
45:18
won't make it to heaven i'm a believer
45:20
in christ and born again
45:21
i'm afraid i have done something that
45:23
has been tied to an unpardonable sin
45:25
or as i have been blaspheming the holy
45:28
spirit what exactly is the end part of a
45:30
sin
45:30
is you know it's like
45:34
she's telling you i don't want to be
45:35
lost and she doesn't understand
45:38
right why i know you have not committed
45:42
the impartable sin
45:44
you are worried about it exactly when
45:47
someone has committed the impartial sin
45:49
that would be what satan did almost
45:52
no one almost no human on the earth has
45:55
committed the unpardonable sin
45:58
satan committed satan will never be
46:01
pardoned for what he did
46:02
lucifer knew what he was doing he knew
46:05
the living God
46:05
he lived with him he knew that it was
46:08
wrong what he was doing
46:09
there is no pardon for him he will never
46:11
be pardoned for that sin
46:13
that is the unpardonable sin when you
46:15
turn your back on God and you hate and
46:17
despise him
46:18
well you're saying you're a believer if
46:20
you're a believer you don't hate and
46:21
despise God
46:23
okay you wouldn't care if you had if you
46:25
committed the impoverished sin
46:27
you wouldn't care you would never care
46:30
you would actually put in people's faces
46:31
so you have not committed the
46:33
unpardonable sin because you
46:35
have grief in you that was not true what
46:38
people were saying to you they probably
46:40
heard the enemy say that
46:42
if you've heard it more than once the
46:43
enemy's beating you up with it
46:45
turn to the enemy and say you're lying
46:47
i'm not receiving the words you said
46:49
i believe in jesus christ i'm my i am
46:52
righteous
46:53
and according to that my life will be in
46:56
heaven
46:57
amen you receive christ
47:01
by his blood that gives you entrance to
47:03
heaven the devil will beat you up with
47:05
whatever you let him
47:08
so you're headed for heaven let me ask a
47:12
cousin question if if somebody is uh
47:14
tortured that's not me but if someone
47:16
says
47:18
back when i was young in a young
47:20
marriage before i got married whatever
47:21
they could they point to something that
47:22
they did that was bad
47:24
uh really bad or maybe they had an
47:26
affair with somebody or
47:28
something that they have never gotten
47:31
over
47:32
guilt bothers them to this day and they
47:35
they pray
47:36
for God to both forgive them and to
47:38
remove the guilt
47:39
and they can't get rid of the guilt what
47:41
would you say to them they can't get
47:42
right
47:42
i wish you when you lose that you lose
47:45
whatever that was from your soul
47:47
you lose that uh what you could call a
47:50
trauma
47:51
for him if it's a trauma for them now if
47:53
they're still thinking about it that is
47:55
the devil
47:56
trying to beat you up if you have
47:58
repented for that
48:00
it says that if we repent of our sins
48:02
jesus is
48:03
he's just and righteous he will cleanse
48:05
us from all unrighteousness
48:07
that means that's not held against you
48:09
the devil's trying to hold it against
48:11
you because you know what the devil
48:12
knows what goes on
48:14
but you've been forgiven for that you
48:16
loose
48:17
what that is that you keep seeing and
48:19
thinking about you have to lose the
48:20
words you have to lose that
48:22
lose the actions from your soul you've
48:24
been forgiven
48:25
don't keep it loosen in jesus name
48:28
and then you say a bind the love and the
48:30
life of God to my soul and you will not
48:33
ever have that happen you again you'll
48:36
never think about it again
48:38
when sins are forgiven God remembers
48:40
them no more
48:41
so the one bringing them to remembrance
48:44
that would be the devil
48:46
that's good very very very good um okay
48:49
this one
48:50
i'm going to just paraphrase because
48:51
it's a little bit long but she's saying
48:53
i know Kat says this christmas town and
48:56
i know she's saying christmas is not bad
48:59
but how do i recline the ugly truth of
49:01
our
49:02
early christmas decorations and origins
49:04
of the christmas holiday with what
49:06
Kat seen in heaven because there's
49:08
another place she says but they
49:09
christmas has these pagan roots
49:11
how do you tell release someone like
49:13
that to enjoy christmas without all that
49:16
worry about pagan this or that i would
49:18
say to do the same thing
49:19
loose all that loose all those lies
49:21
because they are lies
49:23
people can say all you want to this was
49:26
created on the earth this was a
49:28
an occult this was a pagan thing guess
49:31
what
49:32
the things they're lying about are
49:34
normally things that are good that are
49:36
in heaven
49:37
satan will twist what is in heaven
49:40
to make it something evil on the earth
49:42
like the symbol of the
49:44
eye saying that's the illuminati not no
49:46
sorry
49:47
that is the eye of God that is the ever
49:49
seeing eye of God
49:51
and satan knows it so he'll twist it
49:53
make it into some weird
49:55
secret society that doesn't make it
49:58
bad that God made it so guess what
50:01
christmas town has
50:03
been in heaven before these secret
50:05
societies and these wicked pagan rituals
50:08
because they make a pagan ritual they're
50:10
going to use some form of truth in it
50:12
doesn't make that bad so God according
50:15
to God
50:15
christmas is a good time of the year
50:17
it's called it's
50:18
actually called christ's mass is the
50:20
time to celebrate christ
50:22
literally and i know there's going to be
50:24
always secret societies and wicked
50:26
groups they're still out there they're
50:27
still growing they're still being made
50:29
by satan
50:30
that that that does not take away the
50:33
joy and celebration
50:34
of what God has made available to us so
50:38
whether satan likes it or not
50:41
so whether satan likes it or not
50:44
christmas time is in heaven
50:45
it's a place to go celebrate the birth
50:47
of christ only he gives the gifts out
50:50
it's there and you'll have that
50:52
understanding when you get there but if
50:54
you keep getting beat up
50:55
or people keep pointing this is man
50:58
man's pointing
50:59
but this is evil no if it's human
51:02
sacrifice that's evil okay
51:04
i get that that's evil the misuse and
51:07
abuse of
51:08
drugs and stuff human trafficking those
51:09
are evil practices
51:12
by something as beautiful as the glory
51:15
and splendor
51:16
of the birth of christ that's still
51:18
celebrated in heaven today
51:20
that one thing that there that time that
51:23
christmas time of the year
51:25
when people love when they forgive when
51:27
they help others
51:28
that in itself is not an evil thing
51:32
it's so good good good now karen we've
51:34
talked about uh
51:36
many times now about pets going to
51:38
heaven so that's a subtle
51:40
thing our pets do go to heaven but this
51:42
person's saying glenda wants to know
51:44
what happens to our pets
51:46
um her question is when our pets leave
51:50
the earth after they die
51:52
who meets them to take them home to
51:54
heaven have you ever seen anybody meet a
51:56
pet or how does that go
51:58
your own guardian angel takes your pet
52:00
i've always known that
52:02
my guardian angel took my own pet when
52:05
she of course i've known this for years
52:06
and years
52:07
um a few years ago when my own yorkie
52:10
passed away and she waited till i came
52:12
back off the road i was traveling and
52:13
speaking
52:14
the holy spirit said she'll still wait
52:16
to say goodbye
52:18
she had her own way of greeting me and
52:21
um
52:21
i did pray and i told God i said okay
52:23
i've said goodbye i've loved honor
52:25
and spent time with her and i said so
52:27
come and take her my own angel which i
52:29
knew would take her so my own guardian
52:31
angel took her
52:32
her spiritual body my dog's spiritual
52:34
body took her up to heaven
52:35
i've seen my own dog appear a couple
52:37
times in the clouds her spiritual body
52:39
appear
52:40
so your own guardian angel will take
52:42
your pet
52:43
to heaven by the way you've talked about
52:45
humans looking down through the portals
52:47
and
52:48
God creates this portal in heaven you
52:49
can go look at your family of a special
52:52
are you saying that your pet can look
52:54
down and see you
52:55
they make special places i don't know if
52:57
we've ever talked about that
52:59
they make pet portals they're in the
53:01
ground itself
53:02
like they don't go in a building and
53:03
walk up steps there's places i've seen
53:05
them a couple times i've seen pets
53:07
around them looking down
53:10
over the ones that were their masters
53:12
that took care of them and
53:14
of course they love them they can't wait
53:16
to see them again too but yeah
53:18
pets can look down and see you on the
53:20
earth and i would
53:21
say to everyone whether you have a pet
53:24
in heaven a family member in heaven
53:26
or a friend in heaven stop grieving over
53:29
them i
53:30
understand it hurts when they're not
53:32
there but when you think about this
53:34
beautiful place
53:35
filled with the love and the life of God
53:37
they celebrate
53:38
life all the time it isn't just when
53:41
they come home to heaven
53:43
and they do still love you they do still
53:45
think about you
53:46
so i just want people to know you need
53:48
to lose grief at one point
53:49
if you're still grieving a year later
53:51
you say i choose to lose grief from my
53:54
soul
53:55
uh you don't want that to tear your life
53:57
apart they don't want to look down from
53:58
heaven and see you
54:00
in such a turmoil and agony that you can
54:03
function as a normal person especially
54:06
if you're
54:06
like a parent and a child dies this is a
54:09
the hard part
54:10
you can't make the other children feel
54:12
like
54:13
they have no value because all you talk
54:16
about is the one who's not there
54:18
if they could come back they would say
54:20
hey mom hey dad
54:22
make sure you take care of my brothers
54:25
and sisters too
54:26
because they need you you know they're
54:28
living in heaven it's not that they
54:30
don't
54:30
want you or don't care but i do know
54:33
they would say things i hear them saying
54:34
things like that over the portal
54:36
you know please make sure you hug and
54:38
you love my
54:39
my brothers and sisters saying this to
54:41
their parents if they they died young so
54:44
i would say that's a given for anyone
54:47
from the time and step
54:48
out of this body they're engulfed in the
54:50
love and the life of God
54:52
their whole appearance even changes
54:54
their young
54:55
life comes from them and they're filled
54:57
with excitement and expectancy they want
55:00
you
55:00
to feel the same way it's hard
55:03
we need to have a celebration depot when
55:05
people go home to heaven
55:06
that's true it makes me think of you
55:09
know about three or four years ago we
55:10
had to put down our dog
55:12
angel was her name see that's a horrible
55:14
cancer we tried everything to get her
55:16
healed and pray but
55:17
but it was time and then doreen it was
55:20
really drean's dog
55:21
you know doreen and she this is when i
55:24
think it was a two or three
55:25
day process where she began to see
55:29
sink in such grief she was feeling
55:32
herself going a dark
55:33
deep hole and she realized this was not
55:36
great from the lord especially we had
55:38
been told the same day that she passed
55:41
someone saw it they wrote to her and
55:43
they said i saw your dog up in heaven
55:44
playing with other children who
55:46
also died of and so with that
55:49
word and she had to literally choose
55:53
to stop this sinking that was happening
55:56
what would you tell us
55:56
how would you tell someone that's
55:58
starting to be pulled down and
55:59
un
56:04
you know that's why it talks about this
56:06
you know the sting it talks about this
56:08
thing
56:09
uh when there's death or it talks about
56:12
the grave and
56:13
and all that there is a sting in your
56:15
soul because you've been
56:16
separated this is what happens you make
56:19
a soul tie
56:20
with those you love whether it's your
56:22
pet sometimes people don't even have
56:24
family
56:24
members they only have a pet there's
56:26
nothing wrong with loving your pet
56:28
there's nothing wrong with the hopefully
56:29
you're loving your family members
56:31
when that song tie is cut because
56:33
they're not there and they're part of
56:35
your
56:36
life which you know we should love our
56:37
family members not that they they matter
56:39
to us
56:40
there is like a there's a vacancy there
56:43
where they were you need to say jesus
56:45
fill that with you
56:47
the other thing you need to say
56:48
sincerely anytime i find anyone who's
56:51
about to go to a funeral or they've lost
56:52
someone a hat i say please say these
56:54
words
56:55
about your family remember i choose to
56:57
loose you
56:59
to release you to release you into the
57:02
the destiny that jesus has for you in
57:04
heaven i release you into his arms
57:07
for destiny and your life in heaven and
57:10
something
57:11
will happen on the inside almost joy
57:13
will start to spring in
57:15
and that will happen even with your pet
57:18
uh whatever it is because grief can
57:20
really harm and hurt people and it's
57:22
like you get to the p
57:23
of despair is where she was going
57:26
despair
57:27
is not a good thing because there's this
57:29
oppression depression
57:31
and then despair and after despair it's
57:33
um that's where the thoughts of suicide
57:35
start to come in
57:37
and you don't want that to happen so
57:38
anyone out there no matter what's going
57:40
on in your life if you're
57:41
always oppressed you need to say i
57:43
choose to lose
57:44
all oppression and and all
57:47
fear all agony all suffering any grief
57:51
in these spirits of grief i lose them
57:53
from my soul
57:55
and i bind to my soul the joy of
57:57
celebration in life in heaven
57:59
it will help tremendously but you can't
58:03
keep dwelling
58:04
because this is what the devil does
58:05
he'll replay and replay and replay and
58:08
he'll beat you up and beat you up
58:10
till he pulls you further down when you
58:13
get to where you can't even
58:14
hear what God is trying to say to you
58:16
you're rejecting love from other people
58:19
or even
58:19
people trying to console you you don't
58:21
want it maybe in the beginning that
58:23
would be normal but let me tell you
58:26
days later months later you should at
58:28
least begin to feel a little bit of a
58:30
freedom knowing that your family member
58:32
and your pets are
58:33
always going to go to heaven um so i
58:36
just know that the devil if he couldn't
58:38
get you
58:39
if you can't get you into hell or get
58:40
your family members he'll try to ruin
58:42
your life
58:43
and that's what he does and fear is
58:45
still fear
58:46
fear anguish agony suffering
58:50
oppression depression despair all of
58:53
those
58:54
come from hell so don't let it ruin your
58:57
life
58:57
don't let it ruin your mind say father
58:59
it was an act of my will
59:01
to lose from my soul all fear
59:04
all agony all suffering
59:08
all grief all despair i loose it from my
59:12
soul in jesus name
59:14
and i bind to myself the life of God the
59:17
love
59:18
of God the celebration of life in jesus
59:21
name
59:22
and then that stuff won't be in here
59:25
it'll be taken out because if it remains
59:28
in your soul the devil will play that
59:29
little thing
59:30
movie over and over again to you no
59:32
matter what the tragedy or trauma was
59:35
he'll try to use it against you you can
59:38
be free from that in jesus name
59:40
really good really good okay now we've
59:42
touched on something like this
59:44
this is asking a different angle um so i
59:47
don't have a name but it says if you are
59:48
abused by your parents
59:50
well you have to be friends with them in
59:52
heaven i forgive them but do i have to
59:54
be around them in heaven
59:57
um again we're going to have to go to
59:59
the pa the fact that there's a
60:00
difference between heaven and earth
60:03
on earth you're still thinking with your
60:05
normal
60:06
human mind you're remembering about
60:09
all the sufferings and the agonies which
60:11
by the way
60:12
you need to lose all that trauma you
60:15
need to lose
60:15
if you were abused whether by a family
60:18
member
60:19
by other people if you were abused
60:21
especially sexually
60:23
lose that trauma from your soul because
60:26
again the devil will beat you up
60:27
and you will begin to think differently
60:29
i'm not saying what they did was right
60:31
it was
60:31
wrong and God doesn't ever approve of
60:34
that happening but in heaven
60:37
from the moment you step out of this
60:39
physical body and you're engulfed in the
60:41
life and the love of God
60:43
you will feel differently at that second
60:46
when you see your parents in heaven one
60:49
day
60:50
they will embrace you and yes they will
60:52
say it was
60:53
wrong the way that we treated you we
60:56
should have never done that we were we
60:57
were listening or we belong to the devil
60:59
when that happened we want you know that
61:00
we love you and that life
61:02
and that love will just consume you and
61:05
you won't ever think of those things
61:06
again it'll be gone from you because
61:09
there's nothing but the life and love of
61:11
God in heaven
61:12
no one has trauma no one has horrible
61:15
memories nobody is rejected
61:17
nobody hates nobody avoids people in
61:21
heaven
61:21
so that's the difference between heaven
61:24
and earth
61:25
you're there with the maker you're there
61:27
with the one who made you who loves
61:28
everybody
61:29
when forgiveness comes if they repented
61:34
this is how God looks at it like it
61:35
never happened
61:37
just like when you got born again if you
61:39
had sinned
61:40
it's like it never happened to God so he
61:43
would be unrighteous and unjust to throw
61:45
people out because before they got born
61:47
again they had done something bad
61:49
that's the beauty of salvation so i
61:52
would just say
61:54
don't keep the trauma don't keep the
61:57
memory in your soul
61:58
if you want to have a good life yourself
62:01
i think
62:02
that's why God said one day there will
62:04
be soul doctors on the earth i actually
62:06
saw these little signs outside of doors
62:08
and businesses and churches
62:10
even in government offices one day
62:12
there'll be a full doctor where people
62:13
come in there to lose stuff out of their
62:15
soul
62:15
this is how important it is to God it's
62:17
the keys to the kingdom
62:19
he freely gives them to us but it's up
62:21
to you to use them
62:23
whether it was a trauma whether it was a
62:25
tragedy
62:27
and that invades your life and 20 years
62:29
later you're still having nightmares or
62:30
dreams
62:31
stop letting it happen you
62:34
choose to lose it out of yourself
62:37
and some people because it was so severe
62:39
might have to do it more than once but
62:40
i'm telling you it will get better and
62:42
better
62:43
your mind will begin to be free your
62:45
emotions will line up with what you just
62:47
declared
62:48
i it's i've seen the evidence i've seen
62:50
evidence of it happening it will happen
62:53
and so it's still done by faith but you
62:55
have to take the step to do that
62:57
don't let something that happened to you
63:00
well even if it was five days ago but it
63:03
was 10
63:03
20 years ago people will let it ruin
63:05
their whole life because
63:06
all that they can do is the devil
63:08
replaced the trauma or the tragedy over
63:10
and over
63:12
especially if people are already in
63:13
heaven they're up there saying please
63:14
get rid of that
63:16
please be free they want you to be free
63:18
their self
63:20
and so we have to think of things from
63:21
God's perspective he
63:23
made these things available for us to
63:25
use
63:26
that we might be free and guess what the
63:29
truth
63:30
which i'm speaking the truth will make
63:32
you free
63:34
not maybe it will make you free so this
63:37
is truth he gives us to get rid of it
63:39
while you're
63:39
on the earth so you can live on earth
63:42
like they do in heaven
63:44
uh really good i guess we have time for
63:46
one more question let's get this one in
63:48
um this person asks why do we
63:52
need guardian angels when we possess the
63:54
holy spirit
63:56
in us and we have God's presence and of
63:58
course then there's the lord jesus
64:00
christ
64:01
um i mean you can take that to an
64:03
extreme why do we need
64:04
holy spirit within us if there's God so
64:06
i mean
64:08
what why do we need so the question is
64:10
why do we need guardian angels when we
64:12
already have all of God
64:13
well let's let's go ahead and say i like
64:15
the olive God thing first
64:17
uh the fullness of the Godhead that
64:20
would be
64:21
the father the son and holy spirit you
64:24
need all three i agree with that
64:26
but God who is the father
64:29
designed this plan that he would assign
64:33
angels to you at your time of conception
64:37
actually
64:38
you'd always have somebody there
64:39
watching over you and let me tell you
64:42
when you get to heaven
64:43
you go into these theaters that's about
64:46
you
64:47
minus no no there'll be no sin you will
64:49
literally see how many times that angel
64:51
those guardian angels saved your life
64:53
you will know really in reality how many
64:56
times did they save my life did they
64:57
prevent me from doing not the good thing
64:59
or the right thing
65:01
what would my life have been like
65:02
without them if you think about that
65:05
he assigned them on purpose so you'd
65:07
always have them with you to watch over
65:09
you by the way they probably
65:11
say things to you uh to try to get you
65:14
to maybe do some
65:15
the thing that is right they may even
65:17
you may even hear don't turn left here
65:19
right now
65:19
don't go through that light right now
65:21
that's probably them saying that to you
65:23
because they're there and i've
65:24
i've heard that and it stopped and the
65:26
car would like run the light
65:28
and so they're here it's God's plan he
65:31
didn't want
65:32
live in this life alone that's his
65:35
presence with you
65:36
all the time and i do know that with you
65:38
from the time you're conceived
65:40
they are the ones who will take you home
65:42
to heaven sometimes jesus comes and
65:44
takes you too
65:45
but they're with you your whole entire
65:47
life and they love you they care about
65:49
you
65:50
to me that is the thing of beauty that
65:52
God did it's not like why do we need
65:54
them
65:55
of course them because he knows the
65:58
beginning to the end
65:59
he knows when you will need them so i
66:01
would just say
66:02
thank God for them being there when you
66:05
and
66:05
one question related to that related
66:07
guardian angels you said before and i've
66:09
heard this by other people
66:10
they say your angel your angels or your
66:13
guardian angel
66:14
one or both can look like you when you
66:16
say like you do you mean
66:18
exactly like you does Kat Kerr's angel
66:21
look like Kat
66:22
if you can see it mine doesn't normally
66:25
look like me but i know that there are
66:26
probably times when they would have to
66:28
represent you for whatever
66:30
so it could be something to do with
66:32
maybe even saving your life or
66:33
preventing something happening in your
66:35
life
66:36
like of course as much as i know i don't
66:38
know everything and i don't mind saying
66:40
that
66:40
i do know the purpose of him making
66:42
things and i know how that operates
66:45
but there would probably be times when i
66:46
could see them looking like me
66:49
like if maybe harm was coming or
66:51
something they would appear as me and
66:52
walk in a different direction or go a
66:54
different way
66:55
and maybe people would follow them
66:56
thinking it was me to do harm then they
66:58
would just disappear
67:00
my own angels i know exactly what they
67:02
look like they don't look like me
67:04
but i can tell you why in a case like
67:07
that
67:08
yes absolutely yes they could look
67:10
exactly like you if that was necessary
67:12
wow okay good that's awesome well Kat
67:15
that's our time
67:16
you know below we have
67:18
revealingheaven.com it's on the screen
67:20
uh tell people that you have two sites
67:22
tell them about both sides
67:24
i think healingnevin.com is about my
67:26
corporation that God said he wanted me
67:28
to be a business person i am
67:30
ceo of one quest international which
67:33
creates and reveals heaven on earth
67:36
and so that would be when you would buy
67:38
products with all kinds of revelation in
67:40
it
67:41
uh like the cup i like to show the cup
67:43
because i love this i don't do demons
67:45
um there's all kinds of other stuff we
67:47
have on there with all of them have
67:49
revelation in them
67:50
uh there's image of places like in
67:52
heaven and stuff that you can see or get
67:54
um and then my other also it's where you
67:57
go to find out about our events
67:58
mostly they've been online but i will be
68:00
traveling again actually i also will be
68:02
at the arise summit
68:04
um this coming weekend with stephen
68:07
and my hubby will be going with me um
68:10
he's used to the cold and the
68:12
mountains and i guess he'll probably be
68:14
dragging me at mountains again like he
68:15
did in israel
68:17
anyway so um it tells you about events
68:20
and products and
68:22
KatKerr.com it's another whole website
68:25
God calls it his spiritual platform to
68:28
say whatever he wants to say
68:31
about whatever he has to say about it
68:34
and so that's what that is and there's
68:36
also
68:36
so many videos and interviews i had so
68:39
many done with patricia king and other
68:41
people
68:42
there's also some we made ourselves to
68:44
train you how to pray for your family
68:46
members to
68:47
to get to heaven how to do and learn
68:49
about different things in revelation how
68:51
to operate in
68:52
them and so that's the spiritual
68:54
platform it's also the only place
68:57
on the earth where you could give to me
69:00
if you want to give online you go to
69:01
KatKerr.com
69:03
and you click on the treasury you can
69:05
find out about the guardian zone which
69:07
is something that we've established for
69:09
those
69:09
who give on a regular basis and we love
69:12
people partnering
69:13
to help bring heaven to earth so those
69:15

02:32
well some of the best of the best of
02:35
these recordings that you're watching
02:36
here we then send out
02:38
on by email as well once a week or
02:41
sometimes twice a week so
02:43
uh let's see i want to answer one
02:45
question uh let's talk about youtube
02:47
personal answer this other question
02:49
be sure to subscribe to our youtube
02:50
channel that's where all of our programs
02:52
are listed you can see them at a glance
02:54
listen to the one you want so you go to
02:57
youtube.com
02:59
and then you pull up in the search box
03:01
elijah streams
03:03
and when the elijah streams comes up
03:05
then there's three things that you
03:07
click on the bottom the thumbs up right
03:09
there you click on subscribe and you
03:11
click on the bell and that way you'll be
03:12
your devices will be notified uh
03:15
whenever we're coming on live so
03:17
that's the best way to get on there
03:19
let's talk about
03:20
uh the chat let's see one of the biggest
03:23
questions people are asking us is where
03:26
do i submit
03:27
my questions we get your questions about
03:30
almost everywhere we get them from
03:32
underneath youtube we get them on the
03:34
comments and facebook and some people
03:36
have an email
03:38
uh that's the live just that's not
03:40
necessarily the way to do it but we do
03:41
see those there too
03:43
the one place we do not get your
03:45
questions is the chat
03:46
off to the right side of youtube it goes
03:49
by too fast we can't capture it
03:51
um that fast so what you do if you want
03:54
to leave your questions for youtube
03:55
write it down
03:57
at the end of the youtube program once
03:59
it's over or if you're seeing it on a
04:01
replay
04:02
you just put a comment underneath the
04:04
youtube screen
04:05
and we do look at all of those so
04:08
we're all at any one time or a couple
04:11
hundred
04:12
questions behind so 99.9 percent of you
04:17
will never get your question answered
04:19
live uh
04:20
because we're so far behind every once
04:22
in a while something is so potent we
04:23
grab it and ask it live but normally
04:25
that is not how it's density kind of
04:27
gonna get in line with that so
04:30
what else do i want to ask uh answer
04:32
that i think that's
04:33
it so today's Kat Kerr let's bring ken on
04:36
in here
04:38
hey Kat hi how are you doing
04:42
good it was good seeing you sunday or
04:44
this weekend out in bend oregon it was
04:46
uh
04:47
Kat and myself nathan french and johnny
04:50
ello as far as
04:51
our speakers here it was actually a
04:54
johnny inland
04:55
conference called the rice summit some
04:57
of you
04:58
uh were there you can get the replay if
05:00
you were if you paid for it you can
05:02
watch the replays so
05:04
yeah it was really powerful yeah so how
05:07
you then spoke on sunday i heard that
05:09
was pretty good
05:10
did you guys do something different on
05:12
sunday
05:14
i mainly prophesied corporately about
05:17
the time that we're in
05:19
and how that's going to change everybody
05:21
and um
05:23
it kind of lined up with the rise summit
05:25
but you know the father just spoke it
05:26
was really powerful
05:28
uh to encourage people and show them
05:30
some of the future
05:32
like beyond even this time that we're in
05:34
uh
05:35
what things would be like in their lives
05:37
so they can't look at what's going on
05:39
around them right now and think that's
05:40
going to be their normal it's not going
05:42
to be their normal
05:44
and i would also say this that um
05:47
we had so many more people watching
05:49
online than they ever thought they could
05:50
have i think they ended up with around
05:53
six thousand
05:54
45 minutes i believe is what they said
05:56
was represented
05:58
it was just wild but people know the
06:01
truth right they want to know what's
06:02
going on right now
06:04
yeah it could actually i i could
06:05
actually it may not may or may not be
06:07
true for you but that was
06:08
just by the numbers the single largest
06:10
conference i've ever spoken at was 6 000
06:13
at least in the us there was one i did
06:14
in africa that was like
06:16
15 000 but i was just uh
06:20
i was the only white boy in town and
06:22
they called me man of God
06:24
in africa you know they're very very
06:26
respectful
06:27
uh to to those people who are they're
06:30
they're very
06:31
hierarchy oriented they there's a
06:33
stepping
06:34
it's just kind of the way it works in
06:35
africa yeah the top dog in there and so
06:38
we were a man of God and because
06:41
there was a couple of us white speakers
06:43
that were brought on over so
06:45
you'd go to these conferences and
06:47
outside they were selling all these
06:48
pictures here's this whole row of
06:50
pictures of
06:51
of this white guy steve shelf speaking
06:53
and people would buy
06:54
photos on it's a really different kind
06:56
of a culture
06:57
and uh yeah they have these things for
06:59
sales have you been over there yet
07:01
to africa i have 25 invitations to go to
07:04
almost every
07:06
any of the major cities or places there
07:08
but God said that he would have it for
07:10
another time
07:11
now i've spoken at some of those who
07:14
came over here and had meetings and i
07:15
was
07:16
i spoke in america uh you know being a
07:19
part of their conference here in america
07:21
which was
07:22
insane i think it went to like 100 000
07:25
people online
07:26
everybody was watching everywhere in
07:28
africa because of the speaker who was
07:30
there that was bringing the meeting it
07:32
was in atlanta
07:34
and uh it was wild i think it was
07:36
something from nigeria
07:38
where they told town they literally
07:40
pulled down the satanic altars
07:42
uh the mountain opens and swallows them
07:44
up um
07:46
it was really quite something they
07:47
talked about witch doctors and all this
07:49
other stuff that we don't see a lot
07:51
of that level of the darkness showing up
07:53
but the glory was just as powerful so
07:56
uh my husband's waiting for me to go
07:58
i'll go
08:00
then nigeria i remember again this is
08:02
about 20 years ago
08:03
and the worship was so profound and
08:06
again there's like 15 000 people
08:08
at any one time up front there's someone
08:11
having a deliverance very often so
08:13
throughout the service especially during
08:14
worship
08:15
someone would go there and they begin to
08:17
manifest and then i
08:18
remember i'll never forget he's beaten
08:20
himself up you could tell he's beating
08:22
himself
08:22
up and it wasn't voluntary it was
08:24
involuntary so he knew what kind of
08:25
demon
08:26
it was and it got more and more intense
08:29
and finally he just collapsed
08:31
and and was delivered and after a while
08:33
was able to get up and
08:35
and have his right mind but that's how
08:38
we don't
08:38
no we don't have that in our services no
08:41
uh
08:42
the enemy's been uh controlling so much
08:44
of that country for so
08:46
for probably centuries actually and now
08:49
they got such powerful men and women and
08:52
i
08:52
from the speaker that brought me he said
08:55
if you don't live that way you die
08:57
if you try to come against those
08:58
principalities not the principalities
09:00
and powers but any principalities that
09:02
are ruling me in the darkness
09:04
they have real witch doctors who really
09:06
fly and they do all kinds of sacrifices
09:08
and stuff so
09:09
you better be strong if you are just
09:11
going to make a trip
09:12
if you go there make sure it's God
09:14
sending you there
09:15
make sure you connect with somebody
09:16
powerful over there
09:19
because they're not it's not like a game
09:20
not that it's a game here but
09:22
it's so much deeper and farther there
09:25
than here i will go
09:28
and the people there know it because
09:29
what they would take is from our hotel
09:31
which is about a couple miles drive
09:33
yes and and when they when we get in the
09:35
car from the hotel
09:37
they they'd stop and they would pray for
09:41
for protection from the hotel to the
09:42
church and when we left the church to go
09:45
back to home
09:45
they would pray for protection from the
09:47
church to the hotel
09:49
they prayed every time there was
09:51
movement and it was a real
09:53
life lesson for me it is it is a totally
09:56
different lifestyle and culture over
09:58
there like you said but
09:59
the thing that happens is there's such
10:02
damage
10:02
done to the enemy's plans and even the
10:06
hierarchy of hell that's there is
10:07
shredded
10:08
and pulled down when when we're when God
10:11
sends us there the unperfect sentence
10:12
there
10:13
is for a powerful purpose to come into
10:15
agreement with another leader of other
10:17
countries who are
10:19
wanting to rescue their people's lives
10:21
from that darkness
10:23
and i think probably more now than ever
10:25
before i must we'll jump into that we're
10:26
seeing some of that show up here
10:28
in the in the laws and the regulations
10:30
trying to be made by those who have fake
10:32
authority here
10:34
almost every regulation or thing that
10:36
they're making is something that's
10:37
wicked or evil
10:39
and you see that all the time over in
10:40
those other countries
10:42
so whenever God can get somebody in
10:44
africa in a high position
10:46
as a man of God things swiftly change
10:49
right there in that city or in that
10:51
country so we're gonna see a lot of
10:53
shifting
10:54
and i can believe this for sure
10:57
some of the greatest victories will ever
10:59
have in our lives will happen to us
11:01
probably over the next few months at
11:03
least i have to say that
11:05
things will begin to be seen so openly
11:07
and while i'm at it
11:08
let me just give you a tip trump has
11:11
actually come up and finally opened his
11:13
entire own new website
11:15
that you can actually contact him freely
11:17
or freely get
11:18
information from him is 45
11:22
office.com and he launched it yesterday
11:25
i can imagine how many people already
11:27
signed up for but he'll be able to say
11:28
what he wants to to all of us
11:30
and i think that the left is very much
11:32
concerned about that
11:34
they they work so hard to keep us
11:36
separated
11:37
from someone who is our true leader and
11:40
now he's back
11:41
really he's back in that position and
11:43
he'll probably be letting us know a lot
11:44
of stuff that will be going on so
11:46
people are very excited and happy about
11:48
that but i will say this
11:51
these days coming up depending on which
11:53
side you're on
11:55
the light or the darkness it'll be the
11:57
greatest days of your life or the worst
11:59
days of your life
12:00
because when evil is disposed and pulled
12:02
down it's going to totally affect
12:04
those who thought they had gotten the
12:07
right thing
12:08
running after the right thing but when
12:09
they find out the wickedness and evil
12:11
that's behind all that
12:12
it'll shock them but we'll need to pray
12:15
for those people
12:16
i've already had a couple prayer times
12:18
for those people when the reality of the
12:20
what they thought they were getting
12:22
was just the opposite but on the right
12:24
the side of the right and life
12:25
there'll be massive celebrations in the
12:27
streets like i've been talking about i
12:29
know hank's been talking about it
12:30
that literally they are going to happen
12:32
and people will respond
12:34
when God begins to shift it back in the
12:37
way
12:38
he is designed to operate in this time
12:41
that's that's amazing well um how
12:44
if i can ask the question this way how
12:47
eminent
12:48
is it are we like days away from seeing
12:51
dramatic things what what is what is
12:53
what are you saying no God won't give me
12:55
a date he absolutely refuses to give me
12:57
a date i don't ever ask him for a date
12:59
i just keep on going with what he's
13:01
given me and this is what he literally
13:03
has said to me
13:04
audibly you will say these words as
13:07
long and as loud as you can that victory
13:11
is coming
13:12
justice will be served
13:15
and all of the evil will be exposed and
13:18
dealt with completely
13:20
and those are exactly his words until he
13:22
changes those words with me
13:24
i can't say it's going to be this next
13:26
week or next month
13:27
i do know it's a lot closer than it was
13:29
because number one
13:31
at least we can see and hear the one who
13:33
is a legitimate leader here in the
13:35
country
13:36
and now he's got a way we actually can
13:38
receive from him if you go sign
13:40
up and you get on his list you'll get
13:42
every notice he has about what he's
13:44
saying and doing
13:45
that should empower people right there
13:47
that we're no longer being canceled
13:50
because he is overwhelmingly overcome
13:53
he's got some of the greatest people in
13:55
technology working for him
13:57
and they won't be able to block a word
13:58
he says they can't stop that and i know
14:01
fear
14:02
will begin to fall on those people when
14:04
they realize
14:05
this is what's going to happen first
14:06
they themselves begin to realize their
14:08
plan is
14:09
crumbling when that happens
14:13
hell will be able to begin to desert
14:15
certain people in areas
14:16
because even they realize it's not
14:18
working and
14:20
they're going to just withdraw because
14:22
if they don't they will be in serious
14:24
trouble with God himself because God's
14:26
going to get really involved
14:28
literally involved in all of this and
14:30
because this is God's plan
14:32
maybe not man's way i just know what's
14:34
going to happen
14:36
and all those who are backing or
14:38
supporting
14:39
uh this whole plan on the left they're
14:42
all going to either
14:43
run and hide or they may abandon it
14:45
completely
14:46
but one thing that will happen and you
14:48
may even see it possibly in the news
14:50
them bashing each other i'm talking
14:52
about the highest leaders who are
14:54
in illegitimate positions may start
14:56
bashing each other
14:58
or just crumbling even behind the scenes
15:00
if you can't see it they're not going to
15:01
show that
15:02
they won't even show the truth about
15:04
what they're doing in the news
15:05
there's things they're hiding about the
15:07
southern border and don't want you to
15:09
know
15:09
there's things that are hiding in other
15:11
stuff they don't want you to know it
15:12
because they still want to fake as much
15:14
as they can
15:15
by using the news but i will say this
15:18
there are some people
15:19
in the news media that are leaving
15:21
because they know
15:23
if their soul didn't get corrupted by
15:25
listening to fake news their self
15:27
then they already realized this whole
15:29
thing is just falling apart
15:31
i know people the new york times already
15:33
know that the washington
15:35
post they know that also even fox news
15:38
some of the people in fox news i can't
15:40
say all of them
15:41
realize this is a horrible thing that
15:44
they're trying to do and there will be
15:46
no life
15:47
for anyone if they succeeded so now even
15:49
they are speaking against them which
15:51
wasn't happening before
15:53
so this should show you right there that
15:54
things are beginning to happen
15:56
even if they won't put it in their own
15:58
in the fake news they won't say it
16:00
okay but i know they themselves are
16:02
concerned this thing wasn't
16:04
wasn't planned well they just did
16:06
whatever they could to get in that place
16:08
uh that we all know is not true everyone
16:12
in this country knows the election was
16:13
stolen you know
16:15
i think 90 of the note was stolen so the
16:18
whole thing is crumbling now because
16:20
people are starting to speak
16:21
out and let me tell you that's how it
16:23
starts their foundation is very weak
16:26
and it's already falling apart there's
16:28
no way
16:29
they're going to be able to hold it
16:30
together and the more they try
16:32
is the worse it looks to people even
16:35
people overseas are saying what's wrong
16:37
with their minds can't they think right
16:38
can't they speak right
16:40
so even people in in the world are
16:42
realizing
16:43
this whole thing isn't going to last so
16:45
that should make people very happy just
16:46
from those words
16:47
yeah someone had written to me and asked
16:50
the question
16:51
um i wasn't going to ask you but maybe
16:53
i'll try it you don't watch the news
16:55
uh really but someone will bring it to
16:58
your attention
16:58
did you see the clip where biden had
17:01
fallen three times
17:02
going up the steps did you see that i
17:05
did see that somebody sent it to me
17:07
i figured they would do when you see
17:09
something like that does God
17:10
speak to you through that did do you get
17:13
a word of the lord
17:15
when that happened yeah that that whole
17:17
thing was really this no matter what
17:18
they said they said it was the wind
17:20
that's what they said
17:22
they said it was the wind then they said
17:24
his shoes were slippery they tried to
17:25
make up
17:26
everything this is the fake people
17:28
that's what they were saying was
17:30
happening
17:30
but it was God really saying you're not
17:32
climbing to that level you have no right
17:34
to that seat that's actually what he
17:36
said to me
17:37
well yeah the higher end it was good the
17:40
higher he went
17:41
the more he fell and he got to the
17:42
highest point then he fell
17:44
well
17:53
okay so let's jump into that anyone
17:54
that's new may or may not know
17:56
Kat's been having many many times so we
17:59
do uh
18:00
wednesdays with kat steve we hit the
18:02
political scene for a while then we go
18:04
into more questions about heaven
18:06
we have hundreds of and then people get
18:07
into other areas that God would have
18:10
shown you
18:10
so it's mostly about heaven but some
18:14
are slightly different but this was kind
18:15
of in the middle this is a teenage
18:18
girl who's asking this question she said
18:20
are the jewish leaders and high priests
18:22
who falsely accused jesus
18:25
and the people who actually crucified
18:27
jesus
18:28
are they in heaven or hell or some of
18:31
each
18:32
i think that would have to depend on
18:34
what the decision they made themselves
18:36
before they actually died
18:39
i do know that some of those especially
18:41
of some of those who were like guards
18:44
and those who were around the cross
18:46
really did realize
18:47
he was the son of God when the
18:49
earthquake began to happen
18:50
it really freaked them out they didn't
18:52
expect that to happen
18:54
um and so that really stunned them and
18:57
many people actually at that time began
18:59
to realize he probably is the son of God
19:02
why would the earth respond
19:04
uh there were other things that happened
19:05
also in that very time that probably
19:07
shifted their mind like
19:09
what have we done you know what have we
19:10
done and we all know there's always
19:12
movies made
19:13
from way back when that they made
19:16
similar to those things happen
19:18
like um my my husband if he was here
19:20
could tell me what some of the names of
19:22
those for because he loves those movies
19:25
where even some gladiators realize that
19:27
jesus christ
19:28
was the son of God and in that time
19:31
frame of them
19:32
were battling in the arenas did realize
19:36
that they weren't going to do what they
19:37
were doing anymore and so many people
19:39
did and we all know what um that
19:41
you know i think it was was a pilot who
19:43
didn't want anything to do with what was
19:45
going on
19:46
uh one of them i know washed their hands
19:48
and said this sin will not be upon me
19:50
let it be upon the jews and actually
19:53
that's what did happen
19:54
but i do know that some of those who
19:56
were present at the cross
19:59
and saw the things that happened i think
20:02
in that moment they had decided he was
20:04
the son of God
20:05
so i would have to say there's probably
20:07
some in both places i'm sure some were
20:09
went to abraham's bosom if they made
20:11
that decide the decision in their heart
20:14
and i'm sure after that time when they
20:16
were hunting the jews
20:18
you know to take them the um apostles
20:21
that many of their lives probably were
20:22
saved by those who had decided jesus
20:24
christ was the son of God
20:26
and i know that there was some
20:27
protection given to some of them
20:29
so those surely had received christ and
20:32
i know that they're probably they're
20:33
most likely in heaven
20:35
so only God knows who and where but i do
20:38
know when the earthquake began to shake
20:40
the ground like right now that's
20:41
happening hello
20:43
people judgment was coming and you
20:45
better be ready for that happening
20:47
because the ground sure is shaking right
20:49
now
20:49
uh here not just in america but around
20:52
the world
20:53
so that's a great question no one's ever
20:55
asked that so kudos
20:56
really yeah interesting um
21:00
this says does ken hardly suggestions
21:02
how to bring a stubborn friend or family
21:04
member to jesus i've tried witnessing to
21:06
them
21:06
but it breaks my heart to think that
21:08
they may never accept jesus or go to
21:10
heaven
21:11
so i you know of course we've talked
21:13
about decreeing and standing for your
21:15
family yes but i mean
21:17
but and maybe that is the one and only
21:19
answer but this they're saying
21:20
is there anything that we're missing
21:22
about how to
21:23
bring someone to the lord i think
21:27
the worst thing to do is to continually
21:29
bring it before them
21:31
it's almost it's so hard for a family
21:35
member
21:36
unless you're so close together and
21:37
you've been close your whole life
21:39
that might help you show them kindness
21:42
and that sounds wild
21:44
to do that but if you make them move
21:46
further away from you
21:48
if you even though you're doing it in a
21:49
wonderful way if they're rejecting
21:51
rejecting
21:52
i would not keep bringing it up to them
21:54
because most people who are that
21:56
hard-hearted
21:57
they get born again by someone else God
21:59
sends them on their path this happens
22:01
more often than not
22:02
that it's someone else who wins them to
22:04
the lord it's okay just to say you know
22:07
don't forget jesus loves you
22:08
he's got a plan for your life so don't
22:10
give up on jesus
22:12
say it that way and then drop it don't
22:14
keep pushing them because you'll just
22:16
push them further away
22:18
and you may shut the only door you have
22:20
opened them
22:21
as a family member because i'll tell you
22:23
this if they
22:25
themselves get into a place where
22:26
they're desperate for prayer
22:28
uh maybe they've had a bad diagnosis
22:30
maybe some horrific thing has happened
22:32
to them
22:33
if you leave the door open for
22:35
communication by just
22:36
reminding them that jesus loves them as
22:38
a plan for their life don't give up on
22:40
jesus
22:41
uh i'm sure the devil is beating the
22:43
person up number one
22:44
to stay away from jesus they don't want
22:46
him there so you have to realize you
22:47
have to see what the enemy is saying to
22:49
that person
22:50
behind the scene you don't understand
22:52
but if you continue to love them that's
22:54
what my mom did with all of my siblings
22:56
she always left the door open if you
22:58
need me call me i'll always be
23:00
able to pray for you pray for you so why
23:02
don't you leave it
23:03
there because then if something happens
23:06
you'll be the first person they call
23:08
but if you continually try on them you
23:10
need to do this so you don't go to hell
23:12
you're just pushing them further away
23:14
and that's from my own life experience
23:17
uh that what you need to do trust holy
23:20
spirit to bring someone along their path
23:22
certainly pray that but most of all you
23:24
say
23:25
not to that person you say this to jesus
23:28
christ i'm standing in the gap
23:30
for my family member who does not want
23:32
you and i declare they will become a
23:35
living testimony of the saving power
23:38
that you carry
23:39
and that they'll be with me in eternity
23:41
and i'm standing in the gap i'm not
23:42
letting that go
23:43
that is the greatest number one thing
23:46
you can say
23:47
on their behalf other than that unless
23:50
they already know where you stand
23:52
if you you keep talking about them or
23:54
pressing them with us
23:55
they already know what you are and what
23:57
you believe just leave the door
23:59
enough that if they have a serious issue
24:02
they
24:02
i promise you you'll be the first person
24:04
they call
24:05
that's interesting you know there i i
24:07
would i would almost give the name of
24:08
this person
24:09
because it's it was a written in the
24:10
newspaper just a short time ago
24:12
but because um i don't know how wide it
24:15
is now there's a major leader
24:17
people on this list would know about it
24:19
that name and
24:20
and he had five children and they all
24:21
left the lord it sounds like
24:23
one especially then moved to new zealand
24:26
she became a buddhist and agnostic and
24:28
all that and
24:29
she wanted nothing to do with this
24:31
prophetic person's leadership
24:33
and she almost got a boat accident
24:35
almost died
24:36
he was the first person she called yeah
24:38
yeah
24:39
she she moved back because she's still
24:41
the same buddhist person
24:43
now she moved back and she got caught in
24:45
the hurricane
24:46
and had to be on the phone all night to
24:48
try and
24:49
have someone talk her through this
24:51
hurricane who was that person
24:52
her father again yes so she's still
24:56
this buddhist person but she keeps
24:59
calling her father
25:00
when the chips are down that's really
25:02
what you're saying he left the door open
25:03
yes but let me tell you what's really
25:05
happening and she doesn't realize it
25:08
if he's praying for over the phone and
25:10
she asks
25:11
for this those words he's speaking are
25:15
going into her
25:16
soul number one she gave permission uh
25:19
just to talk her through it
25:21
the presence of God that's in that
25:22
person calling her speaking to her
25:25
that frequency of God will go in her
25:27
soul and begin to break up the darkness
25:29
it may not be something that shows up
25:31
but every time she
25:32
goes to him she's getting more layers of
25:35
that life of God put in her
25:37
eventually it's going to get her to
25:40
christ
25:40
that's good that's good you know and
25:42
then that other thing jesus said
25:44
you know the fields are white for
25:45
harvest they said pray that the lord
25:47
will said laborers for the harvest of
25:49
he's talking about people
25:51
or angels or both probably all of the
25:54
above
26:04
all right well here's one people this
26:06
question says people say
26:07
God bless you all the time does
26:09
something happen in heaven once
26:11
when people say God bless you or is it
26:13
just kind of a saying
26:15
it's not just a saying if you're a
26:18
believer and you say those words
26:20
God will search out one of the best ways
26:23
he can bless that person
26:25
because when you say that to them you're
26:28
opening a window for God to come in and
26:30
do
26:30
something to show them he cares i would
26:33
say it's the number one thing i say to
26:35
most people no matter who they are where
26:37
they are
26:38
sometimes they'll just look at me when i
26:39
say that like
26:41
they didn't know it was a christian
26:42
number one but
26:44
they at least know you believe in God if
26:47
you say that so anything you can say
26:49
on behalf of jesus christ or the father
26:52
or holy spirit
26:54
you could say if people say well i'm
26:55
really struggling i'm going through a
26:56
hard time in my life
26:58
you may add may the spirit of God guide
27:00
you
27:01
see that that would they would want to
27:03
hear even though they didn't understand
27:04
that
27:05
there's always ways and i even encourage
27:07
people write down
27:08
some of these one-line things that you
27:10
may offer to a person maybe just like
27:12
three different ones
27:14
and if they make a conversation like i'm
27:16
having a hard day
27:17
then you can say like i pray the spirit
27:19
of God will lead you and give you wisdom
27:21
that that they kind of made a point to
27:24
say something
27:25
you gave an answer to them like i said
27:28
we don't know enough
27:30
of how much our words impact the soul of
27:32
that person
27:33
but what you say to somebody goes in
27:35
their soul and then they're totally
27:37
unaware that that puts something in
27:39
there that God can use so i would
27:40
totally say
27:41
i always say something especially from
27:44
the hard day
27:46
say well or just say i'll pray for you
27:48
but then when they walk away
27:49
they may not want you to touch them when
27:51
they walk away pray for the person God i
27:53
i ask in the name of jesus christ you
27:56
you help that person
27:57
they may know him they may serve him in
28:00
jesus name you're standing in the gap
28:02
and God will
28:03
never ignore those words good good
28:06
okay here's one i don't know why they're
28:09
in this if they're thinking of
28:10
sin in your life or whatever it says do
28:12
your angels
28:14
ever leave you permanently and they
28:16
didn't say why they're asking that
28:17
question gifts
28:18
they said if so for what reason would it
28:20
would your angel leave you permanently
28:23
i don't know of any time they left
28:25
anyone permanently
28:26
they're with them until the day they die
28:29
that's their assignment
28:32
and uh they need to be there for
28:33
purposes got that God has for their life
28:36
and so they may not watch everything
28:39
that they do
28:40
and they close their eyes and i've had
28:42
people say you know they they noticed
28:44
these other angels with their eyes
28:45
shadow said well then maybe you need to
28:47
think about saying something to God
28:49
because you know they have never left
28:52
anybody
28:53
when the time comes for them to pass
28:55
their assignment is to take them to
28:57
heaven they the
28:58
they're the ones who escort you to
28:59
heaven so they're not going to leave
29:01
leave somebody just because they turn to
29:03
bad in their life it may be the only way
29:05
their life gets saved
29:07
it may be the only way that they still
29:09
have the influence of
29:10
of God on their life so you know they're
29:14
with you
29:14
they're going to be with you until the
29:16
day that you pass and there's
29:18
hope and their belief is they will be
29:20
able to take you to heaven
29:22
i did there was a question i don't think
29:25
i've asked this
29:26
uh but i've been asked it a number of
29:28
times also about your angels when you
29:30
die
29:31
and your angels done with you for now
29:34
now maybe they'll have some r and r in
29:36
heaven
29:37
do they get reassigned to another person
29:39
and or do they get
29:40
assigned to someone else in the family
29:42
line do they stick with the family line
29:44
anything like that
29:47
from all that i've heard or known so far
29:50
in heaven
29:51
i don't know that they get reassigned he
29:53
has billions
29:54
of them there's more angels than there
29:57
are people on the earth
29:58
and i think that he probably takes them
30:01
back
30:01
because it because they do know this
30:03
people have gone home to heaven have
30:04
later got to meet their angels
30:06
if they were reassigned they wouldn't be
30:09
there
30:10
so i think for a period of if there was
30:12
time in heaven
30:13
that they would remain there and i know
30:15
that people have encountered their angel
30:17
several times and once they have gone
30:19
back have gone
30:20
and moved to heaven they've had
30:22
opportunities to see them have
30:23
discussions with them
30:25
and uh so i don't know personally at the
30:28
time when they were reassigned to
30:30
someone else on the earth i think think
30:32
they finished their course
30:34
there's so many things that they could
30:35
be doing in heaven or sent out on other
30:37
assignments not necessarily
30:40
as a guardian angel interesting okay
30:43
good now this one ephesians 2 6 they're
30:46
asking about that
30:47
they say can you elaborate where it says
30:49
and he raised us up together and made us
30:51
sit together in the heavenly places in
30:53
christ jesus
30:54
does that actually situate us someplace
30:57
in heaven with jesus in others do we
31:00
literally go are we seated with him or
31:03
is it just that we are always in christ
31:05
relational and it's just kind of a
31:07
neat way of saying we're in christ are
31:10
they talking about why you're on the
31:12
earth
31:12
i think that's the question you don't
31:15
have any
31:17
i know exactly what that means that
31:20
means when you receive jesus christ you
31:21
give him permission he takes a layer of
31:24
your soul
31:25
i've talked so much about the soul
31:27
before because i have a lot of
31:28
understanding and revelation on that
31:31
in your soul are layers of you that's
31:34
what all your emotions are
31:36
and so uh you actually what you give
31:38
yourself to
31:40
whether it's an addiction or it's a good
31:43
thing God gave you to be a part of you
31:44
actually give a layer of your soul
31:46
to that and what happens is you you have
31:49
a great tie
31:50
that's made with that i also know this
31:54
that when you receive jesus christ as
31:55
your savior he has the right
31:57
he takes a layer of your soul which just
32:00
looks just like you
32:01
it's you and he takes it and he
32:03
literally seats it
32:05
in heaven in a heavenly place
32:08
and many times the father sends for that
32:11
layer of you
32:12
to come before his commissioning throne
32:14
room if he's going to give you a
32:16
commission on the earth you're still
32:18
down here alive
32:19
but that layer of your soul that
32:20
represents you in heaven
32:22
he sends for that layer of view they
32:25
walk in the throne room
32:26
they'll kneel down he'll put a mantle on
32:29
that image of you that's
32:30
you that whatever you at the same time
32:32
angels are right there putting one on
32:34
you
32:35
on the earth so there are reasons why he
32:38
takes a part of you
32:39
out and that layer is seated in heavy
32:42
places if you went up there you'd see
32:43
you sitting on the throne
32:45
well you know i had a guy that was into
32:47
quantum a strong believer i met him in
32:50
australia
32:51
and we were talking about that kind i
32:53
don't remember was that scripture but he
32:54
said people don't
32:55
understand the boundaries of the human
32:58
spirit and that was the way he was
33:00
trying to define it
33:02
we think of the soul is here it stops
33:05
here
33:06
and the spirit stops here but using the
33:09
whole quantum
33:11
thing and light and all of that it may
33:13
not be
33:14
quite as defined by the out outside
33:17
edges of our skin i suppose
33:19
what do you what can you say about that
33:21
my father came
33:22
the father came and spent four hours
33:24
earth time
33:26
i literally saw how he made a human soul
33:28
i know what it looks like
33:30
and if you can see inside of yourself he
33:32
takes those layers of
33:33
you when you're a believer and he'll
33:36
send them places to another country to
33:37
preach the gospel that's why people see
33:39
you there
33:40
they met you there and then he sent that
33:42
letter back inside of you
33:44
so he has the ability to use you in
33:47
those ways
33:48
it's not so much that he's projecting
33:51
your spirit
33:52
man everywhere it's those layers of you
33:54
it's still you
33:56
it's still a part of you it's really you
33:57
it looks like you
33:59
it came from you and uh and then he will
34:02
put that back in
34:02
so that's literally how it actually
34:05
happens
34:06
and i do know that's how people can be
34:08
in two places at the same time
34:10
it's a layer of your soul that looks
34:11
like you that he takes the spirit of God
34:13
will take it
34:14
and send it to preach the gospel around
34:16
the world and that will happen more and
34:18
more and there'll be a time
34:20
when we have the understanding that
34:22
that's how we're made
34:24
and it says we're made in their image
34:26
holy spirit is
34:27
made that way it was not made holy
34:29
spirit is that way holy spirit has
34:32
unlimited layers of himself
34:35
now you don't look at him and see a
34:36
million layers they're in him
34:38
and when you invite the holy spirit to
34:40
indwell you he literally reaches and
34:41
takes a layer of him
34:43
that's him it's a whole of him and he
34:45
puts that in you
34:46
and you become the temple the holy
34:47
spirit you don't have a little piece of
34:49
holy spirit he's literally living in
34:51
there
34:51
but he never finishes that's how he can
34:54
be everywhere all at the same time
34:56
he has all these layers sent out of
34:58
himself that knows everything going on
35:00
and so even though people understand
35:02
quantum physics it's not like he's
35:03
taking you
35:05
just as you singly as you and putting
35:08
you all these places
35:09
in in a blink of an eye i understand a
35:11
little bit about quantum physics
35:13
but as far as you being in different
35:15
places it's that layer of your soul that
35:17
looks exactly like you
35:19
when he takes it out and sends it
35:21
somewhere it looks just as full
35:23
and operational as you personally be
35:26
it's the way God that's why he says
35:28
we're wonderfully
35:30
made that's one of the ways he made us
35:33
i there's a prophetic guy we've we i
35:36
won't
35:36
go into who he is and all that but he
35:38
had he's been transported to many cities
35:40
and
35:41
countries but he tells him an experience
35:44
where this
35:44
first began to happen but he would go to
35:47
bed the family would go to bed the kids
35:49
would be in bed the wife would enter
35:50
he's sitting in the chair and he decides
35:52
to walk
35:53
throughout the house and decides to pray
35:56
over the bedrooms and the doorposts for
35:58
his kids and he goes around the outside
36:01
of the house and prays around the
36:02
outside and he comes back to his chair
36:05
and he sees himself sitting there asleep
36:07
in the chair and he realizes
36:08
that God has raised has caused him to
36:12
well how are you describing leave his
36:14
body and do this or what what does that
36:16
sound like to you is that
36:17
it's the layer of his soul that i do
36:19
that all the time
36:20
that's exactly literally what is
36:22
happening
36:23
he's seeing his own body sitting there
36:26
but the layer of his soul is outside
36:29
doing those things
36:30
he feels himself he understands that
36:34
but it's not it's not that God's taking
36:38
him he's not separating his
36:39
body body it's becoming the layers you
36:42
have that he will take and send
36:44
and that's how people who still don't
36:46
know people who even
36:47
walk travel in the spirit that's a
36:49
little bit different if you travel in
36:51
the spirit and God has allowed that you
36:53
leave here you're gone
36:54
you travel the spirit to another country
36:56
that's a different thing
36:58
that you're sleeping and you see your
37:00
own body still there
37:01
that is the layer of your soul that is
37:04
you
37:04
you're a many layered being holy spirit
37:07
is an
37:08
unlimited layered being and we're made
37:10
in their image
37:12
and all these things are just beginning
37:14
to be known because God's giving
37:15
revelation
37:16
there'll be a point where people know
37:18
and the holy spirit may say okay we're
37:20
sending a layer we're sending a layer of
37:21
view to this country and you'll know
37:23
it's happening
37:24
but to even have that head knowledge of
37:26
your mind your natural mind can't
37:28
conceive of that
37:30
maybe if you're brilliant you can so
37:32
that is literally what he experienced
37:34
that was a layer of him you could feel
37:36
yourself walking on the ground
37:38
touching things and then eventually he
37:41
put you back
37:42
in there put you back inside your spirit
37:44
man
37:45
why he did this test Kat and i can't
37:49
remember it's the same
37:50
experience once he realized what was
37:51
happening or if it was a different night
37:54
but he said he tested it he wrote this
37:56
up in a book i think
37:57
and he was outside praying around the
38:00
house he thought i'm gonna test this he
38:02
took a handful of dirt
38:04
up on the air conditioning unit just so
38:06
it was laying there
38:08
dirt he picked up and then he goes back
38:11
and realizes he sees his body he's with
38:13
his body again
38:14
the next morning he goes out and that
38:15
handful of dirt is there
38:17
so he realizes in a material way
38:21
he was there he put the dirt on there
38:23
that's exactly what happens
38:25
that's why people if you send the lay of
38:27
your soul
38:28
to these countries they hugged you you
38:30
prayed for them literally laid hands on
38:32
them that was a physical thing
38:34
because it's a part of you it's the way
38:36
God made you
38:37
when he takes a layer out it becomes
38:39
solid as if it was you
38:41
yourself there so that was wise you
38:44
didn't do that but of course if he was
38:46
whole outside of himself he could pick
38:49
up the dirt he could have picked a
38:50
flower he could have left half a cup of
38:52
water sitting on the sink and it would
38:53
have been there
38:54
you they have to understand how he made
38:58
our soul that's why he told adam you are
39:01
a living soul
39:03
uh it's one of the most important parts
39:04
of your being and all those layers of
39:06
view
39:07
like i tell people all the time this
39:09
would be your will inside of you it's a
39:11
spiritual thing but it's you
39:14
here's your will it's the column coming
39:16
off of that
39:17
will are all these layers of view like
39:20
if i had taken a book and opened it up
39:23
it's the same way all these layers are
39:25
attached like this
39:26
can you see the cup and what God does he
39:29
reaches out and takes one out
39:31
and then that you hold right there but
39:33
your body
39:35
and your spirit is sitting right there
39:37
and here you are
39:38
here and you'll send you to countries uh
39:40
now people most people don't remember
39:43
that but that's exactly what he's
39:44
experiencing
39:45
so that was a great test he did that was
39:47
awesome yeah i had one experience like
39:49
that i told the story but basically
39:51
i was in my bed i saw my headstand i saw
39:55
my
39:56
clock i knew i was there at the same
39:57
time i was down the road in a bus
39:59
accident uh and praying for an
40:01
interceding for it and it was both real
40:03
and i knew i was in both places
40:05
that's the closest i've ever come i as
40:08
far as i am concerned i never left my
40:10
bed
40:11
but that was so real that's exactly what
40:13
happened
40:14
yeah so it's freaky but it was real i
40:17
mean it was good
40:18
i'll never forget it it was freaky good
40:20
i guess
40:22
okay here's a funny question um actually
40:24
it didn't used to be funny because when
40:26
i was really sick and i was dying
40:27
this back in the early 2000s 2005
40:31
70 i was really sick i got so
40:34
empathetic towards anyone that was in
40:37
pain that i
40:38
didn't even want to squish a bug i
40:40
didn't want to touch that thing
40:42
and yeah after i got well i stomped that
40:44
thing flat when it was
40:46
so this is the question is is it wrong
40:48
to kill bugs that come into the house
40:51
i say no
40:52
[Laughter]
40:56
there are some things God made just to
40:58
exist for his purpose here
41:00
and uh i've never seen a roach in heaven
41:03
okay
41:04
i'll tell you that there's no roaches no
41:05
mosquitoes i don't believe those things
41:08
have any kind of a soul whatsoever
41:10
now that would be different if it was a
41:11
different kind of creature
41:13
God doesn't like us to hurt the
41:15
creatures either he really doesn't
41:17
those who have um i think called the
41:19
spirit of life which is they have a
41:21
spiritual body
41:22
and that makes them have a soul and he
41:25
made them that way and that's why he
41:27
told noah
41:28
but every animal in the ark that has a
41:30
spirit of life in it well they were all
41:31
alive so what did that mean
41:33
i mean they had a spirit a spirit body
41:36
too
41:36
and they had a soul because God had to
41:39
make those
41:39
animals agree because in the normal
41:42
you're not going to have wild animals
41:44
running to get on a boat i don't care if
41:45
a storm is coming
41:46
because God impressed them all to go
41:49
with
41:50
noah to get on that ark and they could
41:53
not
41:53
have done it had they not been able to
41:55
choose with their soul and their will
41:57
to go with him and so there are
42:00
most creatures like our cats dogs
42:02
anything that would be in the zoo though
42:04
all of those animals
42:05
they have a soul they have a spirit man
42:07
a spirit body and they have a soul
42:10
and that's why when your own pet dies
42:12
your guardian angel
42:13
takes that spiritual body of your pet up
42:16
to heaven
42:18
okay good um which one of these do i ask
42:21
um this has been asked before i can't
42:22
remember if i've asked this to you but
42:24
that people keep asking okay we've got
42:26
our mansion in heaven and then one day
42:28
there's gonna be a new heaven and a new
42:29
earth does them does your mansion
42:31
in heaven come down to the earth what
42:34
what what's the difference between those
42:35
two
42:37
mansions if there are if they're
42:38
different because i think because he
42:40
makes the statement i will make all
42:42
things new
42:43
i think you'll have a new one and i
42:45
think you'll love it just as much as you
42:46
did the other one
42:48
if you compare that place when you pass
42:50
from this earth
42:52
and your guardian angels take you
42:54
sometimes you just go on up to the
42:56
cosmos and you arrive there
42:58
sometimes you're taking many different
43:00
ways i've seen people step in these
43:01
things that look like elevators and zip
43:03
you up
43:04
some go in chariots some going by planes
43:06
some going um like missiles or
43:09
all kinds of things to delight you
43:11
that's why he does that
43:12
but i can tell you that he made that
43:15
mansion
43:16
for you and the reason he gave you a
43:19
mansion and
43:20
property was so you could use the gift
43:23
he made you whether it's a baker an
43:25
artist
43:26
someone who's saying someone who holds
43:28
rodeos all kinds of things there's so
43:30
much adventure in heaven
43:32
that is your absolute destiny and heaven
43:35
is to use
43:36
what he made you to be in the natural
43:38
that that gift
43:40
and i think if he made all that for you
43:43
it says he's going to roll it all away
43:45
that's what the bible says and he'll
43:47
make
43:47
all things new a new heavens and a new
43:50
earth and even he himself this is what
43:54
he tells me the father i will pack my
43:56
bags at symbolic
43:58
and i will get on the new jerusalem and
44:00
i will come down to the new earth
44:03
that will be our home not just my house
44:06
but it'll be our home together
44:08
and we'll be there forever that's his
44:10
exact word so i have to say he's going
44:12
to make
44:12
everything brand new and that means
44:15
you'll have another
44:16
beautiful place that is yours to all
44:19
to do all kinds of wonderful things and
44:21
but we'll also get to travel through the
44:23
new heavens he makes
44:24
and you'll have planets for us to visit
44:26
just for fun you won't just stay there
44:29
you get to go to many places that have
44:30
been created to have fun
44:32
awesome awesome okay that i didn't
44:36
have a chance to look this scripture up
44:37
but he's referring to revelation
44:39
21 and states the c is no more but then
44:42
she quotes
44:43
according to revelation as different
44:44
fruit for every month
44:46
and she says are there months in heaven
44:48
i'm not that familiar with that specific
44:50
scripture do you know which one she's
44:52
talking about
44:53
talk about everyone scripture well
44:57
unfortunately i didn't look it up she
44:59
says you know we can save it for next
45:01
week and i can look it up but you're
45:03
you're saying you said before there are
45:04
not time in heaven right
45:06
no he he he does things by events
45:10
and every major thing that happens is an
45:12
event
45:13
and it depends on the translation
45:16
let me just push that a lot of the new
45:19
translations have changed
45:20
words to make more sense to us now
45:24
than it would but but then but they
45:26
don't have a they don't have
45:28
excuse me they don't have a son in the
45:30
moon that show one day then another day
45:32
another day they don't do that God's
45:34
light lights heaven
45:37
it's lit by the glory of God that never
45:39
goes out and so it's a whole total
45:41
experience it's still a world
45:44
which people even argue about that it's
45:45
too bad too late
45:47
i've been there many times it is a world
45:49
bigger than our own galaxy
45:51
and that's the father's house that's
45:53
what he calls it
45:54
and so he has a timeline and i've seen
45:58
a good part of his timeline and it will
46:00
have a dot and it says what event that
46:02
is
46:03
the event when this event happens a
46:05
fullness of time has come from that one
46:07
to this one
46:08
that means new things will happen new
46:10
ways will happen
46:11
uh you never stop belonging to him that
46:13
part never changes
46:15
but as time we know on the earth as time
46:17
goes by
46:18
even in the natural things change and
46:21
happen
46:22
because that just goes that's just the
46:24
way it is and so i can tell you
46:27
no calendar there won't be a calendar
46:29
per se like we have hanging on our wall
46:31
and i don't know why that bothers people
46:33
how can you keep track of
46:34
time there is no time it says in the
46:37
bible
46:38
time will be no more doesn't mean we
46:40
won't exist
46:42
that means it's in a whole new thing
46:44
God's created for us to enjoy
46:46
and a lot of the stuff in the past you
46:48
know not i mean
46:49
hard times and stuff like that really
46:52
hard times we won't remember
46:54
those things but you'll still remember
46:56
you you still remember
46:58
your family and the beautiful things you
47:00
experienced in heaven
47:01
he's literally going to make a new earth
47:03
and i also get
47:05
asked about that all the time i said he
47:07
says
47:08
he will roll it away like a garment
47:11
because when there was only the
47:12
spiritual realm and the father
47:15
went out and did nothing the word was in
47:17
him and when
47:18
father said physical realm the word
47:21
which was jesus christ stepped out
47:23
he took a scroll and he actually
47:25
stretched it around
47:27
they could be bigger than the whole
47:28
everything stretched it around
47:30
good part of the spirit realm that was a
47:32
physical realm so they could put
47:33
physical planets and stars the sun the
47:36
moon
47:36
this earth and us we could have a body
47:40
that's what he made there so we could
47:41
come here and have a body
47:43
so that's just part of the big picture
47:45
and he said
47:46
he will roll it away and i can tell you
47:48
why he'll run away he said roll away
47:50
hook the garment
47:51
he knows where the ends are of the
47:53
physical realm
47:54
physical realm holds time so in in the
47:58
in way into the future when we're there
48:01
there won't be calendars or clocks you
48:03
won't need it you'll know every time an
48:04
event is going to happen when you create
48:05
an event everybody knows about it
48:08
so it's a whole new life that your your
48:11
your human mind sometimes can't grasp
48:13
that
48:14
i i and this one has to do with time as
48:17
on heaven versus earth i don't know if
48:20
his men will or someone like man was on
48:22
the program and they said or i read it
48:25
and someone had gone to begin to take
48:27
classes in heaven
48:28
for for whatever they missed on earth i
48:30
don't know and by the time they got to
48:32
heaven and were in the middle of their
48:34
first
48:34
class 30 years had taken place on the
48:37
earth
48:38
does that kind of time warp is that kind
48:41
of like
48:42
it is and is it can be the opposite to
48:45
where you're
48:46
where you feel like you've been eons in
48:47
heaven and two days have gone by in the
48:49
earth how does
48:51
how do you make sense of the earth
48:52
because you've been there and back many
48:54
times
48:56
well when he takes me and brings me back
48:58
it's the same
48:59
time that i left now i know about
49:02
earth earth-wise time um the only thing
49:05
i notice is sometimes he takes me to one
49:08
place in heaven
49:09
sometimes i go he takes me to five
49:11
places in town in heaven
49:12
but that doesn't really necessarily
49:14
relate to
49:16
earth at all he just brings me back i'm
49:19
in the same place that was when he took
49:21
me
49:21
whether it was in the grocery store in
49:23
my driveway
49:25
sitting at my desk here in our offices
49:28
i'm right back exactly in that time that
49:32
he took me
49:33
so because there is no time in heaven
49:36
i can take people been caught up and
49:38
shown many things participated in things
49:41
and then you can bring them back but
49:43
normally it's
49:44
to the exact same time it was when you
49:46
left
49:47
interesting interesting all right here's
49:49
a question about the host of heaven he
49:51
said the host of heaven are the armies
49:53
of the lord
49:54
and God didn't create them to protect
49:55
heaven heaven needs no protection
49:58
he created them to protect us so what
49:59
happens the question is
50:01
what happens when death and hell are
50:03
thrown into the lake of fire
50:04
and there's no more need to defend uh
50:07
have either heaven or earth what what
50:10
happens to the host what do they do
50:13
i think they'll probably be the ones who
50:14
escort us to these other
50:16
planets to visit to enjoy ourselves and
50:19
they'll probably escort us back and that
50:21
might be more just to participate
50:23
and not to protect because there will be
50:25
no evil
50:26
anywhere all evil and wickedness will be
50:29
thrown in the lake of fire which will
50:31
not be
50:31
on the new earth not anywhere near the
50:34
new earth
50:35
and there's so there's no evil aliens
50:37
out there waiting to take us down
50:39
even when God ends time and he ends the
50:42
way this physical realm operates
50:44
we won't have to be concerned and i have
50:47
i have jokingly
50:48
said to the host i guess we'll have a
50:50
lot of tour guides
50:52
in eternity
50:55
yeah i hope it's not boring they gotta
50:56
fight feels like they want to find
50:58
something you know why they won't be
51:00
bored steve they won't have to fight
51:04
yeah that's good okay out of all the
51:07
terms and i've had three quick i'm going
51:08
to blend a couple of these together
51:10
they're wanting to know if you've seen
51:12
adam and eve and or talked with them
51:14
have you seen solomon
51:15
and have you seen princess die those are
51:17
the three that are big that
51:19
i'm putting them together from different
51:20
people i have totally seen adam and eve
51:23
several times absolutely seen adam and
51:25
eve
51:26
some of them i don't always have
51:28
conversation with they may take me by to
51:30
let me see them and they're having
51:31
conversation with people who have
51:33
arrived in heaven because everybody
51:34
wants to meet adam and eve
51:36
of course they made it to heaven they
51:38
were the first ones he made
51:39
and even though they fell in you know in
51:42
sin in the garden
51:43
they did get restored to God eventually
51:46
they had to teach their own
51:47
children about God himself which they
51:50
did well
51:52
because if they hadn't you know then you
51:54
know even then they had to make a choice
51:56
right
51:57
their sons had to make a choice one
51:58
serve God and love God
52:00
the other let pride get in his life so
52:03
but still
52:04
how do you think he learned who he was
52:06
because they didn't have any children
52:08
when they left the garden that means
52:10
adam and eve had to share with them
52:12
about him so yes their adam and eve is
52:15
in heaven
52:16
and i'm trying to remember i know you
52:18
said princess dye was one who was the
52:20
other one
52:22
uh um adam a princess diane solomon
52:26
solomon is absolutely in heaven he is in
52:28
heaven
52:29
um he obeyed God he did what he
52:33
asked him to do he established the
52:35
temple which was the greatest thing God
52:37
asked and the only thing he asked him to
52:38
do was establish the temple
52:40
and some willingly willingly did
52:43
so many sacrifices and gave to God
52:46
more than what God had asked at that
52:48
time in his life when he got older i'm
52:51
sure when anybody gets older they don't
52:53
think
52:53
quite as well and i think he probably
52:55
lived quite a long time
52:57
but i can tell you that as far as i know
52:59
he is solomon
53:00
is in heaven i've seen him i've seen
53:02
king david
53:05
i did not see saul which kind of
53:07
surprised me
53:09
i didn't see saul i saw king david i saw
53:12
solomon
53:12
now you have to imagine you're talking
53:14
about a world bigger than our whole
53:16
cosmos
53:17
and i've seen even though it's been over
53:19
20 years i've seen
53:20
bits of it i have seen quite a few
53:24
people
53:24
humans who are in heaven like from the
53:27
even
53:28
from the past i've seen quite a few of
53:30
the apostles
53:31
i've seen what they're doing people just
53:34
love to find them and talk to them
53:35
so that kind of thing goes on a lot i've
53:38
seen
53:39
john wayne and then later found out that
53:41
his daughter was with him when he
53:43
received jesus christ as a savior
53:45
i tell people i've seen elvis several
53:48
times he's
53:48
usually with jesus when they see him and
53:51
i've seen some athletes that are
53:53
that are up there um i know meadowlark
53:56
lemon i've seen him in heaven he went to
53:58
heaven
53:59
still playing basketball by the way he's
54:01
playing basketball
54:03
he's still playing basketball yes he is
54:05
so i've seen some of the
54:06
people we would say were great people
54:09
people wanted to know them i've seen
54:11
quite a few of them in in heaven the one
54:13
person i have seen
54:14
in hell i've been to hell like three or
54:16
four times now
54:17
i saw hitler in hell
54:21
and i know this sounds terrible but
54:24
satan makes an example of him all the
54:26
time that he was so evil he
54:27
he talked about the the great deceit he
54:29
put upon him and used him
54:31
he'll even blatantly say to him his face
54:33
i used you
54:35
you thought you were wicked and evil but
54:36
it was me and i used you to kill
54:38
millions
54:39
and he's tortured almost more than
54:41
anyone else in hell
54:42
on purpose because he gave so much of
54:45
himself it's totally different
54:46
if you give yourself to God you get
54:47
great you're rewarded if you give
54:49
yourself to satan you're going to be
54:50
you're gonna be uh crushed and a torture
54:53
more than anyone else so don't do that
54:55
people you're never gonna win
54:57
nobody wins in this whole group even now
54:59
that's up there
55:01
uh being uh wicked and evil who are
55:04
sitting in a place that they don't
55:06
deserve and they didn't earn i'm talking
55:08
about in our government
55:10
if they if they do go to hell they'll be
55:12
tortured more than the rest
55:13
because they gave themselves totally to
55:15
the enemy
55:16
that's why it's important for you to
55:18
reconsider your ways God says that
55:21
he desires that the violence sinner be
55:24
free that doesn't mean they're going to
55:25
be free
55:26
they have to choose and repent of that
55:28
things okay that doesn't mean they're
55:29
going to automatically make it
55:32
nobody automatically makes it i have to
55:34
say that
55:35
they will receive uh they will repent we
55:38
see the blood of jesus and
55:39
sometimes it's as they're dying and
55:42
maybe you just
55:43
say this is for your family members if
55:45
you stood for them
55:47
i can almost assure you to say that if
55:49
you made that stain for their salvation
55:51
90 of the time they're going to end up
55:53
by making it into heaven because they're
55:54
not going to say no if they're dying and
55:56
they know they're dying
55:58
and christ appears to them which that
56:00
does happen that's what those keys are
56:02
he took from satan the keys of hell deaf
56:04
and the grave
56:05
were were realms realms of authority
56:08
that he took away from him
56:10
and christ has access to them but he
56:13
needs
56:13
our words now he can't go rescue
56:16
somebody out of hell that died three
56:17
months ago or three years ago or 30.
56:20
it's that's just not going to happen but
56:22
i can tell you it's important for you
56:24
as a believer to make a stand for their
56:27
salvation like we said earlier
56:29
but the more you give yourself to satan
56:31
the worse your torture
56:32
will be in hell on
56:36
back in the days when people preachers
56:38
would preach fire and brimstone
56:40
and people would come running to the
56:41
altar is
56:44
here's what i want to ask you salvation
56:46
salvation
56:47
so so say thousands and millions
56:51
came to God because they were scared to
56:53
death of hell
56:54
and that's how they got in they said i
56:56
want nothing to do with that
56:57
sure i'll accept the lord that they and
56:59
and so they walk that out versus
57:01
seminars who just love God
57:03
it is salvation salvation no matter how
57:06
they get in
57:07
is there a preferable way is it better
57:09
not to be scared
57:11
i would just say this it depends on the
57:12
sincerity of their heart
57:15
and the only one who knows that is God
57:18
God will make a judgment if they really
57:21
sincerely received his son
57:23
this is the father the father sits as
57:25
judge okay
57:27
that's who makes that decision did they
57:29
sincerely
57:30
make a commitment to receive my son and
57:33
maybe they had a really rough life
57:35
maybe they would go up and down up and
57:37
down but they never turned from that
57:39
salvation
57:40
they would be in heaven their reward may
57:42
not be great
57:44
but but i know people or i know people
57:47
like even somebody close on my staff
57:49
that their their husband was just a
57:52
horrible person
57:53
but they went and prayed with him with
57:55
one of my other family members and her
57:57
her ex-husband totally absolutely
57:59
received christ
58:00
was not a good person his whole life and
58:02
they sincerely made that
58:04
and i actually saw that person in heaven
58:06
and where they were living
58:08
they didn't have a big mansion but they
58:09
had the most beautiful place
58:11
like this huge massive maybe three
58:14
thousand four thousand foot
58:15
uh cabin on part of the sea and i didn't
58:18
know anything about them i saw their dog
58:20
their dog was named pepper i didn't know
58:22
that dog i never met this person
58:25
and i knew that they were fishing they
58:26
loved to fish so i came back and
58:28
confirmed hey
58:30
he made it to heaven they were really
58:31
happy so
58:33
people who make it to heaven are
58:35
overjoyed that they're there especially
58:37
it was at the last moment
58:39
maybe they made a commitment very early
58:41
in their life but they never turned
58:43
from that commitment to christ no matter
58:46
how it was done then they will most
58:49
likely be in heaven if they were wicked
58:50
and evil and sin
58:51
horribly and were wicked to people
58:54
that's they
58:55
that's going to cancel that out they
58:56
need to make a recommitment to christ
58:58
but don't stop believing for their
59:00
salvation
59:02
you know when you you ended up with this
59:03
thing about some people may not have
59:05
great rewards i think of my father that
59:07
way because he lived a great wicked life
59:08
but then he got to be
59:10
went to be with the lord at the last
59:11
minute just got
59:13
very safe so we talked about people
59:15
didn't have much reward
59:17
but they wouldn't care if they had a
59:18
little cabin
59:22
but then the question was someone asked
59:23
me what if someone goes to heaven like
59:26
that
59:27
and do they um
59:30
what if they like my father like to
59:32
build things when he gets to heaven has
59:34
a little
59:35
tiny cabinet he says he's going on a
59:36
building i want to make a great big
59:38
cabin do will people
59:39
can people do that do they do that do
59:42
they add i don't
59:43
i don't think they do that i think they
59:45
may i think he will be
59:46
welcome to be part of other projects
59:48
that God is doing
59:50
if that was actually a gift he had if
59:52
that was something that he loved to do
59:54
uh even though he made it in by the skin
59:56
of his teeth that's what i tell people
59:58
he's so happy because that thing he's
60:01
living in was
60:02
made by God himself wow what have
60:05
mercy and love for him
60:08
he wouldn't want to change it see people
60:11
don't think like we do on the earth
60:12
maybe i'll make it better or great that
60:14
won't even enter his mind
60:16
he is grateful and overjoyed that he
60:18
didn't go to hell
60:20
and he's so thankful for the thing God
60:22
made him he loves it
60:23
he'll love it God gave him he'll love
60:26
the mercy of christ
60:28
and all they are all they are grateful
60:30
they're happy for people who have
60:32
places that are bigger no one's jealous
60:35
no coveting
60:36
no pride joy everlasting is what they
60:40
have and
60:40
but if somebody else if jesus has got a
60:42
project going on and he does this quite
60:44
often
60:46
jesus will build new places for people
60:48
to enjoy people who have gifts
60:50
like designers or like like wood work
60:53
people who work with wood and stuff like
60:54
that he will actually go invite them
60:56
to be a part of what he's doing
60:58
interesting okay
60:59
hey someone uh they sent me i don't know
61:01
if this is my producer but she said
61:03
because you've seen hitler in hell now
61:05
judas said i betrayed innocent blood and
61:07
then he killed himself
61:09
is judas in hell judas is in hell
61:14
in the story you need to go back to the
61:16
scripture God always takes me back to
61:18
scripture
61:19
and jesus was talking to the father and
61:21
he was thanking him
61:23
you know he loved the fact that he could
61:24
be in and out of each other
61:26
he said father i have all that you gave
61:28
me
61:30
except for the son of perdition that
61:33
tells you right then you can go to
61:34
heaven that was judas
61:36
because he gave him the 12 disciples he
61:38
said i have all that you gave me talking
61:40
about the disciples
61:41
except for the son of perdition that was
61:43
judas so he did not go to heaven and
61:46
christ was making that plane he i didn't
61:47
get him
61:48
in other words he didn't he didn't
61:50
repent of his
61:52
sins even sorry he was caught
61:55
yeah and he knew that it was such a
61:57
horrible thing that he felt
61:59
he which was the worst thing he could
62:01
have done because that just set him to
62:03
hell
62:03
quicker so no he judas is not in heaven
62:07
in christ actually
62:08
himself and then you may i don't have
62:12
this
62:12
absolutely but i think when when jesus
62:14
prayed and said i've lost none except
62:16
the son of perdition that was like john
62:18
14 or 17 was it
62:20
judas had not yet betrayed him yeah
62:23
but he knew what was in his heart okay
62:26
i mean he knew he knew he was lost his
62:29
disappointment he was
62:30
totally the son of God at that
62:32
appointment he knew
62:34
that but he knew he had turned against
62:36
him no he knew it was already in his
62:37
heart
62:38
from the time he added judas he could
62:40
see everything that was in his soul that
62:42
was something christ could do
62:44
he knew the thoughts and intents of
62:45
judas's heart and his heart was
62:47
deception
62:48
he stole some of the money from the
62:50
offering that's why he
62:52
wanted to make sure he carried the money
62:54
back
62:55
so he was dishonest from the beginning
62:57
he was disgruntled he actually talked
62:59
amongst the others about how unhappy he
63:01
was about stuff that christ was doing
63:03
and he wanted him to be the son of God
63:05
for all of them to make them all look
63:07
great
63:07
christ knew every bit of this he knew
63:10
and at the last supper when he said go
63:12
do what you must do
63:13
he knew what he was going to do yeah
63:18
decision judas had already made that
63:20
decision this is what i'm going to do
63:23
yeah wow on the opposite end people have
63:26
asked me over and over and
63:28
i keep forgetting to ask answer this
63:30
soon or ask this
63:32
mary of course the catholics venerated
63:34
to maybe almost put or too high but
63:36
mary said and prophesied all nations
63:39
will call me blessed so
63:41
it seems like mary the mother of jesus
63:43
would have a super special place
63:46
in in the lord's heart is she considered
63:48
the mother of jesus
63:50
in heaven does she have an amazing
63:52
mansion what have you seen about mary in
63:54
heaven
63:55
i see that mary is really humble even in
63:58
heaven
63:58
that God would entrust her with birthing
64:02
the son of God
64:03
which she kind of always was like that
64:05
really she doesn't
64:07
have some massive huge big mansion
64:11
i don't know that she would necessarily
64:12
want that i've seen her with jesus off
64:14
and on myself and when i was in heaven i
64:16
would see her with him
64:18
and she has still got the love of a
64:20
mother
64:21
because you don't stop loving your
64:22
children even though you're known as
64:25
like you're known as the son or daughter
64:27
of God whom you have near his son and
64:29
his daughter
64:30
although you have great relationships
64:31
with those who were with your family
64:33
hers is the same way she helped to raise
64:36
him and she knew him
64:38
she refuses to allow anyone in heaven to
64:40
worship her and nobody
64:42
what's in you when you get there the
64:45
second
64:45
is that to worship and love jesus christ
64:48
the son of God
64:49
and the father and holy spirit even holy
64:52
spirit and father in ways you didn't
64:54
before because they are the Godhead but
64:57
mary certainly loves the memories she
65:00
have
65:01
of raising christ and the things that he
65:03
did on the earth
65:04
people honor her highly honor is
65:07
different than
65:08
worship but she certainly is honored
65:10
because of what she
65:11
went through knowing she was carrying
65:14
the son of God having to watch him
65:16
die on the cross although great joy came
65:18
upon her
65:19
when she knew that he had been raised
65:21
from the dead so she doesn't carry any
65:23
sorrow or even a sorrowful memory she
65:25
just remembers that God
65:27
trusted her to carry him uh the son of
65:31
God in her and
65:32
she still does even though he said on
65:34
the cross to john
65:36
john behold your mother and he said to
65:39
mary behold your son
65:40
and at that very moment he had to die on
65:43
that cross as her savior
65:46
he couldn't dying as your son he was
65:48
dying as the son of
65:50
God and even though he said that there
65:52
on the earth in front of all those who
65:54
were at the cross
65:55
he was actually saying to john here you
65:57
will care for
65:58
she will not be your mother to care for
66:01
that doesn't mean he wiped away the
66:02
memory
66:03
that she she raised him so that's where
66:06
he is he honors
66:09
she's highly honored in heaven and i
66:11
have to say this to catholics all the
66:13
time there's only one that's worshipped
66:14
it's not mary
66:17
well and speaking of memories uh let's
66:19
we'll
66:20
probably end on this question because
66:21
that's our time but you know in my
66:24
generation we had
66:25
pictures and we started taking pictures
66:27
here a photographer
66:28
and we said we could have pictures the
66:30
lord will put some of our favorite
66:31
pictures in heaven
66:32
mary had no photographer in heaven she
66:35
has no photographs
66:36
might the lord preserve some images and
66:39
put it in her house
66:40
could she have a promise she's got
66:42
photographs of her with him when he was
66:44
a baby
66:45
the angels were there i think they have
66:47
photographer angels because
66:50
there are some that do nothing but take
66:52
the pictures
66:53
and i promise when she got to her
66:55
mansion she saw
66:56
a gallery of all the pictures when she
66:59
was telling that
67:00
that's that uh truth to elizabeth
67:04
and he and and you know john left in the
67:06
womb of elizabeth
67:08
i i know that encounter i'm sure that
67:11
was photographed i'm sure
67:12
them going to bethlehem the brotherhood
67:14
she's probably got pictures all over in
67:16
her own mansion she probably got a
67:18
gallery of all that
67:19
well i want to see those i want to go
67:21
visit people
67:24
that's good you you have not seen you
67:26
have not been in her in her mansion
67:28
though
67:30
i have i've seen glimpses of inside her
67:33
mansion parts of it
67:34
no not all of it of course i've seen
67:36
parts of it
67:38
because of christ himself the father
67:42
taped the father his videographers i
67:45
know what they call them
67:46
the father tapes everything
67:49
because when you get to heaven now when
67:51
you get born again he goes back and
67:53
edits
67:54
all the sin out and they they tape
67:57
everything they tape our lives and then
67:59
they will take
68:00
all those parts out that were sin he
68:03
takes them out
68:04
you yourself can go back when you get to
68:06
heaven and go to these uh
68:08
video uh places like theaters and you
68:10
want your whole life flipped over
68:13
from the from the time that you're born
68:15
you watch your whole life lived over all
68:16
the crazy silly fun things you did
68:19
um the things you did yourself as you
68:22
got older
68:23
especially all the times you help
68:24
somebody you love somebody
68:26
all it's all there so you can see your
68:28
own life left over
68:30
but this is what's included in that
68:32
video will be the holy spirit your
68:34
guardian angels you see everything
68:36
you're guarding that at that moment
68:37
you'll know all the things they did to
68:39
preserve your life
68:40
or to whisper things in your ear that
68:42
maybe you needed to know
68:44
if you're trying to make a decision you
68:45
see every bit of it
68:47
when you get to heaven wow that's
68:50
amazing that's amazing
68:52
you know that's the first time it ever
68:53
occurred to me that mary would have
68:54
pictures of
68:55
of jesus but why wouldn't she you're
68:57
right yeah why wouldn't you
68:58
if some of mine are up there and i and i
69:01
actually was told that
69:02
when i had to lay down he said you lay
69:04
down your photography gift i put in you
69:06
you use it in heaven
69:08
but now the thing i want you to to
69:09
photograph the most will be the host
69:12
so i'm a photographer of the host of
69:13
heaven right now that's what i do
69:15
he said every time you want a picture
69:18
all you have to say is
69:19
i want a photograph of that and they
69:22
take it and then it's put in my mansion
69:25
crazy well kat that's our time uh
69:29
tell people about how to get ahold of we
69:30
have revealingheaven.com on the screen
69:33
tell people which places to go for what
69:37
yeah if you want to know more about
69:39
events or any of the products we have
69:41
our store is at revealingheaven.com
69:45
if you want more revelation on the
69:47
spirit realm
69:48
on heaven on how to pray for your family
69:51
members and that's on
69:52
katker.com um it doesn't cost you
69:55
anything to go to either place
69:57
i will i do want to make mention of
69:58
something i had a call from johnny
70:00
anderle this morning
70:02
and somebody contacted him and said
70:04
somebody ordered my book off of
70:05
amazon.com revealing heaven book
70:08
and when they got it it wasn't my book
70:11
the cover was right
70:12
but inside the printers had made a
70:14
mistake and they put some story in there
70:17
it was about a baker's daughter or
70:19
something
70:21
so if you get that that's not something
70:24
that we did
70:25
you contact amazon.com and tell them
70:28
that they printed the wrong story in the
70:31
book and
70:32
they should either replace that for you
70:34
or give you back your money
70:36
and that just happened so we haven't
70:38
heard that before
70:39
but our own zoolon press
70:42
um they have their own printers that
70:45
they print and send stuff out and we did
70:47
call them to let them know about it
70:48
but they said that must have been on the
70:50
side of amazon's
70:52
printers who have admission for all they
70:55
get so many orders they have permission
70:56
to print that
70:57
so that probably been on their side so
71:00
that's normal story i'm not a baker's
71:03
daughter
71:05
wow i didn't even know amazon did that
71:07
well awesome
71:08
um one last question people say what is
71:10
the movie you said you're working on a
71:12
movie do you have any idea how many
71:14
years or
71:15
how out that is well you all know this
71:18
okay
71:18
literally i am rewriting a script
71:22
for one of the resurrection movies that
71:24
were being made but all of that we know
71:27
stopped hollywood has come to a halt
71:30
uh any projects have come to a halt so
71:33
anything that's been anything you see
71:34
now in the movies were things that were
71:36
made probably in um
71:40
2020 you know what i mean probably made
71:42
some 90 20 or almost none
71:45
but there's nothing that's been made new
71:47
that i know of unless it's only stuff
71:49
made
71:49
online and presented online
71:53
uh so the whole project they had to stop
71:55
that producer contacted me and said we
71:56
got to stop
71:57
everything but inform me that if i want
71:59

72:11

72:23

02:31

02:57
we're cycling this through so we'll
03:01

03:21
that we're on online and online people
03:25
will often forget that it's that time
03:28
although we have a pretty loyal
03:29
following so and of you will not forget
03:32
but um let's see i think uh
03:37
i will say this this is not related
03:40
necessarily to Kat
03:41
because this happened a lot with manuel
03:43
but sometimes
03:45
there's a slight delay plus we usually
03:47
have is
03:48
like manuel yesterday had like five
03:50
points he wanted to cover
03:53
uh but manuel doesn't leave openings he
03:55
just kind of keeps going so
03:58
i i have to interrupt sometimes and
04:00
every once in a while i interrupt
04:02
a super important point if it's really
04:05
good i try to say hold on hold on
04:07
uh say that again but we do interrupt
04:10
sometimes because we
04:11
we want to honor the guest and giving
04:14
their five points or whatever so
04:16
uh please forgive me for interrupting um
04:19
but we're trying to get all the content
04:21
to you we actually
04:23
we actually do let people talk more than
04:25
almost any talk show on the air we let
04:27
them
04:28
go for quite a while but every once in a
04:30
while right about the time
04:32
i'm about to enter i interrupt and i'm
04:35
right in the middle of interrupting
04:37
pardon my pardon my interrupting
04:41
as i'm speaking don't start say you've
04:43
got to hear this
04:45
i i blew it a few weeks ago and i think
04:48
robin said you can't unsee this
04:51
and i interrupted accidentally right in
04:54
the middle of that but he did cover that
04:55
the other day
04:56
he said you can't unsee this so
04:59
um really good stuff so well let's run
05:03
uh the commercial for zappos so some of
05:06
you
05:06
who have not heard about our our
05:08
platform that
05:10

05:14
facebook it's very facebook like
05:16
but you can say what you want so let's
05:18

[Music]
05:36
so
05:45
[Music]
05:59

06:27
that you don't see anywhere else
06:29
so you're going to love it tell your
06:31
friends about it and
06:33
that's good to see if there's any other
06:34
questions um
06:37
i think that's it now um okay so without
06:40
further ado let's bring in Kat Kerr
06:43
good morning Kat hello kev
06:48
has an announcement about her brother
06:51
so rather than say anything else let me
06:53
just turn that over to you talk about
06:55
your brother
06:56
well first of all i want to let people
06:57
know i have seven brothers
07:00
whenever i say my brother they think i'm
07:02
talking about rj i am not talking about
07:04
rj the wild prophet God keeps in the
07:06
wilderness
07:08
okay i'm not talking about him today i i
07:11
have another brother
07:12
and uh he he was told
07:15
he would uh be leaving for heaven over a
07:19
year and a half ago
07:20
and he said to them no i don't want to
07:22
go and i mean he hung on he had some
07:25
issues
07:25
not the virus hello it was not anything
07:28
about the virus but anyway so he
07:31
finally made the decision he was going
07:32
to go and transition and just go to
07:34
heaven
07:35
and so he talked with his wife and cover
07:37
all that the point is this he's in
07:39
heaven right now
07:40
and i'm very excited for him and uh i'll
07:44
just call him mr t
07:45
that's not his name because i haven't
07:48
cleared this with his wife i won't
07:50
mention his actual name mr t will call
07:52
mr t
07:53
and um he actually would act like
07:55
growing up
07:56
this brother was so much fun with us and
07:58
um
07:59
i even know where he is living in heaven
08:01
so i'm going to share that
08:03
uh to all of you by the way why am i
08:06
dressed
08:06
like this no i'm not dressing like the
08:09
romans with this draping thing this is
08:11
heaven
08:12
what i'm wearing is heaven culture if
08:13
you were going to go to somebody's
08:15
welcome home party which is what they
08:18
call it
08:19
there are no funerals in heaven i've
08:21
said it so many times if you were going
08:23
to go to a friends or family members
08:25
welcome home party in the throne room
08:27
you would dress like this
08:28
you would have something that shined
08:30
like the stars in the heaven that was
08:32
beautiful
08:33
you'd have some kind of gems because
08:35
gems are everywhere in heaven they
08:36
represent the love of the father
08:38
this is actually a snowflake because my
08:41
brother's favorite time of the year was
08:43
christmas
08:44
and i'm quite sure christmas was
08:46
displayed all over in the throne room
08:48
because it was his favorite time of the
08:50
year
08:51
that's what heaven does they'll take
08:53
things that are your favorite
08:54
and actually have them present at your
08:56
throne room party that they give you
08:59
most people during your service on the
09:02
earth
09:03
whatever you want to call it someplace i
09:06
keep saying
09:07
with the idea for someone to want to
09:08
make a lot of money and bless people
09:11
you need to start us what did i call
09:14
that a party depot
09:16
party depot instead of a funeral okay
09:18
that's what you need to do
09:19
and you have every fun exciting thing
09:22
there
09:23
that your loved one loved and let me
09:26
tell you they're
09:26
watching from heaven my brother's
09:28
probably watching me right now i'm
09:30
talking about him
09:31
uh but he loved people i'll just tell
09:33
you a little bit about verse
09:35
he he took care of the homeless most of
09:37
his life he was probably the most like
09:39
my
09:40
father who would bring homeless people
09:42
in our own home
09:44
he'd take food off our stove my dad did
09:47
my brother worked with him a lot in
09:49
doing that so even though my brother
09:50
brother was a great businessman he had
09:52
his own business here
09:53
in the city which was uh tremendous uh
09:56
he even had government contracts with
09:58
stuff that he didn't know
09:59
it was postal stuff it wasn't like
10:01
covert you know
10:03
that thing that kind of thing it wasn't
10:05
like the cia
10:06
what did he actually go home Kat when
10:09
did he go
10:10
he left friday no i'm sorry he left
10:12
saturday
10:13
we all went to see him friday night we
10:16
went to see him several times we went to
10:17
see him friday night
10:18
and actually two months ago we all met
10:20
at his favorite restaurant which was the
10:22
piccadilly
10:23
so my family could all come and see him
10:26
uh we didn't know at that time when he
10:27
was gonna go or what happened but he
10:29
actually came
10:29
and we all ate is his favorite place we
10:32
talked a lot and did things which was
10:34
great
10:35
and um most people just as a tip to you
10:38
most of the time if someone's really
10:39
going to go
10:40
they'll have a resurgence of energy
10:44
and i guess uh more focus in their life
10:47
no matter what they've been going
10:48
through God actually kind of does that
10:51
so they have an opportunity to have
10:53
people come by and see them or they get
10:54
to see people
10:56
before they leave for heaven and i've
10:58
known that happened so many times
11:00
so he kind of had that thing happen for
11:02
him
11:03
and so he had a lot of peace on him in
11:06
the room we were in his home
11:08
and so but the angels i knew were so
11:09
excited but then again my brother
11:12
lived a wonderful life he loved people
11:15
all kinds of people my brother was never
11:18
um
11:19
racial or biased against anybody he fed
11:22
people
11:22
literally would make big pots of stew
11:24
and go in the alleys of our city
11:26
and feed the homeless and he did it for
11:28
years and years so
11:30
you know he delighted the heart of God
11:32
uh by pouring himself into others which
11:35
he did all the time
11:36
and so let me ask you the obvious
11:39
question why are you so
11:41
happy today why would i not be happy
11:45
he is living in the most the best place
11:49
ever when your loved one moves to heaven
11:52
their life
11:53
radically changes from the moment their
11:56
spirit bodies stepped
11:57
out of this physical body they are
11:59
surrounded with joy with excitement with
12:01
celebration
12:02
i know everybody talks about peace you
12:04
think about them like in the casket or
12:06
something they're not doing that in
12:07
heaven people that's their body on the
12:09
earth their spirit man is very much
12:11
alive
12:12
they're young they look like they're in
12:13
their 20s they're filled with
12:15
expectation
12:17
and uh you know they're taken to heaven
12:19
in many different ways depending on what
12:21
they would love
12:22
jesus came and picked my brother up
12:23
himself because
12:25
he loved people because he loved people
12:28
he was kind to people
12:30
he helped many others and said before he
12:32
fed people he would pay for hotel rooms
12:34
for them find them places to live
12:37
it's like he's walking in my dad's
12:38
footsteps and so he delighted the lord
12:40
with his life
12:41
and so he came and picked him up himself
12:43
in his own chariot
12:45
and i'm just going to add this because i
12:47
want to say it
12:48
there was a guest in that chariot with
12:50
jesus when he came from heaven
12:52
as i already mentioned my brother's
12:53
favorite time of the year
12:55
was christmas many times he was dressed
12:58
as saint nick forget the bashing about
13:00
satanic people
13:01
he was a real person who lived on the
13:03
earth he was in turkey
13:04
he actually made gift made or got gifts
13:06
and gave them to children
13:08
my brother did that every time of the
13:10
year at christmas time
13:12
somewhere he would dress as saying i
13:14
take gifts to children
13:15
and he always used to say this when i
13:18
get to heaven one day i'm going to work
13:19
with nick
13:21
i'm going to work with him make toys and
13:24
he said i can give him out in heaven
13:25
well guess who was on that
13:26
um chariot with jesus christ it was
13:30
saint nick
13:33
that's amazing i'm quite sure
13:36
my brother was so delighted he probably
13:39
could already stand it
13:40
did you say you saw angels
13:43
hanging around what did you say about it
13:48
his own angels he's got quite a few
13:50
angels they were
13:51
uh every now and then i make eye contact
13:53
with them they would grin
13:54
at me they were grinning i was the only
13:57
one that could see them there
13:58
but they were kind of pacing back and
14:00
forth just waiting
14:01
they knew his time was short and he had
14:04
a lot of peace he would still
14:05
call up people's names you know we would
14:07
hold his hand and we would talk to him
14:09
we actually called family members
14:11
especially me
14:13
called my daughters and i always let
14:14
them say goodbye you know put the phone
14:16
up there this is a clue even if they're
14:18
not responding that he was responding
14:20
to a certain level but even if they're
14:22
not and you know somebody would like to
14:24
say goodbye call that person put the
14:26
phone up to their ear
14:27
and let them say it because their spirit
14:29
man can hear you
14:31
hear them clearly so the angels were all
14:34
excited they
14:35
kept smiling and i went well he's going
14:36
to go really soon
14:38
and so we just all declared my um
14:41
my husband my mom and jen we were all
14:43
there in the room we're in them
14:44
we laid hands on them release the
14:46
anointing because i tell you what that
14:48
does you're either healed or you're
14:49
gonna go home to heaven
14:51
the other thing he loved a lot besides
14:53
christmas uh well people first jesus
14:55
first
14:56
and then people at christmas but he
14:58
loved america
14:59
he was standing just like those who are
15:02
still standing
15:03
for america to have freedom liberty and
15:05
justice that was him
15:07
so we took this beautiful throw that was
15:09
the american flag we all anointed it and
15:11
laid it on him
15:12
because i knew that would bless him it
15:14
would it would just bless him
15:16
so anyway the angels were all excited
15:18
but when you're gonna go
15:20
but from their present when that
15:22
actually happens
15:23
there's a point in the person's life
15:25
when i know within seconds that they'll
15:27
leave
15:27
more angels rush in they rush through
15:30
and yeah waiting for them to step out of
15:32
their spiritual body then all of them
15:34
including their
15:35
guardian angels will take them right out
15:38
and i actually see them leave many times
15:40
the person is undone
15:42
they're grinning from here to ear or
15:43
they're yelling hallelujah
15:45
and if there are people in the room
15:46
they'll actually turn around wave
15:47
goodbye even though nobody sees them
15:49
they'll wave goodbye to the people or
15:50
blow kisses to their family members
15:52
and then they're on the greatest journey
15:54
of their life all the way up to the
15:56
cosmos
15:57
uh they approach heaven for the first
15:59
time which is the most
16:01
brilliant thing it's a spiritual world
16:03
there's millions of angels coming in and
16:05
out of heaven all the time
16:07
there's beautiful things in the
16:08
atmosphere of heaven um
16:10
just like burst of the rainbow or burst
16:14
of the glory all over in the sky
16:16
and then you approach where there's a
16:18
landing port where you get out you
16:20
disembark there
16:21
there's a river of life right there
16:23
jesus is usually waiting to greet you
16:26
and sometimes people actually jump in
16:28
the river of life and they
16:29
like a child remember you're not 90 or
16:32
80 or 100 or 70 you're not sick there's
16:34
nothing wrong with your body
16:36
in any way whatsoever you you feel
16:38
youthful you look youthful and sometimes
16:40
jesus will start throwing water on you
16:42
i've seen this many many times
16:44
people have like a water fight in the
16:46
river of life but when you get out
16:47
you're not wet
16:48
this is heaven you get in you feel from
16:50
what you feel the water it's
16:52
beautiful it's gorgeous it's filled with
16:53
the life of God when you step out you're
16:55
dry
16:56
and then jesus will escort you through
16:58
the crowds and let me tell you if you
17:00
loved people there will be crowds of
17:02
people to greet you there
17:04
um your pets will be there to greet you
17:06
also
17:08
i remember uh just a short note i
17:10
remember seeing oral roberts hum
17:12
going literally uh got to go God
17:15
caught me up and took me to heaven i saw
17:17
him arriving in heaven
17:19
and uh there was his wife waiting for
17:21
him there
17:22
and she just jumped in his arms and she
17:24
said come on oral let's go make some
17:26
music
17:27
now i didn't know anything about their
17:29
their younger years in ministry
17:31
and she handed an acoustic guitar to
17:34
oral roberts
17:35
and they all went in the throne room
17:36
with jesus and oral started playing and
17:38
he
17:39
and they were all singing together and i
17:42
found out later
17:44
i think it was either billy brown or a
17:46
member of his family that told me
17:48
when uh when they first started out uh
17:50
oral and his wife
17:51
always saying they would sing and he had
17:53
an acoustic guitar he would play when
17:55
they did that so
17:56
that was just amazing so you have to
17:58
understand you're entering
18:00
from your death that you just had into
18:03
life
18:03
and life so abundantly and so yeah so
18:07
that that's what happens that's what
18:09
happens to everybody who's going to go
18:10
home to heaven
18:12
they are not suffering they're not sad
18:15
they love you
18:15
but they're going to the one who made
18:17
them the one who died for them
18:20
and they're so besotted with the love of
18:22
God in the life of God and then you have
18:24
this huge throne room party
18:26
and like i said there's many things
18:27
there that you love that you enjoyed
18:30
um like i'm sure it probably was
18:32
decorated like christmas because
18:34
again that was my brother's favorite
18:36
thing let me ask you a couple
18:38
let me ask you two questions together
18:41
your mom is still alive
18:42
how is she taking this and my other
18:45
question is what is that
18:46
thing on your shoulder what is that
18:50
you mean this one or this one
18:53
the first one the blue the blue thing
18:56
this is the uh this is the logo for the
18:59
army of heaven the host of heaven
19:01
it says the h there's a h and an i with
19:04
the open
19:05
portal behind it it's the time on the
19:07
earth that we live in now where we are
19:09
supposed to work
19:10
together with the army of heaven so this
19:12
represents the host initiative
19:14
us working and actually commanding the
19:17
army of heaven
19:18
as christ always intended and so that's
19:20
i where because it's connected to heaven
19:22
my mother is celebrating just like i am
19:26
we went to the funeral home the other
19:29
day uh we're having a memorial party for
19:31
him
19:32
and uh it's gonna be great so we
19:34
discussed all that i think he was undone
19:37
this man was so undone because my my
19:39
sister-in-law margaret was there
19:42
even brother's wife was there nobody
19:44
cried
19:45
we were not crying we were not mourning
19:47
because we
19:48
all know heaven is real there was
19:50
excitement uh
19:52
all around us the whole time we talked
19:54
about his favorite things and what he
19:55
would like to have there to do
19:57
we're going to make sure when he watches
19:58
from heaven he enjoys that
20:00
that celebration memorial food so good
20:04
that's so good this is going to help a
20:06
lot of people
20:08
uh because i remember i went to my the
20:10
first
20:11
viewing i ever went to was my
20:13
grandmother and
20:14
everybody was so sad now there was some
20:17
conversation so it wasn't
20:19
total sadness but uh we had believed at
20:22
that time
20:23
my theology our theology was everything
20:27
that was that person was
20:28
in the gray was about to be in the grave
20:30
that was it there was no
20:32
heaven right now and you know so there
20:35
was a lot of sadness
20:37
um and um you know i remember
20:40
i remember when my father went home 30
20:42
years ago
20:44
this year 30 years ago last month
20:48
my theology had of course changed and
20:51
his had
20:51
not his had not and so i have this
20:55
uh fantasy that on his way up
20:58
because he knew how i changed my belief
21:00
that you go to heaven
21:02
and i i just had this fantasy that on
21:04
his way up he was going
21:05
steve was right
21:09
you know what steve they actually say
21:11
that
21:13
they didn't say that and this is the
21:15
humor this is the humor of the father
21:17
they actually have a welcome center in
21:20
heaven
21:21
for those who are having culture shock
21:23
heaven culture shock
21:24
or they think some people think there's
21:26
no music uh
21:28
you're just a ball of light you can't do
21:30
anything you're you're spirits you're a
21:32
ball of light they don't see you as a
21:33
spiritual body
21:35
but i want to remind people what the
21:36
word says it says to be absent from the
21:38
body
21:39
that's dying is to be present with the
21:42
lord we all know he's not the grave
21:45
so if he's not the grave and he's
21:46
sitting at the right hand of the father
21:48
where does that take you
21:49
that clearly says when you leave this
21:51
body you're going to go to heaven to be
21:53
with him and also
21:55
in the bible jesus said i go to prepare
21:57
a place for you he's talking about
21:59
heaven
22:00
in my father's house that's the world
22:02
called heaven are many mansions there's
22:04
another clue
22:05
i go to prepare a place for you he's not
22:07
talking about at the end of time
22:09
he means when you die you leave there
22:12
you move to heaven you have an amazing
22:15
mansion that he
22:16
made for you you have a real life
22:19

22:28
times when people died and laughed
22:30

22:32

22:54

22:58

23:02
is it is in christmas town
23:05

23:07
inside
23:08
i have seen the outside of it and i know
23:11
because his love for that
23:13
and i know for sure he is working with
23:15
nick saint nick that's why he was there
23:17
he was there to greet him
23:19
and my brother would always say this
23:21
i'll just step outside my mansion
23:23
and if there's not enough snow i'll say
23:25
snow and it'll snow and he was right
23:29
he was going in his own heart
23:32
he knew this yeah he already knew this
23:34
he was all for everything i did and said
23:36
it was all for all of that so he knew
23:39
where he was going and he'd already told
23:41
God i would love to have this and do
23:43
this
23:44
and so he'll be living in christmas town
23:46
he'll be there where it snows all the
23:47
time
23:48
and um he'll be creating and inventing
23:51
toys that's what he
23:52
he wanted to do as a hobby on the earth
23:55
and now he'll get to do it in heaven
23:57
so good well uh looking at the clock
24:00
let's get to the next thing thank you so
24:02
much by the way you've helped
24:04
i've told thousands of people who just
24:07
watched this
24:08
untold thousands it's a celebration
24:12
it is let's talk about anything the lord
24:14
might have told you about the current
24:16
events right now what's going on in the
24:18
government
24:19
i will tell you i will tell you
24:22
well well the father's continuing to
24:23
talk to me all the time he's
24:25
never never changed what he said to me
24:28
about justice being served that is
24:30
absolutely going to happen i can't give
24:33
you a date
24:34
he gives me dates i say them i just know
24:37
this
24:37
he doesn't like any of the stuff going
24:40
on he does not
24:41
hate the people he does not like what
24:43
they're doing he despises evil
24:45
wickedness harm control crushing
24:48
stealing lying we all know what the word
24:50
says about that
24:52
but when your soul becomes so wicked you
24:54
sell your whole self to the devil
24:56
you're doing exactly what he wants and
24:58
we know the bible says the devil
25:00
wants to kill steal and destroy with it
25:02
sounds pretty much
25:03
what's going on right now but God is
25:05
actually yes he's recording all of it
25:07
and there'll come a point where he says
25:09
no more and he means no more he means no
25:12
more
25:13
and so i can say this that is definitely
25:15
getting closer
25:16
but the people the thing that really
25:18
gets me
25:19
is the americans the true americans
25:23
the moral majority who don't like evil
25:25
who don't want to get you know
25:27
get rid of the life they've been living
25:29
they love God in our country
25:31
they love helping families they love
25:34
their own family
25:35
they love their job they want to make a
25:37
living they don't want to get a handout
25:39
they're finally starting to rise up and
25:41
say we're not taking this
25:43
i mean they're not just making
25:44
statements they're showing up places and
25:46
saying it
25:47
and i think there's probably so many
25:48
lawsuits right now
25:51
not just against the bee person who is
25:54
illegitimately sitting in that spot
25:56
and i think they're starting to get
25:58
really concerned up there behind the
26:00
barbed wire
26:02
because so many people are not just
26:03
saying no they're resisting everything
26:05
they're saying that that is law now
26:07
if they say something if they make a law
26:10
that is literally against our
26:11
constitution we actually don't legally
26:14
have to abide by any of it but things
26:16
are not understanding
26:18
is there some situations where even
26:19
congress believe it or not
26:21
don't want what he is proposing and he
26:24
just thought he could write a law and
26:25
make the law
26:26
and they've been reminding him you can't
26:28
do that this has to be approved it has
26:29
to go through a process
26:31
and some of the process has to go
26:34
through the governor
26:35
so guess what people the governors who
26:38
like
26:38
life who want their their states to be
26:40
set free they're point blank
26:42
telling them up there in dc we're going
26:45
to open up
26:46
we don't care what you say the governors
26:48
actually have a say
26:50
quite a say over what happens in their
26:51
state so those who want freedom and
26:54
liberty are taking
26:55
it they're telling the people to ditch
26:57
the masks no more mask mandates
27:00
everyone's going back to work because
27:01
some actually haven't done that yet
27:03
we're going back to life like we had
27:05
before we're gonna have a real life
27:07
and they're not going to allow guess
27:10
what they're not defunding the police
27:12
now that that man sitting up there can
27:14
say oh he wants to that he wants to
27:16
defend them he can't do that
27:18
the decide in their states if they want
27:21
to or not
27:22
so the majority of the governors are for
27:24
life
27:25
they're for hope they're for freedom and
27:28
they want it and they're taking it
27:30
they're taking it he can't do things to
27:32
stop them from doing that because
27:34
they're appointed they're still in their
27:36
um
27:37
they're still in the midst of their time
27:39
to be governor
27:40
and so many people are increasing
27:44
their joy is starting to spread across
27:46
our country
27:47
because governors are making the right
27:49
decision
27:50
of what to do and you know if you don't
27:53
know these people the uk themselves said
27:55
we're not doing the virus thing anymore
27:58
we're not doing it we're done with it
28:00
okay we're going to treat it like the
28:01
flu
28:02
but people are going to go back to work
28:04
because they don't want to lose their
28:05
country
28:06
and i guess it's something they didn't
28:08
think about the person with the bee name
28:10
who is sitting behind the barbed wire
28:12
they thought they could control the
28:13
whole world and if you didn't know that
28:15
that's the goal not just to get america
28:17
they want to they can't control the
28:19
leaders of other countries
28:21
so when a whole country says we're not
28:23
doing this anymore what do you think
28:24
they're going to do
28:25
they can't send an army over there and
28:27
do something so this is what's happening
28:29
their plan is failing before their very
28:33
eyes
28:34
and so this is concerning them very much
28:36
because
28:37
they're no longer participating with the
28:39
pandemic that's what they're saying no
28:40
more pandemic
28:42
it's just like any other virus we're all
28:44
going to go back to work we're going to
28:45
have our life back and there's several
28:47
countries who literally said that
28:50
so those people who are even from china
28:52
and other places who thought they're
28:53
going to get our country
28:55
and then they're going to take the whole
28:56
world they have totally
28:58
missed it they have missed the fact that
29:01
you can't go to a country that's already
29:02
free
29:03
and all their people and you're not even
29:05
in that country say we're taking it
29:08
this is what's going to happen and
29:09
they're saying no we're not
29:11
so that's actually what is literally
29:13
happening right now
29:14
the people are starting to stand up
29:16
their self the governors are doing what
29:17
they're supposed to and even leaders
29:18
about the country are realizing hey
29:20
this is ending we're done with it
29:25
God doesn't give you a timings exact
29:27
timings but
29:29
trump coming back what kind of thing can
29:32
you say about trump coming back
29:35
i know he's still got plans that he's
29:37
working out right now he's
29:38
first of all going to make himself more
29:41
visible than he has before
29:43
which is totally irritating those who
29:46
are also
29:48
it's not just irritating them they're
29:50
deeply concerned
29:52
that that president trump is actually
29:54
appearing in places and speaking to
29:57
people
29:57
and this is the biggest thing he has
30:00
created his own website now
30:03
he can say what he wants to to whoever
30:05
signs up for is 45
30:06
office.com that is president trump's
30:09
brand new website he has freedom to
30:11
speak and say what he wants to
30:13
so they're really upset because what
30:16
they actually
30:17
plan to do hasn't happened they thought
30:20
by this time everybody
30:22
be kneeling and bowing down to the evil
30:24
and wickedness that they want to put
30:25
throughout the whole country
30:27
that they were going to um implement
30:29
every law every fake law that was made
30:31
they thought for sure we just roll over
30:33
and give up and say well we might as
30:34
well do this now there are actually
30:36
people saying that and i don't know
30:37
what's wrong with their mind
30:38
okay i have a clear mind and i want
30:41
liberty freedom and justice because
30:42
that's what america is
30:46
made by God for God
30:49
we we the people welcome God in our
30:52
country
30:53
so they can just about forget about what
30:55
their plan is because they're not going
30:57
to have a good life
30:58
okay so the people are finally doing
31:00
what trump
31:01
actually wanted them to do to begin to
31:03
stand up
31:04
and come against those things trying to
31:06
be crushed on them
31:08
if you remember one of his last comments
31:10
when he was saying well i'm going to go
31:11
but i will be back
31:12
and then they they the other the left
31:14
was saying well these are all our plans
31:16
and he looked at them and said good luck
31:17
on that
31:18
how about that he said
31:22
saying we're going to take over
31:23
everything and we're going to change
31:24
everything and stop everything
31:26
when he says we're good luck with that
31:28
he knew the american people were not
31:30
going to bow down to that stuff
31:32
so i can tell you he's very happy
31:34
there's so much going on right now
31:37
i'm i'm pretty sure you're gonna start
31:38
seeing some major things happen
31:40
uh especially because of him and he is
31:44
visiting the governors of course we
31:46
already know that some of them have said
31:47
we're just giving up the pandemic
31:49
ourself and going back to life that
31:52
delights him he loves it
31:54
and so i just want to encourage people
31:55
God says of course it's not over
31:58
it isn't over till God says it's over
32:01
and when it's over it'll never be the
32:03
same again
32:04
that's so good well let's jump into some
32:07
questions about heaven i
32:08
the first one i've got a whole stack of
32:11
them here
32:12
but the first one is has has your mom
32:15
ever been to heaven my mom has not been
32:19
to heaven but she has seen angels
32:20
she's seen angels right here i'm in my
32:22
studio
32:24
people that don't know it we live right
32:25
here uh
32:27
pretty soon we have been preparing and
32:29
packing our personal stuff to get a
32:31
personal place
32:32
because our this whole thing is taking
32:34
over this whole place here
32:36
we have very few spots we can call it
32:37
personal my mom
32:39
is we have angels who are residents here
32:42
residents not talking about our own
32:44
personal angels okay
32:46
i'm talking about angels who walk up and
32:48
down the hallways to guard and protect
32:50
us here
32:51
she has seen them quite a few times and
32:53
so she knows all this is real she's
32:56
heard things said to her from heaven
32:58
my mom has and real soon we're going to
33:00
have her on one of
33:02
our shows so she can give some tips and
33:04
some comments of her own
33:06
my mom has a lot of comments about the
33:09
laughs
33:10
i've i've met your mom many times uh
33:13
well the po one point to me is
33:17
she was in the same she's in the same
33:20
vein
33:20
that you are rejoicing yes
33:24
she's not seen heaven so the people need
33:27
to take note of that she's not seen
33:28
heaven herself
33:30
and she's rejoicing with you that her
33:32
that her own son has gone
33:34
home right yes and we also know she
33:37
absolutely knows
33:38
our dad my dad uh she knows my dad is
33:41
there for sure
33:42
my mom is a major major intercessor
33:46
she spends hours in prayer she has
33:49
a diaries that she keeps when my mom
33:51
writes everything down
33:53
so she's written everything down the
33:54
whole history of our family she's
33:56
actually going to write a book about all
33:57
of it herself
33:58
at 90. she turned 90 yesterday
34:02
she walks around she walks around all by
34:04
herself she walks around she has her own
34:06
mind it's sharp as steel let me tell you
34:08
what
34:09
she has the most amazing appetite we
34:10
took her out to eat yesterday for her
34:12
birthday
34:13
and she loves cards she loves uh
34:15
people's comments and so she actually
34:17
has already almost like her own little
34:19
following
34:20
she also is anointed literally to call
34:22
babies
34:24
from the father to the earth which means
34:26
she is anointed
34:29
she has her own following she has prayed
34:31
she has her own prayer lines when i go
34:33
somewhere she'll pray for people that
34:34
can't have children
34:36
and she makes him understand are you
34:38
going to be accountable for this child
34:39
okay you're not going to just go to my
34:40
mom and say pray for me you're going to
34:42
get a talk to by her
34:43
and uh she's raised 15 she should know
34:46
right
34:47
so she calls them and she literally
34:49
calls them in
34:50
yeah the father has anointed her to do
34:53
that so we
34:54
almost every person she's ever prayed
34:55
for any couple or person to pray for
34:58
they have a baby i mean they have on
34:59
she's she's going to start a gallery of
35:01
pictures
35:02
and she stays in contact with them until
35:05
they they have the baby
35:07
we call it the baby zone my i operate
35:09
from the revelation zone
35:10
my mom operates from the baby zone
35:13
that's good okay here's a question now
35:15
you remember ellen from norway
35:18
yes okay so she has this question she
35:21
says
35:21
i don't know if this is a thing in
35:23
america but only in norway
35:26
but in norway it's very clear that most
35:29
people have an understanding that God
35:30
the father is the greatest of the
35:32
trinity
35:33
jesus is the middle and the holy spirit
35:35
is the third we know that they are one
35:38
but only God the father knows the time
35:41
when jesus is coming back he is bigger
35:44
in appearance and sits on the throne
35:46
with jesus on his right hand
35:48
holy spirit everywhere so she sees them
35:50
as a hierarchy
35:52
talk about that is that true oh you mean
35:55
the father's more important than the
35:56
others great yeah is he the greatest of
35:59
the great
36:00
he would laugh he would laugh at you for
36:02
saying that
36:03
[Laughter]
36:07
this is what he was says to me we cannot
36:10
exist
36:11
without one another that would be his
36:13
answer to her
36:15
it's not like he's more important what
36:17
he does is different
36:18
than what jesus does their appearance is
36:20
kind of similar
36:22
because i know it says he's the express
36:23
image of the father
36:25
doesn't mean he's an identical twin that
36:28
means he operates
36:29
much like the father does himself but
36:31
the father
36:32
what makes him different is he's the one
36:35
that's why he's called the father
36:37
isn't because he's higher or bigger is
36:39
he's the only one who carries
36:41
us in him until we're born jesus doesn't
36:45
carry all of this
36:46
he's probably really glad he doesn't
36:48
have to do that uh
36:49
jesus holy why does only the father
36:53
know the day or the hour of jesus coming
36:56
what
36:57
he calls it sounds like he's more
36:58
important that way it's not it
37:01
because he is his father
37:07
it isn't because he's more important
37:08
like i just said they can't
37:10
exist without the the other okay they're
37:13
three
37:14
separate individual Gods
37:17
but they always operate together they
37:19
are
37:20
the trinity they are the three in one
37:23
get the one okay the three and one they
37:26
didn't say the three and three
37:28
there's three and one which means they
37:30
agree and talk about everything that's
37:32
going to be done they understand which
37:34
one's going to do which
37:35
part but God isn't operating all on his
37:38
own
37:39
he knows when he's coming back because
37:41
he's
37:42
the one who will send him
37:46
and the reason why he knows when he's
37:48
coming back number one he's going to
37:49
send him he is his father
37:51
he is his son he's going to make sure
37:55
that the people on this earth those who
37:57
are believers are living the life
37:59
they're supposed to
38:01
when christ comes the father said the
38:04
father
38:04
said it will not be a rescue party they
38:07
still don't have it right they still
38:08
understand it they're coming for a
38:10
glorious church that is the body of
38:12
christ with no sin
38:14
in their lives so hello people you can
38:17
get to a place where you don't sin
38:19
stop using that scripture all of sinning
38:21
comes short of the glory of God that
38:22
isn't even talking about
38:24
living a sinful life you don't
38:26
understand revelation
38:28
that scripture is talking about you the
38:30
sin is
38:31
you're not carrying the glory you're not
38:33
producing the glory of God because you
38:34
have too many other things in your life
38:37
it isn't about sinning sinning sinning
38:39
it's that you've fallen
38:40
short you've fallen short of creating
38:43
the glory of God from you with your life
38:46
which you will then carry and release in
38:48
waves that will be shock waves wherever
38:49
you go around the world
38:51
God wants to see that happen the father
38:54
chooses because it's his
38:56
son his son died for our sins
38:59
but the father asked him will you do
39:01
this and he had to say
39:02
yes i will do it the father gets his
39:05
choose when he comes back because he
39:06
knows
39:06
everybody what they're doing and at that
39:09
time when christ comes
39:10
no member of the body will be sinning no
39:13
spots
39:14
thoughts or sins no wrinkles that's your
39:17
flesh your rights your opinions and your
39:19
attitudes showing up
39:21
so guess what we got a long way to go
39:24
[Laughter]
39:26
yeah no spot or wrinkle
39:29
it does say that a spot is sin
39:33
perfection and you know even even let me
39:37
give that take another scripture
39:38
it talks about the spots because the
39:40
father shows me all these
39:42
he says when i said uh he said do not
39:45
even touch a garment
39:47
that is spotted by the flesh
39:51
in the word that means people who commit
39:54
sins
39:55
people are filled with their own self
39:57
and don't even care about others
39:58
don't even take something they own don't
40:00
take it don't wear it
40:02
because there's a residue of them on it
40:04
i understand all that being a seer
40:06
i'll look at things and some people's
40:07
garments have stuff on it you don't want
40:09
your own garments collect your words
40:12
what are you saying okay so this is why
40:14
the father chooses he's going to make
40:16
sure the body of christ
40:17
will or he wouldn't said it they will
40:20
get to a place
40:21
where they're they have no sin in their
40:23
life they're walking free of sin
40:25
they have laid down their flesh to do
40:27
what christ wants them to do
40:29
there's a generation coming that will do
40:32
that and it isn't right now
40:34
right i i
40:38
i can attest to that because
40:41
i threw a jacket away a coat a big coat
40:44
my father died in alaska he had this big
40:46
heavy coat
40:47
now my father had a huge anger problem
40:49
now he went to be with the lord
40:51
because he got his heart right he had a
40:53
huge anger problem
40:55
and i and i asked my mom if i could have
40:57
that coat not knowing about this concept
40:59
about even touching the clothes
41:02
every single time i wore that jack
41:05
that coat i got angry
41:08
for no reason i was angry and i finally
41:10
thought there's this is not a
41:12
coincidence
41:13
i went out to the trash at the end of
41:14
our dirt road and threw it in the trash
41:17
which is a weird thing to do but no one
41:18
ever told me
41:20
it works that way i just figured that
41:22
out by myself
41:23
because i i was turned getting angry for
41:26
no reason
41:27
people steve that happens to them so
41:30
many times
41:31
sometimes it's oppression they don't
41:33
even know why and they've taken
41:34
something from someone who lived
41:36
so depressed maybe they even committed
41:38
you know took their
41:39
took their life because they couldn't
41:40
handle that maybe they got to where they
41:42
couldn't handle living
41:43
you do not want to take stuff like that
41:45
from people
41:46
if it's a precious treasure this is what
41:48
you do i'm gonna show you what you do
41:49
okay here's my gavel
41:52
let's say this came from somebody who
41:54
maybe like steve said was
41:55
angry all the time somebody maybe gave
41:58
this away and it was given to me trust
42:00
me anything that comes to me i do this
42:01
to it
42:02
maybe if i had not you take it you go i
42:06
cleanse it for the kingdom can you see
42:07
that steve
42:08
right he plans us for the kingdom if you
42:11
take a garment from somebody that you
42:13
know wasn't living right because you
42:14
loved them
42:15
you put your hand you say i cleanse it
42:17
for the kingdom and i'll tell you what
42:18
happens
42:19
the fire of God will come out of your
42:21
hand and it will burn every bit of that
42:23
stuff
42:24
off i want to know i don't sit in one
42:26
chair in the restaurant without touching
42:28
that chair and say i cleanse it for the
42:29
kingdom
42:30
sometimes residue but people walk past
42:33
me
42:34
not saying a word and i hear what they
42:37
said coming off their garments
42:40
like your dad wore that coat all the
42:41
time angry it absorbs
42:44
literally into the garment we have to
42:46
understand the spirit realm around us
42:48
your words create something
42:51
and so you don't want to take things
42:52
from people that's why he said don't
42:54
touch a garment spotted by the flesh
42:57
that means they sinned in the flesh that
42:59
could have been all kinds of things that
43:00
they did wrong
43:01
and if you take that the residue you
43:04
can't wash it off in the washing machine
43:05
by the way
43:06
and you wear that you'll start having
43:08
the same thoughts or the same
43:10
expressions coming out of you and he
43:12
just confirmed that i've known that for
43:14
a long time
43:15
so be careful take if a thrift shop if
43:18
you like the thrift shop
43:19
whatever you get in the thrift shop
43:21
cleanse it for the kingdom before you
43:23
take it to your house
43:26
loved christmas and it was
43:29
one of the best holidays in our
43:33
house but he would get angry at
43:35
christmas i love
43:37
christmas so the only time of course in
43:39
the northwest i needed a coat that was
43:41
that heavy from
43:42
alaska was at christmas time so i wore
43:45
it
43:46
and every christmas i wore it for like
43:48
it took me about three years to figure
43:49
this out
43:50
i was unreasonable i was angry
43:54
i ruined people's fun and i thought this
43:56
is nuts
43:58
so i could have cleansed that is what
44:01
you're saying
44:02
yes you could have yeah
44:05
okay well it's really what you find what
44:07
you're cleansing it with so you
44:09
understand
44:10
the bible says when you receive in first
44:12
john 2 27 there's a scripture for people
44:14
complaining about him
44:15
first john 2 27 says when you receive
44:18
jesus christ as your savior
44:20
you receive a deposit of the anointing
44:23
okay that's his what he walked in he
44:25
gives you a measure
44:27
and it goes in you that anointing breaks
44:31
the yoke of darkness
44:32
so when i say i'm cleansing up for the
44:34
kingdom that's the anointing that i
44:36
carry
44:37
the anointing looks like blue fire
44:39
coming out of you when i do that it
44:41
comes out and burns it off
44:43
so if you're a believer you can do that
44:45
if you're not then you better go get
44:46
jesus because
44:48
but you need to remember that's what it
44:50
is the anointing you carry is
44:52
very powerful i'll lay it on a chair
44:55
if i go in people's homes i'll brush the
44:57
wall and release it in the whole place
44:59
but you make sure that if you've got
45:01
stuff right now in your home go lay your
45:02
hands on it and cleanse it
45:04
cleanse it for the kingdom which means
45:06
it's
45:07
okay for you then to to have it or take
45:09
it
45:10
but if if it's been something that's
45:12
been worn a long time or somebody you
45:14
don't know
45:14
you don't want to get something that
45:16
came from somebody who was really wicked
45:17
i wouldn't take anything i wouldn't even
45:19
take it to cleanse it
45:20
but but if you like this top especially
45:23
make sure that you're
45:24
you're laying your hands that this was
45:25
all part of my new mentoring thing i'll
45:27
be doing but you get it for free right
45:28
now
45:31
so you said clothes but you also
45:33
mentioned chairs
45:35
if if i inherit the possessions
45:38
of my family members of it
45:42
so it's not you'll worry it doesn't
45:45
matter if it's jewelry i don't care what
45:47
it is
45:47
it takes a second i cleanse it for the
45:49
kingdom this was given to me by
45:51
by somebody who was very precious um but
45:54
i can tell you this
45:56
if i don't really know their life it no
45:57
matter what comes to that male
45:59
sometimes if it's a letter i'll cleanse
46:01
it for the kingdom
46:03
wow i didn't know that i lived
46:06
this is a lifestyle this is a lifestyle
46:08
if you want to keep
46:09
hell out of your home and away from you
46:13
and i would tell you this if your child
46:15
is started back to school please
46:17
as you walk down the hallway lay on one
46:19
place on the on the on the wall
46:21
and you say i cleanse it for the kingdom
46:24
and any of the darknesses penetrate
46:26
anywhere in there will be taken out
46:29
let me ask you a question that's not on
46:31
my list because this makes me think of
46:33
that
46:33
i i had an issue and this is
46:36
years ago now at a business
46:40
and um there was conflict everywhere
46:44
especially in this one spot and i
46:47
thought
46:47
what what's going on these these two uh
46:50
female well it doesn't matter if they're
46:52
female these two workers
46:54
got in a fight and on this thing and so
46:57
i talked to my friend paul who i've
46:59
mentioned before on the phone
47:01
and i said i'm going to walk through
47:03
this building it was a huge building
47:04
that's not the building
47:06
i said i want you to tell me if you said
47:07
something and
47:09
and i went walking around first of all
47:11
not through any doors or anything that i
47:13
did
47:13
and and he said nothing nothing nothing
47:16
and i
47:16
rounded the corner i went to this one
47:19
spot by the cash register
47:21
and he said oh what's that and i said
47:23
this is a spot
47:24
where two two two employees got in the
47:27
fight and he said
47:28
well tell it to get out of there you
47:30
know you'd always say tell them to get
47:32
on there
47:32
and then so i said okay i did that and
47:35
then i walked around and i went to like
47:37
three doorways
47:38
in this huge building and every and i
47:42
went through the first doorway and i
47:43
didn't tell him where i was where i said
47:45
i'm just walking
47:46
and i went through a door and he said
47:48
stop and i said
47:49
he said where are you and i said i'm in
47:51
the doorway he said they like demons
47:53
like to hang out in doorways because
47:55
people pass to tell it to get out
47:57
that happened two more times in the same
47:59
building
48:00
to two more doorways and he didn't know
48:02
i was in a doorway and he kept
48:04
saying stop what where are you so
48:07
tell me about that do you see that too i
48:10
do see it
48:11
um there's so much you know there's so
48:14
much i have time to talk to people about
48:16
but i think because i think in the
48:19
father is
48:19
kind of switching me um we may have
48:23
a comment we make each time we meet to
48:25
talk about stuff like that
48:27
because people this walk on this earth
48:30
like everything's
48:31
great and everything's normal and
48:33
everything's okay
48:34
if they at least have an understanding
48:37
of how
48:38
the darkness operates i don't want to
48:40
overwhelm people with it but you have
48:41
authority over
48:42
all of it God jesus had to give you
48:44
power over all the power of the enemy
48:47
and one of those things he said to cast
48:49
out demons right
48:50
well sometimes those demons aren't in
48:52
people sometimes they take territories
48:54
sometimes they set up camp
48:56
if somebody uh lived in a certain place
48:58
and they were really wicked then they
49:00
probably have some spirits around that
49:02
place
49:03
if you this is another tip if you move
49:05
into a house that belonged to someone
49:07
else
49:08
make sure you take this is real
49:10
important so listen
49:12
get you some communion if you're going
49:13
to move into a place you didn't live in
49:15
and someone else did
49:17
get communion serve communion do you say
49:20
say just like you would the same thing
49:21
this is his blood he said for me this is
49:23
body broken for me
49:25
and i commit this property to the lord
49:28
pour the communion
49:29
drink some take a bite everything then
49:32
pour it on the ground
49:34
outside the property and take a part of
49:36
that what's left and just kind of put it
49:38
on in the ground
49:40
because that will cleanse your whole
49:41
property i haven't never i've moved 30
49:44
times
49:45
i never move without doing that and then
49:48
if i ever did
49:48
man stuff would start showing up and
49:51
because the enemy will take whatever he
49:53
can get away with so i
49:54
understand what you're saying um i
49:57
actually went to our church one time
49:59
they used to have to ask me would you go
50:01
we're looking for something
50:02
sometimes you want to tell me what we're
50:04
looking for something so go lay your
50:05
hand on the doors and see if you feel
50:06
anything
50:07
well i came up i touched every door in
50:10
the offices right
50:11
so i when i touch the pastor's door
50:14
this is what the father said i approve
50:17
of him and he said i have proven him
50:19
three times i approve of him i approve
50:21
of him i approve of him
50:22
i never even had to go in there for
50:24
anything that was pastor
50:26
senior pastor paul zink from new life
50:29
christian fellowship i think his son tom
50:32
now but but how about that yeah he's
50:35
just telling me
50:35
he's okay right and then they took me in
50:38
the sanctuary continuing to look for it
50:41
well i finally found it it was something
50:43
some witch doctor or witch had
50:46
done a sacrifice and poor stuff i was
50:48
stuck at like
50:50
16 rows up into our big sanctuary
50:54
and i could smell it i could smell it it
50:56
smelled like death
50:57
i kept walking and walking on my stomach
51:00
was getting sick
51:01
and finally i think it was my husband i
51:03
said put your hand underneath there
51:05
and he brought it out it was two pieces
51:07
of this gnarled looking wood
51:09
and God said that was i had a sacrifice
51:11
on it
51:12
so we took it outside and burned it and
51:14
then that thing was gone
51:15
i had two two events in this house well
51:18
i've had
51:19
more because i'll call paul because he's
51:21
the only one i know that operates
51:23
that i can call it uh and i smelled
51:26
sulfur yeah i smelled sulfur and i
51:29
and so i called paul and i said i'm not
51:31
telling you where i walk
51:33
and then i went to the i went to the
51:35
back door which is where i
51:37
smelled it yeah and and
51:40
suddenly he said stop where are you and
51:42
i said right here i smell sulfur here he
51:44
said tell it to leave
51:46
it's always told to leave so i the other
51:48
one is
51:49
this is i really want to know this i
51:51
have a master bathroom
51:53
and it's fine now but it was an add-on
51:56
by the same owners here that we bought
51:58
this house from
51:59
and every time i went into that bathroom
52:02
i would get a migraine a migraine would
52:04
begin
52:05
and sometimes it would continue so i i
52:08
called him on that and he said tell it
52:09
to leave your voices
52:11
you know and then so i did okay so time
52:14
passes
52:16
and it came back
52:19
i went back into the bathroom so months
52:21
goes by and all of a sudden they go in
52:23
the bathroom
52:24
and the migraine starts why does it come
52:27
back
52:27
what allowed it to come back it will try
52:30
to do it if you say
52:32
nothing uh satan doesn't do anything
52:36
saying does everything without
52:37
permission unless somebody sold out to
52:39
him like he's got permission to operate
52:41
in the
52:42
uh fake illegitimate administration
52:45
right now they gave him permission okay
52:48
but sometimes they'll come back if they
52:50
once had an area
52:52
they'll wait and come back to see if
52:53
they can take it back again
52:55
and if that ever happens to somebody you
52:58
should always evict
53:00
it and i actually say evicted i opened
53:02
my front door and he fixed
53:04
stuff like i don't know how it got in
53:06
sometimes people come in and out and
53:07
stuff like that
53:08
every night before i go to bed i'll open
53:10
the front door and say i evict you in
53:12
jesus name
53:14
that i missed and then i then i invite
53:17
having to invade my home
53:19
then i can go to bed okay so you have to
53:22
understand
53:23
the enemy will try again that's why some
53:25
people who are
53:26
free let's say they got free from
53:28
alcoholism they got free from drugs
53:30
the enemy will attempt to bring it back
53:33
and you have to say
53:34
no i am not receiving this i evict you
53:37
in jesus name
53:38
because if the enemy possess something
53:41
even if it was an area a place
53:43
and people cast it out they'll they will
53:46
routinely just come to see if they can
53:48
come back
53:49
and the more you say no you're not you
53:51
know i serve the living God i don't
53:52
serve you
53:53
get out in jesus name they have to go
53:57
so you know if you don't come back and
54:01
check they just say well they're not
54:02
bothering me i guess i'll stay now let
54:05
me ask you this i'm looking at the time
54:07
i got a few more
54:08
minutes there was one other lady
54:12
who i still know and i would call her
54:14
back if i if
54:15
when i need her but i i brought her out
54:17
this probably 10 12 years
54:19
years ago and i said i want you to come
54:22
cleanse my property because that was her
54:24
gift and she had this ability she would
54:27
say i can i
54:28
she would capture these demonic and i
54:30
don't know where she
54:31
said them but she would capture them so
54:34
she walks around my house and she would
54:36
do her little shaking and i said what
54:38
are you doing what are you seeing
54:40
she says there's a whole bunch of demons
54:42
they've been trapped here for a long
54:44
time i'm just
54:46
i'm just taking care of them and she
54:47
would do this on two or three different
54:49
places and i'd say well
54:50
how did they get here she says they've
54:52
been trapped here for you know
54:54
my sense was decades years whatever
54:57
and after she did that the very next day
55:00
i had the
55:01
i had this and this is at my house
55:04
i had the biggest financial success at
55:08
my
55:08
office that i had ever had after she
55:12
cleansed my house does that make sense
55:14
it makes perfect sense because the enemy
55:17
wherever he can be
55:18
and he's just left to do whatever
55:20
they'll do what they can get away with
55:22
and that is sometimes how that shows up
55:26
and what she said i understand what she
55:28
said it isn't necessarily
55:30
they were trapped in the house it could
55:32
have been that they
55:34
were uh on that property where your
55:36
house now sits
55:37
there's no telling what went on if there
55:39
was a force there could have been a
55:40
coven
55:41
for witches that practiced there you
55:43
know i'm not trying to scare people i'm
55:44
letting you know this is how things
55:45
happen
55:47
and they gathered there may be there all
55:49
the time and then they were just
55:51
left and whoever was over that group
55:54
died or left they would remain unless
55:57
someone evicted them out of there
55:59
that's probably exactly what happened
56:01
and the house was just built right there
56:03
but they're spirits it's not like you
56:05
can put a house on top of a spirit and
56:07
stop them from operating
56:08
well right and just to be clear this
56:10
particular situation
56:12
she had cleansed the house itself but
56:16
she was on the front yard
56:18
this was out in the front yard where she
56:20
is
56:21
yeah okay then that's why that's that's
56:24
probably what happened there it was
56:25
probably something that happened mainly
56:27
on the ground itself
56:28
and then the house was built there it
56:30
could affect the house
56:32
just because it was on the same property
56:35
and i that's why i said
56:36
that's why i said when you move
56:38
somewhere take communion pour on the
56:39
property
56:40
literally the ground pour it on the
56:42
ground i don't care if it's an apartment
56:44
go outside the apartment building
56:46
pour it on the ground make the
56:47
declaration i cleanse this entire
56:49
property
56:50
for the kingdom for the operation of
56:51
jesus christ and whatever is there
56:54
has to leave but because the devil will
56:57
do what he can get away with that's how
56:59
he operates remember he's
57:01
he acts like a lion remember looking for
57:04
those who we can walk
57:07
so he'll pose sometimes he'll post
57:10
demons to stay in a certain area
57:12
maybe he doesn't like something that's
57:13
going on maybe he doesn't like what
57:14
God's doing there
57:16
sometimes he'll call him and post him
57:17
there i go up and down my street i
57:20
i cast him off everybody's property
57:22
really
57:23
i run him out of my neighborhood okay
57:25
wow
57:26
they're not in my neighborhood we
57:29
we rule we choose to rule
57:32
or we sit and say nothing if jesus
57:35
christ gave
57:36
us power over them most people are doing
57:39
nothing and to be honest we that's why
57:42
so many people are going through things
57:44
there's going to be a lot of people when
57:45
we stop is going to run outside
57:48
and evict everything off their property
57:50
they communicate pour it on the property
57:53
as far back as i can remember even when
57:55
i was a little girl i remember
57:57
intercessors doing that at places well
58:00
now he had mentioned in a previous
58:02
episode pokemon
58:04
pokemon which was evil amanda grace
58:08
mentioned
58:09
um uh harry potter
58:15
and um jennifer evans mentioned
58:19
what we used to call acid rock it's
58:21
heavy metal rock
58:24
records and i would not play
58:28
anything that belonged to any of those
58:30
bands
58:31
a lot of them had um contracts
58:35
with satan seriously a lot of satanic
58:38
mans and they even call themselves that
58:40
the frequency they released has hell
58:44
in it and i grew up in the 60s okay
58:48
i was well aware of all that stuff and a
58:50
lot of young people were just pulled
58:51
into things
58:53
because that has um uh satan himself
58:56
remember he had the ability to influence
58:59
people
58:59
he had to when he did worship he would
59:02
he would impact people to come and
59:03
worship
59:04
God when he turned and became filled
59:06
with iniquity
59:07
he reversed it he will so pull people
59:10
into things
59:11
and one of the main things satan loves
59:13
because
59:14
he creates himself is music
59:18
he will take territories with music he
59:20
will control people with music
59:23
if you have any of those records from
59:24
any of those satanic bands
59:26
back from the 60s and 70s and even now
59:29
get
59:30
rid of them don't keep shirts with their
59:33
images on it don't keep the t-shirts
59:34
with the images on it
59:36
okay yes image is everything or God
59:38
would not have said let us make man in
59:39
our image
59:40
and after our likeness is how they
59:42
operate so you can understand
59:44
satan has his own images he also can
59:47
influence
59:48
and he uses things to influence people
59:51
and
59:51
unfortunately most of the time it's
59:53
young people but people who grew up in
59:54
the 60s and 70s
59:56
you probably got a lot of stuff to get
59:57
rid of in your home don't
59:59
don't keep posters anything to do with
60:01
drugs don't
60:03
keep it there were songs written about
60:05
drugs okay
60:06
um i'm trying to remember what the name
60:08
of that one song was
60:09
uh people said um my way to heaven that
60:12
one
60:13
no not that one it was another one about
60:15
a steam steamboat or whatever
60:17
rolling rolling that song oh that way
60:21
yeah that whole song is about
60:24
not being on a riverboat going down the
60:27
river
60:28
that is about rolling drugs and i never
60:31
took them
60:32
but i knew what all those meant so yeah
60:34
what you
60:35
the music you play can impact the whole
60:37
atmosphere of your home
60:39
it can impact you yourself and i know
60:42
people who are christians that loved
60:44
listening
60:45
to people's music that i knew were bad
60:47
and i warned them about it and they did
60:49
nothing about it so now they're like
60:51
playing in darkness you can't
60:54
partner this is what God said God says
60:56
don't tolerate darkness
60:58
don't participate with it
61:01
you may say it's only the sound i like
61:03
sounding you don't want that sound
61:06
back in the late 80s i began to hear
61:10
about this concept and
61:13
i don't remember how my eyes focused on
61:15
it but my
61:16
my uncle my great uncle my
61:20
my father's uncles had been missionary
61:22
in a foreign
61:24
country and as a gift as a gift
61:27
they gave everybody these ivory
61:30
statuettes
61:32
and there was two of them and they were
61:33
very beautiful and they're very ornate
61:36
and very detailed
61:37
and i started looking at that and i and
61:39
i started saying
61:41
these are like Gods these are little
61:43
Gods
61:44
these are images these are idols made
61:47
and i've got someone's Gods i took a
61:51
hammer out
61:52
and started and smashed that thing to
61:54
bits and then put it out in the trash
61:58
you know people collect things from the
62:01
mission fields
62:02
because they look good
62:08
even even today even today
62:12
and i'm not just pointing at africa
62:13
either it could be stuff in new orleans
62:15
could be stuff in
62:16
any other places okay number one
62:19
i will just say this about new orleans
62:21
never
62:22
participate with mardi gras if you have
62:24
loose all that from your soul
62:26
um it is it represents something with
62:28
hell you don't want to participate and
62:30
people
62:31
do these things don't ever have an ouija
62:33
board you're actually connecting with
62:34
hell
62:35
i'm not saying you should be afraid of
62:37
every single image out there or every
62:39
single song out there
62:40
i'm not saying all secular music is even
62:42
bad
62:44
i'm saying specific styles now they
62:47
actually have
62:48
christian what i would call rock bands
62:51
in heaven
62:52
that honor God that worship God and i
62:54
know some on the earth that did that too
62:56
but still it's it's who is in that band
63:01
what are they doing with their personal
63:02
life what does it look like what are
63:04
they talking about
63:05
if you have questions about that but the
63:07
things about the idols
63:09
don't ever have a buddha in your home
63:11
i'm sorry you're asking
63:13
and i christ spirit come on in my home
63:14
i'm welcoming you
63:16
you can't have that whole that is it the
63:18
God for many that's got all the
63:19
different arms don't have that in your
63:21
home
63:22
okay you can't bring idols when God
63:25
talked about so much against
63:27
idols it was those idols that
63:29
represented the false Gods but
63:31
satan takes the place
63:34
in that false God when people do things
63:36
for the false God they're actually doing
63:38
them for him
63:39
there's one God that's one God one
63:42
person who we worship the one true God
63:45
the father and holy spirit that's
63:46
it every other false religion
63:50
is tied to satan even the new age
63:53
movement
63:54
doesn't there's no new age God there's
63:56
none of that stuff taking place
63:58
people and that's why i used to teach i
64:01
actually have some old cds that even i
64:02
need to bring them back out and put them
64:04
out there for people to hear because
64:06
for six years God had me talk about
64:08
nothing but that
64:09
warning people get things out of their
64:11
home not wearing things be careful where
64:13
they go
64:14
and most of those actually were made i'm
64:16
trying to remember where i made them
64:18
i think most of those i made a lot like
64:20
up in tennessee mississippi
64:22
and other louisiana where a lot of that
64:25
stuff was going on
64:26
and yeah i have them i'm going to bring
64:28
them up they're coming out of them
64:30
that'd be good could you do this this
64:32
week could we do
64:33
could you do this as we close could you
64:35
lead us into prayer
64:37
to lose from our soul yeah
64:40
anything that comes to mind because yeah
64:42
you know we're going to talk about our
64:44
property and
64:45
clothes too but lose from her soul yeah
64:48
because
64:48
people i mean there are so many people i
64:50
could not believe
64:52
and the father himself calls it harry
64:55
potter witchcraft that's from the father
64:58
he does not like it he said it's invaded
65:01
society
65:02
christians will be some of the first
65:03
ones in line to see the new movies
65:05
you can't partner that's participating
65:08
if you never even read a book i'll tell
65:10
you i never read any of the books
65:11
because he wouldn't allow me to but
65:13
people would tell me things in them
65:14
i know one of the first books they wrote
65:16
on for harry potter
65:18
it literally talked about kids sitting
65:20
on the toilet and demons coming up and
65:22
stealing their soul and this is what
65:23
parents were letting their kids have a
65:25
part of
65:26
and they get so excited when a new book
65:28
comes out or a new movie comes out or
65:30
even the harry potter
65:31
world that is in universal which i speak
65:35
against anytime i go to orlando i'm
65:37
talking about that talking against that
65:38
thing
65:39
so what why is stephen why steve say
65:42
that
65:42
because in your soul or layers and you
65:44
collect stuff
65:46
and if you get too much darkness in
65:47
there i guess you're going to start
65:48
acting like it right
65:50
if you watch too much profanity which is
65:52
satan's
65:53
language that's house language okay
65:55
profanity is hell's language i've been
65:57
there
65:58
and so uh you need to get all this stuff
66:00
out and you can do it by
66:02
loosing jesus said cast all your cares
66:04
on me
66:05
i care for you but he also was the one
66:09
who said i give you the keys to the
66:10
kingdom
66:11
what you bind on earth will be bound in
66:13
heaven what you lose on earth will be
66:15
loose in heaven
66:16
and i know as an intercessor most of the
66:18
time all we did was bind the devil
66:20
but God gave me revelation for four
66:22
hours earth's time
66:23
on what those keys do they can set you
66:25
free
66:26
they can keep you free he said they need
66:28
to lose the hell that has gotten
66:30
into them loose all the hell out and
66:33
when you loose it out in jesus name he
66:35
comes and pulls it out
66:37
that's movies actions books words it
66:40
doesn't matter what it is he will
66:41
literally pull it out of you and it
66:43
won't be there for you to think about or
66:45
or if it's in there you want more that's
66:47
how addiction happens that's how crime
66:49
happens
66:50
so once you lose it then you bind the
66:53
things of
66:54
God you say i choose to bind to my soul
66:56
the life of God the love of God
66:59
the plans of God his celebration his
67:02
joy and then nobody can take it from you
67:05
that's how your soul prospers but if
67:07
you've got all that stuff we were just
67:08
talking about in your soul
67:10
even if it happened when you were little
67:12
it's still in there you need to get it
67:13
out so we're going to do that
67:15
so everybody can say these words uh
67:17
father
67:19
brother i choose as an act of my will
67:22
which is an act of my will to lose from
67:25
my soul
67:27
to lose from my soul all witchcraft
67:30
all witchcraft all satanism
67:34
o satanism all hate
67:37
or hate all satanic symbols
67:41
or music oh satanic symbols or music
67:45
i will not keep it in my soul i will not
67:47
keep it in my soul
67:50
show me which things in my home i need
67:52
to get rid of
67:53
show me which things in my home i need
67:55
to get rid of
67:56
i will not tolerate hell in my life i
67:59
will not tolerate hell in my life
68:03
if i operated in witchcraft if i
68:05
operated in witchcraft
68:07
someone in my family operated in
68:09
witchcraft whether my family
68:11
operated in witchcraft or i read harry
68:13
potter
68:14
or i read harry potter or had satanic
68:17
images like a ouija board
68:19
or he had say 10 satanic images like a
68:23
ouija board
68:24
i lose all of that from my soul at least
68:27
all of that from my soul i will not be
68:30
controlled
68:31
it will not be controlled by the
68:33
darkness
68:34
by the darkness in any way in any way
68:38
okay now we're going to wait just a
68:39
minute
68:42
most things going on people don't
68:44
understand like
68:46
severe headaches if you get pain in your
68:48
head that could be somebody
68:49
speaking against you or which is
68:51
speaking against you if you do things
68:53
for God i know a lot of leaders have
68:54
that
68:55
you literally when that happens because
68:57
it's not something i do myself
68:59
i have to say i sever all witchcraft
69:01
coming against me
69:03
and i mean you make that action i sever
69:05
it because they are trying to control
69:07
you in different ways
69:08
and because you're clueless and satan
69:10
will do it you can get away with you
69:12
do that it will be gone it goes
69:14
instantly
69:15
that's something else that you can do in
69:16
your life and if your children if you
69:19
know your children were invited to
69:20
places and they watch that lay your hand
69:22
on their head and say i choose as an
69:24
act of my will to lose from my child any
69:26
and all witchcraft that was watched or
69:29
spoken
69:30
or discussed and then it will it will be
69:32
taken from your children
69:34
and the reason why i'm saying this is in
69:36
these days
69:37
one of the lying lying signs and wonders
69:40
will be
69:41
that witches heal and they will
69:43
demonstrate it in parks i don't know
69:46
that would be this generation they'll
69:47
demonstrate it in parks
69:48
and in the next park is someone praying
69:50
in jesus name for people to be healed
69:52
they'll be healed
69:52
and people will go well wow this isn't
69:54
so bad all
69:56
satan has to do is take his hands off
69:58
those people
69:59
and then that appears that they're
70:00
healed he took his hands off
70:02
and that was for the one reason to make
70:04
people believe
70:06
if you look at the movies out there that
70:07
show you there are good witches it is a
70:09
lie from hell
70:11
even in the bible it says have nothing
70:13
to do
70:14
with witchcraft a necromancer look it up
70:17
in the dictionary
70:18
that means witchcraft so now we're going
70:20
to bind the things of God to our soul
70:23
so you say as an act to my will it's an
70:26
active i will
70:27
i choose i choose to bind to my soul
70:32
to bind to my soul the love of God
70:35
the love of God the joy of the lord
70:39
the joy of the lord i bind his words
70:43
i find his words and his images
70:46
in his images and his plans for my life
70:50
his
70:50
plans for my life i bind that to my soul
70:54
refine that to my soul i bind to my soul
70:57
abide in my soul
70:59
his celebration his celebration
71:02
his expectation his expectation
71:05

04:21
i'm doing great how are you doing good
04:24
so you had your
04:25
uh your home going party with your
04:27
brother regarding your brother
04:29
not yet we're still planning um you know
04:32
i was kind of put in charge of that by
04:34
my
04:34
family and by my brother's wife people
04:37
who don't know
04:38
for years i was head of hospitality at
04:41
new life christian fellowship that had 4
04:43
000 members so
04:44
i know how to do an event and my family
04:48
know that and they know i'm
04:49
i'm a detailed person everybody loves
04:50
the detail and prophecy but let them
04:52
tell you
04:52
living with with me as a detail person
04:55
so what what
04:56
someone would do two hours it takes me
04:58
10 because every single
05:00
every single design every item nothing's
05:03
going to be left
05:04
out so we're still planning it it's
05:06
actually this saturday and i'm going to
05:07
really relax
05:08
and enjoy myself like my brother is in
05:11
heaven okay
05:13
so nobody is going to be great when we
05:14
do have it
05:16
and for those that didn't hear this your
05:18
brother went home because it was time
05:20
for him to go he felt released to go
05:22
you all blessed him to to go and you are
05:25
not looking this as a
05:28
time degree at all is that right there
05:31
is no grief whatsoever because if you've
05:34
if you ever even had a peek
05:36
or a glimpse of what heaven is you would
05:38
actually celebrate
05:40
i encourage people to celebrate number
05:42
one when you have a service if a loved
05:44
one by the way i gotta add this
05:45
it's not rj okay God's not done with him
05:48
yet everybody's going to say is that rj
05:50
oh
05:50
no he's not ready to go at all
05:54
he's not ready my other brother was
05:56
ready to go and his mansion was done
05:59
it was completely done God had told me
06:01
the beginning of the week
06:02
and to let my brother know the one who
06:04
passed your mansion's not quite done yet
06:06
but it could be done at any time
06:07
and we did get to go visit him we were
06:09
with him literally hours a couple hours
06:11
after we visited him
06:12
and he went to heaven i knew he was
06:14
going to go because his angels were
06:16
pacing
06:17
in the room he wasn't in the hospital
06:19
everything they were pacing back and
06:21
forth and watching him
06:22
and so uh but you know what i'll say
06:24
goodbye i put an
06:26
anointed i tell you what don't ask me to
06:28
pray for your love and if they're
06:29
terminal
06:29
or if they're really ill because they're
06:31
either going to be whole or they're
06:32
going home to heaven
06:33
and most of them go home to heaven so
06:35
anyway he's out there enjoying his
06:36
welcome home party in heaven
06:38
and we're going to have a really great
06:41
celebration
06:42
here i do want to encourage you you
06:44
exist to live in heaven down here we
06:47
exist
06:48
to make a living but in heaven you
06:50
actually exist to live
06:52
so there's quite a difference that's
06:55
awesome well you know i've never looked
06:56
at
06:56
having the same since i first met you
06:59
about well it's probably about seven
07:01
years ago now
07:02
i remember talking to and there were two
07:04
people i asked julia our producer was
07:06
one of them she had gone to see you
07:08
Kat seven to ten years ago went down to
07:11
canada beach or something and
07:12
she had talked about how good it was but
07:14
then you know i i've seen this pink
07:16
haired lady i didn't know anything about
07:18
her but then i did another call with
07:20
theresa phillips i think and
07:22
on that call i said does anybody
07:26
here know about Kat Kerr you the real
07:28
deal and it was victoria boyson who
07:30
spoke up
07:31
absolutely the real deal right after
07:34
that we signed up for the cruise that
07:36
you were on and God said get every book
07:38
on heaven
07:39
well we went on our own cruise first and
07:41
we got every book on heaven
07:43
and i forget exactly chronological then
07:46
we did one on the next cruise with you
07:48
either the year later or something and
07:50
and uh your your staff lost you on the
07:52
boat because you were in our room for
07:54
about four
07:54
hours talking about it a long time but
07:58
you know what
07:59
you you were both very hungry to hear
08:03
about heaven and i can't resist sharing
08:06
those were great those are great a great
08:08
time when we got to
08:09
get together and you know if you
08:11
remember even though in the captain's
08:13
table where we sat and had dinner
08:15
on the ship it was we were talking
08:18
across the table almost like standing
08:20
up talking to each other we were so
08:22
passionate
08:23
excited about having what God had
08:25
prepared for us everybody just kind of
08:27
left us alone
08:28
they kept just talking the whole time so
08:30
yeah i was we were definitely hungry and
08:32
i think i still
08:33
am but i i mean i've got to probably if
08:36
i have 100
08:37
questions to be answered i'm probably at
08:39
60 i have a lot more
08:41
and when i see these questions for you
08:43
then i think well i should have asked
08:44
that one that's a good one right here
08:46
and then there's questions that i don't
08:48
feel like i need the answer to but
08:49
somebody does so
08:50
i'll let some of those in well before we
08:52
do that let's get into questions of
08:54
having two things let's first talk about
08:56
we've got to warn people again
08:58
that you are not writing to them and
09:00
inviting them to be friends and you are
09:01
not writing to them asking for money
09:03
talk about that because we're getting
09:05
requests from both of us saying why are
09:07
you asking for money
09:09
and you know i think people now have
09:11
adapted that as their
09:13
job i mean i think they do it as a
09:15
business on purpose
09:16
those people are out to scalp you for
09:19
your money
09:20
i don't have time number one jen knows
09:22
this i don't understand the technical
09:25
inner workings of the internet or even
09:28
how to
09:28
barely operate my cell phone let alone
09:31
go online and design things and ask
09:33
people things
09:34
i don't have time i love people but some
09:37
people take advantage of that
09:38
and when the more well you're known and
09:41
i heard this from almost every known
09:43
person in the ministry
09:44
it all happened to all of them the
09:46
better you're known the more they want
09:48
to use that and work
09:49
it they design a fake
09:52
uh facebook page like there's like i
09:54
don't know how many did a lot of them
09:55
out there some of them do it
09:57
just to let people know about the
09:58
revelation i have
10:00
some of them do it to make money and
10:02
what they'll do is a facebook allows you
10:04
to take pictures
10:05
as you know off of your facebook page
10:08
and show them
10:09
on theirs just to show them but some
10:11
people take mine
10:12
even exactly what i have on the on the
10:15
very
10:16
front of my facebook page they'll take
10:18
the same picture the background
10:20
they'll put enough information in there
10:21
that sounds like it's me
10:23
except for a couple things number one
10:25
they're not going to be able to answer
10:27
any questions themselves they're not
10:29
going to be
10:30
any of the events that we're showing so
10:32
they don't really can't talk too much
10:33
about the events because they don't
10:35
really know what's going on with it
10:37
the one thing that they will do if
10:39
they're a scalper
10:41
is that they will ask for money either
10:43
directly
10:44
like you know i need money for this
10:46
project i need money for this whatever
10:48
that would be
10:49
like me saying that or uh would you mind
10:52
giving to this
10:53
orphanage would you mind giving to these
10:55
people who have had these horrible
10:57
things happen to them
10:58
you can either send it to us and we'll
11:00
give it to them or they actually create
11:01
a site where when you give it goes
11:04
directly to those
11:05
people and what they'll do too is
11:07
they'll message people i don't even know
11:09
how to do that i think messaging
11:11
they don't mean like send you a letter
11:12
maybe they do anyway they'll contact
11:15
other people and say would you join my
11:16
whatever see i don't even know how to
11:18
say it to you
11:19
i don't invite people to be uh join my
11:22
facebook page
11:23
i never have done that if you get a
11:25
request from somebody inviting you to
11:28
join my page that is a clear sign it is
11:30
not
11:31
me you have to just watch and then you
11:34
can follow that's
11:35
it and i'm not ask you to give money to
11:38
other people i'm certainly not asking it
11:40
for myself
11:41
all the messages that i give are free
11:44
you see over 500 hours of me on youtube
11:48
talking about heaven and i don't charge
11:51
if these people are charging for that
11:53
that is not me so there's a cool there's
11:56
different clues you can follow
11:57
but the Kat Kerr that's what it is
12:01
might be
12:03
the Katker not patrick Katker
12:06
not the hyphen Kat Kerr
12:10
a people will make these fake pages
12:12
somehow to get my name in
12:13
and there's actually one right now
12:15
patrick Katker
12:17
is a fake one and he's saying he himself
12:20
is saying
12:21
i'm part of her media staff sorry
12:26
sitting over there in the chair doing my
12:27
media that patrick person is not on my
12:30
staff that is a fake
12:32
page that's a good example of what goes
12:34
on and we gotta
12:36
i got an email this morning or at least
12:38
i saw it this morning it was sent to me
12:40
the lady said she was upset because like
12:42
a week ago
12:43
that sheets had written to her she said
12:45
i found gob smacked or something like
12:47
that she
12:48
said how would he why would he say if
12:50
you wanted your
12:52
healing to manifest you should donate to
12:54
my ministry
12:55
or donate to uh this orphanage in
12:59
nigeria he said
13:00
so she said i felt God smacked i don't
13:02
know if she sent
13:03
money or not and then about a week later
13:06
she gets an identical email from
13:08
kat Kerr saying if you want your healing
13:11
please donate or donate to this
13:13
orphanage in nigeria using the same
13:15
words exactly the same words
13:17
but but this time it was Kat curve
13:19
advice so you guys
13:21
ought to watch for that most most um
13:24
well-known speakers if we're out and
13:26
about we will not
13:28
initiate contact with you ever
13:31
and asking you for money we just won't
13:34
do that not
13:35
i don't know any of us that do that yeah
13:37
so that's just a
13:38
uh it's it's not just Kat Kerr it's
13:40
happening all over the place
13:41
we've shut down a number of fake steve
13:43
schultz accounts you know
13:45
yes we're losing us you know but anyway
13:47
be patient
13:49
with the system i don't have to figure
13:51
out something one day
13:52
to minimize that but when when you have
13:55
a free
13:56
social media platform
14:00
world which we do yeah we want it to be
14:02
free for people
14:03
then you have to allow people to get on
14:06
and start typing things
14:07
and they have to commit something wrong
14:09
before you know they're doing something
14:11
wrong so
14:11
yeah i haven't figured out a way to cut
14:14
them off at the past we're finding
14:16
out more ways to to smell a rat you know
14:18
but uh
14:19
we actually have a couple friends who on
14:22
purpose
14:23
check um the internet especially
14:26
facebook
14:27
they'll check it all the time to look
14:28
for the fake ones we
14:30
have some people we know who actually
14:32
helped to
14:33
like i said in the beginning there are
14:35
some that are really great friends
14:37
and they'll post everything i say but
14:39
they're not asking people and they'll
14:40
say like
14:41
friends of Kat Kerr or whatever they'll
14:44
mention my name but they're not asking
14:45
for anything
14:47
so there's probably about 15 different
14:49
groups out there
14:51
Kat Kerr celebration something like
14:53
that but they're only to let people
14:55
their friends know about it so there's a
14:57
difference but
14:58
scammers if they ask for money
15:01
or asking you for your personal private
15:04
information
15:04
don't ever give it online don't ever get
15:07
us
15:08
online so those are red flags for you
15:11
and uh but you know what God designed
15:13
the internet this is what the father
15:14
said i designed it
15:16
i'm using it and there'll be a day when
15:19
such that the power of God will come to
15:21
that
15:21
that screen when you're watching and
15:24
there will be
15:24
automatic healings with nobody asking
15:27
you for money
15:28
and i'm telling you the power of God's
15:30
about to be released through the
15:31
internet
15:32
and every time i see like a computer
15:34
screen or even my phone screen
15:36
those are portals i've said this before
15:38
they're portals to the spirit realm
15:41
and things can pass through there that's
15:43
why you be sure you're watching the
15:45
right thing at home
15:46
on your own not television or your
15:48
computer don't watch darkness because
15:50
there's portals there too
15:52
but the power of God is about to hit
15:54
this world
15:55
through people's computers and through
15:57
that media form
15:59
and he's going to send the anointing the
16:01
presence of God the
16:03
miraculous even the angelic may show up
16:06
and you might actually see them this is
16:08
wild stuff i like to talk about the wild
16:10
stuff
16:12
you'll see them such angelic displays
16:15
from
16:15
heaven are coming because this is what
16:18
God wants for this time
16:20
and i was in the grocery store the other
16:22
day i always have an opportunity my hair
16:24
actually is like a beacon
16:25
i'm minding my own business trying to
16:27
shop and this worker
16:29
in the store comes up and goes you're a
16:30
christian aren't you and i said well yes
16:32
i am he said so what do you think about
16:34
this whole thing about the world coming
16:36
to an end it's going to get darker and
16:37
worse and went i don't agree with that
16:39
he said what do you mean i said well i
16:40
know from God it's going to get greater
16:42
and better
16:43
and he's only exposing the darkness so
16:45
it can be pushed back
16:46
he himself is going to do something to
16:48
change the platform
16:50
so we as believers can carry the glory
16:53
around the world
16:54
do the miraculous signs and wonders that
16:56
will be on display everywhere
16:58
and people will know there's a God and
17:00
he's standing there with his mouth open
17:02
like
17:03
expecting that answer but i'm going to
17:05
take that answer so people
17:06
everywhere need hope don't they steve
17:09
they do they do well
17:11
man we can talk about any of these
17:12
things for a long time let's jump to the
17:14
next thing where
17:15
let's talk about what the lord's showing
17:17
you about current events
17:18
and all things we've been talking about
17:20
i do want to say something and it's
17:22
really important number one it's about
17:25
trusting God you're not going to escape
17:27
that no one's going to escape
17:29
in a time where God is doing things not
17:31
expected
17:33
and you may not even understand what
17:34
they are why they're happening you have
17:36
to keep trusting God
17:38
he gave promises to us he said promises
17:41
in the word of God
17:42
he says certain things would happen he's
17:44
not wrapping it
17:46
up he's going to crush the darkness and
17:49
push it back however he chooses to do
17:51
that
17:52
you can listen to man all day long and
17:55
their theories
17:56
their assumptions or even their head
17:58
knowledge
17:59
you need to trust the word of the
18:01
prophet that's hearing God
18:02
and has not changed what God is saying
18:05
no matter how God does it
18:07
he's going to put things the way he
18:09
needs them to be
18:10
that we can prosper not just america but
18:13
over this world
18:15
things are shifting right now even in
18:17
the spirit you cannot see
18:19
God is setting up behind the darkness
18:22
who is totally
18:23
unaware they think they've won they're
18:25
going to get so smacked by God himself
18:28
and suddenly it won't take months and
18:31
years
18:32
and suddenly when God does something
18:35
everyone's going to know what's
18:36
happening you trust what
18:38
God is saying and don't look at your
18:40
circumstances you
18:42
keep saying i'm trusting God i believe
18:43
what he is saying
18:45
and guess what you'll be so happy you
18:47
stood
18:48
and weren't moved it's about time we
18:51
moved
18:51
things and stopped being moved by the
18:54
enemy
18:55
so so so good yeah you know i've been
18:57
last couple days i've been going over
18:58
it's been going over and over my mind
19:00
that scripture i think it's psalms i
19:02
should i don't have it memorized but it
19:03
says because he trusts me
19:05
i will protect him and there's one in uh
19:08
psalms 91. uh there's one similar to
19:11
that the one says because he loves me i
19:13
will
19:13
protect him and another one says because
19:16
he trusts me i'll do that
19:17
God's into and knows intimately who
19:21
trusts him
19:22
and who loves him and he acts on that he
19:24
says it
19:25
over and over when you because you love
19:27
me my my spiritual father
19:29
said would always wade taylor would
19:31
always quote proverbs
19:33
uh eight something he says uh i love
19:36
those who love me
19:38
and i and and and those that seek me
19:40
early will find me
19:42
and then he skips a couple of verses uh
19:44
three or four verses or whatever and it
19:46
says
19:46
and i will cause them to inherit
19:48
substance and depending on the version
19:50
that says the treasury's the wealth of
19:52
the
19:52
in the world and he would quote that
19:54
over and over and over and i think
19:56
wait okay i've heard it but you know
19:58
what i was looking it up again he's been
20:00
with the lord about 10 11 years
20:02
something give or take
20:03
maybe 10 years and uh and i'm still
20:06
pondering that scripture that that he
20:09
was 85
20:09
86 when he went home and his his words
20:12
are still speaking to me because he
20:14
loves me
20:15
you know so anyway well anything else
20:18
i'll go
20:19
share one more thing real quick i can
20:22
tell you these things that guys have
20:23
been saying
20:24
are going to happen
20:27
number one when the prophet themself
20:30
begins to experience
20:31
some of the things God is saying is
20:33
coming for the body
20:35
you know it's really close and i
20:38
personally
20:39
am experiencing some of the very things
20:41
God said would begin to happen
20:44
in these days of greater glory it's not
20:46
the end it's not the tribulation of the
20:48
paris time paris times
20:50
if people say what time is it you say
20:51
these are the days of the greater
20:54
remember the word greater
20:55
greater glory so they're not going to go
20:58
back to the way they are they'll be
20:59
greater than they ever
21:00
were before i myself in the way God is
21:03
talking to me
21:04
and the things he is showing me that are
21:06
just right on the edge right now
21:09
are going to be so fantastic these days
21:12
you're going through will become
21:14
like dust your future
21:17
is not this time this is not the new
21:20
norm i don't like it when they say that
21:22
your normal will be super natural that's
21:26
what God is saying
21:27
so good and you know i can confirm that
21:29
what you're saying
21:30
my dream came home the other day she was
21:32
babysits on tuesday our
21:34
granddaughter um and our our third
21:37
and probably last grandchild depending
21:39
on how it looked but
21:40
she came home and i said man it's like
21:42
during this everything that i'm turning
21:44
to
21:44
it's like the lord's adding grace or a
21:47
little just a little bit more prosperity
21:50
when an issue comes up and the pharmacy
21:53
called and there was a question on that
21:54
they ended up
21:55
giving a whole bunch more and for
22:00
ridiculous price and ridiculous grace
22:02
you know so there was a need and
22:04
it's too long a story to go in but i
22:06
said it's like everything i'm
22:07
turning to is all of a sudden grace
22:10
added to it are you experiencing that
22:11
too
22:12
the grace and definitely the prosperity
22:15
um from unexpected sources and that was
22:18
God said
22:19
i'm going to start sending wealth from
22:21
unexpected sources
22:23
and it will be it will be like an
22:25
overnight thing like one day you're
22:27
waiting to be able to do this the next
22:29
day
22:30
triple more than what you needed comes
22:32
in
22:33
that you can do even more than you had
22:35
desired to do
22:36
those kind of things literally are
22:38
happening right now
22:40
and the doors that are opening from
22:43
unexpected sources like people you would
22:45
never even
22:45
think care about God or care about
22:48
heaven
22:49
those things are beginning to happen
22:50
they will begin to go begin to go out
22:52
and
22:53
waves in the body of christ you should
22:55
be all saying i'm taking that
22:57
i'm receiving that right now when you
22:59
hear a prophet say something like that
23:01
if you want it you should actually say i
23:03
receive that for myself
23:05
that's good that's really really good
23:07
and this is like i said
23:09
a little bit earlier God responds to
23:11
what what's in your heart
23:13
he will reward you without you
23:16
necessarily doing anything because he
23:18
sees what's in your heart
23:19
if trust is in your heart if you believe
23:21
what Kat's saying
23:23
you just earned a reward right there
23:24
without even doing one thing you're just
23:26
going in your heart you're like i
23:27
believe that i really
23:29
boom reward yes you know so watch out
23:33
well listen okay anything else before we
23:35
go into questions about him
23:36
have we covered everything he wanted to
23:38
i think that's probably all i'm going to
23:40
say today
23:41
except this and i still can't tell all
23:44
of this
23:44
this is something literally i am
23:46
personally going to be a part of and
23:48
involved in
23:49
and i've been talking about mentoring
23:51
for some time people keep asking me
23:52
they'll actually send me letters can you
23:54
mentor me
23:55
i can't individually mentor people all
23:58
over the world
23:59
not one-on-one that can't happen but
24:02
online and there's new ways being
24:04
devised to do that
24:05
and not only that in the in the coming
24:08
future
24:09
there will be tours i actually will be
24:11
doing tours
24:13
training people in the spirit realm
24:16
uh in such a powerful way you will never
24:19
be the same person again
24:21
and if you won't be able to come in
24:22
person like i said it'll be a tour like
24:24
a whole area i might do
24:26
uh five meetings in two weeks or
24:28
something in in a greater places greater
24:30
arenas
24:32
so that you will be prepared to rule
24:34
it's about ruling and reigning with
24:36
christ
24:36
it's not about being beat up by the
24:38
devil anymore it's about jerking the
24:40
doormat from underneath his feet okay
24:42
and like christ said pretty soon i'm
24:45
going to bruise
24:46
the enemy you know those things are
24:48
about to happen
24:49
but you will have things to use you
24:51
never thought you could have before or
24:53
do before
24:54
that is right on the edge of happening
24:57
and i am involved in that okay
25:01
announce it we want to be completely
25:03
ready and done
25:04
and have places already set up that we
25:06
will come in great arenas to train
25:09
people
25:10
i'll just tell you what it is about it's
25:12
revelation on the army of God
25:14
you don't know who you are because let
25:17
me tell you once you learn
25:18
and you have the right weapons to use
25:20
your life will be dangerous against hell
25:23
so yes that is really close coming
25:25
you're not going to be the same person
25:26
you'll help you step
25:28
in to this new time that God is bringing
25:30
he's not waiting
25:32
for that new time to shift you would
25:34
begin to shift things yourself
25:36
so cool and and uh before this first
25:39
question you use the word tour we are
25:41
about to announce the kat kur
25:43
elijah streams elijah list tour we
25:45
mentioned it before we were very close i
25:47
gave final approval yesterday but we
25:50
still have to get airline prices and
25:52
a link set up before we can say but it
25:54
basically starts about a year from to
25:57
now a year from this week or year from
25:59
next week uh so
26:00
it's 2022 i think it bridges april and
26:03
may
26:03
it's a really good time before it's too
26:05
cold or too hot it's a really good time
26:07
and kat Kerr will be speaking on
26:09
important places including the
26:11
the garden tomb and masada and some of
26:14
those other
26:14
and you know mount carmel where we've
26:17
done those things before
26:18
we had a good time last time we went was
26:20
that your first time i can't remember
26:21
if that was your first time to israel
26:23
when we did that it was the first time
26:25
i'd been there for
26:26
quite a while when the alec brought me
26:28
over at one point maybe i don't know
26:30
eight years ago
26:31
teaching people how to lose things from
26:34
their soul because of all the stuff she
26:36
was going through
26:37
it was her way to i guess you could say
26:39
get back at the enemy
26:41
to train millions of people how not to
26:43
live in grief
26:44
or or doubt or hurt or suffering and
26:47
those were
26:48
very powerful meanings but it was only
26:49
there for a couple days and came back so
26:51
what elijah was did
26:53
wow opened up almost every major place
26:57
something significant and when i was
27:00
there
27:02
i saw everything that was left as a mark
27:06
by God
27:07
like i saw stairways i saw angels posted
27:10
places i saw the glory of God on places
27:12
in the ground
27:13
i heard what actually happened on mount
27:15
carmel what God had to say about it i
27:16
gave it to the people
27:18
it's going to be that type of a tour in
27:20
israel so you'll hear all the revelation
27:22
that happened in all these significant
27:24
places that if i touch it if i walk
27:26
there
27:27
i will see it and then i share it that
27:29
is so cool yeah you would point out
27:30
indeed sir where the angels were hanging
27:32
out
27:32
over there there's you know and i didn't
27:34
see it because i
27:36
you know i don't want to decree that i'm
27:38
not a seer
27:39
but i've seen a few things but you know
27:41
you weekend on the garden tomb and you
27:43
said something about you'd never
27:45
felt this kind of anointing so that's
27:46
how you knew it was the right place
27:48
and we i walked out and julie they were
27:50
our producer was there with us last time
27:52
she didn't know what you had said
27:54
because she didn't go in at the same
27:55
time she said i've never felt this
27:56
anointing anywhere
27:58
at any time she said it about 60 seconds
28:01
after you said it not knowing you had
28:02
said it so
28:03
you know you take that kind of thing to
28:05
the bank and so well the garden team was
28:07
a very special place especially when you
28:09
realize
28:10
this was really it this is really the
28:12
location
28:13
it's not yeah that i saw posted there
28:16
were the same two angels literally
28:19
that rolled the stone away that were
28:20
there when mary talked to them at the
28:22
tomb
28:23
and the disciples the same two angels
28:26
they're actually still posted there God
28:28
does that a lot around the world
28:30
like when i was in rome before i asked
28:32
the person who robbed me what are those
28:34
lights shooting up from the ground like
28:36
several miles from there what is that
28:37
place
28:38
and they said it was where the prison
28:39
was that paul was held
28:41
really whoa well it's nice to have a
28:45
seer or see yours along
28:47
you know every time we get together
28:48
there are there are more seers on every
28:50
trip i
28:51
you know each time it gets more
28:52
supernatural because God's releasing
28:54
them so
28:55
i'm looking at the clock i guess we
28:57
better jump here let me just start with
28:59
some questions now
29:00
we're going to do a back and forth well
29:03
people are wanting some clarification on
29:05
cleaning their house and their property
29:06
because we talked about that we won't do
29:08
that every single week because it'll
29:09
become
29:10
too much that but we'll get a couple
29:12
clarifications but there's a couple kids
29:14
that wanted some
29:15
questions answered and the first one's
29:17
kind of hilarious but i think i know
29:18
where it's coming from
29:20
this is a son isaiah age nine and
29:23
daughter rachel age 10
29:24
one of them is asking they must be
29:27
thinking of father son and holy spirit
29:29
because they're saying
29:30
how many heads does God have i have
29:32
three questions from them
29:33
how many heads does God have as your
29:34
first one yeah because
29:37
some people in foreign countries
29:39
especially they think
29:40
our God has three heads because
29:44
the bible talks about the three in one
29:47
and people can't decide well does he
29:48
only have one head does he have three
29:51
the trinity are three individual
29:55
beings who are God father God
29:58
he's a spiritual God he's powerful that
30:01
is his name he is the father it talks
30:02
about him all through the word of God
30:04
uh that is the father of jesus christ
30:07
you know who
30:07
jesus came jesus is the second member of
30:10
the trinity
30:11
he is the son of the living God the one
30:13
who died for our sins
30:15
on the cross and then there's holy
30:17
spirit the spirit of
30:19
the living God is an actual being he's
30:22
not just a facet of God's personality
30:24
the father
30:25
yeah she is a real being he is God
30:28
also and that he appears as like
30:31
whirlwinds uh
30:32
ribbons of color the fire he carries the
30:35
fire where he goes
30:36
uh i was like here i'll just tell you in
30:38
the upper room in in israel
30:41
i saw the portal holy spirit came to
30:43
when he put the tongues of fire on those
30:45
waiting and
30:47
they were asking for you know to be
30:50
consumed by the spirit of God so holy
30:52
spirit is the third member of the
30:53
trinity
30:54
and he stands to the left side of the
30:56
throne there's even
30:57
like a well of oil called the oil of the
31:00
holy spirit that he takes and pours on
31:02
people
31:03
sometimes it comes out of bibles those
31:05
things really do happen
31:06
right so there's three individual Gods
31:09
they're all
31:10
God but the reason is the three in one
31:13
is because they have the ability to step
31:16
inside of each other
31:18
and the way the father explained to me
31:20
was he caught me up to heaven
31:21
i saw the father sitting on his throne
31:23
there's christ sitting at his right side
31:25
there's holy spirit on the left
31:27
and he said now we will be the three in
31:29
one jesus stands up and steps totally
31:32
inside of his father
31:33
you can't see him anymore he's in the
31:35
father holy spirit comes and steps
31:38
inside the father
31:39
and the father goes now we're the three
31:41
in one it is that
31:43
simple that's a literal thing that's not
31:47
a symbolic picture
31:50
that literally happens and even in the
31:52
bible when jesus would say to the father
31:55
me in you and you and me i desire that
31:59
they that talks
32:00
about the body of christ be one as we
32:01
are one because when you go to heaven
32:04
you can step inside the father jesus
32:07
steps inside the father and holy spirit
32:09
steps inside the father and then you're
32:10
all there together it's an
32:14
amazing thing and you have more
32:16
understanding of the spirit realm you
32:17
have a spiritual body
32:19
and so they as God they are the God head
32:23
they each have a head they're three
32:24
individual Gods
32:26
and they step inside become the three
32:28
and one the trinity the holy trinity
32:30
and so that's the best explanation
32:32
that's exactly the one the father gave
32:33
me
32:34
i understood clearly and then and then
32:37
of course then the holy spirit steps out
32:39
christ stepped out when i'm standing
32:40
before the throne of God he said now we
32:42
are father son and holy spirit
32:44
it is so simple a five-year-old can
32:46
understand that that's really good very
32:48
very good
32:49
okay now this might come from this is
32:51
there's three questions here this might
32:52
come from someone
32:54
wrestling around with a parent maybe
32:55
because he's saying is God
32:57
ticklish uh i
33:01
i hear God laugh a lot and i think it's
33:03
the things we say
33:05
uh even when we lived in him i remember
33:08
hearing him laugh a lot
33:10
and uh when i'm with him in heaven
33:12
sometimes he laughs
33:14
i say things i say silly things that
33:16
make him laugh when i'm on the earth
33:18
and i have to say he has a funny bone
33:20
somewhere that he
33:21
had to carry all of us like children he
33:24
better have a sense of humor
33:26
and i would have to say yeah he'll
33:27
probably tickle you when you get to
33:29
heaven
33:30
especially children i know jesus does
33:32
that also jesus
33:34
really wow okay and then the last of the
33:38
three is what language does God speak
33:40
and of course neither if you're from
33:42
india if you're from pakistan
33:44
if you're from america so what language
33:46
does God speak
33:48
i i when you're in heaven you understand
33:51
every language
33:52
that's spoken it says in the bible that
33:55
in
33:56
heaven every tongue that's their dialect
33:59
every tongue every tribe that means all
34:01
the different ethnic groups
34:03
and every nation will be represented in
34:06
heaven
34:06
that some from everywhere from all those
34:09
places will be in heaven
34:10
so God made it wonderful that no matter
34:12
what
34:13
language anyone is speaking you know
34:15
what they're saying
34:16
and you could say something to them in
34:18
english and they would understand it
34:20
completely that barrier
34:21
is removed that no matter what you say
34:24
when i hear the father speak
34:26
i've heard him speak in hebrew sometimes
34:28
but understood
34:29
in heaven on the earth i wouldn't
34:31
understand it but most of the time
34:33
i hear him speak to me in english since
34:35
that's the language i use
34:37
but in saying all of that there
34:40
is a language the language of angels
34:43
which the father gave them
34:45
and they communicate with each other i
34:47
don't know what they're saying
34:49
and yet they do that in heaven also they
34:51
have their own language they can
34:52
understand the language as we speak
34:54
but it even talks about the tongues of
34:57
angels in the bible
34:59
and you remember the bible said every
35:00
tribe tongue and nation would be
35:02
represented so even the angels
35:04
are going to be present at this huge
35:06
event in heaven
35:07
and even their own language when they
35:09
use it at one point
35:10
we will understand that right right now
35:13
when i'm in heaven if the angels speak
35:14
in their own language i don't unless the
35:16
holy spirit tells me what they said
35:18
wow now you said to me or to the to
35:21
people
35:22
many times i don't know if this is every
35:24
time but you said you're
35:26
you are when you're caught up with a
35:28
father you're kind of as a
35:30
as a little girl is that what you're
35:31
saying and if so is it always that way
35:33
and how old are you and do you have pink
35:35
hair
35:37
i am eight years old
35:40
wow i met years old and i have these
35:43
little blonde pig tails there's one
35:44
little piece of pink
35:46
in my hair really i think
35:49
like a child that's why i come back and
35:51
give a good report
35:53
you know there's nothing bad to say
35:54
about having but i noticed the fun
35:56
things
35:57
the glorious things the wonder and the
36:00
splendor
36:01
you know when you're little it's easy to
36:03
get people to experience
36:04
wonder you take them someplace they've
36:06
always dreamed of going they're undone
36:08
they're in awe of being there
36:10
well that's what it's like to be in the
36:12
throne room or to be with the father to
36:14
be with his son to be the holy spirit
36:16
i am in all of them but with the heart
36:18
of a child
36:19
i can embrace him openly with no fear of
36:22
rejection with no fear of being
36:24
misunderstood i'm always
36:26
welcomed with that heart of a child you
36:29
know the bible says you must be
36:30
like a little child to enter into the
36:33
kingdom of heaven
36:36
and i don't care if your grandma was 100
36:38
when she went there she'll feel like
36:39
she's a little kid when she gets there
36:41
normally people who are let's say over
36:44
20 in their 30s 40s 50s up to 100
36:46
your spiritual body looks like it's in
36:48
its 20s so you already feel
36:51
you're full of life and energy and
36:53
excitement but when he takes me
36:55
most of the time i'm like that
36:57
eight-year-old child and i'm looking up
36:59
at my father
37:00
i can't wait to see what he's going to
37:02
say i'm almost like vibrating with
37:04
excitement
37:05
and then he'll just whisk me and take me
37:07
somewhere in heaven and show me
37:09
uh places in heaven i never i even never
37:11
dreamed he's still showing me places
37:13
many times i think a couple times when i
37:16
was caught by jesus
37:17
i looked like i was in my 20s and even
37:20
in the 80s
37:21
i was in the mountains i think of north
37:24
carolina
37:25
and the lord called me aside we pulled
37:27
over to rest i guess
37:28
or stop for a break the lord said come
37:30
outside i want to show you something
37:32
all my life i have pursued christ i
37:34
wasn't perfect but
37:36
literally began to passionately pursue
37:38
to know him
37:40
for him as my savior as my king
37:43
as my beloved and so i always had this
37:45
intimate relationship and christ was
37:47
waiting for me on this path and he said
37:50
because you're willing to sacrifice
37:52
yourself and give your life away
37:54
to help the world know me i'm going to
37:56
show you your
37:57
your glorified body and he actually
37:59
moved his hand and i saw myself
38:01
but i will look like an eternity it's
38:04
amazing oh
38:05
i don't think i've ever shared this much
38:06
with anybody i saw myself i remember the
38:09
clothing i
38:10
had on it was like the silver with
38:13
lights moving in
38:14
like it was alive and my hair was really
38:16
long
38:17
it had shades of pink and white and it
38:20
was
38:20
beautiful really long right wow yeah
38:23
and this was in the 80s before i started
38:26
doing the heaven thing i always had
38:28
encounters with christ
38:30
and he said because you're willing to
38:32
give your life away i'm going to let you
38:34
see
38:34
what you'll look like in your glorified
38:37
body for eternity so i can tell
38:39
everybody
38:40
you always win when you choose christ
38:44
your eternity is set in the most
38:46
magnificent um
38:48
amazing places he's got planned for us
38:51
okay
38:51
on the earth you have to live with all
38:54
everything going on and there's society
38:56
and there's
38:57
bad people and not nice people and
38:59
people who are unkind or harsh
39:02
your life that ends when you
39:05
leave this planet you step into a whole
39:07
new life
39:08
of joy and celebration that you can
39:11
imagine
39:12
but the thing about being alive today
39:14
i'm gonna step back for just a minute
39:16
uh the thing about being alive today is
39:18
this is starting a whole new time
39:22
not the darkness i can't say that enough
39:24
i mean people think it's all bad and
39:26
wicked and evil
39:27
because you're actually seeing it in
39:29
action but it is not
39:31
staying that way we have several hundred
39:33
years left
39:34
you know i'll just say it okay in the
39:37
end it's not going to get the band-aid
39:39
off let's just say
39:41
powerful powerful things that the bible
39:44
talked about
39:45
the greater works people stopping
39:48
earthquakes and making them put it back
39:49
the way it was
39:50
wow and you take the lid off the jar and
39:52
raise the dead that was cremated these
39:54
are coming you should be excited that
39:57
you're part of
39:58
christ we're supposed to be christ-like
40:01
he has no
40:02
fear no regrets no anger
40:05
there's no hate no rejection you know
40:06
what i'm wearing the scarf because he
40:08
said
40:08
i am love it's not about himself christ
40:11
he is
40:11
love he loves us enough to share what is
40:14
coming
40:15
he loves you enough to keep you in his
40:17
own hands through this is what
40:19
what happening it will not remain and he
40:22
says it to me
40:23
it will not remain this way it will not
40:25
be the new normal
40:26
what will be the new normal is is satan
40:29
getting
40:29
bashed continually by the body of christ
40:33
wow wow wow well let me uh let me blend
40:37
three uh for time and efficiency
40:40
uh let me just before i ask you these
40:42
three questions about who's in heaven
40:44
is it true or not true that if you don't
40:47
see a particular person
40:49
in heaven that doesn't mean that they're
40:50
not there would that be true
40:52
that is true that does not mean they're
40:54
not there they could be
40:56
anywhere in heaven and when people go to
40:58
heaven there's
40:59
favorite places they begin to go to and
41:01
visit a lot
41:02
uh they're not always in their mansion
41:04
as magnificent or amazing or fun as that
41:07
mansion mentions are fun too they're not
41:09
just
41:09
you know glorious and beautiful there's
41:11
some of them are just all about fun
41:12
because
41:13
that person has that heart for that but
41:15
if they're out doing things with the
41:17
prophets or with king david or something
41:20
else so they're invited you're invited
41:22
invited let me tell you you're invited
41:23
invited invited
41:25
things going on in heaven then that
41:28
doesn't mean you're going to necessarily
41:29
see somebody that doesn't mean they're
41:31
not there right yeah
41:33
and that's good to get that out because
41:34
people will will word their questions
41:37
they'll say is so-and-so in heaven and
41:40
that just because you haven't seen them
41:41
doesn't mean they're not there
41:43
unless you know differently so these are
41:44
the three that i've got they're
41:45
different questions
41:46
ones and i had asked you this about
41:48
princess die and someone else before
41:50
and i forgot to remind you that you had
41:52
not answered if you had seen so princess
41:54
die
41:55
joan of arc and billy graham have you
41:58
seen any of those
41:59
in heaven
42:02
um i i i have totally seen billy graham
42:06
one of the biggest welcome home parties
42:09
ever
42:10
um i got to see oral robbers i got to
42:12
see quite a few people who
42:14
did significant things with the life of
42:16
course
42:17
people hear me talk uh all the time
42:19
about some i can't even remember the
42:20
name right now but i've seen great men
42:22
and women of God there
42:24
uh yes princess die and people can argue
42:27
all you want to about this
42:29
she knew who christ was she had reached
42:32
out to him in desperation and her life
42:34
didn't turn out the way she thought
42:36
she was so innocent when she stepped
42:38
into the royalty thing
42:39
and was not treated fairly you know by
42:42
her husband
42:44
and other people i just put it out
42:46
there's truth this has been in the
42:47
papers for
42:48
years when she wanted this stuff and she
42:51
was brokenhearted
42:53
and i tell you you can see uh when her
42:56
sons were being raised even after she
42:58
had passed and gone to heaven
43:00
her sons were being raised what she had
43:03
put in them about being kind and doing
43:05
things
43:06
right and respecting people i'm not
43:09
talking about stuff they might or may
43:10
not be doing now but as they were raised
43:12
up
43:12
they had something special in them that
43:15
was deposits from christ
43:16
from their mother and so i can say she
43:19
did right by God by training them up in
43:22
the way
43:22
they should be preparing to be someone
43:25
who loved christ
43:26
not necessarily even for the royalty and
43:29
so yes God does honor her and yes i've
43:32
seen her in heaven
43:34
joan of arc is absolutely in heaven she
43:37
literally
43:38
gave her life for the gospel
43:41
for the kingdom she also is honored in
43:44
heaven and
43:45
loved by people and people want to hear
43:48
their story now when i say that they
43:51
want to hear the story they experience
43:53
with christ in their life beyond growing
43:55
up even things that they went through
43:57
they want to know what really happened
43:59
in those days in your life
44:00
and those are those are major people
44:02
that they would want to see and of
44:04
course billy graham was
44:05
loved by so everybody in heaven i think
44:07
loved him
44:08
yeah as oral roberts did so and now of
44:10
course i've also seen
44:12
uh john wayne i've seen some of the
44:13
different stars that gave himself to
44:15
christ
44:16
i've seen renowned people i've seen
44:18
people nobody knew
44:20
i mean seen mother teresa in heaven
44:22
who's still trying to
44:23
uh be a part of helping people if she
44:25
can she just likes to love people and
44:28
give hugs so
44:29
there are many people in heaven you
44:31
would think they're never going to work
44:32
out there
44:33
yeah you said he had said you'd seen
44:34
michael jackson
44:37
whitney houston whitney houston and then
44:39
yeah
44:40
receiving her rewards at the throne yes
44:42
she gave herself that
44:43
to God i'm sorry oh and then the comic
44:47
uh
44:47
i can't think of his name hilarious
44:51
robin williams you've seen him in heaven
44:53
i have
44:54
okay and that was a tough one because
44:57
because he was so dark and depressed
44:59
toward the end that he took his life but
45:00
you'll clarify especially if people are
45:02
on here new
45:03
you haven't heard it the bottom line is
45:05
you said that the lord has said there's
45:07
a difference between
45:08
committing suicide which is an act of
45:10
almost terror
45:11
against other people and someone who was
45:13
so dark and down
45:15
that they couldn't bear another day and
45:16
they that's not suicide in the lord's
45:19
eyes is that right
45:20
you're not able to bear the suffering
45:22
you're under and i also will just say
45:24
this about robin williams
45:26
and any comedian guard your heart if
45:29
you're
45:29
oppressed a lot that's the enemy goes
45:31
after people who bring laughter to our
45:33
lives
45:34
and there's several comedians right now
45:36
who still experience
45:38
oppression and depression the enemy
45:40
doesn't want the men to be
45:42
funny he just can't stand that he wants
45:44
everyone to
45:45
be suffering and agony and doom and
45:47
gloom robin williams
45:48
and his friends knew this his family
45:51
knew this
45:51
he would reach out and go to these um
45:53
restoration centers for help
45:56
and he'd go he'd be okay for a while but
45:59
because that
46:00
that was continually brought against him
46:02
by the enemy
46:03
he still was suffering and so the last
46:06
place he went to
46:07
and i saw this one interviewing don't
46:09
remember who was interviewing him
46:10
he kept mentioning God this was just
46:12
maybe a few weeks before he actually
46:15
ended his suffering but he kept talking
46:17
about we all need to know God we need to
46:19
understand who he is
46:20
and receive that he has something for us
46:22
he said words like that
46:24
and then i found out the last place he
46:26
went to
46:27
for help was a christian uh
46:31
center it was a christian center and he
46:34
came to know christ
46:35
there you trust christ and he was a
46:38
different person he did very few
46:40
interviews
46:41
after that last time when he went there
46:43
but he did one and they
46:44
they brought up they tried to bring
46:46
other things up to him he wouldn't talk
46:47
about him he only talked about
46:49
letting God reach out to you so yes he
46:52
is in heaven
46:54
oh that's awesome i'm looking at both
46:56
the time in my set here
46:58
um uh uh people wanted to know
47:02
what and there's there's three or four
47:04
versions of the same question
47:06
okay so i'm gonna try and lump them
47:09
together
47:10
what do i do when people in my house are
47:12
coming to my house
47:13
guests chill adult children and i know
47:15
they bring
47:16
stuff whether it's harry potter whether
47:18
it's other unclean stuff and they leave
47:20
it even laying around
47:21
what do i do how do i keep my spiritual
47:24
atmosphere clean
47:26
uh and then someone else said what if i
47:27
live with the person
47:29
so i assume that means like a spouse or
47:32
and they're trying to figure out how do
47:33
they stay clean when it's not
47:35
in their power to keep every object out
47:39
of the house so i've had like four or
47:40
five questions that boil down to that
47:43
and there's all very good solid answers
47:46
to those questions because
47:48
you as a believer have the right to
47:51
not put up with activities of hell
47:55
where you live you may not own the place
47:58
you may not be the person over the place
48:00
but you as a believer
48:02
in christ don't have to tolerate the
48:04
presence of the enemy
48:05
you can evict that out of the place all
48:08
the time if you do it every night before
48:09
you go to bed or something nobody's
48:11
watching you don't have to make a show
48:12
in front of people to make them angry
48:15
the first thing you do and i'll just use
48:16
something for example let's say
48:18
this is a magazine left somebody left
48:21
laying around
48:22
or let's say it's a video or something
48:24
they left it laying on a table or
48:26
something
48:26
but it's not yours to throw away or burn
48:28
which i did all the time
48:30
by the way it was gone i shredded it i
48:34
would bash it to pieces
48:35
you know i want tolerate because i see
48:39
the demons attached to it so let's say
48:40
somebody leaves this it's either either
48:42
a really bad magazine
48:44
it could be a dvd even music satanic
48:47
music
48:48
music talks about drugs and death and
48:50
dying and don't you don't want that in
48:52
your atmosphere
48:53
this is what you do number one don't
48:55
play it don't listen to it if they want
48:57
to play it go somewhere else
48:58
take authority over the atmosphere and
49:00
say you evict the presence of the enemy
49:03
and then you tell the host of heaven
49:04
attack the demonic that's attached to
49:06
that
49:07
please make sure you say that they'll go
49:09
after anything that's attached they'll
49:11
bash them to pieces they'll
49:12
bash the demons so here's this lane here
49:15
right and you walk up and you see it
49:16
sitting there
49:17
you take your hand which is filled with
49:19
the anointing you say
49:20
i cleanse this for the kingdom and evict
49:24
any darkness
49:26
after that even if that person who it
49:28
belongs he plays it
49:30
that darkness won't affect you don't
49:32
willingly sit there and watch it
49:34
but it will have no power to affect you
49:37
because you
49:37
dealt with that darkness i would take
49:40
the television
49:41
i can't remember what you call it the
49:42
thing you changed channels with let's
49:44
say that's this
49:45
right it's laying there and you're so
49:47
tired of somebody whether it's a spouse
49:49
or somebody else
49:50
who who thinks they have rights watching
49:53
things you don't approve of and you
49:54
don't want that stuff do the same thing
49:56
i release the anointing that breaks the
49:59
yoke of darkness
50:01
and i declare they'll get tired of
50:03
watching that stuff
50:05
they won't want it anymore i notified
50:07
the right of the enemy to
50:08
operate through it wow
50:12
and this thing that controls that the
50:14
television or whatever
50:16
you will notice a drastic change of them
50:19
not watching it as often or they'll go
50:22
man i'm tired of that and they'll try to
50:24
find something else
50:25
but when people say nothing the enemy
50:27
comes in and takes over wherever he can
50:29
take over
50:30
make sure at night when everybody's men
50:32
you open the front door and say add
50:33
every part of the enemy out of this
50:35
house in jesus name
50:36
and whatever's left behind will run out
50:38
that door so yes
50:40
you can do things about it you have a
50:42
right as a believer
50:43
to be free from any effects of the enemy
50:47
and if things
50:47
show up because someone who owns a place
50:50
let him in
50:50
you say i serve the most high God i will
50:53
not serve you
50:54
get out and as a believer you have every
50:57
authority
50:58
to not tolerate any of that stuff in
51:00
your life no matter where you're living
51:02
right now if you have a choice to live
51:05
of course you're always going to try to
51:06
find a place that's free from it but if
51:08
you
51:08
say you're under your parents maybe
51:10
you're 14
51:11
maybe you're 10 maybe 11 or 12 you can
51:14
do the same thing
51:16
when they're not looking because when
51:18
you make people angry
51:20
you're going to give the enemy an
51:21
ability to then try to attack you in
51:23
other ways so
51:24
be covert right now in your life if
51:27
you're young
51:28
don't put up with anything coming in or
51:31
music coming in
51:33
that you don't want and make sure that
51:35
you're kicking it out
51:36
and especially in your own room you can
51:39
put your hand around the door frame and
51:40
say
51:41
i apply the blood of christ you don't
51:43
have to actually do it i apply the
51:45
anointing
51:46
to keep anything in enemy out of my room
51:49
and your angels will literally stand in
51:51
front of your door
51:52
and will not allow anything to come into
51:55
your room or mess up the atmosphere of
51:57
where you're sleeping at night
51:59
that's good now that's really really
52:01
good Kat
52:02
now there was a second set of questions
52:04
by multiple people they're asking
52:06
a similar question but they're saying
52:08
outside of my home
52:10
maybe in another city are either my
52:12
adult children
52:14
or maybe it's the parents do i have
52:17
authority
52:18
to do anything about them of course
52:19
everybody believes in praying
52:22
for and praying against evil so i don't
52:24
think that's the question
52:25
they're asking what do i have authority
52:27
to cast out
52:29
if any from let's say my child
52:32
down the road or another city you're
52:34
related to these people
52:36
you have a great authority over all the
52:40
power the enemy
52:41
trying to control them whether they're
52:43
involved in witchcraft if it's drugs if
52:45
it's pornography
52:47
if it's just hating people maybe they
52:49
they have uh
52:51
involved in all kinds of things you
52:52
don't like that their mom then
52:54
you could take power over all the part
52:56
of the enemy and come in the host of
52:58
having to go pull down every
53:00
stronghold of satan controlling them
53:03
and it doesn't matter if their son
53:05
daughter husband cousin
53:06
uncle it doesn't matter who that is you
53:09
have authority
53:11
jesus said i give you power over all the
53:13
power of the enemy he didn't say
53:14
but not in this place or not in this
53:16
situation if it's taking authority over
53:19
darkness
53:20
you have to say something okay don't go
53:23
to their face and say i'm kicking the
53:24
demons out away from you okay don't say
53:26
that
53:27
unless God tells you to say it and he
53:29
normally wouldn't
53:31
the activities you take in your own life
53:33
and i can tell you declaring and
53:35
decreeing
53:36
it says when you dare to declare a
53:37
decree it shall
53:39
be established unto you right there your
53:42
words have
53:43
power in them and it doesn't matter if
53:45
they're on the other side of the world
53:47
if that's your son your daughter
53:49
you have authority to speak about their
53:51
life
53:52
over the darkness controlling them they
53:54
still have to make a choice
53:56
but when the enemy when the demonic is
53:58
removed
53:59
that is influencing them or and
54:02
empowering them to do things that are
54:04
wrong
54:05
that leaves an opening for the holy
54:07
spirit to go in there and
54:08
operate in the fullness of the power of
54:10
christ because you
54:11
took authority that's good that's really
54:14
good
54:15
well let's see i've got a couple more
54:17
this one could be big one a long winter
54:18
could be short
54:20
um this lady said i've been wondering
54:22
what the crucifixion was like for God
54:24
the father
54:25
what's the father there watching when
54:27
jesus breathed his last why did jesus
54:29
cry out
54:30
that God had forsaken why did God leave
54:32
him i feel like jesus likely knew that
54:34
was coming but
54:35
but in that comment he seemed surprised
54:38
that his father had forsaken him
54:39
what can you tell us about what that
54:41
looked like or actually
54:42
what uh first thing i'll try to make it
54:45
as brief as i can but you know i'm a
54:47
detail yeah
54:48
yeah go for it just go for it i'm a
54:50
detailed person people so God shows me
54:52
in detail
54:53
he absolutely knew every single thing
54:56
this is the father knew
54:57
everything that would happen to christ
54:59
when he sent him he knew it before he
55:01
sent him
55:02
he's been from the beginning to the end
55:04
which means
55:05
every part of time that will exist the
55:08
father has
55:08
been to that he's already seen it he
55:11
knows what's going to happen he makes
55:13
choices but he knows that certain things
55:17
have to happen to make our life
55:20
possible so he actually before the word
55:24
that was christ's name that's what they
55:27
the angels and army
55:28
they called christ the word even the
55:31
father
55:32
called him the word before he came to
55:35
die
55:35
he wasn't called christ jesus christ
55:38
he was called the word the father he
55:40
would go somewhere
55:41
where there was nothing the father would
55:43
speak what he wanted
55:45
and and the word who became christ would
55:47
step out
55:48
and make it and so that's the
55:51
relationship
55:52
they had he would step in and out of him
55:54
all the time when they created they did
55:56
it together
55:57
and he knew within this time the father
56:00
knew
56:00
time is coming when something different
56:02
will happen so he called the word to
56:04
himself
56:05
shared all that would happen in order to
56:08
make a way for humanity
56:10
to come back to God because adam gave it
56:13
away
56:14
but he knows that he fell he sinned he
56:16
changed it for all of us
56:18
so christ he had to have someone come to
56:21
pay a price that made it possible to
56:23
come
56:23
back he explained to the word all these
56:26
things i got to see part of that
56:28
he actually had to tell him you have to
56:30
be willing to have flesh put on your
56:32
body
56:32
you won't just be all spirit and for all
56:34
the time you'll have that flesh
56:37
you'll have to experience living with
56:38
humanity
56:41
you're God you know the father was God
56:42
he was God you have to understand you be
56:44
there you have to live and experience
56:46
every single feeling emotion and
56:48
temptation
56:50
that you are not even involved or know
56:52
or feel you'll have to go through all of
56:54
it
56:54
so you know what they go through to live
56:57
on that earth
56:58
you have to understand that satan will
57:00
be there he'll want to wipe you out he
57:02
won't know who you are in the beginning
57:04
and he'll he won't understand because
57:05
the word
57:07
looked certain way he was all spirit
57:09
christ
57:11
who was born to the womb of a woman who
57:13
took on some of the attributes
57:15
of the jewish race didn't look like the
57:19
word so satan didn't even know who he
57:21
was for a while
57:22
when he figured out who he was he
57:24
thought he would do him in
57:26
not knowing this was all part of the
57:28
plan christ
57:29
knew he would have to die on the cross
57:31
he even shared it with his disciples
57:33
he knew that was going to happen and so
57:35
he knew that there'd be suffering he
57:36
felt every bit of the pain
57:38
that he went through he carried uh he
57:40
was bruised
57:41
with the stripes meant for our healing
57:44
he was bruised for
57:45
uh and you know he took those stripes he
57:47
took the crown of thorns on him
57:49
he gave himself he drank the cup in the
57:51
garden of every
57:52
evil wicked deed that could ever happen
57:55
because it wasn't just his
57:56
body being crucified it was the evil he
57:59
drank
57:59
in an innocent pure and innocent body
58:03
that stuff had to be nailed to the cross
58:04
which is why christ is the only
58:07
one who can forgive sins because he died
58:10
carrying the sins that doesn't give you
58:13
the right to sin all the time you want
58:15
to that's
58:15
unrighteous to be righteous you repent
58:18
of your sins and he will cleanse you
58:20
from all unrighteousness
58:22
so you have to understand that christ
58:24
knew
58:25
before he left heaven he would go
58:27
through all that but he had to be
58:29
willing
58:29
to be planted as a seed in the womb of
58:32
mary
58:33
being birthed like every other person on
58:35
the earth
58:36
he would then have flesh on him now now
58:39
in his glorified body that flesh can be
58:41
as big as it wants as small as it wants
58:43
so he still has that glorified
58:45
uh part of him that's on him but walking
58:47
on the earth
58:48
he had experienced everything the the
58:51
ridicule the unjust
58:52
criticism the harshness of people's
58:55
words
58:56
and that's why he says that you know he
58:58
he is the one who set your soul free
58:59
he's the one who says cast all your
59:01
cares on me because why
59:02
he cares for you when you
59:05
see the big picture you understand he
59:07
went through all that just for you
59:09
uh what was the question you know well
59:12
on this
59:13
one why did why did he
59:16
what did he actually feel that his
59:19
father had forsaken him
59:21
during those moments did he literally
59:23
feel like why have you forsaken me
59:26
he had already told christ not christ
59:28
never
59:29
was away from the presence of his father
59:31
even when he was
59:32
talking to the disciples and training
59:34
him the presence of God the father was
59:35
with him
59:36
he'd even go to the mountains it says to
59:38
to speak with him and be with him
59:40
but there was that point in his life
59:42
when the father told him for
59:44
three days you will not feel my presence
59:46
but you
59:47
yourself will have to trust me that i
59:50
will raise you from the dead
59:52
that you will walk in great authority he
59:54
had already explained it but when it
59:56
happens
59:57
it's different when it happens yes the
59:59
father did not look upon him at one
60:01
point on the cross
60:02
he turned his head away i don't think
60:04
that he could bear it
60:06
but he knew his son knew he wasn't
60:09
watching he had to trust the father like
60:12
we have to trust he had to trust him
60:15
from that point on
60:16
and he knew even though he'd been told
60:18
he could feel
60:20
the the presence leave him and the whole
60:23
time
60:23
that christ when he took his released
60:26
his spirit out of his body on the cross
60:28
he still didn't have the presence of the
60:29
father yet people make up all these
60:31
things
60:32
he had to go to abraham's bosom or
60:33
paradise where the thief was going to be
60:36
he had to preach the gospel to those
60:37
that God put there because they they
60:39
believed in God himself
60:40
then he left there went into hell he
60:43
still didn't feel the presence of the
60:44
father these three days he didn't feel
60:46
him
60:47
and he had to trust his father in the
60:49
midst of hell where he was taken and
60:51
kept
60:52
and uh of course everybody knows that
60:54
satan planned a big
60:56
show himself and that didn't turn out
60:58
right on the third
60:59
day when the father he could hear the
61:02
father's voice
61:03
speak and thunder ripped through hell
61:07
and christ stood up and melted the faces
61:11
of these high-level demonic who sits on
61:13
thrones around the world he
61:14
melted their features like wax and
61:17
colossians and said
61:19
the principalities and powers that means
61:21
they couldn't ever put back their
61:23
features the way they were
61:24
he demonstrated the power of the living
61:27
God from himself
61:28
in hell stripped satan of everything he
61:30
had on took the keys of helgeth and the
61:32
grave
61:34
i'm telling you that was the biggest
61:35
show ever except for when the father
61:37
kicked all the
61:38
of satan you know lucifer and all the
61:40
one through the angels this was a show
61:43
christ put on a show and it said in the
61:44
bible he made a show of it
61:47
openly in the midst of hell hell
61:50
thinking they had him
61:51
they couldn't wait for him to get out of
61:53
there and then of course he raised from
61:55
the dead
61:56
took his body back his body was
61:58
instantly
61:59
glorified at that moment and he he he
62:02
then
62:02
he knew because he trusted his father
62:05
his father did everything he promised
62:07
and everybody should be doing that right
62:09
now
62:09
in the darkest times of christ's life
62:12
when he could hear
62:13
nothing he had to believe and trust what
62:16
God had said to him
62:18
so his father did not look upon him
62:20
knowing
62:21
not because he couldn't because he
62:23
couldn't stand it necessarily
62:24
as much as he knew his son had to trust
62:27
him
62:28
just like we have to trust the father
62:31
ourselves
62:32
yeah so so so good well we could go on
62:35
for a long time but i think this is a
62:36
good
62:37
holy moment to stop on this point so
62:39
people will ponder that
62:40
man what is what uh what a sacrifice you
62:43
know
62:44
and and yet we are told to be joyful for
62:46
what he did
62:47
for the joy set before him he endured
62:49
the cross amazing
62:50
scripture amazing scripture so
62:54
yeah well tell people remind people
62:56
there's got a couple sites we have
62:57
revealing heaven.com along the bottom
62:59
there that's one of your sites
63:01
tell people about both of those sites
63:03
yeah revealingheaven.com
63:05
is my corporation that God had me create
63:08
a corporation
63:09
uh because we would create so many
63:11
things that would represent heaven and
63:12
put him in the marketplace
63:15
he himself was tired of the evil in the
63:17
darkness i mean demons are put on
63:18
everything everybody knows that
63:20
why not put images of heaven why not put
63:22
par army of heaven on there
63:24
why not but places are in heaven on your
63:26
t-shirts on your bags on your carpets on
63:29
your walls
63:30
and so God created one quest
63:32
international which i am ceo of that
63:34
revealingheaven.com is where you find
63:36
the products that's where you find about
63:38
the events
63:39
but then God had me create Katker.com
63:42
that's a literal website
63:44
uh where you get so much revelation for
63:47
free you can go and see and learn all
63:50
kinds of there's training videos there's
63:52
videos with revelation so many it took
63:54
us forever to create that place
63:56
uh there's interviews i've done with
63:58
people that are on there that are
64:00
powerful
64:01
God calls it his spiritual platform well
64:03
he is where he is allowed to say
64:05
whatever he wants to say
64:07
and at one point we probably will be
64:09
doing webinars from there and other
64:11
stuff from there
64:12
but it's Kat Kerr.com it is also the only
64:15
place on planet earth you can go to
64:18
Kat Kerr.com and give to me online
64:21
not through any facebook nobody's
64:23
facebook nobody's youtube
64:25

64:27
that and so you can go there and click
64:28
on the treasury and do that or you can
64:30
be
64:31
become a guardian regards the treasure
64:33

03:37
days about our platform that is growing

rapidly
03:40
called zap it spelled x-a-p-i-t is very
03:43
facebook-like
03:44
but we're not going to censor you
03:46
especially we're not going to consider
03:48
sensing your conservative views we're
03:50
not even going to make it our business
03:52
to decide if you're telling a rumor or
03:54
not that's your business
03:55
now what i've found in social media is
03:57
if you're telling a rumor that's a
03:59
completely wild rumor
04:00
the people who are watching you will
04:02
tell you that's a rumor
04:04
they don't need the people at the top
04:06
who run the organization decide what's
04:08
the rumor
04:09
we don't like that and that's one of the
04:10
reasons we're in existence so jeff run
04:12

you know you need to know when it was
06:12
said that's accountability on their part
06:14
right hey cat what is that symbol on
06:17
your
06:17
the blue it almost looks like a diamond
06:20
what is that
06:21
this one right here is a shield it's a
06:24
shield representing one from heaven
06:26
this is the host initiative it's about
06:30
heaven's army working with us in this
06:31
time and actually
06:33
god asked me to design a logo and chris
06:36
who's our
06:37
media art tech person helped to create
06:40
this
06:40
and what it is is it says h i the host
06:43
initiative
06:44
the eye is a lightning bolt and on top
06:46
of the eye itself is an
06:48
eye of one of the hosts of heaven and
06:50
behind it is sort of an open portal
06:52
that's what the blue behind it is so
06:54
this represents a new time on the earth
06:57
very cool very very cool well um before
06:59
we let's
07:00
you have an announcement you wanted to
07:02
make about uh this weekend and
07:04
where are you going to be tell us about
07:05
that yeah well everybody
07:08
most people know especially those who
07:10
had signed up for um
07:12
the freedom event the freedom uh
07:15
conference i don't like the conference
07:17
uh freedom event
07:19
of what that was supposed to be in
07:20
murfreesboro tennessee at global fire
07:22
ministries that was cancelled
07:24
because they didn't they really did have
07:26
death threats those death threats have
07:28
been lifted now because
07:30
uh obviously hank uh changed his um
07:34
changed his course so he's not going and
07:36
jeff will not be there at
07:37
all and by the way jeff is on the
07:39
sabbatical i'm just gonna say that much
07:41
right now
07:41
and he probably needs it desperately and
07:44
so does his team
07:45
because of a lot of stuff they've been
07:47
going through however i was invited by
07:49
jan janssen yeah jan
07:52
because god still wanted a message to go
07:54
out through there so i will be
07:55
a special guest speaker this sunday the
07:58
25th
07:59
in murfreesboro tennessee at global fire
08:01
ministries
08:03
it's going to be great it's going to be
08:04
on the times of god
08:06
which is something god just gave me so
08:08
you don't want to miss it
08:09
i'm sure that it will be online if not
08:12
uh i'm sure we at least will have our
08:14
our facebook going with that
08:15
um but just wanted you know global
08:18
foreign ministers is going to go
08:19
uh full steam ahead but jeff is going to
08:23
be taking a sabbatical
08:24
and he probably should have taken that
08:26
six months ago
08:27
if you all didn't know what i'll just
08:29
say this too when the prophets begin to
08:31
jump off the wagon the wagon you know
08:33
that trump's going to be restored
08:35
um a lot of them started bashing him
08:38
which we all know is wrong
08:40
a prophet supposed to speak the words of
08:42
god they're accountable to god himself
08:45
um but no one should bash a prophet you
08:47
know what it says in the bible
08:49
about not touching his anointed so just
08:52
let me give you a heads up that's wrong
08:54
don't bash the prophets hello
08:56
they're the ones who hear from god and
08:58
if they're saying something that doesn't
08:59
line up
09:00
keep it in your heart and pray for them
09:02
but uh but i'm not bashing any of them
09:04
okay
09:05
they made a decision that's between them
09:07
and god we're going to see how all this
09:09
works out in the end
09:10
but if anybody needs a break it would
09:12
definitely be jeff
09:13
and jan and their family and their team
09:17
so i'm going like uh just as uh so that
09:20
you'll still hear a word of god
09:22
that would be powerful from murfreesboro
09:24
tennessee from global fire ministries so
09:26
that's my first announcement i want to
09:27
make
09:28
again that's this sunday and there'll
09:30
just be one service 10 a.m
09:32
sunday and i'm excited about getting to
09:34
go
09:35
and so that's my that's it for that but
09:37
let me tell you what
09:39
yeah go ahead and talk
09:42
you ready to hear about the government
09:44
yeah go go for it yes
09:46
okay well you should probably watch
09:48
hannity the hannity show that president
09:51
trump was actually
09:52
speaking on the other day he gave a few
09:55
heads up about him not being invisible
09:58
anymore
09:59
he's also working full steam ahead to
10:01
get the house flipped
10:03
which we need that to happen if you want
10:05
to pray about something pray that the
10:06
house of representatives gets flipped
10:08
uh back to republican control because we
10:11
need that okay we need it
10:13
the senate's almost a shooting but keep
10:15
praying for that to happen to you
10:17
and those of you who don't know there
10:19
are the elections which
10:20
every four years but there's mid-term
10:23
elections which are very important
10:25
that would be 2022 when a lot of this
10:27
will be voted on
10:28
replacing the voting for the house of
10:31
representatives and for the senate
10:34
there may be a few governorships in
10:35
there somewhere i'm not certain about
10:37
that but i do know
10:38
i do hear down the pipeline but some of
10:41
the governors are going to be more and
10:42
more outspoken the republican ones
10:44
because they have life in their states
10:46
and you should know that if you're in
10:48
one of those i'm in one of those in
10:49
florida
10:50
it's fully open the state's been fully
10:52
opened by governor desantis
10:54
please make sure you're praying for him
10:56
to have more strength and
10:58
and no sound wisdom from god he is a
11:00
strong believer
11:01
and he wants life for the people here
11:03
and there's several other states doing
11:05
the same thing
11:06
so you all you hear from the uh this
11:21
so they're still up to their own
11:23
business they haven't changed their ammo
11:25
at all
11:26
i think one day they will really totally
11:28
regret that because because when the
11:30
news is controlled
11:32
thank god there's other sources newsmax
11:35
and there's a few other sources out
11:37
there i know a
11:38
kenneth copeland show a flashpoint and
11:40
there's several other you don't know
11:42
about
11:43
so you know make sure they're telling
11:44
the truth when you hear them
11:46
because they will encourage you and
11:47
empower you to know what really is going
11:49
on
11:50
i think trump's going to start doing
11:51
that himself and make sure you
11:53
you have checked out is it a 45
11:57
office.com is that what trump's new
12:00
website is i think
12:01
yeah 45 office.com right right 45
12:04
office.com
12:05
sign up for it you'll get stuff from the
12:07
president himself that would be
12:08
president trump
12:10
and so i just want to encourage you
12:11
things many things are going on
12:13
but he's going to be more and more
12:14
visible which terrifies the left and
12:16
terrifies hell
12:18
they don't want his voice to be heard
12:19
there's a frequency in it
12:21
and so he's starting to speak about who
12:23
to vote for
12:25
in these upcoming um midterm elections
12:28
which are very important so please focus
12:31
on that for your prayers
12:32
and of course for trump himself and his
12:34
family
12:35
you're not seeing the end of them trust
12:37
me god's still saying the same exact
12:40
thing
12:40
if you ask me i'm going to keep saying
12:42
the same words he said he's going to
12:44
have his way in this time
12:46
he's going to not just expose the
12:48
corruption but he's going to deal
12:50
harshly with it very harshly with it
12:54
and that's to prepare the way for what
12:56
is coming
12:57
in this next time of god which is not
12:59
the perilous times i know i get tired of
13:01
saying that but people still think it is
13:02
and i saw someone that
13:04
recently asked me that i went absolutely
13:06
not they're from a time when you won't
13:08
even be on the earth people most people
13:09
alive now won't be here when that
13:11
happens you should rejoice about that
13:13
so they'll be great it'll get greater
13:15
and greater and greater and greater
13:17
in the generations to come that's why
13:19
this is being done now
13:21
if you understand how god operated this
13:22
is what he does he wipes out
13:24
exposes the evil hello okay did that in
13:26
heaven
13:27
exposed it then wiped it out of there
13:29
right on the earth
13:30
exposed all the evil with no and then he
13:32
wiped it out and putting over he
13:34
belonged
13:35
he's not going to wipe off the earth
13:36
this time but he's totally going to deal
13:38
with the darkness and
13:40
i know i said eat cake and celebrate yes
13:42
i'm still eating cake in smaller
13:44
portions people
13:46
maybe a cookie would do
13:49
no i don't know a date and guess what
13:51
that doesn't matter to me what matters
13:53
is our god
13:54
is still here you're praying he's got
13:57
your prayers they filled the bowls
13:58
before the altar of his throne
14:00
and yes i've been having many times
14:02
since all this started
14:03
and they're still celebrating so
14:06
celebrate
14:06
but keep your prayer focus out there say
14:09
you may say with your own words
14:11
even in the atmosphere i refuse to
14:13
accept any of the lying cheating
14:15
stealing
14:16
i'm going to accept any a new fake law
14:18
made that takes away my constitutional
14:20
rights i reject it in jesus name
14:23
your words do something in the
14:25
atmosphere to shift things
14:27
so don't think you're powerless you're
14:28
not powerless as long as you've got a
14:30
voice and you've got jesus amen
14:32
very very good by the way this morning
14:33
it is still dark and i get knocked on
14:36
the side
14:37
and i felt like it was an angelic thing
14:39
waking me up and so i thought okay
14:41
i'm going to go back to sleeping i
14:42
thought wait a minute i had reminded
14:44
myself
14:45
when i get knocked i'm supposed to look
14:46
at the clock so i looked at the clock
14:49
the digital this is 4 45 the president
14:51
is 4 45
14:52
this is april i don't know what it means
14:54
i'm just telling you i got
14:56
knocked by an angel look at the clock
14:58
it's 4
14:59
45 so i don't know if the four stands
15:01
for four or april
15:03
probably april maybe but four also means
15:07
you know the number four means god's
15:09
path that's what it means
15:11
god's path uh or god's plans that's what
15:14
the number four means number three means
15:16
god's approval
15:17
so he basically said my path is still 45
15:20
we know who 45
15:21
is yeah absolutely um i'm going to jump
15:24
by the way i was going to mention that
15:26
you said it's april 21 of 21 they've got
15:29
a three for
15:30
because this is your episode 21 with us
15:32
on april 21 of 21. now how's that for
15:35
god in numbers
15:36
that's awesome okay
15:40
but i'm going to jump ahead to a
15:41
question because you just said something
15:42
and i thought i'm going to
15:44
tie that to a question that's way down
15:46
to my list you said
15:48
trump's coming in and they don't like it
15:50
they don't like he's got a different
15:51
vibration
15:52
and i'm going to ask you the question
15:55
then you can jump back to talk about
15:57
i'm going to ask you what did you mean
15:58
by that trump vibration and this world
16:00
inner person said
16:01
there are times when i've come into a
16:03
thick presence of the lord and
16:04
it feels like my back entire body are
16:08
vibrating has this happened even if so
16:10
why are we vibrating so talk about
16:12
vibrating and vibrations
16:14
if they're two different things or
16:15
whatever that's a new question for you
16:19
no i can tell you that happens to me off
16:21
and on
16:22
when the presence of the lord is so
16:24
strong i my body will begin to
16:27
it's like a it's like a super fast
16:30
shaking
16:31
uh i mean we'll shake right and then we
16:33
shake
16:35
your whole inside shakes that's that's
16:37
the frequency of god
16:39
coming into the earth but trump's
16:42
vibration is increasing you're the first
16:45
one who i ever said that you by the way
16:47
that what he's given now is a shaking
16:50
it's a shaking coming from trump himself
16:52
since the enemies trying to
16:54
shake us into fear the words when trump
16:57
speaks him
16:58
has that vibration that frequency of
17:01
of of the spirit of god in them because
17:04
god is shaking himself he's shaking the
17:06
earth itself
17:08
he's starting to shake hell itself is
17:10
shaking right now
17:11
they're terrified because you know
17:13
satan's usually the one who does
17:14
the shaking thing but god had done a
17:17
long
17:18
time ago so he is shaking how the
17:21
spirits of darkness are beginning to
17:22
shake i see them all the time like
17:24
shaking trying to run away
17:26
and so i can tell you we're getting
17:27
closer and closer to that time when god
17:29
himself is going to do something
17:32
of course it's going to involve trump in
17:34
it but even the frequency
17:36
and his voice now has a vibration in it
17:39
some people begin to feel that when they
17:41
hear him speak because you know why he
17:43
is our president
17:46
and i need to remind you when i'm
17:48
talking about this the bible says
17:50
when the wicked are in power you know
17:52
the people is it's going to be a
17:54
terrible time
17:54
people in accuracy all kinds of things
17:56
happen but when that when the righteous
17:58
are in power the people rejoice well why
17:59
aren't you rejoicing
18:01
because the left has no power i don't
18:03
mind saying that
18:04
the left has no power not real power
18:07
they're taking or trying to steal the
18:08
power
18:09
but in the spirit realm they have no
18:11
power to speak
18:13
or bring greater evil and they can want
18:15
to they want to say they want it
18:17
but but because trump is our president
18:19
he is in power
18:21
literally won the election so he's in
18:23
power for that reason but god put him
18:25
there
18:26
and so he is god recognizes him as being
18:29
in power in our country right now even
18:31
though he's not
18:32
that said that officially well he
18:34
actually has said officially he was the
18:35
president
18:36
it's going to shift and when there's a
18:39
shift
18:39
there's a shaking first let me tell you
18:41
but the shaking that's happening in
18:43
spirit right now
18:45
isn't hell shaking it's god shaking
18:49
well that was one of my questions
18:51
somewhere here you just mentioned it
18:54
several prophets have been now saying
18:56
we're in for a bit of a dark time
18:58
before it gets lighter there'll be words
19:00
like that or
19:02
there's going to be riot some riots in
19:04
the cities
19:05
um and maybe some people even need to
19:07
make sure you have
19:08
preparation for a short period and
19:11
before it gets good is someone showing
19:13
you any of that
19:14
and if so or if not no i'm not about
19:17
that
19:18
she's not he's not shown that okay from
19:21
the very beginning when people said we'd
19:23
have civil
19:24
war then they changed some other kind of
19:26
war we'd have neighborhood wars and
19:29
god said the people are not going to
19:30
rise up and have a civil war
19:32
the war is going to be amongst the left
19:34
themselves they're going to start
19:35
fighting themselves and god says it also
19:38
but i can tell you
19:39
we are not appointed under wrath and
19:42
because this is
19:43
not the day of his wrath that's god's
19:45
wrath
19:46
it's not the day of god's wrath that
19:48
means anyone who rises up trying to do
19:49
something
19:50
they're going to get the wrath of god is
19:52
what's going to happen
19:53
and i would say anything like that would
19:55
be uh i don't i don't know if god has
19:57
never said to me
19:58
that they need to be prepared for months
20:00
and months and months of total darkness
20:02
no food no i think and i think most
20:04
people think
20:05
think in the terms of a week or two or
20:07
something like that that there'd be
20:09
some intense times you're not getting
20:11
anything like that
20:12
i'll tell you where they won't come from
20:14
they won't come from the republican
20:17
[Laughter]
20:19
any of states happens you people need to
20:21
know
20:23
if the democrats are in control of the
20:26
states and there's democratic governors
20:27
and we all know about newsome and the
20:29
other one
20:29
i can't remember his name most of the
20:31
time the one in the old california that
20:33
they've tried to get rid of like eight
20:35
times and he
20:36
keeps getting around it i can't speak
20:39
for those states
20:40
because there has been some violence in
20:42
those states
20:43
that has nothing to do with our our own
20:46
president that has nothing to do with
20:48
america itself that's not america
20:51
going into war thus those governors
20:53
permitting and probably paying for
20:56
those different groups to come in and do
20:58
demonstrations of violence and set
21:00
things on fire
21:01
why to bring fear to the people
21:04
that's what that's all about but as far
21:06
as our whole country that's not going to
21:09
happen
21:10
the governors who are in power right now
21:12
and the republican governors aren't
21:13
going to tolerate it happening
21:15
they will stop that from happening
21:17
they've already had meetings about that
21:19
and information has already been sent
21:21
out this kind of covert information
21:24
i can assure you the only ones who will
21:26
keep doing it are the ones who are doing
21:27
it
21:29
good good good good okay uh we've got
21:31
various things okay here's a person
21:33
wanting to know
21:34
uh when jesus was in heaven he or she
21:37
stayed he or she saying jesus was in
21:39
heaven
21:40
until he was in mary's womb so suddenly
21:42
he's in mary's womb
21:44
do you have any knowledge about was he
21:47
the question is that was he able to
21:48
communicate with god
21:50
while he's in the womb during those nine
21:52
months i guess is the question
21:56
i know uh quite a bit about how all that
21:59
happened
22:00
but um the one thing i want to say now
22:02
before we get off the track is
22:04
right side broadcasting is another place
22:07
you can go
22:08
to online is that right now let me see
22:11
uh
22:12
oh i can't forget to say this this last
22:16
sunday
22:17
they had a huge event in florida called
22:20
storm the bay
22:21
trumperilla mega first boat parade in
22:24
tampa florida
22:26
hundreds of thousands of people flooded
22:28
the state
22:29
to celebrate trump and right side
22:31
broadcasting if you go on and look for
22:33
it
22:34
you'll be able to see it and right side
22:36
broadcasting is the one who's always
22:37
showing him now when he has any kind of
22:40
um rallies and stuff like that right
22:42
side broadcasting we'll be putting that
22:44
on so don't forget to go there and check
22:46
it out you'll be blessed beyond measure
22:47
to see
22:49
i'm sure trump was and mike lindell yay
22:52
michael
22:58
he literally paid for that whole thing
23:00
to happen
23:01
and so i want to tell you bless mike
23:03
glendale go buy his pillow my pillow
23:08
really a true patriot absolutely
23:12
okay back to the womb thing what jesus
23:14
going in from
23:15
so i obviously at one moment he's in
23:18
heaven
23:19
then there's the the seed in mary's womb
23:22
suddenly
23:27
i have to let you know it was not
23:30
a suddenly in heaven okay this was
23:34
planned
23:35
our father is the greatest planner of
23:38
all time he makes claims
23:40
to be clear i think this person knew
23:43
that
23:44
but realized that there was a moment in
23:46
time
23:47
when it happened when the plan was put
23:50
into effect
23:51
so he's there the plan is about to
23:53
happen the angel sees mary
23:55
it says the spirit's going to overshadow
23:57
you and whom
23:58
it happens right what do you do and that
24:01
was actually that was gabriel gabriel
24:04
uh was present however
24:08
the holy spirit is the one who brought
24:11
the his name was the word that was
24:13
jesus's name in heaven he was called the
24:15
word the father explained to him if
24:17
you're going to die for them i have to
24:18
put flesh on you turn you into a seed
24:20
and holy spirit will plant you in the
24:23
womb of
24:24
mary so holy spirit came in the form of
24:27
a seed
24:28
and gabriel was there also so when that
24:30
happened gabriel
24:32
got to make the announcement that's why
24:34
that's why gabriel was there to let mary
24:35
know how all that happened
24:37
and i don't know maybe in the beginning
24:39
i'm sure the father was watching over
24:41
him and everything
24:42
but there came a time jesus when he was
24:44
born
24:45
he had to be raised up till he came to a
24:47
time of understanding which was young
24:49
he was young when he knew he was the son
24:51
of god
24:52
but in the womb of mary i believe he was
24:55
like any other baby in there
24:56
he had to grow his body had to form
25:00
uh into the into the the flesh body that
25:02
god had chosen for him
25:05
and so i'm sure the father probably
25:07
saying over him and things like that but
25:08
as far as communication like speaking to
25:11
him
25:11
i don't know that happened until jesus
25:14
got older when the father
25:15
literally wanted him to know you are my
25:18
son
25:18
you must be about my business this is
25:20
why i sent you
25:22
yeah that's good that's good now this
25:24
person wants to know a different person
25:26
wants to know
25:27
jesus is on the man of transfiguration
25:29
and either the father brings it
25:31
says it but most this and elijah i'm
25:34
guessing they were in
25:35
abraham's wisdom then suddenly are
25:37
whisked uh
25:38
for lack of better terrible knowledge
25:40
they're on the mount with jesus
25:42
uh and this person's wanting to know
25:45
what did they talk about if you know
25:47
and did they do some sort of time travel
25:49
to understand what was going on what
25:51
what can you tell me about any details
25:53
about that event
25:55
are you talking about when the disciples
25:56
saw him right yeah
25:58
right they saw moses and elijah and
26:00
they're all talking
26:01
this person wasn't what were they
26:03
talking about
26:05
and then she actually he or she asked
26:07
did they try and travel
26:09
at that moment i think because there has
26:11
been teaching i think kim clement
26:13
suggested this others have suggested
26:15
that there was a time travel element
26:17
when moses was on mount sinai and god
26:20
hit him in the cleft of the rock
26:22
and there was a suggestion they time
26:24
traveled into the amount of
26:26
transfiguration
26:27
hundreds and hundreds of years in the
26:29
future what you thought i think
26:31
that probably could have been a whole
26:32
different incident
26:34
um i'm sure of course jesus christ by
26:37
the way
26:37
appeared when the monk of
26:38
transfiguration was they saw him in his
26:40
glorified body that's what they did
26:43
so so at one moment he's in his body his
26:45
human body that you would normally see
26:47
but when he when christ was glorified
26:49
when he came out of the tomb there was
26:50
such a glory on him remember
26:52
even a few people didn't recognize him
26:54
at that time so in front of them
26:57
they saw christ in the glorified body he
26:59
allowed
27:00
it probably could have been an open
27:02
vision he probably could have done an
27:04
open vision thing
27:05
where they saw you know they saw them
27:08
with him up there they saw him
27:10
it was just evidence to them he was the
27:12
son of god and that that was right what
27:14
they were
27:15
they were thinking at the time in their
27:16
life i do know this that when
27:18
moses when god put moses in the cleft of
27:21
the rock
27:21
god himself put moses inside him the
27:24
cleft of the rock was inside god
27:27
and all of time is con is uh shown in
27:30
there
27:30
god's been from the beginning to the end
27:32
the end of the beginning it's all
27:33
inside him so when he hit he hid
27:37
moses in there moses saw time begin
27:40
he saw the garden of eden he saw adam
27:44
he saw that he would not have known
27:46
about any of that and so he said as
27:48
i pass by when time passes by i said
27:51
when
27:51
that's what he's saying i will show you
27:53
the hinder parts that's the exact
27:55
oh that's what that means wasn't the
27:58
hunter parts wasn't god
27:59
talking about his back the hinder parts
28:02
were the parts of
28:03
time that had gone before them
28:06
he showed moses time before that time
28:09
and that's how moses knew about adam and
28:12
eve and all that stuff so that was a
28:14
whole different encounter that moses had
28:16
with god
28:17
that was a brand new encounter when when
28:19
jesus was shown
28:20
in his glorified body in the amount of
28:22
transfiguration he could have
28:24
totally brought moses and you know right
28:27
there he could have just put him there
28:28
with them
28:29
because you know he is god so there's
28:31
many different
28:32
facets i guess one day we're just gonna
28:34
we're going to not right now
28:35
eventually write a revelation bible or
28:38
bible of revelation however you want to
28:39
call it probably
28:41
and put all these scriptures in there
28:43
with with the encounters that happen
28:45
time travel that happened the spirit
28:47
realm so people are beginning to
28:49
understand there's things we don't see
28:51
or understand that are hidden in the
28:53
word of god
28:54
yeah wow okay awesome that's i i never
28:57
heard that explanation the hindu part
28:59
means in history basically it was what
29:01
awesome i always wondered where moses
29:03
got his revelation about the garden of
29:05
eden that's what you're saying
29:06
that's where it happened because he
29:08
wrote those books okay
29:09
so um three different people you know we
29:12
went through this
29:13
last time but i don't think we kept
29:15
these names
29:16
you may have to remind me people this
29:18
will tell people something about god was
29:20
king who killed his brother
29:22
is he in heaven if he knows nicodemus
29:24
who jesus said you have to be born again
29:26
again is he in heaven and what about a
29:29
massive fire who lied to the holy spirit
29:31
and died are they in heaven if you know
29:35
now i you need to say them over again
29:38
because i know okay
29:39
yeah okay so cain who killed his brother
29:43
nicodemus and ananias and sapphira
29:49
i have never seen ananias and sapphira
29:52
anywhere in heaven
29:53
i've not seen them at all cain is there
29:57
because cain
29:58
did eventually repent cain knew that he
30:01
had sinned but this is the thing
30:03
he knew god protected him he knew he
30:05
would have been killed and this is the
30:07
thing
30:07
why did god still want him even on the
30:09
earth well number one he was still
30:11
he still was producing children that was
30:14
in the lineage of
30:15
um of adam
30:19
for some time so god wanted him to
30:21
remain
30:22
or he would not have marked him so
30:23
people wouldn't kill him god didn't
30:25
allow him to be killed
30:26
that mean he had a time for him to take
30:29
adam when
30:29
and not adam when cain died that he went
30:32
to abraham's bosom so yes
30:34
he did repent unlike judas who never
30:37
repented judas is in hell
30:39
completely and nicodemus i'm almost
30:42
probably pretty certain that he's so
30:44
was passionate about god himself about
30:48
him
30:49
he most likely is in heaven so the only
30:51
ones i'm pretty sure are not are in
30:53
ice and sapphira who lied that was that
30:56
was life blasting
30:57
the holy spirit really rejecting
30:59
knowingly
31:00
knowing the truth and lying to the face
31:03
of the
31:04
those who are in authority lied to them
31:06
that was not a good thing to do
31:08
on on god said never is a good thing to
31:10
do but back then
31:12
it was like they they were not in heaven
31:15
i'm not seeing them in him i've
31:16
seen adam and eve in heaven for sure
31:21
yeah that that reminds me pull it up um
31:24
i may have to come back to it
31:26
someone wrote me a question this morning
31:27
i'm not sure which one of my notes but
31:29
they said if somebody's saved
31:31
and then towards the end of their life
31:33
they got into idol worship
31:35
um and then they they didn't give the
31:38
conclusion
31:39
they said at the end of the life they
31:40
started worshiping idols it must be a
31:41
personal
31:42
thing are they lost forever is there
31:44
some chance that that person
31:46
that accepted christ will still make it
31:48
but they've lost rewards what what could
31:50
you say about that
31:51
i would have more details of the
31:53
question i would say i'm not god
31:55
right well none of us are god and that
31:57
only god knows the heart of a person
32:00
and uh so there's no explanation about
32:03
how did they get pulled into that how
32:05
deep was that
32:06
was that our artificial thing was that
32:08
that was like was that could it be in
32:10
any kind of idol was that like money or
32:13
gold or was that like
32:15
in um like idol worship as far as um
32:18
um you know
32:23
yeah so i would say if they're a
32:25
believer and we're pulled off the track
32:28
for that but never denied jesus christ
32:32
i would say there's definitely still a
32:33
really good chance that they're in
32:34
heaven
32:35
because at that time of their death
32:37
christ would probably
32:39
meet with them if they had a christian
32:41
family
32:42
or close close christian friends praying
32:44
for them that absolutely gave
32:46
but i can't say there's so many
32:49
different ways that it could be idol
32:51
worship okay
32:52
if it was just like idolized if it's
32:55
idolizing
32:56
things like material things that doesn't
32:59
send you to hell just means you're going
33:01
to be a weak christian so there's a lot
33:02
of
33:03
um leeway and all of that but i would
33:06
say
33:06
god this is what he says if i got you if
33:09
you became
33:10
born again i have a hook in you okay he
33:12
puts a hook in you
33:14
that christ will pursue that even up
33:16
until
33:17
the time that you die he's going to
33:19
pursue that because there's those words
33:21
you spoke yourself receiving him it says
33:24
he's married to the backslider so i can
33:26
just keep giving you scripture all day
33:28
long
33:28
he desires that none should perish and
33:31
if you already gave that declaration
33:32
that is a
33:33
powerful powerful thing when you receive
33:35
christ
33:36
he doesn't just wipe you off the books
33:38
because you fall once or twice you get
33:40
caught
33:40
into something that's different than
33:42
giving your whole life and signing a
33:44
satanic agreement with satan
33:47
wow yeah by the way back on the
33:51
anonymous sapphire thing
33:52
let me let me drill down just a bit on
33:54
that i've got this question swirly in my
33:56
brain
33:57
uh we see it as a momentary event
34:00
where where almost as if a few minutes
34:04
before he they decided to talk they did
34:05
they they decided to lie
34:08
do you see ananias and sapphira as half
34:12
having a really character and honesty
34:15
flaw that was working in them for quite
34:17
a while for them to be able to do this
34:19
in other words
34:20
they didn't make a momentary decision
34:22
and spending eternity in hell for that
34:24
or
34:25
were they really pretenders all along do
34:28
you have any other insights on
34:30
i think that is long-standing sin
34:34
i would have to say that was probably
34:36
something that they had been
34:37
um involved in for some time
34:41
that i think they already had um
34:44
made their decision before they were
34:46
asked that even though and they do this
34:48
definitely and they said the same thing
34:50
they both had a chance to say
34:52
separately uh here wrong we've done this
34:55
neither one of them did it we showed you
34:57
that right there there was coercion they
34:59
did it
34:59
they made an agreement this is what
35:01
we're going to say infrastructure we're
35:03
not backing off with this this is what
35:05
we're saying even though it's a lie
35:07
and i have to say that's exactly what
35:09
happened because otherwise
35:10
one of them could have been moved if
35:12
they weren't together
35:13
they had an opportunity to say no we
35:15
lied about it we lied we should have
35:17
told the truth
35:18
they could have at either time having
35:20
done this separately
35:22
had the freedom to say we're lying
35:25
and we're cheating god and they didn't
35:27
do it
35:29
they cheated they lied
35:33
so that was already working in their
35:35
home
35:37
an agreement it makes sense that it was
35:42
yeah because you'd have to get to a
35:43
point in your life where you're willing
35:44
to take that chance
35:45
that i must have kept blessing you no
35:47
matter what you did so you thought you
35:49
could get away with it
35:50
this was inspiring yeah it says okay um
35:53
now
35:54
people will look at cat with pink hair
35:56
multiple visions
35:57
and trips to heaven and they think every
36:00
single prayer gets
36:01
answered for you right away so here's
36:03
the question does cat have
36:04
all or most of her prayers answered
36:06
instantly does she have any prayers that
36:09
are still in process of being answered
36:11
what is the longest prayer she has ever
36:13
prayed and still waiting for the answer
36:17
i have to say the longest one that i
36:19
stood
36:20
and i would have to say i didn't keep
36:21
saying it
36:23
i don't i don't once i ask god something
36:26
if i even
36:26
ask him it's almost never that i ask him
36:30
for something
36:31
not for me it's usually for others that
36:34
i stand in the gap for
36:35
and i would have to say i knew that i
36:38
knew my family was called to do
36:40
something
36:41
and i was probably 14 years old um
36:44
maybe younger than that and my own dad
36:48
my my physical dad had conversations
36:50
with me about our family and what would
36:51
be called
36:52
into and there'd be signs that would
36:53
begin to happen and we would see those
36:55
signs
36:56
and so we my dad and i prayed together
36:58
about this we actually stood in the
37:00
mountains somewhere and like
37:01
this it was very powerful declaration
37:04
and prayer and agreement
37:06
i never dropped it even when my dad went
37:08
to heaven that didn't change anything
37:09
that we were standing for i was standing
37:10
for his intergenerational thing
37:12
and that was probably close to 40 some
37:14
years and it and it happened it began to
37:16
happen the same signs he said what
37:18
happened would happen
37:19
and i rejoice in sin so that declaration
37:23
and decree and agreement that agreement
37:25
has already happened
37:26
so i don't usually ask god just brings
37:29
stuff to me all the time and it's like
37:31
literally i hear him every day and yes
37:33
that's because i have a commission
37:34
that doesn't mean you can't hear him
37:36
every day if you pursue him for that
37:38
but he actually came from heaven and
37:39
said i'm giving you a commission to be
37:41
taken to heaven when i feel like it
37:43
that's god
37:44
to show you things to reveal on the
37:46
earth i'm going to show you things to
37:47
come i'm going to take you to the past
37:48
and show you things how they happen
37:50
and giving you revelation on the word of
37:52
god and it was for one reason that they
37:54
would know him and know that heaven was
37:56
real
37:56
so i don't have a lot of things i
37:59
personally even
38:00
asked for myself because i'm living
38:04
in what his plan is and this is a thing
38:06
i haven't backed up
38:08
i'm not going to back up i won't change
38:10
what he's saying to me
38:11
i'm allowed to say what he says and i'm
38:14
allowed to tell you what he
38:15
showed me so i don't have the mix of man
38:18
in me i don't have man's plans man's
38:21
thoughts man's assumptions
38:22
and i don't listen to most anything out
38:24
there i listen to him
38:26
and and that's good to have a time to
38:29
give to him
38:30
and even though people say stuff if it
38:32
comes against what he said to you
38:33
i would not receive it if it's against
38:36
what god himself said to you and that's
38:37
where a lot of people think well all
38:39
these other people are believing this
38:40
maybe i should believe that no
38:42
you believe what god said to you so most
38:45
of my prayers like i've stood for over
38:46
40 some years for that to happen
38:48
never failing to thank him for it which
38:51
is the key
38:52
he told me god confirmed it that this
38:55
was going to happen
38:56
and i've only thanked him all those
38:58
years for the promise he gave to us
39:03
what that's going to do so let me ask
39:05
you this is me adding to the question
39:07
so there must be four or five people you
39:10
could
39:10
you could think of
39:16
who you have asked god for their
39:18
salvation
39:22
would that be true people that you stood
39:25
for they've asked for their salvation
39:27
but you see nothing happen
39:31
i don't know about that because i see
39:34
the spirit of god
39:36
look around the person drawing them and
39:38
pulling them
39:39
i have to say it wasn't very long if it
39:41
was somebody
39:42
i personally knew that i stood for it
39:45
wasn't very long before they came to
39:46
christ
39:47
and most of these people probably
39:49
belonged to him and were beginning to
39:51
wander
39:52
and i would send the host of podenon
39:54
strongholds of satan trying to influence
39:55
that people was the worst thing i did
39:57
to stop the enemy from continuing to
39:59
speak to them there's so many things we
40:01
have the right as a believer to do
40:03
so those things were pulled down that
40:05
left them open to hear the spirit of god
40:08
the body of christ needs to know you
40:10
need to know who you are and just
40:12
using the word what it says about your
40:14
word you speak
40:16
but then you can't use the same words to
40:18
you can't bless and curse okay i
40:20
bless i choose not to curse you bless
40:23
them don't
40:24
curse them because then you're powerful
40:26
the more your words are pure when you
40:28
speak
40:29
the more things the quickly the more
40:30
quicker things happen
40:32
so i can't equate myself and he won't
40:35
let me
40:36
line myself up with how he does with
40:37
other people because i live
40:39
a different kind of life myself but i
40:42
always tell people
40:43
never give up that is the thing don't
40:45
step back
40:46
don't get caught in fear don't get
40:49
caught in deception
40:51
because there's a lot of deception going
40:52
on right now make sure you're staying
40:54
true to what god said
40:55
read his word meditate and you know what
40:58
that means
40:58
ask him a question if you see something
41:00
just outwardly say
41:02
i would like to know what that means and
41:04
i can tell you whatever i said
41:06
that to him he would always give me
41:08
revelation it might be a
41:10
maybe a couple days later or i would
41:12
actually hear someone
41:13
say the very thing i had asked god not
41:15
knowing
41:16
and they would say this is what i
41:18
believe it is i would say to me that's
41:20
the answer
41:21
so it's it's keeping your own ears open
41:24
by not playing darkness is the biggest
41:27
thing you cannot play with darkness you
41:28
can't play in the camp of the enemy
41:30
and expect to hear clearly in your life
41:33
and the other thing is if you have fear
41:35
which the enemy uses again you kick fear
41:37
all i don't care if you have to do it
41:38
all day kick
41:39
fear out of your soul get out of your
41:41
house because that
41:43
what happens is it begins to stop you
41:45
from hearing clearly
41:47
but i can't line myself up he won't let
41:49
me say well you're doing this but
41:50
they're not or they're not able to do
41:52
this because you can do it
41:53
uh whatever he gives me to do the number
41:56
two thing i would say is keep your
41:57
hearing open is to obey
42:00
obey what god is saying i have to live
42:03
i live in life you just
42:06
absolutely now you just intrigued me by
42:09
because uh
42:10
again i've known you for seven years i
42:12
know you as the probably the
42:14
most obedient person i know and you've
42:17
been caught up to heaven thousands of
42:18
times
42:19
and he walks through your
42:23
wall a day or two and then give it
42:27
to you through someone else's voice
42:29
who's just talking that's what you just
42:31
said is that
42:32
is that right it is right because
42:36
it's usually somebody that i know and i
42:38
think god
42:39
is showing me uh anyone can
42:42
hear if you ask it sincerely and you ask
42:45
him
42:46
in believing that he's going to reveal
42:48
this is about the word of god mostly
42:50
that i'll say why did this happen i
42:52
wonder why that happened i'm not even
42:54
necessarily saying that him i'm just
42:55
saying it
42:57
and then maybe a couple days later gem
42:58
will say well i believe this and this
43:00
was it
43:01
this i think this is how this happened
43:02
her not knowing that i even said that
43:04
out loud
43:05
and so but many times he'll use the
43:07
people close to you if there's strong
43:09
christians he'll
43:10
because maybe he's saying that to them
43:12
at the same time
43:14
but but mostly he just speaks to me and
43:16
most of the stuff
43:17
that i get is what he says to me just
43:20
like he was speaking to me this morning
43:22
when i woke up
43:23
he was speaking to me last night when i
43:25
went to bed and he was speaking to me
43:26
for several hours yesterday
43:28
it's a lifestyle
43:34
interesting okay this questions i've
43:36
heard this before so i i
43:38
think i know your answer but on on the
43:42
on this earth created actual wine jesus
43:45
drank
43:46
actual wine in heaven is their wine and
43:49
if so what is it like
43:51
sorry i'm going to interrupt really
43:52
quick steve you're cutting out
43:54
everything you're going to
43:55
keep freezing here a little bit yeah
43:57
let's see jeff are you coming in
43:59
yeah so steve i'm going to keep it so
44:02
yeah i'm going to kick you out really
44:03
quickly
44:06
yeah you're breaking up and freezing
44:09
right but okay i'll come back here
44:11
okay here we go cat go ahead and just
44:13
answer that question is there wine in
44:15
heaven
44:16
oh there's wine in heaven but there's no
44:20
alcohol people
44:21
because nothing can decay you know they
44:24
use that whole process
44:25
i believe i don't i don't drink myself
44:27
but the wine christ
44:29
drank was heaven's wine at the wedding
44:33
when he made the water into wine that
44:35
wasn't earth's wine that was heaven's
44:37
wine when he spoke it was the first
44:39
miracle he did
44:40
was at a wedding and mary knew he could
44:43
do it because guess what he did it in
44:45
their home
44:45
he made their water into wine heaven's
44:47
wine all the time
44:49
and in the bible when the people got the
44:50
wine in the web and he said
44:52
normally they give the best one the
44:54
beginning of the wedding that's what the
44:55
guy who was
44:56
having the one thing sad to jesus and he
44:58
said but you have given the best
45:01
at the end and usually they gave the
45:03
worst wine they had but this one is the
45:04
best we've ever had
45:06
the reason for that is what jesus made
45:08
was heaven's wine
45:10
and it was being drunk on earth for the
45:12
first time so jesus every time he took a
45:14
cup
45:15
didn't matter where he was he would just
45:17
release into it and it would turn it
45:19
into heaven's wine
45:22
but there's wine in heaven yes it's
45:23
filled with the holy spirit
45:27
okay now jeff my eye because
45:30
since that was me i can't tell i see on
45:33
my screen
45:34
so oh uh can you hear me all right cat
45:38
oh i can hear you fine yeah there's a
45:40
little delay
45:44
on your end steve
45:50
did everybody hear the answer to the
45:51
question i think everybody heard
45:54
and here comes joe i don't see anybody's
45:56
video but
45:57
okay what's going on um
46:02
steve i think it's it's on your end
46:04
there's a little bit of a
46:06
so this is what we're gonna do i got a
46:07
couple of questions picked out
46:09
as well so steve if you want
46:12
is there a way you can reset your router
46:16
i just did before the show okay i i did
46:20
a whole
46:20
cold woo yeah so what if i try to get
46:28
on my hot spot yeah go ahead and try
46:31
that
46:32
yeah yes
46:35
okay let me try and get in my iphone
46:38
okay
46:39
okay so i'm gonna kick him out cat
46:43
i'm gonna ask a question okay i am a
46:46
huge
46:47
superman fan like massive okay and yes i
46:50
know people everybody's saying i look
46:51
like clark can i don't do it on purpose
46:54
i just do and i have to wear glasses i'm
46:56
sorry
46:57
i'm not apologizing for it i don't
46:59
apologize okay
47:00
so my question is i've heard you say
47:03
this before
47:04
touch on this i'm going to ask
47:07
can you fly in heaven yes
47:14
you can fly you can fly in heaven number
47:16
one why wouldn't you
47:18
which is what the holy spirit says to me
47:19
all the time why wouldn't you fly
47:21
i mean it's the place of creation
47:24
it's the life and the power of god is
47:26
everywhere if plants can sing
47:29
if you can travel on light in heaven if
47:32
you can speak and create
47:33
food and it's on a tray in front of you
47:36
why wouldn't you be able to fly
47:38
and there is a park there's an amusement
47:40
park i was taken to that
47:41
have evidence that i was taken to that
47:43
in my book one
47:45
it really exists they have a place
47:47
called flyby that's one of the amusement
47:49
things in heaven in their park
47:51
and you get taught to fly there and your
47:54
friends who are in heaven will come to
47:56
watch you learn to fly
47:58
because it is hilarious you're not
48:00
really good in the beginning you're like
48:02
spinning through the air i mean you
48:04
actually have places for them to sit and
48:05
watch
48:06
you learn but the the point is this
48:08
christopher reeves who
48:10
made it to heaven it's what he gets to
48:13
do
48:14
in heaven and i hope i just bashed a
48:16
bunch of liberal uh
48:17
not liberal but judgmental people keep
48:19
it to yourself you'll find out when you
48:21
go though you'll be standing in line
48:22
with everyone else
48:23
waiting to learn
48:29
that sounds amazing what about super
48:31
strength can you like lift
48:33
super heavy things well you know nothing
48:35
really weighs much in heaven it's made
48:37
out of light but it is substantial like
48:40
the walls of your mansion and heaven
48:41
don't try to run through them
48:43
a portal would open you would run
48:45
through the portal and the wall of your
48:46
mansion but it's a real place in your
48:49
spiritual body in the spiritual world
48:51
you feel the ground you're walking on
48:53
you feel the food that you're eating it
48:55
and so i would imagine since this is one
48:58
of the best things i've talked about
49:00
very little they actually have the angel
49:02
games
49:03
not kidding at all they actually have
49:06
what we call the olympics they call the
49:08
angel games in heaven
49:10
and the army of heaven put them on on a
49:12
regular basis when they come back from a
49:14
lot of
49:15
warring they get to do the angel games
49:17
and show how good they are the different
49:19
supernatural things they do so you'll
49:21
probably be there watching that
49:22
yeah oh yeah steve
49:25
steve hello
49:34
a little bit
49:50
people get to witness any you know
49:52
children
49:53
leaving did you say
49:57
aliens
50:01
did you hear what you said i did not i
50:04
didn't hear what he said
50:06
steve okay i'm going to try one
50:09
placement i'm going to try
50:19
[Music]
50:21
he sounds like a computer yeah you sound
50:24
like your
50:24
part computer steve
50:30
now i think he may have said have i been
50:32
present when people
50:34
went went to heaven from earth he may
50:37
have said that i'm not sure can you hear
50:38
me steve
50:41
yeah he's like completely frozen why
50:43
don't you just answer that
50:44
have you seen that i can and just
50:47
recently did actually
50:49
that happens several ways if i am
50:51
present and somebody passes uh i've been
50:54
present
50:55
several times sometimes family members
50:57
sometimes friends
50:59
one of the most recent ones is my
51:00
husband's best friend who he spent
51:02
time with a lot right before he passed
51:04
and we were actually in
51:06
um uh we were in icu in his room
51:10
and the guy who was there to watch over
51:12
him until he passed was undone that we
51:14
came in to see him i came right from an
51:16
event
51:17
from the airport to see him because the
51:18
holy spirit said he's not going to be
51:19
there long
51:22
so we go in his room and i began to call
51:24
our daughters who
51:26
he's he loved our daughters very much as
51:27
my husband best friend
51:29
and they got to say goodbye to him i
51:31
held the phone up to his ear and they
51:32
each got to say goodbye
51:34
and after the second one did that i told
51:36
this um
51:37
the intern who was in his room i said
51:39
he's going to go really quick and he
51:40
said oh he's going to last all night i
51:42
said no he's not
51:43
his own angels are pacing back and forth
51:45
and i said
51:46
that means the other angels are going to
51:48
come because they all go
51:50
together when they leave and i said
51:51
they'll rush in the room and take them
51:53
with this guy's eyes just kept getting
51:54
bigger and bigger whenever i would talk
51:56
about
51:57
you know that type of thing and i said
51:59
my last daughter we got a hold of her
52:01
and she got to say goodbye to him on the
52:03
phone and when we
52:04
when we hung up our cell phone these
52:07
eight angels
52:08
raced in the room and i told the guy the
52:10
angels have raced in the room
52:12
here right now he was watching his
52:14
screen you know his screen that says his
52:16
heartbeat is still going
52:18
and they took him and his angel they all
52:20
went out to the ceiling
52:21
took his spiritual body and left and all
52:23
of a sudden that goes
52:27
and that guy goes i can't believe this
52:29
he was so shocked when he said
52:31
he checked he said he is gone i went
52:33
yeah i told you they came to take him so
52:36
that's what usually happens
52:40
so it was quite got it quite like the
52:42
guy the guy really got undone that
52:44
that god actually does that so
52:46
absolutely powerful steve hi
52:49
hi if you can hear me i'll try and do
52:51
that one question again and if i go out
52:53
again i'll just have you wrap things up
52:55
jeff if i go out again but
52:57
uh the question that i had that this
52:59
person had is
53:00
with the with uh all the children that
53:03
the lord sends to the earth the father
53:05
says are in
53:06
him literally he sends them to the earth
53:09
throughout our calendar day if you will
53:11
this person wants to know
53:13
anyone in heaven see this activity of
53:15
him sending children do they see
53:17
children go going anything like that
53:22
well they may see them leaving him but
53:24
the way that actually happens is still
53:27
his holy spirit who's involved in the
53:28
holy spirit
53:30
takes a little spirit of life some can
53:32
be very tiny and if you can see my
53:34
fingers or not they can be this small
53:36
they're different sizes we're different
53:39
sizes here
53:40
it's their spiritual body and what
53:42
happens is at the time of conception
53:45
the father releases into his hand that
53:48
little spirit of life the holy spirit
53:49
takes that
53:50
goes down to the earth into the womb of
53:52
the mother
53:54
into her and at the very time of
53:56
conception
53:57
the holy spirit knits and attaches that
54:00
little spirit of life to that
54:02
dot of flesh that's exactly there's a
54:04
flash of light when that happens because
54:07
your little spirit means made out of
54:09
light so when he attaches it literally
54:11
to that
54:12
inside the mother there's a flash of
54:14
light and that little spirit of life at
54:16
that time
54:17
begins to grow in the womb of its mother
54:20
and i tell people i said that for years
54:22
and all of a sudden in
54:24
science they actually discovered
54:26
themselves
54:27
that at the time of conception and they
54:29
can't explain it they actually announced
54:32
we know now that life begins at
54:34
conception because at the time of
54:36
conception when it
54:37
literally takes place there's a flash of
54:39
light and we don't know what that is
54:41
it's that little spirit of life of that
54:44
person
54:44
that baby being attached at that very
54:46
moment on the earth
54:50
so i think people in heaven already know
54:52
that's going to happen if they're
54:53
believing
54:54
and they're watching their family
54:55
members praying god i i would we would
54:57
like to have a child my husband ivan
54:59
that happened a lot
55:01
and so they may go before the zone and
55:02
say father are you going to send them
55:04
a baby are you going to send them one
55:06
and sometimes he'll answer them he may
55:08
say
55:08
it may be a year or earth year go by or
55:11
whatever but yes that is my desire to
55:13
send one to them to raise up to become
55:16
somebody for him so yeah they kind of
55:19
know people
55:20
in heaven already know that this is
55:22
going to happen on the earth
55:23
but as far as being present i don't
55:25
think that happens
55:26
unless they see when the little one
55:28
steps out in his hand
55:30
because i remember myself being in the
55:32
hand of god
55:33
and him speaking to me
55:36
and every now and then somebody will
55:38
tell me years ago i had these dreams
55:41
of me sitting in the hand of god as a
55:42
little tiny
55:44
being is that true does that happen and
55:46
i'm always surprised and go yes that's
55:48
exactly what happens when god would
55:50
speak to you about your future
55:52
and he'd hold you there in his hand or
55:53
he'd sing he'd sing
55:55
a song to you he has his own songs he
55:57
sings to us so
55:59
it is a big event in heaven when he
56:01
sends them from himself to the earth
56:10
oh i can't hear you you can hear me now
56:13
probably
56:14
you know yeah i didn't switch it on um
56:16
steve dropped out but i'm going to ask a
56:18
couple more questions just because i
56:19
have them here
56:20
and i think they're really really good
56:22
okay so uh one person
56:24
asked if you could explain the scripture
56:27
from matthew chapter 7 verses 22
56:30
and 23 and it says many will say to me
56:32
in that day lord lord have we not
56:34
prophesied in your name cast out demons
56:36
in your name
56:36
done many wonders in your name and then
56:38
i will declare to them i never knew you
56:40
depart from me
56:41
you who practice lawlessness so the
56:43
person's question is
56:44
how can people walk in these miracles if
56:46
they don't know jesus
56:48
because number one it's a gift
56:52
uh just like anybody who's high up in
56:54
the fifo ministry
56:56
they they may enter into i'm not
56:58
pointing fingers at anybody
57:00
i know i'm just saying let's say
57:01
somebody's high up in the ministry
57:03
five-fold
57:04
they enter into a secret life of sin
57:07
and they keep that sin and they think
57:10
they're allowed to do it because their
57:12
gift is so great well that's not even
57:15
that's not
57:15
god's not going to say that but when he
57:18
gives us a gift
57:19
if he gives you a gift let's say of
57:21
healing a gift of prosperity a gift of
57:25
truth and hope a gift of evangelism
57:28
and he puts that gift in you he won't
57:30
stop that gift from operating
57:32
he will not stop that gift he says that
57:34
the irrevocable
57:35
he won't take it away from you so that
57:37
gift will keep right on operating and
57:39
they may even be doing
57:40
worse than just sinning they could be
57:42
doing really horrific things and not
57:44
telling anybody guess what god knows it
57:46
all
57:47
and that's why some will get up there
57:48
and he'll say depart from me i never
57:50
knew you because they didn't really make
57:52
a heart to heart conversion number one
57:55
they took use and abuse of the gift
57:58
the gift of influence the gift of other
58:00
things the gift won't stop working and
58:03
that's why i tell people
58:04
don't follow somebody because they have
58:06
great gifts
58:08
it doesn't say you'll know the people by
58:10
their gifts it says you will know them
58:11
by their fruit
58:13
yeah so if there's people out there and
58:15
they're they're
58:16
sleeping with everybody anywhere they
58:18
feel like it because they they think
58:20
that they have the right to they're so
58:22
powerful in their gift and they'll even
58:24
tell people if they're caught they say
58:25
well mike i'm so
58:27
far above everybody my gift wouldn't
58:29
work
58:31
my gift would stop working if god
58:33
thought i was wrong that's not true
58:34
either because even lucifer had a gift
58:37
he had a gift to influence he had a gift
58:39
to uh to
58:40
be involved in worship and we all know
58:42
how some satanic worship is or even that
58:45
how that still
58:46
influenced in the darkness he didn't
58:48
take that gift away so people can
58:50
operate in their gift and they'd be very
58:53
accurate
58:54
but if they're lying cheating stealing
58:57
committing of gross crimes that god
59:00
speaks about in the bible
59:01
they're in trouble with god and i would
59:04
not follow somebody if i knew that
59:06
if i knew they were picking people up
59:08
literally and they do sometimes to sleep
59:10
with
59:10
during their meetings and it does happen
59:14
you dump that person you don't listen to
59:16
that person now make sure this is a true
59:19
uh and accurate don't don't don't pick
59:21
up people and say well i think they're
59:23
bad
59:24
it's going to be found out anyway so i
59:26
would say make sure you look at the
59:28
fruit of the people
59:29
are they operating in in holiness are
59:32
there
59:32
they have their lives that they're
59:33
accountable are they loving their family
59:36
are they living according to the word of
59:37
god
59:38
they can't step outside god's guidelines
59:41
where this is sin
59:42
sin is sin when you sin you're
59:44
unrighteous
59:45
okay but that gift that's why the world
59:48
has gifts that are powerful they don't
59:50
know god
59:51
they have a gift to influence have a
59:52
gift in music they have a
59:54
gift and all kinds of things but if what
59:57
they're doing with that gift is evil
59:59
that doesn't make them okay to listen to
60:01
or watch
60:02
yeah and i think also this is something
60:04
i'm sure you've seen
60:05
heard this a lot too this scripture
60:07
specifically i've seen
60:09
the enemy kind of try to twist it where
60:11
people
60:12
almost become afraid they're like what
60:14
if i serve god
60:15
my whole life you know i follow the
60:17
scriptures i serve him faithfully and
60:19
all of a sudden he just says
60:20
depart from me i never knew you and it's
60:22
something that you know when i was in
60:23
missions i did a lot of like mission
60:25
schools raising up
60:26
youth yeah that was something i was very
60:28
adamant i was like that is a lie
60:31
a lie from the pit of hell it is yeah
60:34
it is a lie because if you're doing if
60:37
you're doing the work of god
60:39
the enemy will try to the enemy try to
60:41
bash you
60:42
and lie to you the whole time if you
60:45
know that you love jesus christ you know
60:47
you're doing what he has called us to do
60:49
to bring the truth to give the message
60:51
of the kingdom to influence people to
60:53
know christ
60:54
and you're helping them feeding them and
60:56
you're in the trenches doing stuff for
60:58
god
60:58
you know what you're going to know
60:59
you're going to get greatly rewarded in
61:02
heaven you will have rewards
61:04
that scripture has nothing to do with
61:06
those who know that they're
61:08
for christ and with christ that
61:10
scripture is about those who are living
61:12
their life
61:12
any way they want to and they think
61:14
because they have a gift
61:16
and god isn't saying anything he doesn't
61:19
care and there's been great people at
61:20
that
61:21
there's been people that's happened to
61:22
you and probably only the mercy of god
61:25
maybe somebody at the last moment before
61:27
they died
61:28
got them to give their christ their life
61:30
back to christ and repent for that stuff
61:32
but he's not talking that scripture is
61:34
not about people who know that they
61:36
belong to christ if you receive jesus
61:38
christ as your savior
61:39
and you know in your heart that's true
61:42
and you're following
61:43
the course he put you on then you you
61:46
are going to have a great time in heaven
61:50
he will not take your name or the lame's
61:52
book of life okay that doesn't happen
61:54
even that doesn't happen that easy
61:57
he wants you to know that he's proud of
61:59
you he is
62:00
blessed by your life you have well
62:02
pleased him that you're reaching out to
62:04
others sometimes when you have need
62:06
yourself the greatest thing to do is
62:07
reach out to help others
62:09
now the one thing is not your job to do
62:11
is you can't go
62:12
make somebody receive christ you share
62:14
the truth
62:15
you let them make that decision then you
62:17
go on to those who
62:19
who are reaching out back to you but
62:21
your words are like seeds in the heart
62:23
of that person
62:24
so that would not be you people who
62:26
think they've committed the
62:27
um pardonable sin have never committed
62:29
the impartial sin
62:31
people who commit the unpardonable sin
62:33
don't care that they've done it okay
62:35
they don't care they hate god they hate
62:36
what he has planned
62:38
if you're concerned about that you
62:40
definitely have not done that
62:42
but if you're out there doing things for
62:43
god especially
62:46
like in the mission field that god has
62:48
so
62:49
loved people and some of the most highly
62:52
honored people in heaven are
62:53
intercessors and those who are in
62:55
missions
62:56
amen okay so on that this is a great
62:59
question
63:00
the final question that segways from
63:02
this one
63:03
and it's um basically it's uh
63:06
can you share about the crowns will
63:08
receive in heaven what do they look like
63:10
and are they different or bigger
63:12
depending on our rewards
63:14
they're different they're very different
63:16
from each other and actually every
63:18
believer
63:19
in somewhere in your mountain you might
63:21
mention you have a crown
63:23
room you literally have a room that is
63:26
so
63:26
beautiful and light just shoots out of
63:29
i've been several people's
63:31
uh in their crown rooms in heaven i've
63:33
seen their crown rooms
63:34
and there's these beautiful like pillows
63:37
and things that are very ornamented by
63:39
the by gemstones from god himself he
63:41
designs these things
63:43
and they place those crowns on them
63:45
certain certain of those crowns you get
63:47
to wear in heaven when you get there
63:49
when it says we will throw our crowns at
63:51
his feet that's something that will
63:52
happen at one time with
63:53
all of us there but you can actually
63:56
wear some of those crowns like the crown
63:58
of life the soul winners crowns they're
64:00
all different from each other they're
64:01
not
64:02
they're not alike at all that's amazing
64:05
so cool i can't i can't wait to see them
64:08
you know it's interesting one just a
64:10
side comment i was thinking about i'm
64:12
i've i'm somebody who's been blessed
64:14
with a very big
64:15
imagination and there are times you know
64:18
i
64:19
i'm i doubt dabble in filmmaking and all
64:22
kinds of stuff
64:23
but there are some things that come to
64:25
my mind
64:26
that i do not know how to describe in
64:29
words like i'm like i've never seen this
64:31
before
64:31
i don't even know how i would
64:32
materialize this in the world and part
64:35
of me is wondering and like
64:36
there's specific things where i'm like
64:37
i'm wondering if god is showing me
64:39
glimpses
64:40
of certain things like you know almost
64:42
one-upping me he's like yeah you think
64:44
that was cool he's like check this out
64:46
you're going to see this in heaven you
64:47
know
64:49
he is definitely right now doing that
64:51
and in the past when people would get
64:52
though that they were afr
64:54
they were not i don't want to say fear
64:55
fear but they were hesitant to share it
64:58
with others
64:58
like paul wouldn't do it in the bible
65:00
okay paul's like i'm not even going to
65:02
try to tell people what this is like
65:04
but in these days of greater creativity
65:06
and invention
65:07
some of the things you see may be things
65:09
that actually begin to happen
65:11
on the earth this is what i have always
65:13
told people get a journal
65:15
please people get a journal just go get
65:18
you a little journal it doesn't have to
65:19
be anything fancy
65:21
and write down what you saw if you can
65:23
if you can
65:24
draw it draw it if you know what it does
65:27
write what it does and then date it and
65:29
don't get rid of that
65:30
that might be something god's going to
65:32
send to the earth and then he may give
65:34
you more about that thing he's done that
65:36
with me
65:36
many times and i do know there's greater
65:39
inventions
65:40
light is going to be used in many
65:41
different ways it's going to be used to
65:43
color our hair it's going to be used to
65:44
paint on this
65:45
i should have done that or i should have
65:47
presented it the thing that will happen
65:49
once this whole shift happens and the
65:51
darkness is like
65:52
wiped and pushed back and creativity
65:55
invention will explode
65:56
god's got things he's waiting to release
65:58
until this whole thing is dealt with the
66:00
justice comes
66:01
why would he end things if he's bringing
66:03
some of the greatest things ever he's
66:04
not gonna let the evil have it okay
66:06
but he will give it to the most
66:08
unexpected people
66:10
maybe you're not a professor maybe
66:12
you're not even good like an electronics
66:14
or
66:14
a mechanic or something that won't stop
66:17
god from giving you something so make
66:18
sure you get a journal
66:20
i've got many of them i'll draw it i'll
66:23
draw it
66:23
you know and write down if you have an
66:25
ipad or something you can do that on
66:27
i'm old school so i've got tons of
66:30
journals
66:30
like that i've saved over the years of
66:33
things i saw in heaven or things i knew
66:34
would be on the earth
66:35
this is exciting time if you're young
66:38
you have one of the best
66:39
futures of people who've ever been on
66:41
the earth because of the great things
66:43
that will be happening and being
66:44
invented

66:47
key thing about light and i think that's

03:07
actually online just a little bit over a
03:09
year tens of thousands of people that
03:11
you know many
03:12
most are probably believers or
03:13
conservatives it is open to everybody

04:08
on both your devices your iphone and
04:11
your
04:12
uh the other one the galaxy i can't
04:14
think of the name
04:15
all of a sudden but yeah on those other
04:17
ones all right
04:18
uh i think that's good for now i will
04:21
remind people before we bring cat on
04:23
that
04:23
uh tomorrow is ivana tia and then on
04:26
friday we have the canadian prophet
04:27
barry wench
04:28
if i'm saying that right we'll ask him
04:30
how to pronounce that so
04:31
looking forward to it um
04:34
okay i see one question there all right
04:36
well hey without further ado let's bring
04:37
cat curry in
04:39
there she is hey cat hey
04:43
good to see you good to see you today um
04:46
um
04:46
how's everything oh everything's great
04:53
you look like you're particularly
04:57
and the lights are because you know we
04:58
keep moving them around so i'm not sure
05:02
where to hold my head i forget they've
05:03
already got the camera like we're
05:05
supposed to be because i feel like if
05:07
i'm not right in front of it then
05:08
it's all messed up but that's why i'm
05:10
not a tech person okay
05:15
had knowledge no head knowledge wanted
05:17
okay i just got lots of revelation
05:20
i'm a detailed person but you're not
05:21
detail in the tech area
05:23
so it will show us your uh little it
05:26
looks like almost like a scrabble
05:28
pieces there i see the 28 is there a
05:31
four
05:31
that's 420 you're going to turn it a
05:33
little bit because the shine
05:34
the light's shining off of it funny this
05:37
is our clever
05:38
way to keep people from copying over our
05:40
stuff
05:41
it's just april 43 yeah definitely being
05:43
the 28th
05:44
the 8th the 40s
05:49
yeah we we do a lot of this we bought
05:51
you know someone wrote to us this
05:52
morning that
05:52
they someone else was copying us on
05:54
another channel so we thought we tried
05:55
to keep our own content
05:57
as those cats so yeah 28
06:00
2021 people that's april 28th
06:03
2021 yeah i'll have to say that again in
06:06
the middle somewhere
06:08
yeah it's it's unfortunate how many
06:10
people will try and and
06:11
it's basically theft of content and then
06:13
they try and make money off of them so
06:14
that's unfortunate yeah
06:16
well listen um let's jump into anything
06:18
you might have to say government-wise
06:21
and then we've got lots of questions
06:22
about heaven so
06:24
i'll throw the floor to you i have to
06:27
start with a comment about
06:30
another extremely unintelligent
06:34
um desire of the bee person
06:39
to go ahead which i can't even believe
06:41
they did this you all
06:42
by now know the green plan that was
06:44
given by you know who
06:46
about the cows and whatever else it was
06:48
about
06:49
to eliminate the cows oh i know and
06:51
travel and stuff
06:52
these are just craziness from people who
06:55
don't really know what they're saying
06:57
but they can't get rid of that stigma on
06:59
them
07:00
the left so therefore they've made a
07:03
whole new thing they're going to put out
07:04
there
07:05
that uh they're going to go ahead with
07:07
the less cows thing that was actually
07:09
given at the beginning i think they only
07:10
hurt their self and they make a really
07:13
unintelligent regulations like that
07:15
because now they're trying to limit
07:17
every american to one hamburger a month
07:22
right yes they don't know they're in
07:23
america right
07:25
because we love hamburgers and uh
07:28
that's just not gonna work i'd like to
07:30
know how they're gonna go to the
07:32
all the millions of people they're gonna
07:34
run by everybody's house or a restaurant
07:36
and see how many hamburgers do the
07:37
restaurants have to eat
07:39
well they have to do one day a month
07:41
hamburgers only because
07:42
i can tell you that isn't going to work
07:45
people you need to get back in your
07:46
office and re-figure that thing up
07:48
because
07:49
you make yourself look more and more
07:51
ridiculous thank god
07:53
this is america the land of the free and
07:55
the brave
07:56
and that's what the way we're gonna stay
07:59
i would just say
08:00
as always god has not changed his mind
08:03
about anything
08:04
and people go why do you keep saying the
08:06
same thing because he's saying the same
08:08
thing
08:09
no i'm not making updates to give you
08:11
like some other people
08:14
i'm not going to tell you something that
08:15
god has not said as a prophet i have to
08:18
say what god says
08:20
and he is still saying all of this stuff
08:23
is going to be pushed back taken down
08:26
and set back the way it's supposed to be
08:28
and we will run our races in the greater
08:30
glory this is very powerful
08:32
i just got back from tennessee global
08:35
fire church
08:36
where i spoke on sunday that would be
08:38
april 25th 2021
08:41
yeah and i guess it was so powerful it
08:44
got taken down but what they don't know
08:46
is we have the audio recording
08:49
yay team at global life and they will be
08:53
sending us that and so we will put it
08:55
out there somehow not sure how
08:57
uh if nothing else i know we'll make a
08:59
cd out of it
09:00
we may do a podcast but we'll have
09:02
available for people to hear because let
09:04
me tell you
09:05
it will jump start you into this whole
09:08
new season
09:08
entering to entering to you know you
09:12
can still produce your destiny and take
09:14
authority and rule
09:16
as a king no matter what's going on
09:19
actually will help when we begin to
09:20
doing that instead of repeating what
09:23
is wrong we need to start talking about
09:25
what is right
09:26
that's good that's good well okay well
09:29
if anything else before we jump into
09:31
some questions here any other
09:33
you got it i just know there's still
09:35
things going on behind the scenes
09:37
no matter what's being said or people
09:40
thinking or ha
09:41
is happening you don't know the whole
09:43
story and you won't know
09:45
until it happens yeah i just know god
09:48
says
09:48
still stay excited that shows hell
09:52
you are not afraid of what the enemy
09:55
looks like he's doing
09:57
talk about what god is doing bringing
09:59
the greatest days ever on the face of
10:01
the earth because your words make a
10:03
difference in your
10:04
own life and in your own soul as well as
10:07
what we release into the atmosphere
10:09
here in our country and all over the
10:11
world because god's touching the world
10:14
not just america that's good so cat what
10:17
i'm going to do
10:18
now is i'm going to throw up there's
10:20
been a controversy about which
10:21
is your correct facebook site there's
10:24
only one and jeff throw up the actual
10:26
picture of her facebook page
10:29
and okay there's the url see it says the
10:31
revelator cat curve that's what it will
10:33
say up top
10:34
in the url that's not what when you
10:37
punch it in the search engine
10:39
you type the cat cur right there
10:42
now look down below you see where it
10:44
says down 109 000 followers circle that
10:47
see that 109 000 followers fake
10:50
bank accounts do not have 109 000
10:53
followers so when you see that
10:55
you know that's the real thing if you
10:57
don't see something very close to that
10:58
number
10:59
you know you're not on the right thing
11:01
what else jeff anything else
11:03
she's about in the back okay okay on the
11:06
about
11:07
this was started april 29 2016 tomorrow
11:10
is the anniversary
11:12
that it was started so that's what five
11:14
years ago april 29th
11:16
yeah the anniversary of that tomorrow so
11:18
that's that's the legitimate facebook
11:20
anything else is not so that's right
11:23
okay let's cover one more thing
11:25
kat uh did you or did you not say as a
11:29
couple people have reported
11:31
that if you took the covet vaccine you
11:33
would not go to heaven did you or did
11:34
you not
11:39
isn't that amazing i don't know who made
11:41
that one up but i'm going to be
11:43
very biblical right now there's only one
11:46
reason why you don't get into heaven you
11:49
reject
11:50
jesus christ right you're not going to
11:53
hell because you wear jeans
11:54
you have jewelry or you wear makeup or
11:56
you you have that
11:59
there's only one reason why you don't
12:00
make it and you have up to every moment
12:03
breathing your last breath and i believe
12:04
even right after that you still could
12:07
because christ has the keys of hell
12:09
death and the grave we'll go over that
12:11
another time
12:12
but i never said that absolutely not did
12:15
not say that i myself
12:17
am choosing not to have the vaccine i've
12:20
probably been asked that at least 30
12:22
times just in this last week
12:24
even when i greeted all the people at uh
12:27
global fire i think about 400
12:29
showed up and they didn't even advertise
12:31
it because of
12:32
our little thing that we mentioned about
12:35
a week ago
12:35
steve they had all those other people
12:38
show up
12:40
that's amazing so i say no my choice is
12:44
no
12:44
i don't need it i'm not taking it there
12:47
you go
12:47
now you have that officially set right
12:50
and i
12:51
you know i think i have one son that i
12:53
he's either had it or he's talking about
12:54
having it
12:55
and his mind is made up from what i can
12:58
tell but i
12:59
i don't intend to take it you know i i
13:01
just don't i don't need it i don't want
13:03
it
13:04
i believe there's treatments in case you
13:06
get it so i'm not telling anybody not to
13:08
do it
13:08
let me tell you something we get
13:10
extremists on both sides people are
13:12
angry at us because we don't tell them
13:14
they're
13:14
going to kill themselves or something
13:16
and then the people
13:18
get angry on the other side because
13:19
we're we we're saying we're not going to
13:21
get it
13:22
both sides think we're being completely
13:23
irresponsible everybody has
13:26
a choice that's just everybody you have
13:28
your own choice you make your decision
13:30
what gives you peace the bible says
13:33
follow
13:34
after peace again i'm going to be very
13:36
scriptural
13:37
so follow after what gives you peace i
13:40
have peace not having it there you go
13:42
steve has
13:42
peace not having it there there you go
13:45
there you go
13:45
all right well let's get some questions
13:47
about having for anyone that may not
13:48
know
13:49
uh cat car's been to heaven well over
13:51
thousands of times and
13:53
god often woke up the father will walk
13:55
through the wall
13:56
uh one lady wrote let me just start with
13:58
this this wasn't my number one but she
14:00
asked us today
14:01
or the other day she said if cass says
14:04
the father will sometimes walk through
14:05
the wall or god will walk through the
14:07
wall
14:07
and talk with her and we haven't covered
14:09
this for a long time this you don't have
14:11
to have an exhaustive answer but give
14:13
them maybe a short answer on
14:14
she'll say well how can that be when the
14:16
father says nobody can see my face and
14:18
live
14:19
just kind of recap that for new people
14:21
yeah i'll be scriptural again this must
14:24
be scripture day
14:25
yeah okay john in the book of john we're
14:28
talking about the disciple
14:30
john the beloved he said you cannot see
14:33
the face of god and live
14:34
and yet in the book of revelation
14:37
okay look up revelation 4 you'll find it
14:40
it's in there
14:41
where god the father sitting on his
14:44
throne in heaven with the rainbow coming
14:46
from him
14:47
caught john up and it's
14:50
written in the book he saw him sitting
14:52
on the throne
14:53
he saw the rainbow coming in and out of
14:55
him he saw
14:56
his face he had flames of fire lightning
14:59
bolts were coming from him those are
15:00
lightning bolts of love he clearly
15:03
describes him
15:04
and yet people he didn't die
15:07
and that was god clearly saying when you
15:09
are born again
15:11
when you're born again okay you have
15:13
access
15:14
to heaven not just when you die
15:17
god may catch you up and show you you
15:19
may have encounters there
15:21
um you may have visions or dreams of
15:23
heaven itself
15:24
and and it says the eye is not seen nor
15:27
ear heard nor entered in the heart
15:29
or mind of man what god has prepared for
15:32
those who love him
15:33
and those who are going to go to heaven
15:34
unless and accept
15:37
the spirit of god shows you
15:40
clearly the spirit of god took john up
15:42
in the book of revelation so he could
15:44
see
15:45
the face of god and see him sitting on
15:47
the throne
15:48
knowing at that moment he didn't die
15:51
you're not going to die
15:53
okay in these days if god chooses to
15:55
allow you to see it then
15:57
just be happy because it's it's
16:00
you're not gonna die okay just trust me
16:02
there's even been sinners caught up and
16:04
shown the face of god and they didn't
16:06
this is god's sovereign choice
16:08
and uh i can tell you others were caught
16:10
up and saw the face of god they didn't
16:12
die
16:13
and but if you're sealed in the blood of
16:15
christ that is for all eternity
16:18
you will have access you'll be welcomed
16:20
when you come home to heaven you're
16:21
welcome before the throne of god he will
16:23
embrace you
16:25
um and so there that's my answer that's
16:27
the shortage
16:29
well and then there was that one other
16:30
answer there's lots of other things that
16:32
could be said but god
16:33
god spoke i can't remember mr aaron
16:35
miriam or if it was to
16:38
to other people he said with moses i
16:40
speak to
16:41
him face to face as one man speaks to
16:43
another right
16:44
right there absolutely right that that
16:46
was said he did say that when god came
16:48
down
16:49
and had them brought out of the tent of
16:51
meeting yeah they were grumbling and
16:53
complaining about moses who does he
16:54
think he is the only one who knows god
16:58
and god said when i speak to moses it's
17:00
not in dreams it's i speak
17:02
to him face to face that came from the
17:05
living god if you want more you're right
17:07
steve that was in there that's good
17:08
that's good
17:09
okay well i'm gonna slip in a few of my
17:11
own i've been uh biting my own tongue
17:13
for a while
17:14
i'm gonna give a few of my questions
17:17
so here's one you said heaven is as big
17:19
as i can't remember if you said our
17:21
solar system or galaxy it's that big so
17:24
the question is if i have friends
17:26
who live a hundred thousand miles away
17:28
because they're
17:30
their farms out over there their ranches
17:32
what do we do we get in transport and
17:34
drive through the country do we drive
17:36
through
17:36
other cities in heaven to go visit how
17:39
does that work
17:40
if heaven is that big we're not all
17:43
there's
17:43
billions of us so how does that work
17:46
you just think you want to go there and
17:48
you're there there's so many different
17:50
ways yes you can do that by
17:52
uh thought transport you just say i'm
17:54
gonna go see my cousin joe
17:56
and instantly you're there like outside
17:59
his door
18:00
you can step into kiosks there's a kiosk
18:03
that's sort of like
18:04
that's what they call them anyway it's
18:06
like a big arch
18:07
like along the streets of gold with
18:08
steps and beams of light are shooting
18:11
out i
18:12
actually uh was taken to several lows
18:14
several times
18:16
and i saw people step in they said where
18:18
they wanted to go they step in the beam
18:19
of light and
18:20
instantly they were on the other side of
18:23
heaven
18:24
there so some people like to travel
18:27
they still like to drive you know i
18:29
guess you could drive most of the cars
18:30
don't really have
18:31
wheels per se most cars fly in heaven
18:35
but there's all different ways you can
18:36
transport you can ride on light you can
18:38
ride on song
18:40
and having to travel across heaven uh
18:43
there's bubbles you can step
18:44
into and they float you there it depends
18:46
on what everybody wants there's always
18:48
different ways to travel
18:50
so are there towns and cities along the
18:53
way
18:54
in other words heaven has like i'm
18:56
thinking of the wizard of oz there was
18:58
the emerald city so there's an emerald
19:00
city here and there's a diamond city
19:02
are there things like that yes and
19:04
actually the bible says
19:06
that heaven is a country
19:10
and a city it actually mentions that in
19:13
the word of god i think it's in hebrews
19:15
hebrews talks a lot about heaven by the
19:17
way people you should check it out
19:19
um so anyway it says it's a it says it's
19:22
a city
19:23
it says it's a country it says in the
19:26
bible earth is a shadow of heaven that
19:29
gives you a good clue
19:30
except nothing's dirty nothing gets old
19:33
nothing ages
19:34
they certainly have cities i know the
19:37
names of some of the cities there and
19:39
even part of the countryside
19:40
there's a friendly forest there's a
19:42
valley of the falls there's a mountain
19:44
of spices there are literally
19:46
places that exist in heaven uh there's
19:49
cartoon
19:50
village there's video land all these
19:52
wonderful places passionate paradise
19:54
which is about the love the absolute
19:56
love of god
19:57
these are literally places that exist
19:59
there so yes there's many places to go
20:01
and see
20:02
but what people don't realize is their
20:04
loved ones who are there are
20:05
making a list of where to take them when
20:09
you get there so
20:10
it's not like you wander around you
20:12
can't get lost no matter where you end
20:14
up you'll never be lost in heaven nobody
20:16
gets lost in heaven
20:17
but yes there's very beautiful
20:19
countryside and there's amazing cities
20:22
with real supernatural things to do
20:24
there's amusement parks there's rodeos
20:27
there's
20:28
sports arenas where every game is played
20:32
as worship to jesus christ because jesus
20:35
gets all the points
20:37
well now i'm trying to remember cat if
20:39
this was you in your book
20:41
because i read your books but someone i
20:43
read said
20:44
that people like billy graham or some
20:46
people their rewards are so great that
20:48
their mansion was as big as a city
20:50
was that you or is that someone else i
20:52
did say that i said that i said there's
20:55
some people's mansions that are the size
20:57
of
20:58
new york city i am not exaggerating i'm
21:01
not
21:02
and that means there's many different
21:04
things on there yes your mansion can be
21:06
tremendous you know your mansion could
21:08
be i don't know 50 000 square feet
21:10
but then there's other things on there
21:12
that he's blessed you with or created
21:14
for you with
21:14
on this massive piece of property and
21:17
there's even places for friends to come
21:19
and stay if they want to stay you know
21:21
there's not time clocks or
21:22
uh calendars per se but people want to
21:26
come and visit for a while they actually
21:28
have places for them to stay that would
21:29
be exciting and fun
21:31
wow i thought that was okay here's my
21:34
next question um
21:36
so i picture almost everybody in my head
21:38
i'm picturing everyone because i live in
21:40
the country i love the country
21:42
so i picture everyone in the country
21:44
with many acres surrounding their
21:46
uh mansions but do so the question is do
21:49
some people
21:51
like to live in a nice fancy housing
21:53
track close to their friends do people
21:55
live in
21:56
housing groups of housing or does
21:58
everybody have uh
21:59
swirling acres around them or what how
22:01
does that all go
22:03
well you know what there's nowhere in
22:05
the bible that says you only get one
22:07
one house okay he goes to prepare a
22:11
place
22:13
that place has different doors
22:16
i've said this before this is the
22:18
supernatural side of heaven
22:20
with some people's heads they can't
22:22
really get it there's no limit to space
22:25
in other words even on your own property
22:27
let's say you got i don't know 100 acres
22:29
a thousand acres depending on what you
22:31
like
22:32
let's just say for instance you have 10
22:34
acres 10 amazing acres it's on the
22:36
crystal sea
22:38
with beautiful palm trees with creatures
22:40
that talk and sing and the flowers sing
22:43
it's beautiful but you have interest in
22:46
other areas and god knows that
22:48
so you'll walk on your property you come
22:50
to a door
22:51
a real door a beautiful door they're
22:54
made all different colors and shapes
22:56
and you can walk around the door let's
22:58
just say this would be the door
23:00
you can walk around the door and you see
23:03
the front and the back of the door but
23:04
when you go
23:05
in and you open it standing where you're
23:08
at
23:08
you can literally see another place
23:11
that belongs to you another piece of
23:13
property
23:14
that could be in the mountains so spices
23:17
where some of your families are because
23:18
they love it
23:19
that means you step through that door
23:21
you're on your other piece of property
23:23
the mountain spice is you go enjoy all
23:24
your family do things with them
23:27
uh explore stuff and then when you're
23:29
ready to come back you step
23:30
through the door you're back on your
23:31
original piece of property
23:33
that's why they call it that's why they
23:35
call it heaven
23:37
yeah and i was trying to remember if you
23:38
had what your answer was if i said
23:40
because you said there was you get you
23:42
told us about there's a sea
23:44
versus ocean and i like the crashing
23:46
waves
23:47
of the ocean but are they not crashing
23:51
away
23:51
are there crashing waves anywhere in
23:53
heaven yeah
23:56
especially at the surf park they have a
23:58
surf park that's like
23:59
hundreds of miles long wow his along
24:03
you know the the crystal sea they call
24:05
it the crystal sea because
24:07
uh it's filled with crystals and
24:09
gemstones and rainbows shoot up
24:11
out of it that would be like your ocean
24:13
having that
24:14
it's an amazing thing yes the waves do
24:17
crash
24:18
you can't surf on a wave that doesn't
24:20
crash
24:21
and then you have huge surf spots there
24:24
uh but i
24:25
i want to jump ahead to the end of the
24:27
bible where it talks about the new
24:29
earth and it says there'll be no more
24:32
seas so people
24:33
picture this earth the new earth with no
24:35
ocean no he didn't say there wouldn't be
24:37
an ocean
24:38
actually on the new earth there'll be
24:40
one massive land mass
24:42
like we had originally here i mean huge
24:44
massive
24:46
and all around it will be this massive
24:48
ocean because wherever the father
24:50
goes that that flows from him
24:54
so he'll be on the new earth it flows
24:56
from him even in heaven now
24:59
underneath the throne out into the
25:01
streets
25:02
and you literally see this beautiful
25:04
gorgeous people jump into it
25:06
and they put gemstones up out of it that
25:08
comes from the heart of god that
25:09
represents revelation and love
25:11
and life and it goes all over heaven to
25:14
become this massive ocean that people
25:16
i have big sailboats or they
25:19
both have all kinds of things yeah even
25:21
like old type ships with the massive
25:23
sails they have them
25:25
have them in heaven so on the new earth
25:28
we can't escape ever having an
25:29
ocean because as long as the father's
25:32
with us
25:32
that will flow out of him oh wow now and
25:35
then about the are there any people
25:38
uh groups or groups of people that say
25:40
we like living
25:42
you know they're the type of people that
25:43
on earth they couldn't wait to go next
25:44
door and share brownies or go across the
25:46
street
25:47
are there people that live close
25:48
together on purpose like next door
25:51
like almost like a tractor but i don't
25:53
know probably two
25:56
they have places similar to that like
25:59
it's it's
26:00
massive pieces of property that will
26:02
probably come up next to each other
26:04
but they have ways you just walk through
26:07
these like
26:08
i don't know through these top these
26:10
places i wouldn't call it a tunnel
26:12
it's like uh things of light um
26:16
sometimes you can't explain it it would
26:18
be like a tube made out of light you
26:20
step in and you're in
26:21
instantly into your other family members
26:23
mansion
26:24
they have that they do have that i think
26:26
i talk about it in one of the books
26:29
but they also have places like let's say
26:31
you
26:32
live in the city of heaven where all
26:34
these beautiful streets of gold and all
26:36
these amazing things
26:37
are but you loved you vacation in the
26:40
mountains well in the amount of spices
26:42
you'd have another place very similar to
26:44
that
26:45
with many many many rooms in it and all
26:47
of you together would go
26:49
there to enjoy time up in the mountain
26:51
spices together so it's almost like a
26:53
vacation place
26:54
but you have more than one of those so
26:56
you have your main mansion but you have
26:58
many
26:58
other things properties the proper word
27:02
is property
27:03
he made a place for you that's your main
27:05
mansion but from there
27:06
you go to all these other properties
27:08
that are yours
27:09
and some are like family type places to
27:12
go to and enjoy all your families
27:13
together
27:15
and this is probably a silly question
27:16
but i've never heard it asked i've never
27:18
asked it myself
27:20
we don't probably get dirty per se
27:22
although we could play in the mud
27:24
if we wanted to i suppose but we don't
27:27
sleep
27:28
per se there's no night so
27:31
that must mean there's not showers in
27:33
the in
27:34
a shower in the mansion is there
27:36
anything like a shower or nothing like
27:38
that
27:39
there's nothing like that because no
27:40
matter where you go or what you do yeah
27:42
if you want to dig in the mud or the
27:44
dirt and build things
27:45
when you're done and step away it's not
27:48
on you anymore
27:49
it's only on you while you're
27:50
participating it's just like the crystal
27:52
sea
27:52
you go in there you swim you feel the
27:54
water going through you and all around
27:56
you but when you step out of the crystal
27:57
sea you're totally dry
27:59
that's heaven you don't ever have to
28:01
clean up you're never going to get in a
28:02
place where you have to
28:04
there's no bathrooms in heaven is the
28:06
problem i love that
28:07
well you know i remember you said that
28:09
there are sports in heaven they play
28:11
football and i remember you said you're
28:13
playing football
28:14
to win points where jesus said rather
28:15
than crush your
28:17
fault but so i i'm thinking sweaty and
28:20
muddy and dirty
28:21
but when it's over you walk away clean
28:23
as a whistle yes
28:24
yes that's right okay
28:27
okay now this one i i want to ask this
28:30
about okay so i
28:31
people have heard me say before my dad
28:33
barely made it to heaven he's been gone
28:35
30 years
28:36
um this year and uh he got his heart
28:39
right
28:39
he's with the lord but his his
28:42
rewards are probably slim so he probably
28:44
has a less
28:46
than mentioned than many people would
28:47
have so someone had written it and asked
28:50
me this question
28:51
if a person wanted to build or add on to
28:53
their mansion because they like to build
28:55
my dad liked to build things
28:57
would he be of a mind to
29:00
add on to his mansion and build things
29:02
because he liked to do that
29:04
regardless of what he's different i've
29:07
seen people's places in heaven that made
29:09
it on their deathbed
29:11
and it was the most fantastic actually
29:14
was margaret
29:15
my cfo my sister-in-law i saw her
29:18
ex-husband's place in heaven he got
29:20
saved
29:21
my brother and margot went and prayed
29:22
with him to be born again got saved
29:25
and he has this most magnificent it's
29:28
like an a-frame
29:29
the most glorious looking cabin you've
29:31
ever seen probably
29:32
i don't know eight thousand ten thousand
29:34
square feet wow
29:36
on uh on a river that comes off the
29:38
crystal sea because he loved the fish
29:40
i saw him there with his dog pepper i
29:42
didn't even know he had a dog
29:44
when i came back i asked margaret and
29:45
she said yeah he had a dog named pepper
29:47
so i i knew that was him i was seeing so
29:50
i'll tell you why
29:51
they don't want to change it steve they
29:54
are so
29:55
grateful beyond measure that they
29:58
number one didn't go to hell that the
30:00
love of god and because of christ they
30:02
were able to be there they
30:04
love everything he made for them
30:07
because your mansion is made by jesus
30:09
christ
30:11
most people don't want to change it they
30:13
can bring in things they picked up like
30:15
beautiful things that people give them
30:17
but again the other thing they can do is
30:20
people
30:20
do actually build things to hold big
30:23
events
30:24
like they will put up different types of
30:26
buildings and stuff they hold big events
30:27
on their own property
30:29
they help others who are doing that they
30:31
make things and do stuff
30:32
i bet that's what your dad is doing but
30:34
i do want to say this god just said to
30:36
tell steve
30:37
his dad is delighted every time
30:40
you say my dad did make it to heaven
30:43
wow wow i love that
30:47
hey thank you when you say it
30:51
well yeah and i mean because you people
30:53
have talked i've been kind of an open
30:55
book you know i'm my sister i have a
30:56
sister
30:57
that to this day and we pray for i'm
30:59
standing for our salvation and she will
31:01
yeah but she has said a few years back
31:03
she says if dad's going to be there i
31:04
don't want to go
31:05
well that's her temporary position
31:07
because she was abused
31:08
but she won't hold that forever but um
31:11
well let me ask
31:12
you guys go to heaven they all have so
31:14
much love for each other
31:15
really will people just don't even think
31:18
about those things
31:20
um they go with forgiveness already in
31:23
them and all they can't wait to do is to
31:24
see their family members when they're
31:26
there in heaven
31:27
wow wow now i wanted to ask if there's
31:30
are there people like my dad probably
31:33
felt he would go to heaven because he
31:35
knew his heart was right but if
31:37
are there people who suddenly at their
31:39
death find themselves
31:40
ushered into heaven who are startled
31:43
because they didn't think they were
31:44
going to go
31:47
oh yes that's why they had the welcome
31:50
center which was one of the places that
31:52
god took me
31:53
and showed me and the lord has taken me
31:55
back again and showed me
31:56
they actually have a welcome center in
31:58
heaven because people some people are in
32:00
shock
32:01
some people aren't shocked because they
32:03
made it but they did make it
32:06
i guess they felt like they hadn't
32:07
achieved some kind of level of goodness
32:09
or something
32:11
but because of christ in them they're
32:14
there
32:14
and they actually say there's actually
32:16
people who
32:17
are funeral directors on the earth who
32:20
are now in charge
32:21
of people coming to heaven that are in
32:23
shock like is this heaven is all this
32:26
are people really dancing are they
32:28
celebrating are they making noise
32:30
do they have music here and they'll come
32:32
say come on we're going to show you and
32:34
explain
32:34
all about this and then they take them
32:36
to the welcome center
32:38
and when they leave there they're just
32:40
running so free and excited about
32:42
because i actually get to see a lot of
32:44
things in heaven when they take them
32:46
there
32:46
yes this is this is where you're at this
32:48
is heaven you have actually made it here
32:52
that's really it so then i have the
32:54
opposite question are there people
32:56
who were convinced they were going to
32:58
have an inner stun to find themselves in
33:00
hell
33:01
i think probably most people inside
33:04
their self
33:05
already realize that hopefully as
33:09
they're dying they will
33:10
uh yell out that they repent for their
33:13
sins
33:14
and uh still have an opportunity at that
33:16
last moment
33:18
to receive christ there are some people
33:21
who wouldn't receive it no matter what
33:22
you did because they're so deceived
33:25
um by man or by the enemy himself
33:29
sometimes the enemy does still make
33:30
promises to people if they
33:32
do wicked evil things and some people
33:34
don't think there's either place
33:36
so depending on the mercy of god or
33:38
their family what they're standing for
33:41
i will tell you this they all usually
33:43
know by the time they're going
33:45
because there's a traveling thing in
33:46
that it's not like you die then you're
33:48
there you have
33:49
the demons will come and get you and
33:50
take you there or fear starts to consume
33:53
you as a believer that spears never
33:55
going to consume anybody
33:56
when they die but i'm telling you people
33:58
do know that they did not receive christ
34:01
they fully rejected him
34:03
uh when they're there when they do go go
34:05
go to hell
34:06
so george everybody make sure you
34:09
receive
34:10
jesus christ let me ask you about right
34:14
see the romans one or two it says that
34:16
those that did not have uh the creator
34:20
did by nature the things that were right
34:22
and they they were a lot of themselves
34:24
and i think that meant that
34:25
so we have things like the aboriginals
34:29
in africa and never heard of the name of
34:30
jesus over the decades and hundreds
34:32
years we have the first
34:33
nations people in here before the white
34:36
men came and brought
34:37
the teachings and how did how
34:41
do those people end up who never
34:44
knew jesus and never knew god i mean we
34:46
have
34:47
chiefs indian chiefs we talk about the
34:49
great spirit
34:50
is that how they get in or what i will
34:53
tell you
34:54
again the scripture this one's the
34:55
scripture again in the book of romans
34:58
it says in romans that uh god
35:02
said i make myself known to
35:05
every man that would be mankind
35:08
he makes himself known to them they know
35:11
there is a god as much as they want to
35:14
say there isn't there is nobody he said
35:16
i make myself known to all mankind so he
35:19
does
35:20
and i would say the native americans
35:22
probably have some of the greatest
35:23
encounters with with god himself and
35:25
with the lord
35:27
they were spiritual people and yes god
35:30
did make himself known
35:31
to many of them and i happen to know
35:34
they also had encounters with
35:35
angels because on some of those totem
35:37
poles i have
35:38
i've seen some of the faces of the host
35:41
carved on there
35:43
and that one encounter i had out in the
35:44
middle of the desert in
35:46
arizona where i saw one of the the
35:49
angels were
35:50
over the western territories his face
35:52
looked like it had
35:54
facets in it and he was actually wearing
35:56
images of the eye of god on himself
35:59
and the holy spirit said back in the
36:03
days before the white man was here
36:05
this being would be out there warring
36:07
and they some of them
36:08
you know would see him and they would
36:10
take the images he was wearing and put
36:12
them on their on their homes and on
36:14
their clothes that they wear
36:16
and they knew that that being
36:18
represented god himself and you have to
36:20
understand
36:21
uh there have been angels in many places
36:24
that did
36:24
have encounters and speak to people so i
36:27
think the native americans probably had
36:29
a lot of encounters of their own before
36:31
men
36:31
came and actually said what the name of
36:33
god was and i think that probably
36:35
happens everywhere or god would not say
36:38
i make myself known to every man
36:42
so they do have an opportunity to say
36:44
yes to him and you know even in the in
36:46
even in the the other country i
36:48
think it was paul that saw the
36:51
the statue to the unknown god and he
36:54
used that to preach the gospel to those
36:56
people so
36:57
they knew there was a god they didn't
36:58
know the name of him
37:00
that's good that's really really good
37:02
okay you talked about aborted children
37:04
of course going
37:05
right to heaven and many of them
37:09
are there waiting for their parents and
37:10
others of them their parents
37:12
never show up because they didn't
37:13
receive christ that's right
37:15
and so we talked about uh people who
37:18
were childless could then
37:19
ask the lord to adopt i mean it's uh the
37:22
question occurred to me that
37:23
if a woman was childless and she had
37:26
always dreamt of having twins she could
37:28
say do you have a set of twins whose
37:30
parents
37:30
didn't come can they do that can they
37:32
say i want to raise twins
37:34
that no one was able to raise when i go
37:35
to heaven absolutely
37:37
yes and there's they actually do and god
37:40
knows your heart already that you wanted
37:42
them so you would be on purpose taken
37:44
past that place which has beautiful
37:46
meadows
37:47
all these little babies are playing
37:49
because little babies
37:50
uh even still what we would call a baby
37:53
they already can laugh talk
37:54
play sing dance and many people go
37:58
there and take them as their own and uh
38:01
and then they raise them they'll grow
38:03
very very
38:03
slowly even in having them grow slowly
38:06
and those people get to raise them as
38:08
their own so yes you can do that
38:10
that's really really good okay uh all
38:13
these
38:13
questions a lot of them are completely
38:15
disconnected from each other but
38:17
um some of you talked before about if
38:19
someone really likes to cook
38:21
they like to cook from scratch they're
38:24
in their mansion
38:25
so because they like to know you don't
38:27
have to spend money on anything but do
38:28
they
38:29
go out and some find some free flower at
38:32
this place and get some free lists here
38:34
and they start their coverage with
38:37
supplies
38:38
or what how does that happen if someone
38:40
loves to cook all the time from scratch
38:42
this is the difference between earth and
38:44
heaven you don't have to stock anything
38:46
you're in there in your amazing kitchen
38:49
now you know i'm not cooking
38:51
i'm sorry i've cooked most all of my
38:54
life
38:54
and great dreams not gonna cook my
38:57
glorious tables with all my friends and
38:59
family probably 100 people some
39:01
some homes have tables that will seat
39:03
100 people everybody sits there and say
39:05
what they want and it appears on the
39:07
plates
39:08
fully done amazing you eat it and then
39:11
it disappears and your plates are clean
39:12
again that's going to be my
39:14
mansion but some people i was taken to
39:17
someone's mansion whose greatest
39:18
pleasure was to cook for their guests
39:20
and there was this kitchen it had
39:22
gadgets and i didn't even
39:24
i didn't even know i didn't know what
39:25
they did but they were making
39:28
the salad and all they did was say like
39:30
i need lettuce and cucumbers tomatoes
39:33
um all these other things they listed
39:35
and they all appeared on the counter
39:38
in like these baskets already clean they
39:40
didn't have to scrub them or anything
39:42
wow and she was uh peeling
39:45
these carrots okay now the carrots one
39:48
reason she
39:49
they were cleaned but she wanted to peel
39:50
thinner i saw this one
39:52
pick up a carrot and peel it and when
39:54
the peeling came off it
39:56
disappeared there was no garbage when
39:59
she was done and it was perfect she cut
40:00
it up she was making this
40:02
salad to feed like 50 people and i
40:05
watched this over again like
40:06
there's no garbage there's there's no
40:09
there's no trash
40:10
to pick up and so i was amazed so yes
40:13
you can cook
40:14
if you want to cook i love that and
40:17
and we talked about there being stores
40:20
where you don't have to pay i think we
40:22
did
40:35
what you do is everybody uses their
40:38
particular gift in heaven it can be
40:39
making things out of glass
40:42
making things out of wood beautiful
40:44
things that they have created
40:46
and they have shops and sometimes the
40:48
shops are actually in the people's
40:50
mansion
40:51
so you know live somewhere then go
40:54
somewhere else to use your gift it's all
40:56
designed
40:57
around your mansion it's on your own
40:59
property people come
41:00
depending on what it is if you have an
41:02
ice cream shop it would be right there
41:05
people come from all over having to eat
41:07
the ice cream that you have
41:08
made and that you're offering in your
41:10
shop you get to scoop it and put it on
41:11
the stuff and everything
41:13
the same thing with jewelry stores i was
41:15
taken into a jewelry store on the city
41:17
streets of gold and it was a it was a a
41:20
jew
41:21
it was a jew who had a jewelry store who
41:23
received jesus christ
41:24
and it was in this big diamond this was
41:27
his store and a facet dropped down
41:29
people walked up inside
41:31
i saw the showroom everything in it was
41:33
free
41:34
he he caught the gems that came from um
41:37
there's a place you can go get all the
41:38
gems you want to design
41:40
jewelry and stuff if you make that and
41:42
some can be custom made for family
41:44
members coming to heaven and then you go
41:46
in there and then you can take it they
41:48
put it in these beautiful little
41:49
satchels and you take it with you
41:51
every kind of thing you can imagine
41:53
that's beautiful they have
41:54
fabrics things are made out of fabrics
41:56
out of leather
41:57
uh glass metal whatever that gift is
42:01
it's your passion to use that's what you
42:03
do in heaven that's why there's so many
42:04
things to do in heaven
42:06
interesting okay here's a question by
42:09
the way jeff i'm getting a real echo in
42:10
my
42:11
earpiece i don't know if anyone else is
42:12
telling you but that's just me there it
42:14
went away
42:14
okay cool uh so i'm thinking of someone
42:17
like rush limbaugh who went
42:19
home to be with the lord recently and um
42:23
do people like him who loved
42:26
political science and what was going on
42:29
would he have an interest in having an
42:31
or the ability to see who's president
42:33
when who's coming even if he can pray it
42:37
in or is he completely oblivious now
42:39
once he goes to heaven
42:40
he knows nothing about who's president
42:42
or anything like that
42:44
oh no he's fully aware of all of that
42:46
everyone can watch they go to those
42:48
beautiful places that i
42:49
actually is in one of the one of the
42:51
sketches in book one it shows you these
42:53
places they're called the portal but
42:55
they're actually
42:56
building the structures and you walk in
42:58
walk up the steps and look over this
43:00
beautiful railing maybe a thousand
43:02
people could go in here to time you look
43:04
down and see all different kinds of
43:05
things happening on the earth
43:07
and so if you were interested in that
43:09
you could totally watch all that going
43:10
on
43:10
except one good thing about heaven no
43:13
one is concerned about the fraud and all
43:15
the other stuff going on right now
43:17
because they can see what's going to
43:19
happen they know what's coming up next
43:21
well they do yeah they can watch a lot
43:24
of that and they're up there
43:25
cheering us on down here they're excited
43:27
about what god's plans are
43:29
they see god's plans even though they
43:31
can see some of the stuff
43:33
influence of the enemy they will see
43:34
what god's plans are
43:36
so they get excited and the other thing
43:39
rush will be doing is
43:40
when somebody new comes to heaven they
43:42
actually have meetings where they get to
43:44
come and talk and share
43:46
and everybody wants to hear what they
43:48
have to say even though they could have
43:49
washed them on the earth
43:51
and they will give testimonies like god
43:54
spared my life god gave me this
43:56
revelation about this thing
43:57
he empowered me to speak boldly and i
44:00
was so excited
44:01
they kind of give their testimony and
44:04
these places jammed full of people in
44:06
heaven everywhere because they want to
44:08
hear from someone
44:09
who has just come from the earth i love
44:12
that
44:13
i love it okay here's when i was talking
44:15
to a man yesterday on the phone
44:17
friend oh friend he'd lost his wife very
44:20
very recently in
44:21
their best best friend for 40 some years
44:24
and god has
44:24
through multiple prophetic voices told
44:27
him
44:28
that that he's going to be married again
44:30
soon and he's probably close to my age a
44:32
little bit older
44:33
and so here's my question he said people
44:35
can look down in the portals of heaven
44:36
and they see these
44:37
births and marriages these these pivotal
44:41
moments in time so his wife who went
44:43
before him
44:44
that she looked down to the portal and
44:47
see him getting remarried
44:49
and rejoice or what he will rejoice
44:52
greatly
44:53
really he will literally rejoice
44:55
sometimes they'll even ask jesus can you
44:57
please send them and someone else
44:59
because i don't want them to be alone
45:02
no they know this they know one day when
45:04
everybody gets to heaven
45:06
you're not going to end up there with
45:08
three wives you'll have three
45:10
best friends and everyone knows that
45:13
they're so happy that god sends them
45:15
someone else to have so
45:16
i have somebody else in their life and
45:19
not be alone
45:20
[Music]
45:21
that's good that's really that i never
45:22
heard that asked and it just occurred to
45:25
me today
45:25
you know you know because
45:28
i would there would be that part of me
45:30
that would have felt funny if that ever
45:31
happened to me and if i ever had to get
45:33
decided i was going to get remarried i
45:35
forbid that that would ever happen but
45:37
but you know that in heaven everybody in
45:40
heaven would be happy for that
45:43
interesting very very interesting okay
45:45
now that's the end of my couple of
45:46
questions
45:48
here's some more uh listen this keeps me
45:51
asking me are there different levels in
45:53
heaven i keep being asked that
45:56
different levels of heaven i would not
45:59
say
46:00
um levels per se like you have to live
46:02
at the bottom of heaven
46:04
it's and i've actually heard people say
46:06
that they thought that was true
46:08
it doesn't say that in the word of god
46:10
everyone has
46:11
access to the father everyone has access
46:14
to this throne room
46:16
i think it's more per se how much
46:19
property has he given you
46:20
for how much have you poured yourself
46:22
out for him how many people have you
46:24
loved it's not like he keeps
46:26
count but the more you pour yourself out
46:28
on his behalf
46:30
the more reward you will get
46:33
they're definitely layers in heaven i
46:35
think not level is not the right
46:37
quite word layers there's layers in
46:39
heaven that you can go
46:41
into and you go up and go into other
46:43
places that aren't necessarily on the
46:45
ground
46:46
to enjoy there is a place called
46:48
passionate paradise
46:49
where because of your pouring out of
46:52
yourself you get to go meet with jesus
46:54
and he gives you his own
46:55
songs to sing and you're still
46:57
worshiping him but you are
46:59
you're you're standing on this platform
47:01
when you're raised up
47:02
and everyone in heaven at that point
47:04
will hear you singing
47:06
these songs of adoration to jesus christ
47:08
so
47:09
honor is going to be given nobody
47:11
worships anybody except jesus christ
47:14
they adore the father and the they also
47:17
love and adore holy spirit
47:19
but jesus christ is the is the groom
47:22
for everyone who fears the bride
47:25
everyone will love him
47:27
first more than anyone else and he
47:30
honors people for what they did in their
47:32
lives even people we never saw or heard
47:34
of
47:34
like maybe some little grandma prayed in
47:37
three moods of god nobody knew their
47:39
name but
47:39
they took authority over the any enemy
47:42
to prevent things from happening or
47:43
interfering
47:45
they prayed on behalf of so many people
47:48
who had answers to prayer
47:49
were healed and didn't even know why
47:50
that happened you're gonna know you will
47:52
know those people who did that in heaven
47:54
god will make sure that they're honored
47:56
really good um you talked about spending
47:59
time with jesus and
48:00
and in the past and then if you said
48:03
there was a garden and whenever you want
48:05
to spend time with the lord
48:06
he would come and so here's the question
48:09
if
48:10
if you spend time you spend a couple
48:12
hours with the lord this morning or
48:13
today because i
48:14
don't know if there's morning noon or
48:15
night they're just today
48:18
and you go to your friends and see your
48:19
three other friends and you say i spent
48:21
a couple hours with the lord today
48:23
three or four other friends could say
48:25
the same thing we all spent a couple
48:26
hours with the lord today too private
48:28
time
48:28
is that would it work that way yes
48:32
you people need to understand the word
48:35
layer is so important in heaven you
48:38
yourself
48:39
are a layered being you have a body soul
48:42
and spirit those are layers of
48:44
you okay but they're still you
48:47
your soul itself has layers it's your
48:50
mind your will and your emotions god
48:52
made layers
48:53
holy spirit is an unlimited layer
48:57
being so holy spirit can be everywhere
49:00
at the same time the same way jesus does
49:02
that
49:02
he takes a layer of himself and sends it
49:05
somewhere but that is a whole of him
49:08
jesus does the same thing jesus can do
49:10
the same thing
49:11
he can be in more places than one at a
49:14
time but it's still fully him
49:17
that's hard for your human mind to
49:19
understand or conceive because
49:21
we can't do that ourself here and yet
49:24
people are seeing another country's
49:27
preaching
49:28
and jesus would reach and take a layer
49:30
of them
49:31
we have a layers of ourself too it's
49:33
involved in our soul the layers of our
49:35
soul
49:36
are all of our emotions and he'll take
49:38
it and send it to a foreign country to
49:40
preach maybe even while we're sleeping
49:42
that's still you when people see you
49:44
they'll say i saw you you were preaching
49:47
here
49:47
you pray for me and that all is real
49:50
that's not something that's made up so
49:52
jesus has the same ability
49:54
being the king of kings he has
49:58
many layers so he can be with different
49:59
people all over the world right now
50:01
and it's a real encounter he's really
50:03
with them so
50:04
in heaven that's just the same way it is
50:07
interesting very very good here's a
50:10
question from
50:10
one of the viewers is does god grieve
50:13
too
50:13
does his heart break sometimes does he
50:16
grieve
50:17
or is he just joyous all the time it
50:20
says in the bible that sometimes he
50:22
weeps over certain things
50:23
so i think he does sometimes do that
50:27
it isn't like us like if we grieved and
50:30
it stayed in our soul it would affect
50:32
our whole being
50:33
that doesn't happen to him but there are
50:35
some things that he's
50:36
not happy with or some things that does
50:39
move his heart
50:40
okay it moves his heart i know he sings
50:42
over us he laughs
50:44
and um he loves to be with us he doesn't
50:48
like evil he cannot stand or bear evil
50:51
he doesn't like it when anything happens
50:53
to any of us
50:54
but the one thing he despises the most
50:56
is when
50:57
anyone messes with his babies
51:01
he does not want people messing with the
51:03
unborn it is like
51:05
one of the worst crimes it even says in
51:08
the bible
51:08
that if you you were involved in
51:10
abortions that would be better than um
51:12
be better worse be worse for you
51:16
and when they say millstone in the bible
51:18
i'm not talking about a little rock
51:20
millstones are the size half the size of
51:22
your house they grind
51:24
they have like water mills even back in
51:26
the old time sometimes they still have
51:27
some
51:28
these massive things that that weighed
51:30
probably tons
51:31
it'd be better for you if your
51:33
punishment was having one of those tied
51:35
around your neck and thrown in the sea
51:36
than what he's going to do to you
51:38
for you messing with his unborn because
51:41
he chooses to send them here for a
51:43
purpose when you
51:44
end your life you are really probably
51:47
going to be on the worst side of god
51:49
possible
51:50
and just to clarify for anyone who's
51:53
just heard that
51:54
you're also saying or i don't want to
51:56
put words in your mouth that anyone who
51:58
did that
51:59
is doing that has done that if they
52:01
repent
52:02
there's forgiveness and that that can be
52:04
there's absolutely forgiveness
52:06
there's absolute forgiveness you can
52:08
repent for doing that
52:10
and i've told many people who had
52:11
abortions repent
52:13
of what you did when you get to having
52:15
the very baby
52:18
that has life ended will be given them
52:20
back to you to raise that's the mercy
52:22
and the love of god
52:23
but people who do this for a living and
52:26
never repent
52:28
i wouldn't want to be them oh wow
52:31
so you're saying if somebody had an
52:33
abortion i know i think uh
52:35
jim baker's wife that she's been married
52:38
to 15 years whatever it's been
52:40
had five abortions and then she adopted
52:42
five children
52:44
but you're saying when she goes and she
52:46
talks about it publicly so it's her
52:47
public testimony yes
52:49
uh lori i think is it when she goes to
52:51
be with the lord
52:52
she will have five babies to raise yes
52:56
wow wow and the same thing for anyone
53:00
else who's had multiple
53:01
and the same thing for those who've had
53:03
multiple miscarriages they would have
53:04
those babies to raise
53:06
absolutely yes they will have their
53:08
babies when they get to heaven
53:10
that's just crazy grace you know that's
53:12
good good greedy grace um
53:14
someone wants to know if you've seen
53:15
samson in heaven and if so what does he
53:17
look like i'm just curious if you've
53:19
seen him
53:19
i have seen samson i actually just
53:22
answered um
53:23
i think hank kind of asked that question
53:26
i wanted to show
53:27
i actually texted him the answer and uh
53:30
he said he figured that to say you know
53:33
hank doesn't care if you talk about him
53:35
if it's good
53:36
hank it talked about samson's hair must
53:38
have had the most glorious hair because
53:39
you know his hair was his gift right it
53:41
was his
53:42
right and i said i had told hank well
53:45
samson has won the best prize ever for
53:47
the best hair in heaven
53:51
and now he's in his spiritual body in
53:53
heaven of course we know that but your
53:55
body has definition in heaven even
53:58
though it's
53:58
living in a spiritual world in your
54:00
spiritual body it's sort of like being
54:01
on the earth
54:02
you can hug each other and touch each
54:04
other so yeah
54:06
a samson was really had really muscles
54:09
on muscles
54:10
he did even though he was extremely
54:12
muscular
54:13
his hair got anointed that hair
54:16
and as long as he had the hair he had
54:18
supernatural strength so he was already
54:20
strong
54:21
but with that hair that god gave him
54:23
that blessing and it gave him
54:24
supernatural strength
54:26
and most of the time he enjoyed it
54:28
himself what he looked like
54:30
but i was saying at the end of his life
54:32
he chose to let god
54:33
have his will his hair grown back out
54:36
he did wipe out a lot of evil people
54:38
even in the end with his supernatural
54:40
strength so
54:41
yeah i've seen samson sims and totally
54:43
made it
54:44
wow awesome good thing
54:50
someone wants to know and i don't know
54:52
if there's an answer to this this is can
54:54
you describe a typical day in the life
54:56
of those are in heaven there's really
54:57
day always day right it's not like
55:00
there's days and then there's another
55:01
day
55:04
they actually they kind of keep track of
55:07
things like that according to events
55:09
yeah people have more than one event to
55:11
go to they have so many events to choose
55:13
from
55:14
everybody's you know you just know and
55:16
someone could be standing like
55:18
um if my dad is in heaven my brother
55:20
who's there now was in his own mansion
55:22
in heaven
55:23
and out in christmas town if my dad was
55:26
gonna have
55:27
a big cookout and invite people he would
55:29
just say hey tim
55:31
i'm having a cookout make sure you come
55:33
by
55:34
i'm going to get started soon my brother
55:36
would just leave immediately and go
55:37
there to my dad's ranch
55:39
and that's how people know things are
55:41
happening and then there's things
55:42
heaven puts on a big event heaven puts
55:45
on
55:46
in the throne room outside the throne
55:48
room along the crystal sea
55:50
the father always does all kinds of
55:52
things so everybody can come and enjoy
55:54
them
55:55
you hear that announcement and you go so
55:58
i guess if you
55:58
kept track of the things that you did i
56:01
guess you could keep track of all the
56:02
events you went to
56:03
you would just know that you've been
56:04
really busy lately
56:06
so you wouldn't be so the language of
56:08
heaven you would never say well remember
56:10
yesterday when we did this and tomorrow
56:11
let's do that
56:12
that wouldn't be in your in your
56:14
vocabulary would it yes
56:16
you have to change the whole way you
56:17
talk but you could say this uh
56:19
didn't we have a good time when elijah
56:21
came by and he was showing us all these
56:23
amazing things
56:25
that were in heaven that we could go and
56:27
see and know about and that does happen
56:30
and they went i can't i can't wait to go
56:32
there it'll be exciting to go visit
56:33
those places he talked about so that's
56:35
really how you talk about it
56:38
you'll always say didn't we enjoy this
56:40
or did you love that or what was the
56:42
best thing you've been to
56:44
so far or what are you planning to go
56:46
and do you
56:47
learn how to talk when you're up there
56:49
but it's different talking about a
56:51
spirit realm and it's different talking
56:53
about things when there's no
56:54
stopwatch or whatever and people also
56:57
say
56:58
if you pass somebody on the streets to
56:59
go wow we need to get together
57:01
i'm just going to let you know i'm going
57:02
to have something planned or you let me
57:04
know when you've got something planned
57:05
and will come
57:06
that's how they handle it interesting
57:09
and you know speaking of
57:10
elijah's visiting with elijah who stands
57:14
out
57:14
in heaven that you've seen as far as
57:18
they turn out to be a real character
57:19
they're just a hoot they're
57:21
they're joyous they're having fun
57:23
anywhere from the lord himself down to
57:25
anyone you've seen does anyone stand out
57:27
yeah king david really yeah
57:31
he's a red-haired guy right doesn't he
57:33
have red hair
57:34
he has really red hair he's got this
57:36
beard that comes to a point
57:38
and he loves it and not not in a way
57:40
like israel but he loves his beard but
57:42
he
57:42
on purpose everyone who goes to heaven
57:45
is going to get a chariot ride but he'll
57:47
come by and just get you unannounced
57:49
get you in there but his chariot goes
57:51
through the sky of heaven he takes you
57:52
on tours really
57:54
cracks he'll crack jokes the whole time
57:57
and he'll
57:58
laugh and laugh and laugh king david
58:00
loves people
58:02
and the other person that really stands
58:04
out
58:06
you get undone besides of course jesus
58:08
christ i mean you
58:09
everybody feels like you're just going
58:10
to melt and step inside of him he's
58:12
going to step inside you which he does
58:14
sometimes
58:15
and then you you burn with such love for
58:17
him is spiritual love but it's the
58:19
greatest love ever
58:20
so being with jesus who is also a
58:22
character
58:23
you hear people laughing all the time
58:26
really
58:27
walks with you you're going to not stop
58:29
laughing the other thing you're going to
58:30
see jesus at is if somebody's having a
58:32
party
58:33
if someone's having a party that
58:35
includes dance not dance like earthly
58:37
dance but fun dancing like old type
58:39
things and
58:40
how many do like waltzes and stuff and
58:42
some of these big events that they have
58:44
jesus has him at his own mansion and i
58:47
was surprised to find out he had one but
58:48
god said well he lived on the earth as a
58:50
human
58:51
he certainly deserves his own and his
58:53
home engines mainly one big dance floor
58:55
with dessert tables all around it
58:57
so jesus loves parties that's why he was
59:01
at the wedding that's why he was invited
59:03
to weddings and so if there's food and
59:06
flowers and fun i know he's the king of
59:09
he's a king of war right now and he's
59:11
our fierce warrior
59:13
but in heaven he didn't have to war and
59:16
he was liked and recognized as being fun
59:19
to be around even by
59:20
sinners he was captivating he still is
59:22
but
59:23
enoch i have to say even
59:26
looking at him which is you get undone
59:30
seeing i i can't say ancients that's not
59:32
really a word in heaven
59:34
you see the relationship the strength of
59:37
the relationship you have with god
59:39
on the earth why god took him and kept
59:41
him and his eyes are like emerald green
59:44
and you hear him coming before
59:46
he arrives so no one is
59:49
ever going to be bored they are
59:51
captivated by the presence of
59:53
being there and yes many people throw
59:55
themselves on the ground of heaven and
59:57
actually
59:58
kiss the ground of him and say thank you
60:00
jesus thank you god for
60:02
for letting me come here you see that
60:04
happen in heaven
60:05
and people run up and they'll hug people
60:07
and say we're so glad you're here
60:09
no one's rejected no one is despised and
60:12
just so people know this
60:15
every tribe tongue and nation will be
60:18
there
60:19
there's no ethnicity there's no racism
60:22
there's no rejection of anybody
60:25
who's in heaven they're all loved not
60:27
just by father son of the holy spirit
60:29
but by everybody
60:30
there so no one is alone in heaven
60:34
everyone is honored in heaven and loved
60:36
and everyone is not just loving them
60:38
they're excited that they're there
60:40
and you really understand that people
60:42
are excited to see you
60:44
that's amazing hey one last question you
60:46
talked about the ethnicity
60:48
jesus was born uh a jewish man
60:52
and it's the father
60:56
a lighter skin than what yeah so
61:00
say just describe it because i have
61:02
heard actually
61:03
teachings about that go ahead and
61:04
describe what you're going to say well
61:07
i've seen jesus on the earth and i see
61:10
jesus in heaven and uh if you get close
61:14
his skin
61:14
is a deep olive color it's great
61:18
he walked down on the earth i mean he
61:19
didn't get a second skin
61:21
he had his body back when he came up to
61:23
the grave he got his body back
61:26
and uh it's in perfect shape but he kept
61:29
the scars as a testimony
61:31
you know the holes and the hole isn't
61:33
here
61:34
the holes down here this massive hole
61:37
right here
61:38
wow that they had to put them to there
61:40
or he this would not have held him on
61:42
the cross
61:42
okay so you see that people think that
61:45
they're
61:46
they're precious and priceless to people
61:48
because they know he paid a price
61:50
but he definitely has beautiful olive
61:52
skin he's
61:53
got dark um beautiful hair it's waves
61:57
it's not like real tiny tiny kiki but
61:59
it's kind of waves
62:01
and i've seen when he begins to release
62:03
the glory from himself
62:04
the hair can turn actually white really
62:08
from the glory coming from him uh enoch
62:10
has
62:11
his skin is not pale at all because you
62:14
know enoch
62:15
and elijah both have their natural skin
62:18
that has been kept by god all this time
62:21
you know they didn't die they never died
62:23
you just caught them up there and
62:24
they're still there in heaven
62:25
so what color is their skin what color
62:27
is eating it is he
62:28
whiter or is he darker you have everyone
62:31
needs to understand
62:33
did they live the country they lived in
62:35
they couldn't have pale skin
62:37
they would have they would have burned
62:39
up from the sun obviously because
62:40
a lot of people spent more time outside
62:42
back then god would have given them the
62:45
right kind of skin
62:46
to live in that region which would have
62:48
been very sunny so they both have
62:51
nicely like nicely tanned skin i've seen
62:54
and elijah and and they look in
62:57
perfect condition they look like they're
62:58
in their maybe early 20s
63:00
maybe early 30s there's they're timeless
63:03
right now even the physical bodies are
63:04
timeless
63:05
so there's no wrinkles in anybody's skin
63:07
not even them
63:09
it's quite a delight you just walk
63:12
through heaven looking you don't know
63:13
where to look there's so much to see
63:16
and enjoy and people do make lists
63:19
they give them this little thing and
63:20
they put notes in it and they say when
63:22
my
63:22
they put their family members name i'm
63:24
going to take them here here and here
63:26
and this one here here and here so
63:28
they're making plans for people
63:30
wow before you get there they're going
63:32
to have a whole a lot of places to take
63:34
you
63:34
wow very very good well that's our time
63:37
man this is so good we can do two hours
63:39
easily but
63:40
we'll keep it short we'll keep them
63:41
wanting for more can be sure and tell
63:43
people that how they can get a hold of
63:45
your
63:45
websites and all that i'm glad you asked
63:48
because i probably never say anything
63:50
i'm so
63:50
i'm surprised you know i tell people
63:53
people say they want to be me and when i
63:54
have to be me
63:55
you have to be you he may do you but i
63:58
do have a commission
63:59
because a lot of people say how come you
64:01
go all the time and i don't i have a
64:02
commission
64:03
like when he sent me from heaven it was
64:06
going to be my commission
64:07
to be caught up to heaven and shown
64:09
heaven for the purpose of revealing it
64:11
and these days
64:12
he's not hiding what heaven is he's not
64:14
even hiding himself
64:16
and he wants you to know him so my one
64:19
website is revealingheaven.com
64:22
where you can get things like i love

03:50
this zap at commercial let me remind
03:51
people about our
03:53
platform that they can go to so
04:02
[Music]
04:22
[Music]
04:35
awesome there it is if you want to go on
04:37
to it we are in the app store as well
04:39
you go to zappa.com
04:41
we are very facebook like it's not an
04:44
exact copy but it's similar
04:46
so if you use facebook you'll be able to
04:47
use it there's tens of thousands of you
04:49
all
04:50
on there now the more people you tell
04:52
the more of your friends will join that
04:55
so if you want to talk politics or
04:57
pro-trump or
04:58
anything like that you're welcome to do
05:00
that and you will not
05:02
be um we're not going to come on and say
05:05
that's fake news
05:06
i've told people several times it will
05:09
never be our job to determine if
05:11
something is fake news unless it's
05:12
something
05:13
really really blatant that's the job of
05:16
the
05:16
viewers or the users before
05:20
facebook got woke and did all that they
05:23
did if you posted something
05:26
and people disagreed they would write to
05:28
you and they'd say
05:29
that's that's fake they they may not
05:33
have used the term news but they'd say
05:34
that's been debunked that's the you know
05:37
the users will self uh clean the list
05:40
they'll let you know
05:42
or they'll write you privately so that's
05:43
the way it should have always stayed
05:46
but uh facebook had a different idea
05:48
which is not a good idea so
05:51
all right that's uh i think our
05:53
preliminaries let's bring kat
05:54
in here there she is
05:58
hey cat good to see you
06:01
i was just complimenting her and her
06:03
brand new haircut looks really nice and
06:05
uh
06:06
yes he's looking very spiffy is it it's
06:09
more blonde in the back
06:10
isn't it yes it is you can see that
06:13
is it normally that blonde in the back
06:16
it is it always is
06:18
there's no pink in the back part at one
06:21
time
06:22
now all god said was we need you to have
06:24
pink highlights in your hair
06:26
and within a couple years of doing that
06:28
it was all pink i have to jump
06:30
my entire head is hot pink and the holy
06:33
spirit said um
06:34
you don't need to be quite that
06:36
[Laughter]
06:38
but there is a way if if i had time
06:41
um i could pull some of the white from
06:43
underneath here and have like streaks
06:45
which is what i like so
06:47
um
06:50
it looked better but yesterday last
06:52
night everybody has heard most people we
06:54
have brand new little baby kittens
06:56
born um and some of them are outside so
06:59
i had to stand outside in the floor to
07:01
heat
07:02
and so my nice new hairdo kind of went
07:04
flatter than it was supposed to be
07:07
and that reminds me because we were
07:08
talking about your hair and use it and
07:10
you said
07:11
the mentoring program is about to begin
07:14
and so tell people about that
07:15
but the reason i'm bringing it up now is
07:17
because you said you were doing
07:18
something different with your hair
07:20
during the mentoring thing which i
07:21
didn't quite get the connection but go
07:23
ahead
07:25
at one time also my hair was extremely
07:27
radical looking like it had this
07:29
kind of spikes sticking out um i liked
07:32
that
07:33
god said you're going to go softer for a
07:35
while because i'm going to introduce a
07:37
whole lot of people that don't know you
07:39
and i guess that would be more
07:41
acceptable i don't know but he told me a
07:43
couple weeks ago okay you're going to go
07:45
and you're going to go radical because
07:47
of
07:48
the mentoring program which is
07:50
revelation on the army of god
07:52
and i don't mind just telling anybody
07:54
it's called spirit force
07:56
and what is that well it's not the air
07:58
force and it's not
07:59
space force that should give you a
08:01
little bit of an idea is spirit force
08:03
is as operating fully as the body of
08:06
christ
08:07
it's going to be such it's going to be
08:09
such a
08:10
crush to the enemy's plans i'm talking
08:13
about the spiritual enemy
08:15
okay um it's gonna be powerful it really
08:18
is
08:19
it will be free so don't worry about
08:21
paying something i know
08:22
my cfo goes free i want god said it'll
08:25
be free
08:26
but one thing he will allow us to do is
08:28
we will have products available
08:30
probably like t-shirts hats all kinds of
08:33
gear
08:34
that is either a cadet a captain or a
08:36
commander see god's getting
08:38
all of this from the time it took me to
08:40
drive from my home
08:42
from my office to the salon in 15
08:45
minutes he downline
08:46
downloaded the entire spirit force
08:49
mentoring program
08:50
in me that's just how he does it with me
08:52
so it'll change your life forever
08:54
we'll let you know when you can sign up
08:56
for that not yet
08:58
but he said you will look a little bit
08:59
more radical because you're going to be
09:01
fierce against the enemy
09:03
and i think it might start something new
09:05
even in the fashion industry some of the
09:07
stuff we'll have available
09:08
but also the hair so if i look fierce
09:12
it's not against you
09:14
it's against my worst enemy and your
09:17
worst enemy
09:18
is against hell so there you go
09:21
absolutely
09:22
and and um very i don't know of anyone
09:24
that's doing a whole mentoring program
09:26
for free so
09:27
don't don't think it's uh less valuable
09:29
because it's free it's very very
09:31
valuable people keep saying
09:33
have can explain this have her explain
09:36
which capture in fact i have a
09:37
question or two about that have her
09:39
explain this she's going to be
09:40
doing that yes i am it's not going to
09:43
cost you a dime but you need to sign up
09:45
for it
09:46
talk one more time about for now about
09:48
that logo did you say that's the logo
09:51
that the
09:51
that the angels wear what is that
09:54
yourself yeah
09:55
yeah yeah this is the logo for the
09:58
for the heavens army this represents
10:02
the host of heaven and um it's an
10:05
age and an eye it's the host initiative
10:08
the father
10:09
literally caught me up to heaven and and
10:11
he held out a scroll
10:13
and showed me the scroll a scrolling
10:15
heavens not a piece of paper parchment
10:17
paper you unroll
10:18
it's a living thing because it's heaven
10:22
there was this living scroll that had
10:24
movement in it
10:25
and life in it and when he opened it i
10:28
saw this whole thing shoot out
10:32
that showed me that it was us commanding
10:35
the
10:36
army of heaven the host initiative
10:39
usually a coup or anything that has to
10:42
do with
10:43
an initiative is a group coming together
10:46
some type of group
10:47
well you all know about the what is it
10:49
the avengers
10:50
initiative or something like that anyway
10:52
the host initiative is something god's
10:54
always had planned even before you were
10:56
on the earth he planned this
10:58
the army of heaven will not complete
11:00
their entire destiny they weren't made
11:02
to protect heaven they remained a war
11:03
with us
11:05
and that's what this host initiative
11:06
will do in 2014
11:09
uh he he gave this to me and chris
11:12
our great media guy tech guy art guy
11:15
he does a lot has wear a lot of hats he
11:17
actually
11:18
designed this from a little sketch i
11:20
gave him it's an open
11:21
portal behind this hi which means heaven
11:25
is coming in
11:27
we have some big ones there you go oh
11:29
nice wow
11:30
and you're very classy you can put this
11:33
on your car it's a magnet
11:35
it's amazing i can see a little bit
11:37
better you see the h in the eye the eye
11:39
is a lightning bolt
11:41
that's just gonna tell how they were
11:43
kicked out of heaven that's what that is
11:46
and the little dot the dot on the
11:48
lightning bolt is actually an
11:50
eye of one of the host of heaven because
11:52
they don't all have round eyes
11:55
they say that again they don't all have
11:56
what they don't have all their eyes on
11:59
around the army of heaven
12:00
some are like this is like a diamond
12:03
shaped kind of an eye see it
12:05
yeah and even has facets in it
12:09
and i have met some of the the army
12:12
creatures that look like that
12:15
and so that's what that is it represents
12:17
the army of heaven
12:18
and us uh warring together with them
12:21
because you know we don't pull down the
12:23
strongholds people people try they die
12:25
okay you can't do that but it says in
12:27
the bible our weapons
12:29
are not natural they're not they're not
12:31
fleshly
12:32
they're spiritual they are mighty to the
12:35
pulling down the strongholds that would
12:37
be the army of heaven
12:39
that's why he made them and so and god
12:42
always planned that from the beginning
12:43
even when they didn't have an uh
12:45
enemy to fight the army was made and so
12:48
we
12:49
for the first time literally in 2014
12:52
they were released to come i saw
12:53
millions of them coming to the earth
12:55
they will be a great part of spirit
12:57
force training
12:59
so you won't escape knowing about the
13:01
army of heaven
13:02
working together with the army of god
13:04
that's us on the earth it will be very
13:06
powerful
13:07
very good i'm looking forward to it well
13:09
kev before we went on the air you said
13:11
you had some
13:12
something i don't know if you used the
13:13
word harsh but or intense but it was
13:16
against it related to the government
13:19
let's just tell us what you got it's
13:22
kind of good
13:23
news actually although not for them i
13:26
think
13:26
that for the first time uh well not the
13:29
first time
13:30
but in in quite a while they are
13:32
experiencing fear
13:34
i'm talking about the left now they're
13:36
never going to tell you that
13:37
they don't tell you anything actually
13:38
except they want to brainwash you with
13:41
but i will assure you of this that the
13:44
foundation they built this whole
13:46
fake thing on the stake administration
13:48
the stake uh
13:50
uh presidency the the the election
13:52
stealing
13:54
all of that that was all planned
13:57
they planned it but what happened was
13:59
they built
14:00
on a foundation of darkness and a
14:03
foundation of evil
14:04
if you don't think they're evil look at
14:06
the laws they're trying to pass in this
14:08
country
14:09
one of the things i have to say that i
14:12
knew would happen god knew what happened
14:13
you know god doesn't tell you everything
14:14
at one time
14:16
he knew eventually the foundation that
14:18
they had built this whole thing on would
14:20
begin to crumble
14:22
number one god said i guess they forgot
14:25
america
14:26
is already free we are free we will
14:29
be free and they can't make us not free
14:34
good yeah we got it it's in our blood
14:36
it's in our
14:37
everything yeah it is it's on everything
14:39
we have and they're trying to take every
14:41
symbol away i think if we take the
14:43
symbol away
14:44
this won't be here anymore that's a joke
14:46
okay because it's in
14:48
us it was put in us from the time we
14:50
were born
14:51
it's what god made america for the land
14:54
of the free the brave
14:56
and the stubborn
15:00
that's true and i still remember the
15:03
comment made
15:04
on on the you know on the fake
15:06
inauguration day
15:08
when trump turned and he said well good
15:10
luck with that
15:11
that was his comment to the left you
15:13
know thinking they were actually had won
15:15
and were taken over
15:16
he said good luck with that he knew so
15:19
many things already
15:20
that would begin to happen number one
15:23
they
15:24
don't have the military on their side
15:27
and let me tell you who they love the
15:29
military love you know who
15:31
number 45 that's who they love and guess
15:34
who is our president
15:35
number 45 that's who our president is
15:38
if you didn't get that his name starts
15:40
with t
15:43
so when you hear me say the b person
15:45
that's the fake that's
15:47
god cause i'm actually a villain so if
15:48
you don't think god doesn't have
15:50
comments
15:51
so the villains and the illegitimate
15:53
side
15:54
fear is falling on them yay and that's
15:58
okay
15:59
because guess what they are not an
16:01
authority god reminding me again like he
16:04
needs to
16:04
he said remind them remind them
16:08
they are not in power they have stolen
16:12
when you're in a racing olympics and you
16:14
lose you don't win
16:16
you have no authority no say there's no
16:20
celebration
16:20
okay that is taken away and so because
16:24
nothing has happened against them like
16:26
literally coming dragging them out
16:29
they think they've won let me give you a
16:31
lesson
16:32
when the devil thinks he's won he gets
16:35
sloppy
16:36
he gets extremely unintelligent i'm
16:39
trying to be polite
16:40
and he'll even allow arguing amongst the
16:43
ones he's been controlling
16:45
that's already happening so there are
16:47
many so many people's eyes are being
16:49
opened
16:50
that if this continues if they get their
16:53
way
16:53
the fake ones you know the fake
16:55
administrators they get their way we're
16:56
not going to have a country it's finally
16:58
getting in their head
17:00
we this is the left this is the liberal
17:02
speaking who have big businesses the big
17:04
business the high tech
17:06
and even the media already beginning to
17:08
understand
17:10
number one they're not getting their
17:11
promises fulfilled case you didn't know
17:13
that you probably didn't
17:14
in order to do this whole takeover the
17:17
left had to
17:18
pay off or bribe or make promises
17:22
guess what china some some high people
17:26
in italy
17:26
were involved in this uh the high-tech
17:29
people were were also bribed with
17:31
promises of what they would have for
17:33
doing this
17:34
the media was all these people even some
17:37
of the medical facilities not all of
17:40
them
17:40
they were bribed by the left to continue
17:43
the virus
17:44
any way they could to keep us separated
17:46
to keep our mouths
17:48
masked uh because they don't want us to
17:50
oh lord if they ever get together
17:52
they're gonna find out what's going on
17:54
guess what is happening anyway
17:56
so their foundation is beginning to
17:58
crumble this is what the god what
18:00
the father said it's beginning to
18:01
crumble before the very eyes
18:03
they thought it would simply be easy
18:05
we're here we're taking over yay
18:08
and then nobody wants to do what they're
18:09
saying and the ones who voted for them
18:12
don't want them anymore so guess what
18:14
people
18:15
getting a whole lot closer closer to our
18:17
day of celebration okay i've got my
18:19
pillow ready right here
18:22
confetti
18:25
we went out and got some cake the other
18:27
day just to remind i said go out and buy
18:29
some chocolate cake so
18:30
you get those great big pieces it's
18:33
supposed to be a piece
18:34
it's more like two meals worth you know
18:36
but yeah
18:37
we're celebrating but i mean you know
18:39
that that event in tulsa uh
18:42
not last weekend but the week before
18:44
lynnwood and all the people were there
18:47
4 500 people inside and no one had a
18:49
mask on and it was celebratory and
18:52
and people were saying enough is enough
18:54
we're done we're not doing what they
18:55
tell us anymore
18:56
and that's spreading like like a good
18:59
virus
19:00
yeah more and more of us are saying
19:01
that's it they're already getting
19:03
backlash
19:04
from we the people we've had enough
19:08
okay and i will tell you this that if
19:11
they're
19:11
even if there wasn't there is a covert
19:13
plan but even if there wasn't
19:15
the rednecks in this country would
19:17
handle it yourself
19:18
and overnight there'd be a whole big
19:20
change they might be finding some bodies
19:22
somewhere i'm not being unkind
19:24
i'm being truthful the truth will make
19:27
you free
19:27
not more lies i will be attending
19:31
uh i'm not even sure how much of what
19:33
it's about right at this point just the
19:34
other day i was invited
19:36
to attend a major rally i don't know
19:39
it's a rally
19:40
it's like a summit thing the governor
19:42
will be there
19:43
governor desantis yay i love you
19:46
well he's a good man it's gonna be in
19:49
orlando and i'm actually getting
19:50
backstage passes i'm probably going to
19:52
get to meet people and stuff like that
19:54
i'm not a speaker on the platform but i
19:57
will be available if they have questions
19:59
for me
20:00
they're they're bringing in some profits
20:01
that they know are still standing
20:04
for truth and for freedom in our country
20:06
and i just got that invitation
20:08
so uh i'm looking forward to that maybe
20:11
i probably can give a report on it after
20:13
after that
20:14
that would be awesome i mean robin
20:16
bullock went there to mar-a-lago and he
20:18
said the people the
20:19
the kitchen workers were all watching i
20:22
don't know if it was the livestreams or
20:24
his
20:24
show he didn't say but they they knew
20:26
who he was
20:28
yeah i think they know who we are
20:33
i get more comments about
20:36
even new people say i've never saw you
20:38
before i found you on the live
20:40
streams i went back and watched every
20:42
one of them i could
20:44
and i get more comments uh telling
20:46
people
20:47
saying thank steve for elijah's dreams
20:50
and that is one of some people it's
20:52
their number one
20:53
place to go to for truth steve you need
20:56
to know that remember
20:58
remember when i said to you that god
21:00
said to tell steve he's one of the most
21:01
important
21:02
people on planet earth right now i
21:03
remember you saying that i had a hard
21:05
time believing
21:06
well it's happening it's happening
21:09
that's amazing that's amazing well i
21:12
guess let's get into some questions for
21:14
about heaven for anyone that's new cat's
21:16
literally been transported to heaven
21:19
thousands of times god or god will walk
21:21
through the wall so she's got a lot of
21:22
revelation
21:23
and we get a lot of repetitive questions
21:25
so we try we're trying to give new
21:27
questions be sure you go back
21:29
if you ever on the youtube channel under
21:31
the video tab you can see every single
21:33
show we did with cat and every single
21:35
one of those we have questions about
21:37
heaven and we try not to duplicate too
21:39
much
21:40
so they're all new and fresh revelation
21:42
but if you're ready
21:43
i'm ready yeah i just want you to know
21:46
that people
21:47
people have said along with telling you
21:49
thank you
21:50
never have they been so excited about
21:52
heaven and not just heaven but their
21:54
future here
21:55
because they said i have really learned
21:57
about the father i've learned so much
21:59
about jesus my relationship of intimacy
22:01
is increasing
22:02
and now i even have revelation of holy
22:04
spirit but knowing where we'll be going
22:06
one time
22:08
this is people saying this i have so
22:10
many letters and things from people and
22:11
emails and texts and comments
22:13
they're excited about their life in
22:16
eternity but also right now and that's
22:18
because
22:19
you and i and god we know that was god's
22:22
plan
22:23
to do this every week they know every
22:25
single week there's probably people all
22:26
over the world right now
22:28
watching this right now on this
22:30
broadcast hi everybody we love you
22:33
yes we do it's may 5th may 5th oh by the
22:37
way it's not may day mayday is may 1st
22:39
we should sell okay that's me
22:40
first okay it is may 1st here's my
22:42
little calendar that i don't have
22:44
attached
22:45
this is the the cinco de mayo which it
22:48
just means the 5th of may
22:49
yeah and i don't know what it celebrates
22:52
but it's something good i think it's
22:53
independence for
22:55
mexico i'm not sure the huge festival
22:57
they have i think my mom when she was in
22:59
um
22:59
arizona got to celebrate that with my
23:01
uncle one time it is huge it's
23:03
everywhere
23:04
and most of the spanish communities have
23:07
that
23:08
and it is a big day to celebrate they
23:10
eat food
23:11
they they probably have dance and i have
23:14
not
23:14
attended one yet but i've heard a lot
23:16
about them awesome hey and someone send
23:19
us
23:20
i don't normally do this on the air but
23:22
i i was thinking the other day
23:24
why don't we have someone that's on the
23:27
level of the prophets that we're having
23:29
on elijah streams
23:30
from mexico and i haven't found one i
23:32
mean there's people that will prophesy
23:34
don't get me wrong
23:35
there's thousands of people that
23:36
prophesy that we want
23:38
we want to find a prophet from from
23:41
south of the border
23:43
who prophesies on this level who gives
23:46
specific revelations so if you have some
23:48
of those
23:48
write to us and we'll begin to say it'll
23:50
take us a while to go through it and
23:53
and see but you know we got a very once
23:55
from canada
23:57
had a super anointed word for the for
23:59
the country of canada the other day
24:01
it was just like off off the chart
24:04
anointed and we'll have barry back so we
24:06
got
24:06
canada covered but we need mexico
24:09
coverage
24:11
well let's jump in uh okay so this is
24:14
my friend liz and she's asked this a
24:16
couple of times so i told her i would
24:17
make sure i
24:18
asked you this so she said um
24:21
can you please ask cat to speak again
24:23
about i she'd heard this and i had not
24:26
heard you say this cat
24:27
she said to speak again about how our
24:29
father is always writing
24:30
notes and designs and has actual
24:34
angelic scribes or stenographers around
24:36
him
24:37
he's always planning and designing
24:39
jotting things down
24:40
i have a couple of friends that watch
24:42
you and cat faithfully and they've
24:43
mentioned that
24:44
i've not heard you say that have you
24:46
said that i have
24:48
tell us about that well there the
24:51
it takes me always back to you know how
24:54
heaven operates of course
24:56
uh those scribe angels are under gabriel
24:59
i'll let you know that right now
25:01
every angel or member of the army and if
25:04
you ever meet one of the heaven's hosts
25:06
don't call them an angel
25:07
they want to be called the host that is
25:09
very distinct about who they are
25:12
army's all under michael of course all
25:14
of the worship angels in heaven
25:16
were under lucifer and he got that
25:19
one-third of the angels he got
25:21
they were worship angels who believed
25:23
him because he led them
25:25
and they believed his lies and they were
25:26
all kicked out with him so guess what
25:28
when we worship we replace them most
25:31
people don't know that
25:34
satan does not want you to worship he
25:36
doesn't want worship in church he
25:37
doesn't want it because we replace
25:39
what he used to do and that is uh either
25:42
lead in worship or
25:43
worship now some of them didn't get not
25:46
every worship angel got taken to
25:47
seraphim
25:49
who are over the thorn of god have one
25:50
of the most beautiful voices i've ever
25:52
heard in heaven they dip down out of a
25:54
glory cloud you hear them worshiping in
25:55
the throne room
25:57
so they're still there but most of the
25:59
worship
26:00
that's why it's important verse 3 that
26:01
comes from here it goes up to
26:03
to god before his throne but scribes the
26:07
scribes the messengers the couriers
26:10
the worker angels in heaven the ones who
26:13
deliver the body parts down to earth
26:16
uh ones are sent to record messages
26:18
those are scribes
26:19
and i i woke up one time and two of them
26:22
were actually sitting on the end of my
26:23
bed
26:25
with a word from god and they had this
26:27
thing written down
26:28
i couldn't understand the language i
26:30
don't even think i may have told this a
26:31
long time ago
26:32
but they held out this this like almost
26:35
like a notice or something
26:37
they say we have brought this written
26:39
and and the angel said from this day
26:42
forward god the father will be recording
26:45
every word spoken by every leader in the
26:48
body of christ
26:49
wow whether it's listen to this part
26:53
whether it's got a good report or not
26:56
so your words matter make sure they're
26:59
not wasteful words or even harsh words
27:01
or profane words for heaven's sake you
27:02
don't want that written down
27:04
and it does say that in in heaven you'll
27:06
be held accountable for every wasteful
27:08
word so you can imagine if you're
27:09
speaking things
27:11
beyond wasteful wastefuls just things
27:12
that disturb trouble or things like that
27:15
um it's not nice word you speak to
27:17
people but let me tell you when you
27:19
speak words that
27:20
draws brother against brother or you
27:23
repeat gossip
27:24
god doesn't like the repeating of
27:25
matters but he he was very distinct and
27:28
he didn't give a deadline on that he
27:29
just said from this day forward
27:31
the father will be recording every word
27:33
of every leader in the body of christ
27:35
it's a five-fold ministry
27:37
especially and those who call himself a
27:39
leader in the body your words have been
27:41
recorded for probably
27:42
right now probably about 14 years
27:46
leaders and you're you're not saying
27:48
every single person you're saying he's
27:49
recording the
27:50
of the leaders those who lead us in the
27:52
body of christ
27:54
that's right that's right wow
27:57
if you repent for some that you spoke
27:59
he'll wipe them out
28:01
well i was gonna yeah that's what i was
28:02
gonna ask if
28:04
that was your record if you're rewarded
28:06
for everything you've done
28:07
you've done good or evil you're saying
28:10
if you're saved
28:12
are the evil things uh are they're wiped
28:15
off the notes
28:16
so when you first get born again
28:18
everyone's
28:19
is every sin or everything you ever did
28:21
from that point
28:22
back in your life is wiped out
28:25
from that point forward you're held
28:28
accountable yourself for repenting if
28:30
you do things that are wrong that are
28:32
sin
28:33
um if you lie cheat steal
28:36
if you become a drunkard you know where
28:39
you hurt people
28:40
uh i can just go through the list it
28:42
talks about it in the bible right if you
28:43
commit adultery people that's
28:45
not okay with god i'm talking about
28:47
people who are believers right now
28:50
if you do any of those things if you use
28:52
profanity you need to say to god
28:54
in jesus i repent for those things i did
28:58
jesus will come according to first john
29:00
and he will wipe it away
29:02
and make you go from unrighteous to
29:04
righteous again it says jesus is
29:06
faithful and just to forgive you of your
29:09
sins those are the ones you repented of
29:11
and then he makes you righteous again
29:13
this is all scriptural but those scribe
29:16
angels were sent
29:17
from gabriel by order of the father
29:21
to give me that message and i never
29:23
forgot that
29:24
and um so i've i've always watched my
29:27
words but i really watch
29:28
them from them
29:32
a courier may actually come and hand
29:34
somebody a message sometimes they didn't
29:36
handle
29:37
it we're telling you about it so the
29:38
courier scribes worker angels will care
29:41
for places in heaven
29:42
who care for things on the earth all
29:45
those are in tribes god makes angels and
29:47
tribes and so
29:48
that's good god
29:52
does write things down he has books he
29:54
has a book of these days that we're in
29:55
now he writes things down like when you
29:57
say yes to what he wants to do
29:59
he records that and then when you obey
30:01
he really records your obedience
30:04
really people who are willing and
30:05
obedient will eat the fat of the land
30:07
by the way i was going to tell you this
30:09
is when i said this is from liz this is
30:11
from your friend and mine liz it's on
30:13
the same
30:14
text that we're on and she wanted to
30:16
know
30:17
she wanted to know she wanted to know
30:19
about the whole
30:20
design aspect too does is god making
30:23
notes about
30:24
designing things did you say something
30:26
about that
30:28
yeah he also does that i think the holy
30:30
spirit gets involved
30:32
a lot also with him the holy spirit is a
30:34
very creative
30:36
designer himself holy spirit loves to uh
30:39
is involved in drama
30:41
he's involved in drama and anything that
30:43
releases things in movies he's involved
30:46
in movies and writings
30:47
really really oh architecture
30:50
uh for the earth holy spirit is very
30:52
much involved with that so i'm sure the
30:54
father and he
30:55
i see them in his board room god the
30:57
father has a board room with the throne
30:59
in it
31:00
and sometimes he'll call people that are
31:02
already in heaven and to hear things he
31:04
has to say they get so undone
31:05
they're so undone he invited him to
31:07
listen but he and holy spirit sometimes
31:09
work on projects sometimes
31:11
jesus and the father sometimes all three
31:13
work on them but holy spirit is
31:15
definitely a creative designer uh
31:18
that's part of his what what he does and
31:21
when there's anything
31:22
he designs for apparel for architecture
31:25
they're already drawing them
31:26
and they'll drop them into the mind of
31:28
man or he'll just give them to a
31:29
specific person saying
31:31
and i i will say this i'll add this that
31:33
i happen to know that in vietnam watch
31:35
vietnam
31:36
that's something he specifically told me
31:38
about would be
31:40
leading in the apparel industry because
31:42
they don't use um
31:43
they don't use asbestos they don't use
31:45
formaldehyde they don't use
31:47
poisons and i've seen more and more of
31:50
their
31:50
clothing checking out their products
31:52
like for home accessories
31:54
and god said they're going to be huge in
31:56
the market and i'm going to turn their
31:57
heart to be
31:58
um not not communistic anymore
32:02
but want to work together and so i i can
32:04
release that
32:06
as a word that you'll see more and more
32:07
stuff from vietnam because a lot of
32:09
people are ditching china that uses
32:11
harmful stuff
32:12
i have to say whenever i say that not
32:15
every person in china is wicked please
32:17
don't believe that
32:19
it's normally the leaders and those who
32:22
back their leaders just like hitler
32:24
everyone in germany was not wicked and
32:26
evil okay that was hitler satan used him
32:29
those who were a part of what he was
32:31
doing is evil they were evil
32:32
i met people in germany they're very
32:34
kind-hearted they love
32:36
people they care about people they still
32:38
have the stigma
32:39
but you watch vietnam it'll begin to
32:41
rise up in the clothing and apparel
32:42
industry
32:43
a lot of stuff i find that was actually
32:45
made in vietnam i'm probably going to be
32:47
visiting them one day
32:48
god's going to uh bring me together with
32:50
some uh industry over there
32:52
to learn about stuff so yeah mom's
32:55
i want to ask you about you said movie
32:58
so the question
32:59
is sort of a multiple choice uh do you
33:01
mean the holy spirit gets involved
33:04
in christian movies only or just
33:06
allegorical movies does he get involved
33:08
in
33:09
star wars type movies yeah what kind of
33:11
movies does the holy spirit
33:12
involve himself in well he is called the
33:15
drama king which means he loves
33:16
excitement he loves intensity
33:19
he he loves beautiful things he loves he
33:21
loves
33:22
things that move the emotions of people
33:25
in a great direction
33:26
never anything in the darkness the only
33:28
time he does anything if it's a movie
33:30
just
33:30
bashing bashing darkness to pieces
33:34
where good always wins good wins over
33:37
evil which is really what star wars is
33:39
about
33:39
and i did not know this but jen said
33:41
yesterday was star wars day
33:43
when they say may the fourth be with you
33:46
it's crazy
33:47
but i myself love star wars and what it
33:50
stood for
33:51
you know in case anybody wondered stan
33:53
made it to heaven people
33:55
um of course he's marvel he's not
33:57
necessarily star wars
33:59
but i just had to throw that in there
34:00
for free um stan was the marvel guy
34:03
who even even to his very end was
34:06
designing and creating stuff
34:08
he always always like star wars george
34:11
lucas who started star wars
34:13
always wanted to show good over evil
34:17
awesome never in the movies was he's for
34:19
evil
34:20
and in those movies there's almost no
34:22
bad words and almost no sexuality is in
34:24
in the star wars movies uh there's like
34:27
sci-fi
34:28
violence like you see robots being blown
34:29
up and stuff like that
34:31
but it is for the good i'm telling you
34:33
the movies are exciting and fantastic
34:36
um and and i still appreciate watching
34:39
some of them
34:40
that's a good decent fantasy
34:44
did you literally see did you
34:47
literally say just now that the that
34:50
yesterday the fourth of may
34:52
that the holy spirit himself said may
34:54
the fourth
34:55
be with with you is that right did i
34:57
hear you right
34:58
they they actually do say that in heaven
35:00
but they actually say that
35:02
on the earth may the fourth be with you
35:05
and i want you to know that the force in
35:08
those movies
35:09
was god they actually
35:12
they probably hit it they probably have
35:14
hidden it but i
35:15
in the day was here when the first one
35:17
was released i was getting sick when
35:20
uh it's called a new hope of all things
35:21
where you will look when you meet the
35:23
main characters in star wars
35:25
and that would be luke you know and um
35:27
princess leia and all them
35:29
and how hope was being brought by guess
35:32
what a remnant of people to come against
35:34
the evil
35:36
fantasies it's true i'm sure steve is
35:38
seeing it and so
35:40
um god i know that the hope the new hope
35:43
actually shows in heaven
35:44
and you can actually sign up to be
35:46
characters in that movie it's heaven has
35:48
movies but they're they have to be
35:50
decent they have to be exciting there
35:53
can be no evil
35:54
things there's no witchcraft no
35:56
witchcraft in heaven and the thing about
35:58
star wars is they never had witchcraft
36:00
okay they did a great movie showing
36:02
villains that weren't witches that's
36:04
that's a good tip right there um which
36:07
is a real
36:08
there are no good ones i might as well
36:10
add that for you too
36:11
but i myself actually god's gonna hand
36:14
me produce movies one day
36:16
i knew i would write them but then the
36:18
father came to me said
36:19
i want you to get a marker and write on
36:21
the palm of your hand these words
36:23
and he said i'm writing him on my hand
36:25
at the same time this is how he does
36:27
things with me
36:28
and he he wrote he said right on your
36:30
hand heaven's producer
36:32
and he was talking about me so that's
36:34
how i knew
36:35
that's how i get new assignments and uh
36:38
there are some of the best movies that
36:39
haven't even been made yet that'll be on
36:41
this earth
36:42
some will be about christ some will be
36:44
about the spirit realm and the truth
36:46
about this being around but some of you
36:47
some of the best
36:49
action adventure movies you've ever seen
36:52
that will be
36:52
decent but powerful without profanity
36:55
without sexuality without witchcraft
36:57
and and there and they haven't even been
36:59
made yet but i already know people are
37:01
saying god's dropping things into me
37:03
like this
37:04
and people look at hollywood well stop
37:06
looking at the way it is now because
37:07
god's about to do something with that
37:10
you know you don't know this about me i
37:11
don't think i told you this but
37:13
years ago before i kind of got attacked
37:15
in my health but
37:16
i was at an airport in cincinnati and
37:19
i've got a man who was kind of a
37:21
simpleton
37:22
um you could tell he was he had a the
37:24
chronological age was
37:26
or his mental age was probably like five
37:29
or six
37:30
but he was an adult he was doing the
37:32
trash and he would come along and he
37:34
would tell everybody
37:36
who they look like and he'd say you look
37:38
like a plumber or you look like this
37:41
and he came up to me and he said excuse
37:42
me sir can i talk to you
37:44
and i said yeah and he says you look
37:46
like an independent film producer and i
37:48
sit and i was taking it back
37:51
and then he uh so then he left for a
37:54
while
37:54
he did more things an hour or two went
37:56
by because it was a long way
37:58
airport i was in the restroom
38:01
in one of the stalls i heard him come in
38:03
and begin to tell people who they look
38:05
like
38:05
he never ever ever repeated that same
38:08
thing
38:09
yeah and then i went back out to my same
38:11
place he came around he didn't
38:14
he acted like he had no idea he'd ever
38:16
spoken me ever and he said excuse me sir
38:18
can i tell you who you look like
38:20
and he go and i said sure he goes you
38:22
look like an independent film producer
38:24
right and i was stunned and i knew it
38:27
was the lord
38:28
yeah i didn't go back back in time like
38:30
two years ago i'm at
38:32
a cpe with a prophetic roundtable
38:35
and de havilland is her name
38:39
first name african-american woman and
38:41
she's talking to me i just didn't matter
38:43
and we were just talking
38:44
she stopped in mid-sentence she goes
38:46
you're going to produce
38:47
christian films and and all of a sudden
38:50
you know so she didn't say i've had like
38:52
four of those so
38:54
i know i i've got the same heart that
38:56
you do that
38:57
that just because we are prophetic
39:00
people doesn't mean god won't give us
39:02
these other kinds of
39:03
tasks which is the same word for
39:05
everyone watching
39:06
just because this doesn't mean you won't
39:08
also be that right
39:10
your abs that's absolutely true
39:12
especially in these days we're in why
39:14
they're so important
39:15
before we start getting accelerated
39:17
again people and i encourage people get
39:19
a journal i don't care if it's like a
39:21
dollar notebook
39:23
a spiral notebook if god has given you
39:25
ideas
39:26
for witty inventions or apparel draw
39:30
it you may not know how to make it but
39:32
if god gave it to you then you're
39:33
responsible for
39:34
it eventually at one point there will be
39:37
places you can take that and have things
39:38
made but even
39:39
movie scripts okay even books and but i
39:42
know movie scripts is a if god
39:45
could have had movies on the earth in
39:48
jesus time he would have used them
39:50
that's why he told
39:51
parables a parable is a movie without
39:54
the screen
39:57
they're huge on movies and he will be
39:59
showing so many powerful things
40:02
in movies right now in our own theater
40:04
there's probably one thing i'd even go
40:06
and see because the rest of it's very
40:08
dark
40:09
and um but i can promise you that is
40:11
going to be changing also
40:13
so write it down if you gave me
40:15
something
40:16
especially if it has to do with the
40:18
movies and i am an avid moviegoer but i
40:21
always check out what's in it before i
40:23
go see it that's good that's really
40:25
really really good
40:26
awesome awesome okay khalida had a
40:28
question she's
40:29
worded it a couple different ways she
40:31
lost her sister
40:33
in january uh cletus
40:36
is an assistant to one of our writers so
40:38
she's connected to the prophetic
40:40
but she says our loved ones go to the to
40:42
a portal and they declare
40:43
over us declaring for their unsaved ones
40:47
what
40:47
she wants to know what kind of authority
40:50
that
40:50
carries on earth and she also asked at
40:53
the same time
40:56
she said uh when we gather with the
40:58
family and are sad about my sister going
41:00
to be
41:01
uh to heaven would she her sister see
41:04
that
41:05
and how would she feel when she looks
41:08
down and she sees us being sad as her so
41:10
she wants to know if her sister is sad
41:13
when she sees that um
41:17
no not really you mean the ones in
41:19
heaven right
41:20
no one is sad in heaven there is no
41:23
sadness
41:24
at all nobody is sad they're living with
41:27
life itself they're living in the
41:29
presence of god
41:30
they've already been shown some of the
41:32
future for their loved ones
41:34
on the earth so really excited i'd have
41:37
to say
41:38
everyone in heaven is excited especially
41:40
right now because they know about the
41:41
big shift that god's gonna do
41:44
um they're not sad when they when they
41:46
when they when they look down they see
41:48
the great things god is doing but you
41:50
have to remember
41:51
even if someone's not doing something
41:53
right they see holy spirit
41:55
they see the angels of the person they
41:58
see the activities that going on in the
42:00
spirit that god is moving towards those
42:02
people
42:02
to bring them to him so when somebody
42:05
from heaven looks down it's not like you
42:07
just looking across the street it's not
42:08
like that
42:09
and they're living in an atmosphere of
42:12
even beyond
42:13
hope truth and they know that if
42:16
especially if they stood for that person
42:19
and back to the first thing where
42:20
they're declaring over their family
42:22
members
42:22
it has a great effect on that person if
42:26
you spoke over your family members while
42:28
you were on the earth
42:30
even though you're in heaven the words
42:32
you spoke are right here
42:34
going around them it's like i walk past
42:37
people
42:38
i'll hear voices around them that is
42:41
their family members declaring
42:45
oh yeah they don't forget you trust me
42:47
they're right there declaring over you
42:49
to know christ to become a believer and
42:51
that they will see you again they'll see
42:53
you in heaven one day
42:55
and those words what happens is when
42:57
someone's on the earth praying for them
42:59
and in heaven they're declaring over
43:00
them they get caught
43:02
in the smack of those decorations and
43:05
then the increase this is how heaven
43:07
does it boy if you know how they really
43:09
fully operated i don't have time to tell
43:11
everybody everything
43:12
but the way they operate in heaven is
43:14
magnificent
43:15
it is absolutely magnificent god takes
43:18
every opportunity to draw somebody
43:20
to him and you use many different ways
43:23
on the earth but those in heaven
43:24
absolutely will go to a portal and uh if
43:28
jen can hear me i wish he'd go get me
43:30
one so i could show it
43:32
um anyway so anyway i'm just letting
43:35
people know that god that created places
43:37
in heaven
43:38
that when you're there you can walk up
43:40
going this beautiful building you walk
43:41
up steps
43:42
and you look down to this massive
43:44
opening maybe a thousand people are
43:46
looking down
43:47
uh people on earth would call them the
43:48
balconies of heaven
43:50
uh but they have made these places and
43:52
they can look down they see you on your
43:53
birthday they see you at christmas they
43:55
see you
43:56
having babies they see you getting
43:57
married and i know when my daughter got
44:00
married in december i know my dad was
44:02
watching my grandmother my
44:03
great-grandmother
44:04
i know casey's friends who had passed on
44:06
were all watching from that portal in
44:09
heaven
44:10
but they also go there to declare over
44:12
you and oh here's one right here
44:14
um i'm hoping we can get out of the
44:16
plastic i'm just gonna i'm
44:18
old school people okay i know we have
44:20
technology but i'm very
44:22
spur at the moment people yeah let's

44:28

44:43
like a media
44:45
it's a media source really a monitor
44:48

44:50
on the right of this picture these two
44:53
different ones will show you
44:55
you'll begin to see your family member
44:57
about to get um
44:58
born again and everybody will get ahold
45:00
of ready go quickly to a portal
45:03
watch your family member get born again
45:06
and then the ones on the left they'll
45:07
begin to show the faces of those who are
45:09
about to come home to heaven
45:10
that's how they know so these places are
45:14
all over heaven
45:15
and yes your family members go up these
45:17
steps right here
45:19
and uh they look over this big balcony
45:22
and they'll declare
45:23
on your birthday they'll sing to you
45:24
they'll send these pedals if you begin
45:26
to feel peace when someone's passed
45:28
they're throwing peace petals petals
45:30
like flowers really
45:32
yeah with the peace of god they'll throw
45:33
them over top of you and they'll they'll
45:35
begin to consume you
45:37
and so yeah these places are real this
45:39
is one of the when the first places i
45:41
was taken to in heaven
45:43
and so uh and it's very huge this place
45:46
right here would probably hold a
45:47
thousand
45:48
um and when those thousand people cat
45:50
when those thousand people are looking
45:52
that each one of the thousand
45:55
will see the whole thing as if it's
45:58
their own movie screen or what
46:01
no it's like they're really here over
46:03
you
46:05
okay so they look down and looking down
46:07
on me
46:08
like if my dad was watching me right now
46:10
it'd be
46:11
he's right there watching me like like
46:14
not from far away it won't be far away
46:16
okay
46:17
it's like they're there and you can feel
46:19
their presence sometimes you may smell
46:21
their uh
46:22
favorite flowers or cologne um
46:25
or if you liked cookies or brownies and
46:27
you begin to smell them baking that
46:28
probably means that family member is
46:30
watching you from here
46:32
wow and we we have these on my website
46:35
revealingheaven.com if you're interested
46:37
but god
46:38
help me make them available you know i
46:40
think for a very small fee because
46:42
you know we we pay for the art we pay
46:44
for the coloring and the printing
46:46
and uh and so i love i used to travel
46:49
and show these i'd carry them
46:50
just like i am now and show them to
46:52
people and i'm just going to show you
46:54
one more
46:55
this is in the nursery of heaven with an
46:57
angel
46:58
i actually met him and he's holding a
47:01
little baby
47:03
that was miscarried and the parents will
47:05
have that baby when they go to heaven
47:06
one day
47:08
and uh and when they have them they'll
47:10
rock them in their arms and they'll sing
47:12
songs of god and the breath of god
47:14
nourishes their little spirits
47:17
is that i can't quite see the the photo
47:20
um
47:20
is the baby not quite fully formed yet i
47:23
can't quite tell
47:24
uh it's wearing a purple or pink outfit
47:27
can you see it now
47:28
yes yes is it fully formed
47:31
yes it is okay okay it's kind of small
47:34
so
47:35
wow so it's as
47:37
[Applause]
47:39
oh there you go so i said oh there you
47:40
go so it's as if it's a brand new born
47:43
baby like days old yes
47:47
yes wow and they they already they can
47:50
laugh
47:50
and play and sing and they can walk or
47:53
run
47:54
really
47:56
[Laughter]
47:58
that's really really really good well i
48:00
guess we have more questions i better
48:01
get to
48:02
i have so many more questions but um to
48:05
clarify
48:06
when when the thousands are standing
48:08
around that portal
48:09
and they look down you said it's as if
48:12
they're literally
48:13
here it's like three-dimensional is
48:16
everyone seeing the entire portal as if
48:19
they're in your living room
48:20
they're all looking at the same place
48:22
with seniors no everybody
48:24
sees what they desire to see everybody
48:27
sees their loved one
48:30
or maybe it's their pets that are still
48:32
on earth people still love their best
48:34
no they see only what they came to see
48:37
right so everybody could be seeing
48:39
something totally different when they
48:40
look now it's just how god does it
48:43
and last week you completely blew my
48:46
mind and some of you
48:47
that were watching because i was talking
48:49
about my dad barely made it to heaven
48:51
but he made it to heaven
48:52
and you interrupted me and you said the
48:54
lord wants me to tell you
48:55
that your father loves it every time you
48:58
say he made it to heaven
48:59
i had no idea that kind of thing would
49:02
happen
49:03
does that mean other people's loved ones
49:06
are hearing them say talk about how they
49:09
got to heaven and how they barely got to
49:12
heaven
49:12
and that kind of thing yes yes
49:17
that's just amazing that's just blue i
49:19
have been thinking about it all week
49:20
long too
49:21
so yeah i tell people you want to say hi
49:24
look up and wave you have said that
49:30
that's not talking to the dad they're
49:32
very alive their body's dead but they're
49:34
they're not dead i remember i think i
49:37
was on a cruise with you when you said
49:39
that and i thought
49:40
you know okay that's a nice thing but i
49:42
didn't mean to disbelieve it but
49:44
but this sounds more three-dimensional
49:47
believing it there right there
49:49
you know yeah that means my spiritual
49:51
father wade taylor went home in 2012
49:54
and he used to say god's gonna give me a
49:56
healing ministry
49:58
and he and he always prayed for the
50:00
healing but he
50:02
one day he intimated i can't remember
50:04
how it came about but maybe all
50:06
the healing ministry will be when i'm in
50:09
heaven do some people have a healing
50:10
ministry
50:13
in heaven i don't know i don't know
50:17
i don't know how that would work unless
50:19
maybe
50:20
they go to visit the babies in the
50:22
nurseries and just love on them
50:24
it's not probably like healing bodies
50:26
obviously their bodies aren't there
50:29
nobody gets sick nobody's handicapped
50:31
there's no blind people in heaven
50:33
everybody can see it but he can hear
50:34
everybody i think i thought he must have
50:38
meant
50:39
when i'm in heaven i'm going to have a
50:41
special anointing to pray for healing on
50:43
earth but that that's what i thought
50:45
maybe he meant
50:46
i i've never seen that i've never seen
50:48
that happening
50:50
okay okay that's a great thought though
50:53
okay here's a question
50:54
um can i ask my angel
50:57
um this is interesting i mean it might
50:59
be he says can i ask my angels
51:01
i think they mean the host i suppose
51:03
they ask my angels to draw their swords
51:05
and cut off the heads of any and all
51:07
devils
51:08
that i find that are attacking me and if
51:10
not what can they ask them to do
51:12
okay you cannot ask them you can't
51:15
kill a demon people right right
51:19
you couldn't do it yourself at all okay
51:21
number one you're spiritual you're
51:22
physical that's just not gonna happen
51:24
um if you if you had a physical sword it
51:27
would pass through them it wouldn't do
51:28
anything to them all right
51:30
so this is the thing you you can have
51:33
them
51:33
bound and and
51:36
your guardian angel number one is not
51:39
one of the hosts i have to let you know
51:41
that those are totally separate
51:43
the guardian angels come under gabriel
51:46
okay
51:47
your garden angels mostly look like
51:49
people but with
51:50
wings okay uh the hosts don't
51:53
mostly don't ever look like people they
51:55
look like creatures
51:57
um or they're made out of things like
52:00
light or sound i mean but they're real
52:02
and they're
52:03
they're they're fierce they can battle
52:05
the demonic
52:07
they can shred them but not kill them
52:09
and i mean they
52:11
they will literally shred them they can
52:12
leave marks on them they can't kill them
52:15
i've seen uh if i find that i'm going to
52:17
show it on
52:18
a live stream i'll just hold it up and
52:20
show it to people i
52:21
literally took a picture one time when i
52:23
first invited heaven's army according to
52:25
the protocol the father gave me invited
52:27
heaven's army to be one of my weapons
52:29
they began showing up outside in the sky
52:32
over my home
52:33
and one time not kidding there was a
52:36
whole group of them the ones that looked
52:37
like lions at the world guard they had
52:39
some demons in chains
52:42
and brought them over my roof and i got
52:44
a picture now sometimes
52:46
really i'm not kidding i'm not kidding
52:50
they were showing me the ones they had
52:52
captured and were dragging either for
52:55
judgment um because i have been in the
52:57
courtrooms in heaven where sometimes
52:59
demons are
53:00
dragged up and judged and then the
53:02
father deals with them they're either
53:04
thrown in a dry place
53:05
or they're thrown in chains um that's
53:08
what spear force is all about you're
53:10
gonna learn so much about that so i
53:11
don't have time
53:12
or won't answer any questions but i can
53:14
tell you you can
53:16
command your your army if you have an
53:18
army
53:19
now your guardian angel is mainly to
53:21
protect you from
53:22
a car hitting you or maybe the plane
53:25
blown up and saving you from that uh
53:28
that's mainly they're with you from the
53:29
time you're conceived you're guarding
53:31
angels there's usually more than one
53:33
and if you saw them most of them even my
53:35
own looks like
53:36
a 40-foot like muscular human with
53:39
massive a
53:40
massive wings he's got golden hair i've
53:42
seen him since i was little he goes
53:44
everywhere with me
53:46
he has literally saved my life like
53:48
physically saved my life many times
53:50
and i felt his arm hold me so i let me
53:53
get hit by a car so
53:55
your guardian angel does those things if
53:57
you want them to fight demons you better
54:00
invite heaven's army to be your weapon
54:01
the army
54:02
fights the dark army they pull down
54:06
strongholds which means it says your
54:08
your weapons are mighty to the pulling
54:10
out of strongholds that's right there
54:12
that's heaven's army okay
54:13
they can go and put on strongholds of
54:15
demons that have built themselves
54:17
against you to cause you to lose money
54:20
or even bring fear to you and your that
54:23
army will go and literally
54:25
yank them away from you and either put
54:27
them in chains and
54:28
send them somewhere to be dealt with but
54:30
they won't be there anymore
54:32
you'll find out freedom coming to you
54:34
that you don't have
54:35
fear anymore but that's why we've been
54:38
beat up for so long we were not aware
54:40
that's what they were made for although
54:42
that scripture is there people don't
54:43
have revelation on it
54:45
the army of heaven is one of our weapons
54:48
okay they're not going to be your best
54:49
friend don't sit down and have tea they
54:51
don't they don't
54:53
that's like going to an admiral of the
54:55
navy or somebody in a high-level
54:57
military position and say come on over
54:59
to my house today we'll have honey and
55:00
tea and toast okay
55:03
they want orders to deal with
55:06
the enemy whether it's our natural army
55:10
going against an evil natural army
55:12
or spiritual army going against a dark
55:14
army
55:15
you have to you have to say i take power
55:17
over all the part of the enemy
55:19
that is continually keeping me from
55:22
closing this deal to community keeping
55:24
me from owning a home that's a block for
55:26
me
55:27
i command my army to go and pull down
55:30
the strongholds of satan that's keeping
55:31
that from happening
55:33
that i will have favor when i go to
55:35
apply
55:36
that would be something that you would
55:38
say that's very specific that's
55:40
very specific because you're saying if
55:42
there was something that god intended
55:44
you to prosper on
55:45
you're not talking about he's hitting
55:47
you around he's not talking about
55:50
at this moment you're not talking about
55:51
i'm sick and i'm
55:53
you're saying there's a deal that needs
55:54
to be closed and i can command the
55:56
armies
55:57
to take care of the deal right yes but
55:59
also you can also send that same army to
56:02
potent spirits of infirmity
56:05
if you keep getting hit with the same
56:07
disease over and over again the same
56:08
sickness those same army
56:10
that belong to you you can come in and
56:13
pull down strongholds of
56:15
the spirits of infirmity that keep
56:17
attacking you attacking your family
56:19
that will also be finally god's just
56:21
going to say i'm giving it to all the
56:23
body of christ so that's why he designed
56:25
spirit force
56:26
it is a force to be reckoned with how
56:29
i have a force to be reckoned with with
56:31
this spirit force because you'll learn
56:33
how to do
56:33
all these things that you're hearing me
56:35
say i lived that way
56:37
i had to do it myself i had to receive
56:40
it i had to
56:41
operate in it and you start with 100
56:44
army army members when you invite them
56:46
now this is a thing
56:48
if you have sin in your life forget it
56:51
because they hearken under the word of
56:52
the lord they'll look at you to see
56:54
are you speaking the right words in your
56:56
life you know
56:57
if you're using profanity they're not
56:59
going to listen because christ doesn't
57:00
do that
57:02
so if you're being hateful to people if
57:04
you're wrongfully
57:05
accusing or abusing people yourself i'm
57:08
not saying
57:09
judgment needs to happen about the
57:10
situation and you're bringing facts
57:12
about somebody doing something i'm not
57:14
saying that
57:15
i'm saying you're going around gossip
57:16
and slashing people or doing it on
57:19
facebook or youtube don't bash
57:22
your arnold in there look at you and say
57:24
guess like i won't be doing
57:25
anything for a while well that's kind of
57:28
it can't is that a little bit the same
57:30
principle where
57:32
the scripture talks about husbands love
57:34
your wives and god
57:36
that your prayers be not hindered in
57:38
other words if you you're
57:39
mistreating your wife your prayers are
57:41
literally hindered
57:43
they're not going to work no and that's
57:46
the way they were
57:47
sent they they were given boundaries
57:49
just like when god sent you know
57:51
wherever god posted angels he put a
57:53
boundary around them they're not go
57:55
beyond the boundary
57:56
and so that's why your angels the army
57:59
is sent to war against the dark army
58:01
they're not going to kill your neighbor
58:02
i'm not going to kill your neighbor's
58:04
dog
58:05
they will just they'll probably say god
58:06
just take me back to heaven okay
58:08
you you are going to be accountable for
58:11
your life if you're going to
58:12
operate even the army of heaven they
58:15
have protocol they have to follow
58:17
a military person i know my husband was
58:21
in the marines
58:22
our military cannot act on their own can
58:25
they steve
58:26
they have to have orders from
58:28
headquarters they have to have orders
58:30
from the captains of where to go what
58:31
weapons to use
58:33
where is this going to happen the army
58:34
of heaven is the same
58:36
and the thing is this jesus didn't say
58:38
to the army of heaven i give you power
58:40
over all the part of the enemy he said
58:42
it to the believers
58:44
you can't send that army without saying
58:46
first and some people don't like
58:48
protocol
58:49
they're probably not getting much done
58:51
every time i send my arm you have to say
58:52
i take power over all the power of the
58:54
enemy
58:55
that is colluding or a part of the line
58:57
cheating and stealing
58:59
let's just say you know behind the
59:01
barbed wire
59:03
i command one million of my army to go
59:05
there begin to pull down everything
59:07
that's being hidden
59:08
every lying word every contract that's
59:10
being signed behind the scenes
59:12
i had to give them uh orders that were
59:15
definite
59:16
and they were strategic but i had to
59:18
take authority over the darkness working
59:20
there first or they couldn't
59:22
go that's why we have to have spirit
59:24
force and i'm going to read this really
59:26
quick
59:27
don bradley hello uh he said what are my
59:31
chances of getting
59:32
a message to cat i've tried for months
59:33
an important question she has not
59:35
covered in their conversations
59:37
how is it that good people often end up
59:39
in health they reject jesus christ
59:42
there's only one reason you're going to
59:44
howl you reject jesus
59:46
christ i don't care how nice you are
59:48
unless your sins are forgiven and
59:50
they're blood washed you're not taking
59:52
the flesh
59:53
of you you're not going to heaven and
59:56
polluting heaven
59:57
with with darkness and that's why god
60:01
he did not want us to come he wouldn't
60:03
have sent his son
60:04
people always say how can a loving god
60:05
send people to hell it's just the
60:07
opposite
60:08
he loves us so much he makes a way for
60:10
you to come to heaven
60:11
but that's the answer to your question
60:13
right there you must receive
60:15
jesus christ as your savior so all your
60:18
sins
60:20
selfishness and any wickedness is wiped
60:23
out of you okay we're born into sin
60:26
because of adam you remember that you
60:29
all have an
60:30
opportunity your entire life and even at
60:33
that moment of death you can say
60:35
forgive me of my sins i want you and
60:37
he'll
60:38
take you so and if people are praying
60:41
for you especially
60:42
so if people end up in hell it's because
60:45
one reason
60:46
not because you wore blue jeans or
60:48
jewelry it's because you rejected
60:50
the the price the son of god paid on the
60:53
cross
60:54
so you had entrance into heaven i was
60:57
watching the program recently
60:58
and of course there it's a play it's a
61:01
play on tv so it's it's a program
61:03
and the husband wasn't going to church
61:05
but he was saying
61:07
i'm a good person all week long why do i
61:10
have to go to church one
61:11
going to church doesn't save anybody we
61:13
know that
61:14
but being a good person doesn't save
61:17
anyone either because
61:18
because our righteousness is filthy rags
61:21
the lord says so
61:22
it's a it's a it's a huge difference so
61:25
you can have
61:26
okay so what about cat um
61:30
a producer in hollywood they make pretty
61:32
good movies
61:33
they give millions to the poor
61:37
but they never receive christ
61:41
you're not going to heaven
61:45
it's just the way it is there's only one
61:48
way
61:48
to heaven and i always if i go someplace
61:51
for the first time i said let me make
61:53
this perfectly clear
61:55
there's one true god there's one godhead
61:58
the father the son the holy spirit those
62:00
are the ones i follow
62:02
that i honor that i worship that's the
62:04
ones in the bible
62:06
and you will not go to heaven unless you
62:09
receive the sacrifice of jesus christ
62:11
because
62:11
he nailed all the evil in he had put in
62:15
his body that was nailed to the cross
62:17
he's the only one who can forgive
62:18
it because he's the only one who ever
62:20
took it in himself when he drank the cup
62:22
no one else can give you entrance into
62:26
heaven
62:26
and i'll say so good luck if you think
62:28
you can find another
62:31
that's good that's really really good uh
62:33
hey one last question and this
62:35
that's our time but was jesus giving
62:38
some sort of
62:39
example or was he just dealing with a
62:42
situation when
62:43
when he he meets the the guy at the in
62:45
the
62:46
the demoniac at the gather at the
62:49
gatherings
62:50
and and they said to him have you come
62:52
to torture us before our time
62:55
and he sends them into the pigs
62:58
or i think they may have even requested
63:00
to be sent in the pigs
63:01
and then the pigs ran off and went into
63:03
the water what was that all about
63:05
what was he doing and what was that all
63:07
about it was a
63:08
it was really a kind of a hint or tip or
63:12
whatever
63:14
that i even have
63:17
i have on my bio right now then my hobby
63:20
is torturing demons
63:23
you torture them with the way you live
63:26
because back then most people didn't
63:27
know about christ
63:28
they weren't watching how they lived
63:30
their life and even
63:32
the way i live my life i do it to bring
63:34
glory to jesus christ
63:36
christ in you and i want to point this
63:38
out real quick
63:40
people look at the scripture and say wow
63:41
you know we make glory for god no
63:44
christ in you is the hope
63:47
if you think christ doesn't hope for
63:49
things what about that scripture
63:50
the hope that your life will bring glory
63:53
to god
63:54
by the way you live it the way you
63:56
manifest like him talk like him
63:59
uh love like him that's what brings
64:02
glory
64:02
that ties in with the scripture all have
64:05
sinned and fallen
64:06
short of the glory again if you're not
64:09
if you're not creating glory by the way
64:11
you live your life
64:12
all these scriptures are what christ
64:14
wants for you
64:16
that's why he died not just give you
64:18
hell insurance so you don't you don't go
64:20
to hell although that happens
64:22
he wants you to be just like him okay
64:25
then you come against the darkness you
64:26
don't tolerate it you don't participate
64:28
you bring life and hope with the word
64:30
you speak you
64:32
shift things in the spirit realm by
64:33
taking authority over the darkness
64:36
that's how you make glory for him christ
64:39
in me
64:40
and so my life i give him glory so he
64:43
didn't have to hope for that anymore
64:45
he's going to get it
64:46
but i can tell you there is one way to
64:49
heaven
64:50
and that is because god doesn't want
64:52
heaven to be
64:53
just like the earth
64:57
that's good that's so good well kat
