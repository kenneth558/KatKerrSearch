01:00
Well, welcome to Elijah's Streams. It is Wednesday, February 1, but we are recording this the
01:20
day before, so I'm recording this in the clock behind us. We'll say Tuesday, January 31,
01:24
but you will see this in the morrow on Wednesday, so we're very excited to bring you Kat again today.
01:30
She has a shorter schedule because they're in the middle of a move, so we're going to do 35
01:34
minutes and fast and furious and we'll have a good time. I had to hook myself up today and
01:39
all the things are dragging in. Anyway, hope the dog doesn't bark because I didn't take care of
01:44
that ahead of time, so we'll see how this goes. So pretty short show, but we'll enjoy every minute
01:50
of it, so we're not going to run any spots or any other announcements. Tomorrow, by the way,
01:53
is Robin Bullock, so don't miss that. So you're hearing this on Wednesday, so Thursday will be
01:58
Robin Bullock. So all right, without further delay, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go.
02:04
Hi, Kat. So you're in the middle of a move this week, huh?
02:24
Yes, and we are so excited. I'm really excited.
02:29
Awesome. Well, it's good to see you. We've got questions. We were going to jump right into
02:33
questions today. Anything you wanted to say before we do that?
02:37
I just want to say how much I love everybody and thank you for all the prayers you've given us over
02:43
the years and even for this move, which sometimes seems almost impossible. Here we are moving tonight
02:52
and tomorrow night. So we seriously are moving and we are all very excited. You know, it's a
02:59
beautiful place. We know people there. We're going to meet a lot more people. I know God's
03:03
going to be there too, of course. And so, yeah, we're trying to use our time as wisely as we can
03:11
and our staff is actually going to come tomorrow to help. They have been bugging us forever.
03:16
Please, let us help. Let us help. Yeah, we've got to take that, man. It's more talking than moving,
03:21
but we're all very excited about how God has blessed us. So, yeah. And I feel that you're
03:28
paying on the moving too. You know, you can have fun with friends and everything, but man,
03:35
every time I've ever moved, we moved about something like 17 times in our married life.
03:40
It's crazy. Wow. One time a year for the first half of the year. And then this place we've been
03:45
at for 23 years now. Yeah. Yeah, so amazing. Well, listen, Kat, so you're pretty excited
03:53
about the future still. Are you optimistic about how things are going? I am optimistic about
03:59
everything God has said or told me and still intend to do. So, absolutely, yes, we all are.
04:05
We're all very optimistic. By the way, once again, not intentionally, but we wore them. You got your
04:10
teal on your hat and I got my teal on my tie and you're... Yeah. And that is heaven's color,
04:16
you said, or heaven's favorite color. So, if I'm saying that right. Okay, so Kat, let me just jump
04:22
in and ask you one question that I may have asked you a variant of this from time to time, but
04:27
when people go to heaven, they've died and now they've graduated to heaven and you've said
04:34
people, when they get to heaven, don't start comparing, don't say, how did you die? No,
04:37
how did you die? They don't do that. But do... Would someone show up? Let's say they meet their parents
04:44
and their parents are young like they are. They're everybody's in their 20s and 30s, I guess, looking
04:48
at them. Does that... When they sit down and have coffee or whatever it is you do in heaven,
04:54
do the parents say, well, tell me what happened last time we were there, you didn't even know the
04:59
Lord, what happened? Do they tell that kind of story? And some say... Sometimes they do,
05:04
if something's really on their heart, sure. And nobody minds at all if they ask some questions
05:10
like that. I would have thought, you know, in my P-brain, I would have thought that that would
05:16
be almost a sure thing that everybody would want to hear that story. But you... It sounds a little
05:21
bit like it's more of an exception to the rule. Well, they actually hold meetings already when
05:26
they come. Every time somebody comes new from earth, they always have huge events and everybody
05:32
wants to come so they can hear what's been going on. Oh, okay. It's not gonna be any really good news,
05:37
anything that's changed or maybe major things have happened that they would want to know about.
05:42
That's an automatic, that part is automatic. So everybody will attend me somewhere. And then
05:49
that person will be invited over and over and over again to visit people, speak places.
05:54
And so, yeah, it's very exciting. Okay, very cool. So let's see, I wanted to go with this one.
06:02
This one was... I've had this... Somehow I came across my desk I've had since December.
06:06
It says, okay, I love Kat. I purchased and read her wonderful books. I find them very encouraging.
06:14
I would like to ask her this question. The Bible says, when you try to approach the throne of God
06:19
or God himself, you become very, very fearful. I have not heard Kat talking about the reverential
06:26
fear of the, fear the Bible speaks of when it went in the presence of the great and almighty God.
06:33
So I guess they're asking once you go to be with the Lord or once you visit heaven. I'm not quite
06:40
sure where the reverential fear is that she's wanting to address. What would you say about that?
06:48
I think it would probably depend on what was going on in its own home at the time. Of course,
06:54
I've always, always had such holy reverence and love for the Father, for the Son, for the Holy Spirit
07:02
that never changes. You never, ever get familiar with all that and not any of it. It's just
07:09
overwhelming sometimes, the peace and the love that you experience when you're there.
07:14
And of course, when I go many times, I'm like eight. Yeah, that's what you said.
07:19
Not all viewpoint would be entirely different than most people who are already adults.
07:26
So I think about what kind of fun will I have? Where will we take me? What will we do?
07:30
I love him so much. I'm so excited to be here. So that would be the way that I would look
07:36
at things and he wants me to. He wants me to see him that way. And there's other people who feel
07:42
that way also. Well, yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. But you talked about how
07:50
you've gone as an eight year old and that you usually go as an eight year old. So God sees you
07:56
and you interact, I guess, as an eight year old. And you have said many times that heaven is like
08:02
50 percent worship, serious worshiping the Lord and 50 percent fun. Am I quoting you right? Is that about right?
08:09
I would have to say yes. And he even says sometimes it's 50 percent fun. I'd have to make it fun. You come
08:16
like a child. It makes sense. And so if you tell a story about this, I saw this or I saw that. And
08:27
it makes the children or you at eight years old, when you go, giggle and laugh to see something
08:34
funny, that's something that's in the heart of God to provide. Giggles and laughter and even goofiness
08:42
when you're having fun, right? Yeah, you know, most everyone who comes says you must come like a
08:48
child, right? And he wants us to feel that, you know, you're really all that innocent and excited
08:57
and you know, you're going to have a good time. I mean, he is our father. That's who he is. That
09:01
doesn't take anything away from his sovereignty, you know, his holiness, his power, the life he
09:07
gives people. It doesn't change that. It's just that from my perspective and the way he's always
09:13
taught me, he taught me as his daughter, he taught me as a child. So I see from their perspective.
09:19
Okay, okay, cool. All right, Isaac is age 15. And he's asking this, are the world's wonders in heaven?
09:27
For example, the hanging guards of Babylon, the Colosseum and so on, because we think of the seven
09:32
wonders of the world, he's like, no, are those wonders in heaven? There are wonders, it says
09:40
of course, those wonders in heaven. But I think it is the famous ones that we know, like, no, not
09:47
those. Okay, not those. It would be like, you know, like the Valley of the Valley of the Falls
09:54
would be definitely one the throne room, of course, absolutely the streets of gold, his rainbow. I
10:01
mean, there's so many different things you would want to see the crystal sea, where you can swim
10:06
under the water and breathe and talk and meet all the creatures there. So of course, they do actually
10:11
have their list on quite sure of amazing places. Oh, yeah, the city is there. So there's so many
10:20
things to do, see and learn about people have their favorites once they've been there for a while.
10:24
So I would say, yes, it is sort of like, maybe more than eight. Yeah, well, you know, all right. And
10:31
so if someone said, well, I will always hope that I never could go to see the Grand Canyon, I hope
10:36
that I could see it in heaven. It's not like God needs to give you the Grand Canyon, he's got the
10:41
grand everything. He absolutely has the grand, the grand of everything, you're right. So it's not
10:49
like you missed that anymore. Won't you see what he's got there? Yeah, so good. Okay. Pam is asking
10:55
this, can't you taught us that our level of spiritual authority grows as we mature in Christ?
11:01
Can you tell us what a brand new Christians authority looks like? I don't, I guess,
11:07
I have to interpret what she means. What does it look like? What, what would you say
11:11
a brand new Christians authority like? I think maybe she's asking the moment you're saved and
11:16
you're brand new. Do you walk out and possess certain authority that you didn't have? Or
11:21
what does it look like if you're brand new? I think that no one can really maybe even think
11:28
about that ahead of time. I think you are so undone by the glory that, you know, the glory we create
11:35
for him, the splendors and the wonders that are there. You're so overwhelmed by his goodness
11:42
that he gives us. But I'm brand new believer especially. They're overwhelmed really at what
11:50
has been given to what Christ actually did give you, what you can operate in, how to do that,
11:55
and what difference it would make here in the earth if everybody did. So yeah, there's a lot of
12:00
things that there's so many things that we could talk about and discuss, but always those feelings
12:06
of a new believer realize what has been paid for for them and what it's like to operate.
12:14
There's like nothing is, you know, I don't think as much as I've been excited in all the years
12:20
afterwards, I think the cream of the crop was the first week days and weeks after I encountered God
12:26
and everything. It's hard to find that level of first love very many times. Don't get me wrong.
12:32
I seek it and I do discover major encounters, but you're overwhelmed by that love. Absolutely yes.
12:40
Yeah. I mean the Old Testament when I had the encounter with God 81,
12:45
even the Old Testament screamed grace, grace, grace. I read it and I said,
12:48
there's grace all over this thing and I had only seen bad news and that's them.
12:53
All right. So Jan is asking this, when people first get to meet Jesus in heaven, what is the
12:59
first most common response? Is it a joyful celebration kind of moment or a holy worship
13:05
kind of moment? So what is that? I mean, yeah, so like, go ahead. Yeah, I think most of the time
13:11
it's probably more of a holy thing. You are so undone knowing you're meeting actually the risen
13:19
Savior, the one who gave everything for you. So I have seen most of the people probably would have
13:25
that holy reverential thing that we talked about. Yeah. Unless you're a kid, then you're going to be
13:30
like, yeah, besides yourself excited. Yeah. Well, you know, I, when I picture it for myself, I think,
13:39
I think I'd fall on my knees or I would be, I would feel like falling and I feel like tears
13:45
would come, but they would be tears of absolute unbelievable joy that we made it and he did
13:51
this for me. And are there tears of joy? You know, there are tears of joy. I don't people think you
13:57
never cry again in heaven. At the end of the Bible, it says every tear will be wiped away. You know,
14:03
the former things, you know, more. That's the end of everything when it says, you don't cry,
14:08
but crying for joy, excitement, gratefulness. Yeah, that's, it's a wonderful feeling anyway.
14:16
And you absolutely love it. So yes, people still do that. Cool. Very cool. All right. Reggie's
14:23
asking this, will teams of people work together or collaborate together to create things in heaven
14:29
or on the new earth, like in these say, it's like groups work together on earth now to create or
14:36
will, but we only create individually using our individual gifts and talents. So I guess he's
14:40
likes doing things together as a group. And will we collaborate and do things together? That's
14:45
the answer. We do collaborate and do things together. Of course we do. And you do learn how
14:51
to create, not people, but there's creation lab where you think that's for in heaven. Okay.
14:56
All kinds of things, places that we can make for each other, not talking about like our
15:02
mansions or anything like that, but there we all have a creative ability because of who they are
15:08
and so absolutely people get excited. Yes. And actually people say, well, what do people do?
15:15
There's nothing to do there. You don't have a job or you create stuff. You hold events everywhere
15:22
and everybody wants to be a part of your event. So yes, those things do happen a lot.
15:28
That's good. Good. Okay. I have so many rabbit trails that I want to go to, but I'm going to jump
15:35
to the next question. Elizabeth asks, how do I know if my child goes to heaven? If my child goes
15:41
to heaven in her sleep, I asked this because she has a dear friend and recently that recently moved
15:48
to heaven twice this week. She said she had a dream about them playing together and running.
15:54
I'm not sure if I understand the question. How do I know if my child goes to heaven in her sleep?
16:00
I asked this because she has a dear friend. Oh, she's saying when my child is sleeping,
16:05
did she go to heaven and visit? That's what she's asking. That is a great possibility. Sure. Yeah,
16:10
he takes people while they're sleeping. Okay. So they may, they say, Mom, I had this dream and I
16:16
was playing. Yeah, my green kids have actually had that happen to them quite often. Okay. And
16:22
those five places in heaven, like when they were four years old and they went, they didn't even
16:28
know those places were there. But I mean, they have been that they ride, they rode, I think I
16:32
mentioned before, you would ride lava out of a volcano. Yeah. My grandfather, my dad. Yeah,
16:38
there are some of those giggles, by the way. I love the giggles. Giggles of God. Someone needs to
16:42
write that book because we serve a happy, joyful, funny. By the way, of all the three, Father,
16:52
Son and Holy Spirit. Who's funniest if you could, if you, who's clever with their wit if you, if you
16:59
had. I would have to say there's either Holy Spirit, probably or Jesus. I think Jesus definitely has
17:04
the wit. I think they call Holy, well, I know they call Holy Spirit the drama king. Yeah.
17:10
Right there. He loves a good joke. He really does. He loves like all kinds of drama and exciting
17:19
things going on up there. So I would have to say probably more of those. The father is definitely
17:24
for love. Yeah. Just dad, father, you know, I think Kim Robinson has had multiple trips together.
17:30
She calls him daddy, God. You've had, I'm not asking you to say the names, your private names
17:35
for God, but God has given you different names that you call him. Is that right? Yes, he had.
17:40
That's a real interesting thing. And I've known several others that were like that. They say I've
17:44
called them such and such and it would be something I'd never heard. But God gave, I don't know,
17:49
maybe he gives different people the same ones, but that's pretty special. All right.
17:55
He's just asking, how do you pray when asking God to relocate? How do you pinpoint where God
18:03
wants you? I guess that means to move. I do not want to move to a place out of his will. So he's
18:07
saying, she's saying, how do you pray when you're asking God to relocate you? I mean, I guess you,
18:14
you want to tell him, I guess you want to ask, okay, I don't even know how to interpret that
18:19
more than the question. So yeah. So what's your thoughts on that?
18:26
So I think she wants to move, but she doesn't want to move to the wrong place because God
18:31
didn't tell her to do or something like that. She's, she's going, you know, how do I pray?
18:36
I would say, you know, you want his will done more than anything else and asked him to please
18:41
give him permission to let you know. It's a good way to do that. You get, you get him permission
18:46
to let you know if it's not the place he wants or maybe something different like that. I think
18:51
most of the time, if it's, if it's about him and you've heard him maybe say things like that in
18:58
his will towards you, I think people are so centered on pleasing him and making sure they
19:04
don't step out of what he wants. So they don't mess up their life. I don't think he'd let them mess
19:08
their life up if maybe they did choose something differently, but, but telling him that certainly
19:14
is going to help you stay focused. And for the people that, that are not seers and they don't
19:20
see all the things in the spirit like you do. I mean, can they say, Lord, I think you're telling
19:25
me to go here, but if I'm wrong, would you close the door before I absolutely ask you to do that.
19:32
You absolutely could do that. It's a good idea. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. All right. Shonda,
19:37
Shonda, I must be Shonda. How do you release the anointing when you're on a telephone call?
19:42
How would you do it if they, if they call you and you want to release the anointing? I'm sure
19:47
she's meeting on the other person on the other end. So yeah, I would just hold my phone and I
19:52
would just say it, or I would do it before I call them or he knew that I was going to call their
19:57
number. I would say I released this, the anointing into this phone call when they pick it up, it'll
20:02
go right into them. Okay. Okay. All right. Jill, let's see. This is partially cut off. Let me make
20:09
sure I can read the whole thing. Okay. Jill says, as a seer, when I'm in church, I often see huge
20:16
angels that stand between the first front, front seats and rows in front of the podium where the
20:25
pastor preaches. It is always in the same position no matter what church. The angel is so big that
20:30
his head is outside the roof. I didn't, I didn't notice an angel where we were going to church
20:35
now until the last couple of weeks. Can you speak of what you know about those angels? I guess she's
20:42
wanted to know if, if that's identifiable or something you've seen? I've seen angels 2,000 feet
20:48
high, probably even higher than that in heaven. So just to what every side imagine is there.
20:54
And I don't know that typically it's certain, you know, a tribe of angels or something like that.
21:01
I just know that they do have many different sizes of angels. Do you, this is never a question
21:08
that has never been popped to my head, but if you've seen 2,000 foot angels and you've seen
21:12
angels that are probably roughly your size. Yes. So are massively tall angels by definition
21:20
massively more powerful? Is that what the big means or what would you say? Possibly, but
21:26
maybe possibly not. It's just that God loved making different types of angels or the hosts
21:32
and he practiced well at doing that. Okay. Cool. All right. Cheryl is asking this question.
21:42
She goes, I've heard you speak about how our loved ones in heaven can go to a portal on special
21:46
days for us and sing happy birthday. For example, is the reverse true? My husband went to heaven
21:52
less than two years ago. Can I sing happy birthday to him on his special day and have him hear me
21:58
singing it? I'm sure that you could. I know that I have sung different things like to my father,
22:07
like on Father's Day or something like that. I know that sounds odd, but I do really love my
22:12
dad and a great relationship with him. And yes, and I know for a fact that Father has said you
22:17
can sing what you'd like to them and he'll make sure they hear it. Yeah. Now I've said,
22:23
this is maybe years past, but I've, you know, before I heard that you maybe can speak directly
22:28
in there. They hear it in the spirit realm or something. However, but I've said, Lord, would
22:34
you give my dad this message to tell him like, and I've said, like one time I said, tell my dad,
22:39
I forgive him for those things. I don't even know that if that's appropriate thing because he's in
22:44
bliss. Why would he need to hear that? But that's, that would be my question. What kind of things
22:51
can you send as a messenger or ask God to set an angel and tell your dad, you know, can you say
22:56
something like that? Tell him I forgive him. You mean on earth or in heaven? No, I'm saying,
23:03
you know, he's in heaven now and you know that when he left, he left a mess like that was the case
23:09
with my dad. And if I would have said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I mean,
23:15
that was years past, but what do you think about that? You just say, no, no, don't go there because
23:20
he's already happy. He doesn't need that. I think that I don't think I would mind you saying that
23:27
and all of somebody. I think it would be all right to say that. Even though they wouldn't still have to hear it. Yeah,
23:34
because they already, yeah, I hear you. It's not like his soul needs to be unburdened for what he
23:42
did. So it's just words of love, I think. Yeah. Okay. Dolores is asking this, do regular common
23:50
people from different generations mingle with one another? For example, would an auto executive that
23:56
went to heaven in 2022 mingle with the poor widow from Elijah's days, would they have things of
24:02
interest to talk to? I think anyone who you would meet there would have, there's almost everybody's
24:11
going to have something that they would love to talk to about you to you or with you. And you would
24:17
find it very fascinating. So people still love to have conversations. They like to reason together,
24:22
talk together. They love to share things. I mean, that never stops happening. Not here on earth or
24:27
in heaven. Well, and then is there the sense that throughout eternity or as long as you're on heaven,
24:34
one day, it's everyone's going to be on new earth. But as long as you're in heaven,
24:39
are people making new friends all the time? Or do they kind of establish their friendship
24:44
thing and their friends hang? Oh, they make new friendships all the time, no matter where they
24:50
go. They do. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, Tracy. Oh, this, this does occur to me to ask this question
25:00
because you've talked because we said a minute ago about the portals in heaven. And you know,
25:04
your loved ones can look down on special occasions. Can't with that being possible,
25:10
could someone, this is probably a dorky question, but because someone say, hey,
25:15
they should do her girlfriend from earth and now they're all both in heaven together. And he says,
25:19
come on to the portal. I want to, it's my daughter's birthday. I want to say, I want to see them and
25:24
come and see where my daughter, what my daughter's up to. Could they do something like that? Or is
25:29
it only for personal family? You know what I mean? I think a lot is for family, but I think you could,
25:37
there's people who would push doing anything or talking about anything to anybody if they could
25:42
there. So yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of these questions are questions that you don't, it's not
25:48
like you walk around knowing the answers to all these deep questions, but yeah. Yeah. Okay.
25:57
Tracy's asking this, I'm a worship dancer. Can you elaborate a little more on what
26:02
happens when we minister and dance? And this seems like it's a common question. People want to know
26:07
when I do this on earth, what's it, what's happening? What is it accomplishing is, I think, is what
26:16
she's saying. What happens when I dance? I mean, that could go a bunch of directions. What is the
26:21
Lord doing? What's happening in the spirit realm? I mean, is, would you have any thoughts? Because
26:26
you're a seer. Do you see people dance and then see things happening because of it?
26:30
I see a lot of mostly music. Of course, I do see some dance. And sometimes you dance, you're not
26:38
even on the floor, like in the throne room, they have a lot of dance and pageantry and stuff in
26:43
there going on. It's absolutely beautiful. And of course, there's ways that you collect things
26:50
as you dance. And then it's represented in some other way in heaven, like you create artwork or
26:56
paintings by your dance. Even though it is with dance, not with your paintings, it's just something
27:02
that's created as something to remember that about. Okay. And back for those that are dancing on earth,
27:11
when you've seen people with the pageantry that God loves on the earth and they're waving their
27:15
flags and they're dancing, does it affect the angels around them when they do that? Is something
27:23
being triggered in a good way when they dance? And I think that's what she's trying to get at.
27:29
Do angels respond? Does our blessings drop down that we don't see? What is the dance
27:36
accomplished? Or is it just dance? I know dance is considered a high praise. It even says that it's
27:43
in the Bible. And so yes, even some of the hosts are absolutely amazed and really love the warfare
27:53
that takes place as a dancer. When you dance, like in the spirit about things, so that is definitely
28:00
something that takes place. And all three of my daughters are dancers. They would have to be
28:04
wore in dance in the spirit for people to be healed, for messages to be sent to be received.
28:10
And so I would definitely know whether it's dance, whether it's music. A lot of things are created
28:16
in the spirit. Okay, awesome. Sarah is asking this, are there, you've seen gemstones in heaven,
28:25
and I think I've heard you talk about the crystal sea and stuff. She says, is there gemstone art
28:31
in heaven that resembles stained glass? Have you seen? Absolutely, yes. A lot of people have
28:37
those in their home there. Really? Especially if people were artisans in that. My grandfather
28:45
made stained glass wonders. Okay. He's got some he's made in heaven. Wow, very cool. And I mean,
28:53
you know, it makes me wonder, because you said that guy will put favorite pictures of yours
28:59
that are on earth, or you'll show up at your mansion and there it's hanging. And I'm curious if
29:03
God would do the same thing. Not that you would know the answer to this, but that if you if someone
29:08
made stained glass on earth, they show up and God said, this is one that you made. I really,
29:12
especially loved, I kept it. And here's it. That was that sound like something he might do just
29:17
because that's who he is. I think he probably would. If people gave him any high gifts, he's
29:24
going to love him anyway. Yeah. And even he has some favorite things that he likes, anything
29:29
he may with life with colors, things like that. Whether you're young or not young, he loves people
29:35
when they give him gifts. Cool. All right. Let me see. We're five minutes out here. We got time
29:42
for a few more questions here. George is asking, when some people are dying, they reach out or
29:47
call for their family members who have died before them. They act as though their family members are
29:52
right there in the room with them. Do you know, do they really see their loved ones and do they
29:58
come? I guess they're asking, do their loved ones come to help with their transition to heaven?
30:03
Can you share about that? I mean, I have no idea. I think sometimes they do. I do know for a fact
30:08
that some people have seen their family members, like maybe within a week of passing or something.
30:14
I think it's something that God just does to encourage people. And so I just know that it does
30:19
happen. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Rachel's saying, when we are reunited with our loved ones that are
30:28
already in heaven, to them, will it feel like it's been a long time since they've seen this? Or will
30:33
it only feel like seconds or days since they've seen us? I think it's just seconds. Really? Oh,
30:44
yeah. They don't miss someone being gone 30 years or something like that. All they can think about
30:48
is can't wait to see them again when they see them. And so for them, you've only been gone for a short
30:53
time. Okay. Wow. Okay. And Andrew's asking, when and why were the host, Michael's army created,
31:06
was it after Satan's treason, specifically to deal with him or was it actually before
31:11
Satan's treason? In other words, you've made it very clear that the only reason there's an army
31:16
is not to protect heaven. God doesn't need an army to protect heaven. So when do you know when
31:23
the army was created? Was it after the fall of Satan? I think the army was been around a very
31:31
long time. They even wondered why they were created one time. Really? To fight. Yeah,
31:37
they were there for the enemy, for who became an enemy. So maybe they only understood what
31:44
they were being trained up for when that fall happened. Yeah. They were taught war and they
31:49
had to run maneuvers and do all kinds of stuff like that. Really? And that one was how loose
31:55
for a fallen heaven. They knew who their enemy was. Interesting. All right. Here's another question
32:02
about the Michael, the captain of the warrior angels. Is it Martha's asking, I believe the
32:06
angel Michael is the captain of the warrior angels and Gabriel is the messenger angels.
32:12
Are there other types of angels with specific purposes? I'm guessing there'd be lots of them
32:17
with specific purposes. There are so many, I cannot number them. There's many, many, many, many.
32:25
There's ones who are couriers, of course, the scribes, the Bible talks about them, helper angels
32:31
that help all over heaven doing things like that. Of course, there are the hosts of heaven.
32:35
There's ones who serve in different places and who keep the treasures
32:42
shined up and all kinds of things like that. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It makes sense that he might
32:48
even have thousands of different kinds of angels, right? For categories that we've never even thought
32:53
about. So, yeah. Man, just that's right. Me, A, N, G, S. Does God really cast out your sins into
33:01
the sea of forgetfulness? If you brought up your past, would he not know of it? I think most of the
33:07
time he wouldn't because he does cast it there and he's not going to think about it. I tell people,
33:13
stop reminding him of your sins. He won't know what you're talking about if you've repented.
33:18
Yeah, boy. I could have used that understanding years ago when I kept repending over and over
33:25
and over and over to make sure I got it right. He's probably saying, would you stop repending?
33:32
Okay. Jamelia, lots of interesting names today. Jamelia, have you seen inside of the courtrooms
33:39
in heaven? What's happening in there? What do they look like? Do they look like a courtroom on earth?
33:44
The judge sits on the bench up there high and then there's a defense in both sides?
33:50
I have absolutely been to the courtroom in heaven. Actually, there's more than one.
33:57
I guess outside, not outside of heaven, but in the atmosphere of heaven, it's invisible.
34:05
I know this sounds crazy. You can actually see to it. You can see that it's there.
34:09
Then of course, it's a courtroom that's actually in heaven. Yes, I've seen both. Like anything
34:15
else, God sits as judge. Jesus is our lawyer and Satan gets hauled up there about different
34:23
things sometimes. Other things get harder, but justice does take place in those courtrooms.
34:30
So it does look like a courtroom as we would know it. Well, they have one that looks very
34:34
supernatural. They do have one that looks like what you would call a courtroom, maybe not exactly
34:40
like that. So they're both different than I've seen. Okay. All right. Here's the last question here.
34:47
Natalie is asking, what is your favorite thing about Jesus that you would like to describe?
34:53
What's your favorite thing about? Of course, you'd have thousands of things, but what stands
34:57
out to you? I think his eyes. I think his eyes are so amazing. I never get tired of whenever
35:05
I'm around him. I always want to look at his eyes. They're beautiful, very beautiful. But he also does
35:11
have a, I almost want to say a cynic sense of humor. I mean, he was very bold about the things he
35:18
said on the earth to those who were not doing right. Like one of my favorite ones is, are you
35:25
you're a white and sepulchral school of dead men's bones? Yeah. You thought of the religious hierarchy.
35:30
I think both of those probably, those two things are probably my very favorite thing about it.
35:35
And he holds both of those at the same time. He, you know, he's got that serious side and then the
35:42
clever fun side. Yeah. So good. So good. Well, Kat, that's our time. We need to let you get to
35:49
your moving and rest in between and all of that. So I appreciate it very much. We'll spend more
35:54
time the next time talking about revealing heaven.com, but we're going to revealing the
35:58
heaven.com to see her, to get her books and all that. And there it is. Katcur.com is where you
36:03
can support her. The only place you can support her is online because she doesn't ask for money
36:09
in any other way. A lot of people keep trying to pretend to be her. So all right. Thanks so much,
36:14
Kat. Tomorrow, everybody is Robin Bullock. We're looking very much forward to that. When you see
36:19
Robin Bullock, he almost, I think he always has that pin that you created. It says, I don't do
36:25
demons. He wears that on his coat and everywhere he goes. So it's a, so that that'll be him right
36:31
there after people see this. Yeah. Thank you very much. We love you. Bless you. Have a good time
36:36
with your staffs. We'll see you again soon. Okay. See you later then. Bye.
