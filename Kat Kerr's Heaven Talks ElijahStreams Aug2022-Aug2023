Happy Wednesday, August 17, 2022. 
01:38
Welcome to the broadcast. 
01:40
It's going to be a great show today. 
01:42
We have Kat Kerr as always. 
01:44
It's going to be right an hour show starting now. 
01:48
She's got some other things she needs to do. 
01:50
This is the day before Eric Trump comes. 
01:54
So Eric Trump will be here tomorrow. 
01:56
Do not miss this. 
01:58
Be sure and text your friends. 
02:00
Call your friends and let them know. 
02:02
We've got some great questions for Eric. 
02:04
It's going to be great. 
02:06
Oh, by the way, yes. 
02:08
Thank you, Julie. 
02:10
It is 8 a.m. tomorrow. 
02:12
I would have forgotten that. 
02:14
It's 8 a.m. Pacific time. 
02:16
If you're on the East Coast, it will be 11. 
02:18
It's 8 a.m. in the morning. 
02:20
That's when we could get him. 
02:22
We're happy to do that. 
02:24
We did that one other time with General Flynn. 
02:26
It is 8 o'clock in the morning Pacific time. 
02:28
So there you have it. 
02:30
I'm just making sure I'm not missing any notes here. 
02:32
Before we bring Kat on, 
02:34
let's bring Mike and Lori Sally on. 
02:36
Let's talk about the wells. 
02:38
They are spearheading the whole thing, 
02:40
the whole project. 
02:42
I can't wait to hear all about it. 
02:44
So Mike and Lori Sally, take it away. 
02:46
Yeah, go ahead, Lori. 
02:48
We are so excited to update you 
02:50
specifically about the water wells 
02:52
in Uganda. 
02:54
I think one of your shows you shared about 
02:56
that we had had 300 
02:58
salvations. Well, now it's up 
03:00
to over 800 people 
03:02
who have given their lives to Jesus 
03:04
because of these water wells. 
03:06
I was just in shock. 
03:08
Who knew that Jesus, we know he can turn 
03:10
water into wine, but who knew 
03:12
he was going to make these water wells 
03:14
and share 
03:16
the gospel in such an impactful way. 
03:18
People just be... 
03:20
I had always hoped 
03:22
that maybe a person 
03:24
or two would come to Jesus 
03:26
because of this, but I had no 
03:28
idea that this would be 
03:30
an evangelism tool where 
03:32
hundreds and hundreds, 
03:34
and we just think we're just getting started. 
03:36
We're just getting started. We're now doing a well 
03:38
a week. Every week, one well. 
03:40
So, wow. 
03:42
So we're up to 
03:44
47 new wells 
03:46
that Elijah Streams has provided. 47. 
03:48
I was looking 
03:50
at the big organization that does work in Uganda 
03:52
and all of last year 
03:54
and then all they do is water. 
03:56
All they do. And they did 42 
03:58
water projects, not even wells 
04:00
in the entire year. 
04:02
Really? Yeah. 
04:04
It's incredible the pace 
04:06
and the excitement of the people 
04:08
and I was surprised as well 
04:10
as how many people are coming to know Jesus 
04:12
because of this. It's crazy. 
04:14
It's not normal, actually. 
04:16
It's something God's doing. 
04:18
The anointing is all over this project 
04:20
and just the investment 
04:22
that people are making. It's incredible. 
04:24
I wanted to share one of the stories. 
04:26
So I was asking my team, like, tell me 
04:28
what does it look like? I mean, how is this happening? 
04:30
How are they sharing the gospel? 
04:32
Because, normally, I mean, 
04:34
pastors are out there sharing all the time 
04:36
and in this one particular area, 
04:38
so Elijah Streams, 
04:40
we are drilling wells 
04:42
in different parts of Uganda, 
04:44
not all in the same exact spot. 
04:46
So it's in different areas. 
04:48
One area that is really, really dry, 
04:50
it's a drought area 
04:52
and so it's kind of like 
04:54
the forgotten people. It's drought. 
04:56
They don't have a lot of government 
04:58
assistance. They don't have many 
05:00
organizations that are coming there to help 
05:02
and so what they've been doing 
05:04
is as the 
05:06
water company is coming out 
05:08
with their equipment, 
05:10
they're renting a 
05:12
speaker and hooking it up 
05:14
to a car and they're 
05:16
driving through the village 
05:18
and they're kind of announcing, 
05:20
hey, we want you to know what Jesus is doing. 
05:22
There's people 
05:24
that love Jesus, 
05:26
that are responding to him 
05:28
and they care about you and he cares about you 
05:30
and they want you to know about him 
05:32
and so then they start sharing the gospel 
05:34
and then right behind them, not very far, 
05:36
there's these huge, 
05:38
massive trucks that have 
05:40
these huge drilling 
05:42
implements and things 
05:44
and my team is telling me that 
05:46
not only are the water wells 
05:48
an amazing thing, but the fact that 
05:50
we're using this equipment, 
05:52
the technology 
05:54
that we're using to drill these wells 
05:56
is abnormal for them because normally 
05:58
when people come and drill a well, they do it by hand 
06:00
and we're thankful for those 
06:02
that are able to do that, but it's 
06:04
not as efficient because you can't go as deep, 
06:06
it's actually dangerous to do it like 
06:08
that, but people are in awe 
06:10
and imagine if it's not every day 
06:12
you see massive trucks coming 
06:14
in, you know, whenever 
06:16
they're in these villages, when strangers 
06:18
come, everybody stops what they're 
06:20
doing and they run 
06:22
and they want to know what's going on 
06:24
so they're using that first 
06:26
introduction of here's why 
06:28
we're doing this and then they're watching 
06:30
the process the entire time and then 
06:32
when they hit water, 
06:34
then when they hit water, they do a big 
06:36
commissioning and they gather 
06:38
everybody together 
06:40
and that's when their hearts are 
06:42
touched and they were telling me this 
06:44
story about this one woman, she's 
06:46
71 years old and to me 
06:48
when I hear 71, that doesn't seem 
06:50
that old because I'm, you know, I'm in my 
06:52
50s so 70 doesn't seem like it's that old 
06:54
but in Uganda that is old 
06:56
the life expectancy isn't that long, we know 
06:58
Jesus can do it 120 
07:00
years more than that, but 71 
07:02
she's considered an elder in her 
07:04
community and my team is telling 
07:06
me that she has 
07:08
zero faith, normally in Uganda 
07:10
you find people that are either, they 
07:12
adopt something, whether they're really born again 
07:14
or not and they say born again, we say Christians 
07:16
in the states but they always say born again 
07:18
and that means you're really born again 
07:20
she didn't 
07:22
believe in anything or she didn't 
07:24
really ascribe to any particular thing, she must 
07:26
have believed in a higher being because 
07:28
she testified that 
07:30
she used to say to 
07:32
whatever higher being she was talking to 
07:34
if somebody would come and solve 
07:36
this water crisis because 
07:38
I've been suffering, my parents were suffering 
07:40
my children are suffering, now my 
07:42
grandchildren are suffering 
07:44
and then whenever we came in 
07:46
and drilled this water 
07:48
and she saw the water coming 
07:50
she just started yelling 
07:52
God is alive, God is alive 
07:54
God is alive 
07:56
that's amazing 
07:58
she was so excited 
08:00
she truly was like 
08:02
the woman at the well because she 
08:04
then gave her life to Jesus 
08:06
people followed suit, they 
08:08
followed her, they thought if she 
08:10
believes in Jesus, I want the same Jesus 
08:12
and it was remarkable 
08:14
so Steve, over 
08:16
800 people 
08:18
I can't 
08:20
I mean I do but it's like 
08:22
I mean 
08:24
I thought maybe a person 
08:26
or two would come to the Lord because of these 
08:28
wells, I had, I never 
08:30
saw this coming, not even close 
08:32
and we're just getting started 
08:34
one well a week 
08:36
it'll probably increase 
08:38
unless you run out of land to drill wells 
08:40
I don't think we'll run out of land 
08:42
there's a lot of people who contact us all the time 
08:44
really? 
08:46
oh yeah, all the time 
08:48
tell me about that for a minute 
08:50
do other people call and say bring a well here 
08:52
or what? I get emails 
08:54
every week from people that hear about 
08:56
what's going on with Elijah's streams 
08:58
and how we're providing this water 
09:00
can you do one for me 
09:02
here's somebody I know in this village that needs help 
09:04
here's a school that needs help 
09:06
I don't think we've gotten close 
09:08
to tapping out the potential yet 
09:10
and so it's pretty exciting 
09:12
just let those that are watching know 
09:14
it's not as easy as 
09:16
just people contacting and saying hey I need 
09:18
a water well here because we're trying 
09:20
to work with reputable well drillers 
09:22
that we can 
09:24
make sure that we're going to go deep enough 
09:26
and the water is going to be sustainable 
09:28
because you hear stories of water wells 
09:30
that were drilled by 
09:32
different organizations and 
09:34
maybe they're drilling it and go deep enough 
09:36
and then it ends up running dry and that's what 
09:38
we don't want that to happen so 
09:40
we're trying to do it through relations 
09:42
I know you brought a video 
09:44
your daughter Caitlin made this video 
09:46
so let's watch that video 
09:48
about it's kind of the latest 
09:50
I laughed because 
09:52
he said we're emptying hell 
09:54
and we're populating hell 
09:56
but you can populate 
09:58
but we understand what he means he said 
10:00
we're doing damage big 
10:02
time to hell I mean we are literally 
10:04
coming against 
10:06
hell so let's watch that 
10:08
video 
10:36
this year 2022 
10:38
the recharge plants have been started 
10:40
so your denerasty 
10:42
is not only providing clean water 
10:44
but is emptying hell 
10:46
and populating heaven 
10:48
by souls coming to the kingdom 
10:50
and we talk about your Elijah's things 
10:52
so everyone prays for you 
10:54
and God bless you so 
10:56
very much 
10:58
Mike and Lorde Salle 
11:00
this is amazing before the launch 
11:02
of this power hall 
11:04
Moscow has been preached 
11:06
and about 15 people 
11:08
have accepted in Christ 
11:10
as Lord and Savior 
11:12
and even land 
11:14
has been donated 
11:16
to start a church 
11:18
in this place 
11:20
this is a testimony this is amazing 
11:22
these are 15 souls 
11:24
they have come to the kingdom of God today 
11:26
because of the donation 
11:28
of the power hall 
11:30
thank you very much 
11:42
it's so exciting 
11:44
he's like a kid isn't he 
11:46
well I'm like a kid 
11:48
you know I'm sitting here 
11:50
you guys are the same thing 
11:52
look what's going on 
11:54
I mean I can't believe it 
11:56
I do believe it but 
11:58
we are above and beyond 
12:00
anything I think any of us 
12:02
expected to happen 
12:04
wait to see what God is doing 
12:06
for sure 
12:08
well thank you both 
12:10
for coming I see Kat is now here 
12:12
so blessings to you both 
12:14
I appreciate it Mike and Lorde 
12:16
you're working with us very strongly 
12:18
to look into water situations 
12:20
that we will be talking about 
12:22
very very soon here in the states 
12:24
you are here and we're looking at 
12:26
a lot of different things related to the water 
12:28
so we'll be reporting that 
12:30
and a lot of people don't know 
12:32
we're helping a lot of other people 
12:34
even not related to the water 
12:36
but everyone who sows into this ministry 
12:38
receives a reward 
12:40
from him 
12:42
I mean 
12:44
without you know he says 
12:46
even if you give so much as a cup of cold water 
12:48
to one of these you will not lose your reward 
12:50
can you imagine the rewards 
12:52
God's passing out in heaven and on earth 
12:54
thank you to all of our viewers 
12:56
we appreciate it very much 
12:58
so thank you Mike and Lorde 
13:00
we'll see you soon and we'll bring on Kat 
13:02
bless you guys 
13:04
okay so without further ado 
13:06
let's do Wednesdays with Kat and Steve 
13:08
music 
13:24
and there she is hey Kat 
13:26
how are you 
13:28
I'm great thank you 
13:30
so good to have you back 
13:32
I got my Disneyland tie on 
13:34
and tell people why it's 
13:36
okay to still love Disneyland 
13:38
even though we hear some of these bad things 
13:40
you know 
13:42
I always look at the roots 
13:44
of something or the foundation 
13:46
of something 
13:48
and well 
13:50
we can even look at the throne of God 
13:52
Satan has taken many things 
13:54
that are actually some of the father's images 
13:56
the way he operates 
13:58
and he is 
14:00
on the earth polluted them 
14:02
and made them not good 
14:04
but that doesn't mean it's okay 
14:06
to partake of Satan stuff 
14:08
I'm just making an example 
14:10
Walt Disney was 
14:12
put on the earth by God 
14:14
at the time he was put on here 
14:16
and he was put here to create fun 
14:18
in family entertainment 
14:20
that's why people think well he doesn't care about entertainment 
14:22
well they have it in heaven people 
14:24
movies in heaven is all kinds of 
14:26
roller coasters because God knows 
14:28
we need fun 
14:30
and heaven I say is a good bit fun 
14:32
it is holy 
14:34
is pure there's nothing defiling 
14:36
there's no profanity 
14:38
there's no wickedness anywhere in heaven 
14:40
not in anything to create or make there 
14:42
but Walt had this passion 
14:44
in his heart to make a place 
14:46
that families could come and bring their children 
14:48
because even in those days 
14:50
there was a lot of craziness going on 
14:52
in the 60s 
14:54
and things weren't turning in the best 
14:56
direction in that time 
14:58
and so many things were going on that were not good 
15:00
he was determined 
15:02
and he really fought hard 
15:04
well in Orlando especially to get the land 
15:06
for Disney World 
15:08
but the reason he created that in those characters 
15:10
was so we could have something to laugh at 
15:12
and have fun 
15:14
and he is not happy himself right now 
15:16
with stuff that's going on 
15:18
but it is going to change 
15:20
and the father has adamantly told me 
15:22
it's going to change 
15:24
so a lot of maybe people might end up 
15:26
being removed and have this replaced there 
15:28
because I know when Walt was on the earth 
15:30
he was adamant about keeping it 
15:32
at a level 
15:34
that what was produced 
15:36
and the content that was produced 
15:38
not just at that time but for years to come 
15:40
could be enjoyed by family, by children 
15:42
and know that they were going to see something safe 
15:44
and when Disney World was open 
15:46
I actually went to the park here in Florida 
15:48
the first year they were open 
15:50
it was so many masses 
15:52
of people were coming 
15:54
to enjoy 
15:56
and talking about Disney 
15:58
I always appreciated 
16:00
was he always showed 
16:02
in his movies or any of the other things he created 
16:04
you knew the difference between 
16:06
good and evil 
16:08
and every time good would be the victor 
16:10
in the movies and any of the sets he made 
16:12
and he made sure 
16:14
that you knew that this was evil 
16:16
and it was dark and it was not good 
16:18
and yet this was filled with life and light 
16:20
and so I loved it 
16:22
the heroes always saved the day 
16:24
and it overcame 
16:26
every evil obstacle 
16:28
or thing that was in any of the movies 
16:30
or things he produced 
16:32
and so I always appreciated that with Walt 
16:34
and if he was here today that's exactly 
16:36
what would still be happening 
16:38
instead of compromise 
16:40
and darkness invading parts of that 
16:42
there are going to be some 
16:44
covert activities going on in there 
16:46
and no one's going to know anything about it 
16:48
except God himself 
16:50
but things are about to start changing 
16:52
in Disneyland 
16:54
and in Disney World 
16:56
and I don't know if that means something 
16:58
might close for a while or things are being changed 
17:00
or things there's going to be so many things 
17:02
accelerated in these days 
17:04
where darkness is going to be pushed back 
17:06
and that doesn't mean 
17:08
it might close completely 
17:10
but what it'll mean is darkness will be pushed out 
17:12
of places and out of 
17:14
entertainment especially 
17:16
and those who make wicked 
17:18
movies will bomb and they'll lose their shirt 
17:20
if they keep doing it 
17:22
when this whole thing shifts 
17:24
so I do 
17:26
appreciate Walt and all that he created 
17:28
for families 
17:30
if you ever go to either one of those places 
17:32
you can see his own personal comments 
17:34
on the walls in the place 
17:36
and he was so appreciated 
17:38
the people who helped to build the place 
17:40
and the ones who work there now 
17:42
his own comments about how he feels about them 
17:44
he appreciates 
17:46
all of their efforts to help everyone 
17:48
have the time to make it safe 
17:50
and he called them a team 
17:52
he never took 
17:54
direct credit for everything 
17:56
he always gave credit to everyone 
17:58
who was a part of what he did 
18:00
which I also admired in him 
18:02
that he considered everybody involved 
18:04
and he wasn't just the only one that was doing anything 
18:06
and then of course we know 
18:08
there's other people involved in that place now 
18:10
that is not Walt's plans 
18:12
or his ideas 
18:14
some of them that are being put out there now 
18:16
and even in the new things that are being made 
18:18
there's a whole entire different content 
18:20
in it 
18:22
that most believers or even good moral people 
18:24
would not appreciate 
18:26
but just wait and see 
18:28
that will also change 
18:30
I'm glad you see your Donald Duck 
18:32
it's such a special place 
18:34
they opened the doors 
18:36
the year I was born 
18:38
1955 
18:40
I met my wife across the street from Disneyland 
18:42
at the convention center 
18:44
on our honeymoon 
18:46
it's just a real special place 
18:48
and yeah 
18:50
there'll be some bad apples that'll get 
18:52
gone and it's interesting to hear what you just said 
18:54
but 
18:56
some people think well then 
18:58
this must be an evil place 
19:00
don't think that Walt Disney's 
19:02
DNA is still in that thing 
19:04
I remember hearing a story that 
19:06
that 
19:08
he and his brother Roy eventually ran the place 
19:10
after he passed 
19:12
but Roy didn't want to spend the money 
19:14
he didn't want to put gold on the top 
19:16
of the castle 
19:18
there's a point or something 
19:20
and so Walt waited until he was 
19:22
got a vacation or something and he went up there 
19:24
and had the people put gold up there 
19:26
I mean I assume 
19:28
it was gold paint but anyway 
19:30
he spent the money 
19:32
he wanted top notch 
19:34
anyway so fun 
19:36
listen I know we have to stop 
19:38
at the top of the hour because of things 
19:40
that people have to do 
19:42
but anything else you want to share before we get 
19:44
into questions 
19:46
I was 
19:48
thinking of something just a minute ago 
19:50
I did want to say 
19:52
one more thing about Disney World 
19:54
I think when you're prayed up when you go there 
19:56
you may have opportunities to 
19:58
minister to people 
20:00
I'm not saying everybody there is bad 
20:02
or wicked 
20:04
some stuff going on or being controlled 
20:06
by certain people who are not 
20:08
very good people 
20:10
and I'm not going to name names or anything 
20:12
I'm just saying keep it in your prayers 
20:14
I know Walt is declaring from heaven over it 
20:16
absolutely 
20:18
and that is something God gave him 
20:20
to create 
20:22
and he was very pleased with it 
20:24
he's not so pleased now 
20:26
but it's going to change 
20:28
I just want to encourage people to make sure 
20:30
and no matter where you go 
20:32
this is just for parents of young children 
20:34
make sure you always keep your kids with you 
20:36
make sure you see them 
20:38
and know who they're with 
20:40
please don't just drop them off at some 
20:42
friends house that you don't even know 
20:44
the friends or the family 
20:46
I would do that anyway 
20:48
I always was like that anyway 
20:50
I was always very careful with my children 
20:52
who babysat them 
20:54
but if we went to a big place we made sure 
20:56
we made rules to go in there 
20:58
to make sure we all knew where everybody was 
21:00
if a child was always with 
21:02
an adult that went with us 
21:04
and these days right now 
21:06
with all the stuff going on 
21:08
that would be a good tip 
21:10
for everybody 
21:12
really really really good 
21:14
alright well I have questions for you 
21:16
a whole list of questions here 
21:18
so let me just start with the first one 
21:20
Nathaniel asks 
21:22
and I hadn't heard of this before 
21:24
but here he goes 
21:26
he says I've heard that there are angels 
21:28
that stand at the four corners of our home 
21:30
is this true 
21:32
or are the angels all over our home 
21:34
in and out so that's his question 
21:36
I think it depends on 
21:38
where you put them 
21:40
where you post them 
21:42
you are allowed to say 
21:44
to the angels who are sent 
21:46
to protect you all the time 
21:48
you and your family 
21:50
they're sentries 
21:52
and they're posted here by your home 
21:54
and they pretty much stay around your home 
21:56
you have others that leave and go with you 
21:58
when you go places 
22:00
and I just tell them I'm going to post a sentry 
22:02
at each corner of my home 
22:04
I'm going to post so many over the home 
22:06
and even down the road 
22:08
and they actually go there and that's what they do 
22:10
they watch for anything of darkness coming 
22:12
they pull down strongholds 
22:14
they shred platforms 
22:16
trying to control us 
22:18
spirits of wickedness or whatever 
22:20
of darkness that want to control us 
22:22
or take things from us 
22:24
so they do both 
22:26
they will even march around 
22:28
on your property and watch it all the time 
22:30
or you can post them as sentries 
22:32
in certain places and if you have a second place 
22:34
you can also post sentries there 
22:36
and that is their number one job 
22:38
which will protect that area that they're assigned to 
22:40
that's really good 
22:42
you know I live on acreage 
22:44
that's not all my acreage 
22:46
there's actually a few hundred acres 
22:48
it belongs to the neighbors 
22:50
but in order to keep the dare out 
22:52
I'm involved inside the fence 
22:54
so they put a fence around it 
22:56
I didn't realize this about sentries 
22:58
this is the first time I've heard you say that 
23:00
that I can recall 
23:02
but I felt I was supposed to post sentries 
23:04
and I used that word 
23:06
at every post on the fence 
23:08
around all the property 
23:10
my neighbors as well 
23:12
I said if anyone gets anywhere near us 
23:14
to try to do harm 
23:16
I want them to see these sentries as 
23:18
and I said 
23:20
let them think they're police officers 
23:22
let them whatever 
23:24
if they try to do harm 
23:26
so I don't know what you think about that 
23:28
well you can actually 
23:30
also tell them to expose anyone 
23:32
who's coming, why they're coming 
23:34
and they actually can stop them from coming 
23:36
they'll actually stop them 
23:38
they'll actually interfere with someone trying to 
23:40
come in on the property 
23:42
and that might be appearing them 
23:44
that might be them saying something 
23:46
and even if they can't see them 
23:48
they would hear that 
23:50
so that's what sentries do 
23:52
is keep things away from you 
23:54
and to make sure that your life 
23:56
and your property is safe 
23:58
so you did the right thing by posting sentries 
24:00
that's really good 
24:02
I got really serious one day 
24:04
because there had been 
24:06
evidence of an invasion 
24:08
and I thought I'm not having this 
24:10
I went to town 
24:12
I took off after that 
24:14
alright Star is asking this question 
24:16
she says some of us 
24:18
write letters to God 
24:20
just simply write things down 
24:22
to Him, to God 
24:24
does the Father receive those letters 
24:26
and if He does how does He receive them 
24:30
there's several different ways that can happen 
24:32
I would encourage you if you wrote one 
24:34
read it out loud to Him 
24:36
you can do that when you're just by yourself 
24:38
in your prayer time or just in the time 
24:40
when you're walking or just doing something 
24:42
you can actually read it to Him 
24:44
say Father I have written this letter to you 
24:46
and read it to Him 
24:48
and it's going to hear you 
24:50
read that letter 
24:52
and they probably record it 
24:54
it's probably recorded in heaven 
24:56
they do a lot of recording there's angels 
24:58
that's what they do and they're sent for that 
25:00
they actually record things 
25:02
there's couriers, there's scribes 
25:04
who write things down 
25:06
or else they write things down and you say 
25:08
or they bring messages from heaven 
25:10
that are written 
25:12
I've had both of those happen to me before 
25:14
but absolutely 
25:16
I'm just standing in a spot and just say 
25:18
to your family member 
25:20
I love you, I just want you to know I haven't forgotten you 
25:22
I'm excited about one day being there with you 
25:24
then He'll make sure they hear that 
25:26
people think everything's so far away 
25:28
but especially the Father, the Son of the Holy Spirit 
25:30
if you wanted to really say something to them 
25:32
He loves, by the way 
25:34
writing that thing down 
25:36
is an MO 
25:38
it's a motive operations of the Father 
25:40
He does have 
25:42
we know He has the lamest book of life 
25:44
we know that He has a book of remembrance 
25:46
He actually has many and they're real books 
25:48
they're huge books and He does actually 
25:50
write in them, He likes to write things out 
25:52
Christ would rather say it 
25:56
but the Father writes things down 
25:58
you know He wrote a book about your life 
26:00
before you were even born 
26:02
so I would say you writing things down 
26:04
maybe a good thing would be to get a journal 
26:06
and if you think of something 
26:08
each day to say something to Him 
26:10
then you write down the date and what you wanted 
26:12
to say to Him and make sure He hears that 
26:14
and the other thing you can do with that journal 
26:16
is when He begins to answer you 
26:18
it may be 
26:20
that still small voice inside 
26:22
but you know it's Him answering because He's answering 
26:24
what you just said to Him 
26:26
so that way you can have a two-way 
26:28
conversation and you can record it 
26:30
in a journal and then you can enjoy 
26:32
looking at it later on 
26:34
or maybe leave that for your children one day 
26:36
and they might be surprised if that's said to you 
26:38
or what you said to Him 
26:40
so authorship 
26:42
is a really big thing in heaven 
26:44
everyone has written a book 
26:46
that represents God or heaven 
26:48
or just something really fun 
26:50
but decent they're already on 
26:52
library shelves and your books are already 
26:54
in heaven 
26:56
do you mean everyone's 
26:58
written a book whether they've written it here 
27:00
or not what do you mean by that 
27:02
you said everyone 
27:04
some people still write books in heaven 
27:06
do you 
27:08
but are you saying people that 
27:10
don't write here are actually 
27:12
in effect authoring 
27:14
a book there I'm not quite sure what you're saying 
27:16
what I'm saying is those who 
27:18
have authored a book here 
27:20
those books 
27:22
I saw my own books 
27:24
in a library in heaven 
27:26
so I do know and I was told 
27:28
those who become authors is so 
27:30
important because even when 
27:32
you're gone that book 
27:34
remains here and those words will still 
27:36
be read by people and it may be 
27:38
something spiritual 
27:40
or it could be something just 
27:42
a help book or just something 
27:44
funny that's really decent and people 
27:46
love to read and there's still people 
27:48
who read books at all so you can go get them out of the library 
27:50
or you can just request 
27:52
to have one yourself there in heaven 
27:54
and you have a place for a library in your own 
27:56
mansion so people still 
27:58
still love to read 
28:00
well I thought it was cool when 
28:02
Bill Johnson had my book 
28:04
in his library if my book is in heaven 
28:06
that's way cooler 
28:08
yeah that's very 
28:10
very cool okay let me 
28:12
come back for a moment to 
28:14
this just popped into my head 
28:16
I think I'm supposed to share it like so it's almost 
28:18
15 years ago I didn't know you 
28:20
yet I hadn't heard about either 
28:22
sentries or hosts 
28:24
but I was a praying man 
28:26
and my oldest daughter 
28:28
got in trouble she gave her 
28:30
phone number to a guy 
28:32
in the market 
28:34
and I was furious not at her 
28:36
but that this would happen 
28:38
that he would have it and he started calling 
28:40
and I 
28:42
ripped into the spirit realm 
28:44
and I prayed every prayer 
28:46
every kind of emotion 
28:48
about I wanted God to take 
28:50
it take notice 
28:52
and take action and 
28:54
protect her does God 
28:56
pay attention to the 
28:58
the amount 
29:00
to me there was faith behind that emotion 
29:02
because I knew God would act 
29:04
does God pay attention to our 
29:06
how do I say this 
29:08
angry faith if I can put it that way 
29:10
angry against the devil is what I mean 
29:12
I would say that's called 
29:14
passionate 
29:16
you're fierce against what the enemy is doing 
29:18
of course the fathers can hear you 
29:20
I'm absolutely sure 
29:22
many times he's going to answer that prayer 
29:24
and it may not be the way you think it will 
29:26
happen but it will happen 
29:28
and I've also seen that 
29:30
but you know passionate people 
29:32
God those people who have a passion 
29:34
and you're expressing what you're 
29:36
feeling and what you're thinking 
29:38
especially if it's something that lines up with 
29:40
what God wants and he speaks 
29:42
in this word about protecting and guarding 
29:44
your words and 
29:46
keeping certain people away 
29:48
from you because he doesn't want 
29:50
your family life infiltrated 
29:52
by the enemy 
29:54
or a thing that the enemy could use 
29:56
against you so absolutely 
29:58
especially the words of a parent 
30:00
for the child he's absolutely going to 
30:02
pay attention to that 
30:04
that's kind of like you hear about 
30:06
mama bear I became papa bear 
30:08
I can't 
30:10
remember any time in all of my 
30:12
life I prayed that intensely 
30:14
for my daughter but I 
30:16
felt there was an urgency 
30:18
so I let it rip 
30:20
alright 
30:22
Margaret asked is God 
30:24
the father 
30:26
and or heaven 
30:28
going through time with us 
30:30
on the earth even though the father 
30:32
can move back and forth in and out of time 
30:34
is there a sense of past 
30:36
present and future 
30:38
to Jesus Holy Spirit and the people 
30:40
in heaven so I think 
30:42
I understand where they're coming from do they 
30:44
get a sense of time 
30:46
because we're in time 
30:48
I'm quite sure heaven 
30:50
is very much aware of what's going on 
30:52
in any time 
30:54
actually 
30:56
the father's omnipresent 
30:58
he knows exactly what's going on 
31:00
where's going on and everything so he 
31:02
he has to be aware of what's going on 
31:04
so he can send help 
31:06
or send words or scribes 
31:08
or couriers for whatever 
31:10
purpose so yes he is very 
31:12
much aware even though 
31:14
he's not held by time 
31:16
or bound by time and doesn't 
31:18
operate like the way we 
31:20
operate here in time 
31:22
we have hours we're awake and hours we're sleep 
31:24
they don't sleep in heaven they don't have to 
31:26
but he's still very much aware of what's going on 
31:28
and all over the earth at different times 
31:30
on the earth so yes 
31:32
he's like he's present all the time 
31:34
no matter where we are what's going on 
31:36
and of course he can still go into 
31:38
the past and see things he can go into 
31:40
the future and see things the Bible says 
31:42
he's been from the beginning 
31:44
there would be time 
31:46
from the beginning to the end 
31:48
there is a beginning of time 
31:50
that was right when he 
31:52
first made the earth the end of time 
31:54
is when he wraps it all up and then he makes 
31:56
the new earth and then we're just 
31:58
in eternity we'll be in eternity 
32:00
but during this time 
32:02
I said time during 
32:04
this seasons of our life 
32:06
where time is very much 
32:08
involved with us with heaven 
32:10
then they are seeing things 
32:12
all the time as it's going 
32:14
by but he also knows 
32:16
the end of things at the same time 
32:18
so it's like 
32:20
if we're 
32:22
agonizing in prayer for something to happen 
32:24
that we want or think we need 
32:26
or we do need 
32:28
and there is a sense where God will 
32:30
say 
32:32
it's not time yet for that 
32:34
he'll know that it's 
32:36
three months in the future so he does 
32:38
operate within 
32:40
that framework he knows that this is 
32:42
for three months from now 
32:44
that kind of thing 
32:46
he already knows that he already knows 
32:48
when things are going to happen 
32:50
and even what's going to happen 
32:52
even though people have wills of their own 
32:54
he's already actually been through all of time 
32:56
he's seen all of time already 
32:58
but right now as we're speaking 
33:00
he is watching and he's listening 
33:02
so he can 
33:04
be anywhere at the same time 
33:06
that's one of the great things about him 
33:08
so he's very much involved in our lives 
33:10
at the same time 
33:12
and even does know 
33:14
what that end looks like 
33:16
and I've already told people 
33:18
that he actually did show me 
33:20
when the end of time would be 
33:22
and it's not really a date 
33:24
it's an event 
33:26
and I've learned that about him 
33:28
most of the things he plans 
33:30
and things for on the earth 
33:32
he goes by those events that he has planned 
33:34
and those are things that will happen 
33:36
in the earth 
33:38
that he has planned are going to happen 
33:40
but he did tell me one time 
33:42
he said there will be a day that will come 
33:44
when time will be no more 
33:46
because I won't need time 
33:48
and you won't need time 
33:50
on the earth on the new earth 
33:52
we won't have a clock 
33:54
we won't have things like that going on 
33:56
we will be living forever 
33:58
and we will also plan things by events 
34:00
at that time on the new earth 
34:02
but when everything ends 
34:04
is when time will be no more 
34:06
because he doesn't need 
34:08
time on this earth 
34:10
the reason he needs time now 
34:12
is because he's sending those little spirits 
34:14
from him, that's where everybody came from 
34:16
you lived in him 
34:18
but this is what he said 
34:20
time will be no more 
34:22
when I have sent the last one from myself 
34:24
I won't need time 
34:26
that's good 
34:28
I have a question about time 
34:30
now that we're on the subject 
34:32
Manuel Johnson talks about 
34:34
he's been transported 
34:36
in the future and the past 
34:38
so have you 
34:40
well God took him in the past 
34:42
he transported him in the past 
34:44
he showed him what happened 
34:46
he was there 
34:48
and it brought healing to his soul 
34:50
because God showed him 
34:52
this and that 
34:54
I don't know the whole story 
34:56
because I'm probably not doing it justice 
34:58
but great healing came to him 
35:00
by God taking him back in time 
35:02
does God 
35:04
do that sometimes 
35:06
does he see 
35:08
a need to bring someone back 
35:10
in time 
35:12
I think that he probably does 
35:14
because I know several other people 
35:16
who have encounters like that 
35:18
and 
35:20
I have been taken back in time quite a few times 
35:22
it was all related 
35:24
to things that happened in the Word of God 
35:26
or the way he made heaven 
35:28
the way he made the earth 
35:30
it was always related to revelation 
35:32
when he takes me back in time 
35:34
like he showed me his son on the cross 
35:36
and what happened when he had his spirit leave 
35:38
he took me back 
35:40
and I saw paradise or Abraham's bosom 
35:42
while he was there with the thief 
35:44
I saw him 
35:46
also when he was in hell 
35:48
approached the gates of hell 
35:50
and they were taking him and I saw what happened on the third day 
35:52
I was taken back 
35:54
back in the book of Acts 
35:56
when the Holy Spirit came and invaded 
35:58
in the upper room 
36:00
I mean there's many times he's taken me back 
36:02
I was taken back to the tomb 
36:04
the very day 
36:06
that he came out of that tomb 
36:08
I was taken that day back in time 
36:10
and I actually felt myself traveling 
36:12
it was the one time I felt myself traveling through time 
36:14
and I told people 
36:16
it was like on Star Trek or Star Wars 
36:18
when you go warp speed 
36:20
and those like shoot past you 
36:22
it is exactly like that 
36:24
I know they probably got that idea 
36:26
from the idea zone in heaven 
36:28
about how it looks like when you travel 
36:30
but it actually did 
36:32
and I actually could feel myself moving 
36:34
whenever we got to the part of time 
36:36
God wanted me to see 
36:38
we stopped and my feet just touched the ground 
36:40
crazy 
36:42
and it's like a portal open 
36:44
and I was there 
36:46
I was literally there in that time 
36:48
and I saw Mary go into the tomb 
36:50
looking for him 
36:52
and she saw the person in the garden 
36:54
and she came out and she thought he was the gardener 
36:56
because Christ was actually standing 
36:58
in the flowerbed smelling 
37:00
the flowers 
37:02
when these things happen 
37:04
both that and all the other 
37:06
back in time 
37:08
to be very very clear 
37:10
you went 
37:12
in that time 
37:14
this wasn't a vision 
37:16
a 3D experience 
37:18
you actually were there during the time 
37:20
it actually 
37:22
I was actually there 
37:24
I was wide awake 
37:26
I don't sleep long enough to dream 
37:28
I almost never dream 
37:30
and I have sometimes 
37:32
visions but this is called 
37:34
an encounter 
37:36
an encounter is you are actually 
37:38
there 
37:40
he's not showing me a film 
37:42
my feet touched the ground 
37:44
outside the tomb 
37:46
I saw the stone had been rolled away 
37:48
it was actually quite a ways down thing 
37:50
I also saw Christ standing 
37:52
he has a back turn to 
37:54
where the tomb was 
37:56
and he was literally looking at the flowers 
37:58
because he loves flowers 
38:00
and he had just been through 3 days of you know what 
38:02
and so when he came out of there 
38:04
after thanking his father 
38:06
for all that he had done for him 
38:08
he wanted to be in the midst of the flowers 
38:10
and I actually say 
38:12
Mary surmised 
38:14
or thought he was the gardener 
38:16
and she spoke to him 
38:18
she said her name 
38:20
she knew instantly when she heard him speak 
38:22
that it was him and then he turned around 
38:24
and of course she saw him then 
38:26
and I saw that 
38:28
in person, in that time 
38:30
that's how it happens people 
38:32
and instead of bashing people 
38:34
saying why not ask God to give you an encounter 
38:36
and show you something powerful 
38:38
I've been taking it up many many times 
38:40
for me and I didn't take myself 
38:42
I have to make it clear 
38:44
I didn't take myself 
38:46
that God had purpose for me 
38:48
and he'd already told me we're going to take you back 
38:50
in time, forward in time 
38:52
we're going to give you revelation on the word 
38:54
revelation on the times you're in 
38:56
and show you things to come 
38:58
and if you remember in Revelation 4 
39:00
he actually said that to John 
39:02
I will show you things to come 
39:04
and so that's one of the things that God does 
39:06
with his prophets 
39:08
and so I was literally there 
39:10
in person remember the feeling of the ground 
39:12
the smell of the flowers 
39:14
everything about that place 
39:16
amazing 
39:18
Bobby Connor tells a story 
39:20
about going to the crucifixion 
39:22
not a vision 
39:24
not a 3D idea 
39:26
he was actually there and he said 
39:28
the smells 
39:30
the sights, the sounds 
39:32
you know 
39:34
have you been to the crucifixion as well? 
39:38
I saw a part of the crucifixion 
39:40
it was more what I heard him saying 
39:42
and 
39:44
they were of course 
39:46
very upset that he had died 
39:48
but we know that he actually 
39:50
the thing about Christ was 
39:52
he was such a powerful being 
39:54
he had to lose his soul 
39:56
from his body 
39:58
he actually had to tell it to leave 
40:00
he knew he had to die 
40:02
and so 
40:04
they probably were wondering why in the world hasn't that guy died 
40:06
they even put the sword inside and everything 
40:08
but he finally knew that it was time 
40:10
so he just lost his soul 
40:12
from his body 
40:14
and his spirit man left his body 
40:16
and then of course he was there 
40:18
his body remained on the cross until they took it down 
40:20
they were wrapping it 
40:22
the women were crying 
40:24
John was 
40:26
but John remembered also 
40:28
the words Christ said that he would rise again 
40:30
and so it was a very powerful thing 
40:32
people in the city 
40:34
people I could hear crying 
40:36
in the whole area there 
40:38
that he had died 
40:40
because they loved him so much 
40:42
he had helped so many people 
40:44
and did so many miracles 
40:46
they said you couldn't even put him in a book 
40:48
there were so many people count the miracles 
40:50
it says if the books were written 
40:52
of all the things he did 
40:54
the books would go around the world 
40:56
like the planet people 
40:58
so he was non-stop 
41:00
all the time doing his work 
41:02
that God gave him to do 
41:04
and so it was an emotional time 
41:06
but of course I already knew 
41:08
that he was going to raise from the dead 
41:10
but I had visited that place 
41:12
and then of course 
41:14
I was taken back 
41:16
when he came out of the tomb 
41:18
and then I was taken back 
41:20
when he was down in hell 
41:22
and then I was taken back 
41:24
I was taken back in time when he actually 
41:26
was sent into heaven 
41:28
and one of the angels had this urn with his blood 
41:30
because he had to pour that out on the mercy seat in heaven 
41:32
and so he showed me these things 
41:34
and he showed me the reality 
41:36
of the word of God 
41:38
it was so powerful 
41:40
but yes I have encounters 
41:42
he clearly comes and takes me 
41:44
just takes me 
41:46
like in a second and it doesn't matter where I am 
41:48
really and I gave him permission 
41:50
so it might be better if you say I give you permission 
41:52
to take me whenever you want to 
41:54
or speak to me whenever you want to 
41:56
that encourages him to do it actually 
41:58
and I don't even say that to him 
42:00
when he told me this is what we're going to have you do 
42:02
commission on the earth as a revelator 
42:04
this is what you're going to do and I said I'd give you permission 
42:06
whenever you want to 
42:08
and I guess while we're talking about 
42:10
time okay now you got me 
42:12
I have heard 
42:14
you and others talk about 
42:16
okay he said 
42:18
to the thief that was saved 
42:20
that became saved 
42:22
he said I'm telling you this day 
42:24
today you will be with me 
42:26
in paradise he didn't say in hell 
42:28
he said in paradise 
42:30
I have not heard anyone say 
42:32
during those three days 
42:34
what did he do 
42:36
in paradise 
42:38
no one's ever really related that 
42:40
to me at least 
42:42
well the first thing he did was preach the gospel to all of them 
42:46
it said he 
42:48
it said that he took captivity 
42:50
captive 
42:52
the captivity that was 
42:54
it was called Abraham's wisdom and paradise 
42:56
it is the same place 
42:58
where the dead 
43:00
we died if you were faithful and knew God 
43:02
and believed in God himself 
43:04
this is before the Messiah came 
43:06
God counted that your faith 
43:08
as being you know 
43:10
you were just and you were faithful 
43:12
so he didn't send them to hell 
43:14
they couldn't ascend to heaven though 
43:16
because Christ hadn't gone back to heaven 
43:18
pour out the blood except of course we know Elijah 
43:20
and Enoch literally were taken to heaven 
43:22
in their bodies and they're still there in the physical bodies 
43:24
I believe that they were glorified 
43:26
when he took them up to heaven already 
43:28
because they didn't have to die 
43:30
and that was the Father's choice to do that 
43:32
but 
43:34
but it is quite a thing 
43:36
for God to trust you to do things 
43:38
and share things for him 
43:40
but yes 
43:42
but that's his choice to take me 
43:44
I don't take myself 
43:46
but he actually entered into paradise 
43:48
because he had to keep his word 
43:50
to the thief 
43:52
thank you Holy Spirit said the XT 
43:54
he had to keep his word 
43:56
and he didn't say I'll see you tomorrow 
43:58
he said this day 
44:00
that day 
44:02
that day 
44:04
and so when he died 
44:06
they actually 
44:08
I think he died before the thieves 
44:10
didn't they have to come break their legs so they would die 
44:12
I think so because they had to break the legs 
44:14
and all that with the thieves 
44:16
so Christ descended into paradise 
44:18
paradise 
44:20
was not a place with rocks 
44:22
and you think well it's in the earth 
44:24
there's a bunch of rocks sitting around 
44:26
it was a city 
44:28
it was a beautiful city God made 
44:30
faithful 
44:32
and that's where his friends he called 
44:34
Abraham you know that was his friend 
44:36
many others of 
44:38
back in the Old Testament were friends of God 
44:40
because they chose to be friends 
44:42
of God and he didn't send them to hell 
44:44
they still had to 
44:46
they had to descend though 
44:48
when you believe in Christ now 
44:50
and you die you don't descend at all 
44:52
you ascend 
44:54
into heaven that's where he does the big difference 
44:56
because Christ has been there 
44:58
he made the way back 
45:00
he cleansed it he put the blood 
45:02
on the altar showing that he had 
45:04
died for everyone's sins 
45:06
and so that changed everything about 
45:08
for those who died that believed in Christ it changed 
45:10
some things happen that change 
45:12
everything and so 
45:14
yes he did go down there he was talking 
45:16
to Abraham he was talking to Joseph 
45:18
who raised him 
45:20
he was talking to all those people 
45:22
the faith of David all of those 
45:24
were in paradise and at one 
45:26
point they all exited 
45:28
and left paradise 
45:30
is empty now there's nothing there it's 
45:32
still there people actually 
45:34
asked me would Satan take it over he doesn't 
45:36
have the ability to take 
45:38
paradise over that's like 
45:40
a holy place that God made 
45:42
for those who loved him and believed in him 
45:44
and no hell can't take 
45:46
paradise and use it people 
45:48
he's never going to get paradise 
45:50
so he would have taken 
45:52
Joseph the one who was sold 
45:54
in Egypt 
45:56
he would have taken David 
45:58
Solomon and he would have preached 
46:00
the gospel and said this is what 
46:02
it means to be saved 
46:04
this is what I had to do that 
46:06
kind of thing he would have told the whole story 
46:08
he literally changed the gospel as if 
46:10
you tell people 
46:12
that Jesus Christ gave his life 
46:14
that he gave his life so 
46:16
that we might have a way to go back 
46:18
to heaven where we all came from 
46:20
there had to be a prize 
46:22
paid there had to be a sacrifice made 
46:24
and he actually told all of them 
46:26
they had like a gathering and he 
46:28
just preached the gospel to everybody there 
46:30
and everyone there received 
46:32
him as their Messiah 
46:34
they had to receive him as 
46:36
their Messiah because that's what 
46:38
makes it possible for you to go 
46:40
you know to go into heaven 
46:42
and so he did he preached the gospel 
46:44
he said he preached the gospel 
46:46
and so then he took captivity 
46:48
he captivated them 
46:50
with his love and his sacrifice 
46:52
for all for all those 
46:54
who choose him and so they then 
46:56
eventually they did 
46:58
exit Abraham's bosom 
47:00
or paradise 
47:02
and they are all now in heaven 
47:04
they don't use that anymore 
47:06
it's not used but it is still there 
47:08
it had golden buildings 
47:10
it actually had a river 
47:12
now these are spiritual places 
47:14
because you're there in your spiritual body 
47:16
I will explain to people the difference 
47:18
of being in the flesh and being in the spirit 
47:20
you have a spiritual body 
47:22
and it looks like you but it looks a lot better 
47:24
you look young you're full of energy 
47:26
and life and so 
47:28
when you died you entered into this 
47:30
spiritual round place that was paradise 
47:32
or if you were wicked 
47:34
there's a great gulf that separates those places 
47:36
I think the people 
47:38
in paradise can see the gates of hell 
47:40
and they know hell if they come up 
47:42
to the gates can see 
47:44
like it's like 
47:46
I can't think of what you call it 
47:48
a balcony they see like this big 
47:50
balcony that they can see in a far 
47:52
distance because remember the dream 
47:54
that the wicked man had 
47:56
and he wanted the beggar to bring a drop 
47:58
of water and put it on his tongue 
48:00
burning in hell that dream 
48:02
was real that was real 
48:04
and that's a good way to explain 
48:06
you read that dream and see what happened 
48:08
there was a hell he was burning in hell 
48:10
and he was telling God please send 
48:12
someone to 
48:14
earth to tell them about this place 
48:16
it's horrible I don't want my family to come 
48:18
here and of course God's answer 
48:20
to him was it wouldn't matter who came 
48:22
they're wicked in their heart and they 
48:24
don't want it 
48:26
and he said so that but he would not send 
48:28
Lazarus who was a beggar 
48:30
who was a beggar on the earth and he was 
48:32
they could see that he's eating 
48:34
he knew they were eating there's like 
48:36
a king's table a feast set there 
48:38
you still eat in your spiritual body 
48:40
people in heaven and these 
48:42
people in paradise were eating they had 
48:44
buildings that they stayed in 
48:46
they had a beautiful river they even had a 
48:48
sky because it was a spiritual 
48:50
place oh wow okay 
48:52
of the year he wouldn't take his 
48:54
friends who actually believed 
48:56
in him and lived right 
48:58
he wouldn't send them to place 
49:00
it was a dark money place here you 
49:02
are in the middle of the earth sitting next to the lava 
49:04
that wasn't going to happen 
49:06
God made this place beautiful 
49:08
and it and it was beautiful 
49:10
let me ask this one last question because 
49:12
I know we have to stop at the top of the hour 
49:14
there was a great earthquake 
49:16
when Jesus was crucified 
49:18
and graves were open what have you 
49:20
seen if anything 
49:22
as far as that have you seen 
49:24
that event 
49:26
graves open the earthquake I know 
49:28
it didn't happen I know that the 
49:30
earthquake was shook and graves 
49:32
open and people saw 
49:34
I'm trying to remember I don't know if they gave a number 
49:36
or something but it was quite a few 
49:38
it was quite a few hundred I believe 
49:40
they were actually noted 
49:42
it was noted and written somewhere I don't know 
49:44
maybe Josephus or somebody wrote that down 
49:46
but it does mention in the Bible that 
49:48
they had an earthquake and the graves were 
49:50
opened and they saw people walk it was just 
49:52
another testimony that that was 
49:54
the son of God I mean a lot of people 
49:56
began to believe that was the son of God 
49:58
cross that was the son of God 
50:00
because he knows that couldn't have happened any other way 
50:02
so that really did happen 
50:04
people came up out of the graves and they walked around 
50:06
it was fascinating 
50:08
it was fascinating 
50:10
but you know it's interesting because 
50:12
you know it shows integrity 
50:14
on your part because you're not making it up 
50:16
if God didn't show you 
50:18
you're not saying God showed me 
50:20
you're saying I didn't see people walking out 
50:22
of the grave 
50:24
people walking out of the graves when there was 
50:26
an earthquake so that to me 
50:28
that adds credibility to you 
50:30
because you could make something out of it 
50:32
I wasn't taking and showing those people walking 
50:34
but I do know that did happen 
50:36
I do know that did happen 
50:38
they still talk about it in heaven sometimes 
50:40
wow I'd love to see a video of that 
50:42
and I guess in heaven we get to see 
50:44
replays that we want right 
50:46
if we want to see what that looks like 
50:48
absolutely can see replays 
50:50
awesome I like 
50:52
those are the kind of re-runs I want to see 
50:54
that if you will 
50:56
pray for the people 
50:58
before we go and just 
51:00
bless them if you will 
51:02
Father I thank you for this 
51:04
beautiful day I thank you for your 
51:06
holy son our king 
51:08
of kings I thank you for 
51:10
Holy Spirit who can be 
51:12
our best friend but is still God 
51:14
he was sent to come alongside 
51:16
us and then when we choose to invite 
51:18
him to indwell us he actually 
51:20
moves on the inside of us and then 
51:22
he'll never stop talking to us 
51:24
but I thank you for that 
51:26
that you are very much involved in our lives 
51:28
and you do care for everyone 
51:30
and I 
51:32
pray Father that people 
51:34
have to understand they need to understand 
51:36
that when they have 
51:38
someone who belongs to Jesus Christ 
51:40
and they receive Jesus Christ 
51:42
when they move to heaven it is 
51:44
a good thing 
51:46
it is a good thing for them 
51:48
that's why they celebrate in heaven 
51:50
they don't weep and cry when someone comes home 
51:52
they celebrate 
51:54
because God loves it when one of his children 
51:56
come home one of his sons or his daughters 
51:58
they come home to heaven they actually have 
52:00
a huge celebration rewards are given 
52:02
from the throne at that time and then 
52:04
all their family and friends go to see 
52:06
this person's mansion and then they get 
52:08
undone by how beautiful and amazing 
52:10
or adventurous even 
52:12
these mansions are so powerful 
52:14
thank you Father for thinking of us in the 
52:16
past now in this time 
52:18
and in the future you know where we are 
52:20
you know that we love you 
52:22
I thank you in these days 
52:24
set a table 
52:26
and the presence of everyone's enemies 
52:28
that would be the left 
52:30
that would be the liberals 
52:32
all those evil people colluding 
52:34
and flaming together to take over 
52:36
this world which makes me laugh 
52:38
ha ha ha 
52:40
because this earth was 
52:42
made by you and your son 
52:44
and it says the earth and the focus 
52:46
now belongs to Jesus Christ 
52:48
the earth is your footstool 
52:50
because 
52:52
you're ever watching us 
52:54
thank you for intervening in lives 
52:56
people have lost things like 
52:58
their property or their 
53:00
money is running low I thank you 
53:02
right now you take out 
53:04
of your own stock 
53:06
and you give to those people 
53:08
Father because they're trusting you 
53:10
they're believing you and they're 
53:12
staying excited I thank you 
53:14
for showing yourself strong on their path 
53:16
in these days right now 
53:18
in Jesus name 
53:20
so be it 
53:22
and everyone said 
53:24
amen and amen 
53:26
I just want to encourage people to go to 
53:28
revealingheaven.com 
53:30
cats two books are there and other products 
53:32
go to catcur.com 
53:34
that's the only place you can give 
53:36
into her ministry and I hope you will 
53:38
support her ministry at catcur.com 
53:40
it was one more little thing I did want to mention 
53:42
I will be of course 
53:44
in Colorado at a women's event 
53:46
and then less than a week later 
53:48
I'll be up with Hank 
53:50
and the other ones 
53:52
who have been invited to open the heaven 
53:54
and I just want people to know we 
53:56
actually have created some new things 
53:58
that represent heaven that we will be taking with us 
54:00
but I do know during 
54:02
my time that I get to speak 
54:04
on Saturday I think it's Saturday 
54:06
maybe it's Friday 
54:08
it's Saturday it is Saturday 
54:10
I will actually be sharing about 
54:12
Spirit Force 
54:14
if you haven't made reservations 
54:16
you can still have time to go 
54:18
I believe they still have seats left in that 
54:20
Mid-America Center 
54:22
and I'm just letting you know ahead of time 
54:24
I actually will be talking about Spirit Force 
54:26
and I'm excited to see people 
54:28
and share that truth, that new revelation 
54:30
from the Father with everybody there 
54:32
I'm looking forward to seeing all of you in person 
54:34
and may God keep you, bless you 
54:36
protect you on your journey, protect your family 
54:38
whoever is not 
54:40
not going with you 
54:42
and may He supply all that you need 
54:44
to get to that event because it will be life 
54:46
things and many of the prophets 
54:48
will be there 
54:50

01:00
Well, welcome to Elijah's Streams. It is Wednesday, February 1, but we are recording this the
01:20
day before, so I'm recording this in the clock behind us. We'll say Tuesday, January 31,
01:24
but you will see this in the morrow on Wednesday, so we're very excited to bring you Kat again today.
01:30
She has a shorter schedule because they're in the middle of a move, so we're going to do 35
01:34
minutes and fast and furious and we'll have a good time. I had to hook myself up today and
01:39
all the things are dragging in. Anyway, hope the dog doesn't bark because I didn't take care of
01:44
that ahead of time, so we'll see how this goes. So pretty short show, but we'll enjoy every minute
01:50
of it, so we're not going to run any spots or any other announcements. Tomorrow, by the way,
01:53
is Robin Bullock, so don't miss that. So you're hearing this on Wednesday, so Thursday will be
01:58
Robin Bullock. So all right, without further delay, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go.
02:04
Hi, Kat. So you're in the middle of a move this week, huh?
02:24
Yes, and we are so excited. I'm really excited.
02:29
Awesome. Well, it's good to see you. We've got questions. We were going to jump right into
02:33
questions today. Anything you wanted to say before we do that?
02:37
I just want to say how much I love everybody and thank you for all the prayers you've given us over
02:43
the years and even for this move, which sometimes seems almost impossible. Here we are moving tonight
02:52
and tomorrow night. So we seriously are moving and we are all very excited. You know, it's a
02:59
beautiful place. We know people there. We're going to meet a lot more people. I know God's
03:03
going to be there too, of course. And so, yeah, we're trying to use our time as wisely as we can
03:11
and our staff is actually going to come tomorrow to help. They have been bugging us forever.
03:16
Please, let us help. Let us help. Yeah, we've got to take that, man. It's more talking than moving,
03:21
but we're all very excited about how God has blessed us. So, yeah. And I feel that you're
03:28
paying on the moving too. You know, you can have fun with friends and everything, but man,
03:35
every time I've ever moved, we moved about something like 17 times in our married life.
03:40
It's crazy. Wow. One time a year for the first half of the year. And then this place we've been
03:45
at for 23 years now. Yeah. Yeah, so amazing. Well, listen, Kat, so you're pretty excited
03:53
about the future still. Are you optimistic about how things are going? I am optimistic about
03:59
everything God has said or told me and still intend to do. So, absolutely, yes, we all are.
04:05
We're all very optimistic. By the way, once again, not intentionally, but we wore them. You got your
04:10
teal on your hat and I got my teal on my tie and you're... Yeah. And that is heaven's color,
04:16
you said, or heaven's favorite color. So, if I'm saying that right. Okay, so Kat, let me just jump
04:22
in and ask you one question that I may have asked you a variant of this from time to time, but
04:27
when people go to heaven, they've died and now they've graduated to heaven and you've said
04:34
people, when they get to heaven, don't start comparing, don't say, how did you die? No,
04:37
how did you die? They don't do that. But do... Would someone show up? Let's say they meet their parents
04:44
and their parents are young like they are. They're everybody's in their 20s and 30s, I guess, looking
04:48
at them. Does that... When they sit down and have coffee or whatever it is you do in heaven,
04:54
do the parents say, well, tell me what happened last time we were there, you didn't even know the
04:59
Lord, what happened? Do they tell that kind of story? And some say... Sometimes they do,
05:04
if something's really on their heart, sure. And nobody minds at all if they ask some questions
05:10
like that. I would have thought, you know, in my P-brain, I would have thought that that would
05:16
be almost a sure thing that everybody would want to hear that story. But you... It sounds a little
05:21
bit like it's more of an exception to the rule. Well, they actually hold meetings already when
05:26
they come. Every time somebody comes new from earth, they always have huge events and everybody
05:32
wants to come so they can hear what's been going on. Oh, okay. It's not gonna be any really good news,
05:37
anything that's changed or maybe major things have happened that they would want to know about.
05:42
That's an automatic, that part is automatic. So everybody will attend me somewhere. And then
05:49
that person will be invited over and over and over again to visit people, speak places.
05:54
And so, yeah, it's very exciting. Okay, very cool. So let's see, I wanted to go with this one.
06:02
This one was... I've had this... Somehow I came across my desk I've had since December.
06:06
It says, okay, I love Kat. I purchased and read her wonderful books. I find them very encouraging.
06:14
I would like to ask her this question. The Bible says, when you try to approach the throne of God
06:19
or God himself, you become very, very fearful. I have not heard Kat talking about the reverential
06:26
fear of the, fear the Bible speaks of when it went in the presence of the great and almighty God.
06:33
So I guess they're asking once you go to be with the Lord or once you visit heaven. I'm not quite
06:40
sure where the reverential fear is that she's wanting to address. What would you say about that?
06:48
I think it would probably depend on what was going on in its own home at the time. Of course,
06:54
I've always, always had such holy reverence and love for the Father, for the Son, for the Holy Spirit
07:02
that never changes. You never, ever get familiar with all that and not any of it. It's just
07:09
overwhelming sometimes, the peace and the love that you experience when you're there.
07:14
And of course, when I go many times, I'm like eight. Yeah, that's what you said.
07:19
Not all viewpoint would be entirely different than most people who are already adults.
07:26
So I think about what kind of fun will I have? Where will we take me? What will we do?
07:30
I love him so much. I'm so excited to be here. So that would be the way that I would look
07:36
at things and he wants me to. He wants me to see him that way. And there's other people who feel
07:42
that way also. Well, yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. But you talked about how
07:50
you've gone as an eight year old and that you usually go as an eight year old. So God sees you
07:56
and you interact, I guess, as an eight year old. And you have said many times that heaven is like
08:02
50 percent worship, serious worshiping the Lord and 50 percent fun. Am I quoting you right? Is that about right?
08:09
I would have to say yes. And he even says sometimes it's 50 percent fun. I'd have to make it fun. You come
08:16
like a child. It makes sense. And so if you tell a story about this, I saw this or I saw that. And
08:27
it makes the children or you at eight years old, when you go, giggle and laugh to see something
08:34
funny, that's something that's in the heart of God to provide. Giggles and laughter and even goofiness
08:42
when you're having fun, right? Yeah, you know, most everyone who comes says you must come like a
08:48
child, right? And he wants us to feel that, you know, you're really all that innocent and excited
08:57
and you know, you're going to have a good time. I mean, he is our father. That's who he is. That
09:01
doesn't take anything away from his sovereignty, you know, his holiness, his power, the life he
09:07
gives people. It doesn't change that. It's just that from my perspective and the way he's always
09:13
taught me, he taught me as his daughter, he taught me as a child. So I see from their perspective.
09:19
Okay, okay, cool. All right, Isaac is age 15. And he's asking this, are the world's wonders in heaven?
09:27
For example, the hanging guards of Babylon, the Colosseum and so on, because we think of the seven
09:32
wonders of the world, he's like, no, are those wonders in heaven? There are wonders, it says
09:40
of course, those wonders in heaven. But I think it is the famous ones that we know, like, no, not
09:47
those. Okay, not those. It would be like, you know, like the Valley of the Valley of the Falls
09:54
would be definitely one the throne room, of course, absolutely the streets of gold, his rainbow. I
10:01
mean, there's so many different things you would want to see the crystal sea, where you can swim
10:06
under the water and breathe and talk and meet all the creatures there. So of course, they do actually
10:11
have their list on quite sure of amazing places. Oh, yeah, the city is there. So there's so many
10:20
things to do, see and learn about people have their favorites once they've been there for a while.
10:24
So I would say, yes, it is sort of like, maybe more than eight. Yeah, well, you know, all right. And
10:31
so if someone said, well, I will always hope that I never could go to see the Grand Canyon, I hope
10:36
that I could see it in heaven. It's not like God needs to give you the Grand Canyon, he's got the
10:41
grand everything. He absolutely has the grand, the grand of everything, you're right. So it's not
10:49
like you missed that anymore. Won't you see what he's got there? Yeah, so good. Okay. Pam is asking
10:55
this, can't you taught us that our level of spiritual authority grows as we mature in Christ?
11:01
Can you tell us what a brand new Christians authority looks like? I don't, I guess,
11:07
I have to interpret what she means. What does it look like? What, what would you say
11:11
a brand new Christians authority like? I think maybe she's asking the moment you're saved and
11:16
you're brand new. Do you walk out and possess certain authority that you didn't have? Or
11:21
what does it look like if you're brand new? I think that no one can really maybe even think
11:28
about that ahead of time. I think you are so undone by the glory that, you know, the glory we create
11:35
for him, the splendors and the wonders that are there. You're so overwhelmed by his goodness
11:42
that he gives us. But I'm brand new believer especially. They're overwhelmed really at what
11:50
has been given to what Christ actually did give you, what you can operate in, how to do that,
11:55
and what difference it would make here in the earth if everybody did. So yeah, there's a lot of
12:00
things that there's so many things that we could talk about and discuss, but always those feelings
12:06
of a new believer realize what has been paid for for them and what it's like to operate.
12:14
There's like nothing is, you know, I don't think as much as I've been excited in all the years
12:20
afterwards, I think the cream of the crop was the first week days and weeks after I encountered God
12:26
and everything. It's hard to find that level of first love very many times. Don't get me wrong.
12:32
I seek it and I do discover major encounters, but you're overwhelmed by that love. Absolutely yes.
12:40
Yeah. I mean the Old Testament when I had the encounter with God 81,
12:45
even the Old Testament screamed grace, grace, grace. I read it and I said,
12:48
there's grace all over this thing and I had only seen bad news and that's them.
12:53
All right. So Jan is asking this, when people first get to meet Jesus in heaven, what is the
12:59
first most common response? Is it a joyful celebration kind of moment or a holy worship
13:05
kind of moment? So what is that? I mean, yeah, so like, go ahead. Yeah, I think most of the time
13:11
it's probably more of a holy thing. You are so undone knowing you're meeting actually the risen
13:19
Savior, the one who gave everything for you. So I have seen most of the people probably would have
13:25
that holy reverential thing that we talked about. Yeah. Unless you're a kid, then you're going to be
13:30
like, yeah, besides yourself excited. Yeah. Well, you know, I, when I picture it for myself, I think,
13:39
I think I'd fall on my knees or I would be, I would feel like falling and I feel like tears
13:45
would come, but they would be tears of absolute unbelievable joy that we made it and he did
13:51
this for me. And are there tears of joy? You know, there are tears of joy. I don't people think you
13:57
never cry again in heaven. At the end of the Bible, it says every tear will be wiped away. You know,
14:03
the former things, you know, more. That's the end of everything when it says, you don't cry,
14:08
but crying for joy, excitement, gratefulness. Yeah, that's, it's a wonderful feeling anyway.
14:16
And you absolutely love it. So yes, people still do that. Cool. Very cool. All right. Reggie's
14:23
asking this, will teams of people work together or collaborate together to create things in heaven
14:29
or on the new earth, like in these say, it's like groups work together on earth now to create or
14:36
will, but we only create individually using our individual gifts and talents. So I guess he's
14:40
likes doing things together as a group. And will we collaborate and do things together? That's
14:45
the answer. We do collaborate and do things together. Of course we do. And you do learn how
14:51
to create, not people, but there's creation lab where you think that's for in heaven. Okay.
14:56
All kinds of things, places that we can make for each other, not talking about like our
15:02
mansions or anything like that, but there we all have a creative ability because of who they are
15:08
and so absolutely people get excited. Yes. And actually people say, well, what do people do?
15:15
There's nothing to do there. You don't have a job or you create stuff. You hold events everywhere
15:22
and everybody wants to be a part of your event. So yes, those things do happen a lot.
15:28
That's good. Good. Okay. I have so many rabbit trails that I want to go to, but I'm going to jump
15:35
to the next question. Elizabeth asks, how do I know if my child goes to heaven? If my child goes
15:41
to heaven in her sleep, I asked this because she has a dear friend and recently that recently moved
15:48
to heaven twice this week. She said she had a dream about them playing together and running.
15:54
I'm not sure if I understand the question. How do I know if my child goes to heaven in her sleep?
16:00
I asked this because she has a dear friend. Oh, she's saying when my child is sleeping,
16:05
did she go to heaven and visit? That's what she's asking. That is a great possibility. Sure. Yeah,
16:10
he takes people while they're sleeping. Okay. So they may, they say, Mom, I had this dream and I
16:16
was playing. Yeah, my green kids have actually had that happen to them quite often. Okay. And
16:22
those five places in heaven, like when they were four years old and they went, they didn't even
16:28
know those places were there. But I mean, they have been that they ride, they rode, I think I
16:32
mentioned before, you would ride lava out of a volcano. Yeah. My grandfather, my dad. Yeah,
16:38
there are some of those giggles, by the way. I love the giggles. Giggles of God. Someone needs to
16:42
write that book because we serve a happy, joyful, funny. By the way, of all the three, Father,
16:52
Son and Holy Spirit. Who's funniest if you could, if you, who's clever with their wit if you, if you
16:59
had. I would have to say there's either Holy Spirit, probably or Jesus. I think Jesus definitely has
17:04
the wit. I think they call Holy, well, I know they call Holy Spirit the drama king. Yeah.
17:10
Right there. He loves a good joke. He really does. He loves like all kinds of drama and exciting
17:19
things going on up there. So I would have to say probably more of those. The father is definitely
17:24
for love. Yeah. Just dad, father, you know, I think Kim Robinson has had multiple trips together.
17:30
She calls him daddy, God. You've had, I'm not asking you to say the names, your private names
17:35
for God, but God has given you different names that you call him. Is that right? Yes, he had.
17:40
That's a real interesting thing. And I've known several others that were like that. They say I've
17:44
called them such and such and it would be something I'd never heard. But God gave, I don't know,
17:49
maybe he gives different people the same ones, but that's pretty special. All right.
17:55
He's just asking, how do you pray when asking God to relocate? How do you pinpoint where God
18:03
wants you? I guess that means to move. I do not want to move to a place out of his will. So he's
18:07
saying, she's saying, how do you pray when you're asking God to relocate you? I mean, I guess you,
18:14
you want to tell him, I guess you want to ask, okay, I don't even know how to interpret that
18:19
more than the question. So yeah. So what's your thoughts on that?
18:26
So I think she wants to move, but she doesn't want to move to the wrong place because God
18:31
didn't tell her to do or something like that. She's, she's going, you know, how do I pray?
18:36
I would say, you know, you want his will done more than anything else and asked him to please
18:41
give him permission to let you know. It's a good way to do that. You get, you get him permission
18:46
to let you know if it's not the place he wants or maybe something different like that. I think
18:51
most of the time, if it's, if it's about him and you've heard him maybe say things like that in
18:58
his will towards you, I think people are so centered on pleasing him and making sure they
19:04
don't step out of what he wants. So they don't mess up their life. I don't think he'd let them mess
19:08
their life up if maybe they did choose something differently, but, but telling him that certainly
19:14
is going to help you stay focused. And for the people that, that are not seers and they don't
19:20
see all the things in the spirit like you do. I mean, can they say, Lord, I think you're telling
19:25
me to go here, but if I'm wrong, would you close the door before I absolutely ask you to do that.
19:32
You absolutely could do that. It's a good idea. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. All right. Shonda,
19:37
Shonda, I must be Shonda. How do you release the anointing when you're on a telephone call?
19:42
How would you do it if they, if they call you and you want to release the anointing? I'm sure
19:47
she's meeting on the other person on the other end. So yeah, I would just hold my phone and I
19:52
would just say it, or I would do it before I call them or he knew that I was going to call their
19:57
number. I would say I released this, the anointing into this phone call when they pick it up, it'll
20:02
go right into them. Okay. Okay. All right. Jill, let's see. This is partially cut off. Let me make
20:09
sure I can read the whole thing. Okay. Jill says, as a seer, when I'm in church, I often see huge
20:16
angels that stand between the first front, front seats and rows in front of the podium where the
20:25
pastor preaches. It is always in the same position no matter what church. The angel is so big that
20:30
his head is outside the roof. I didn't, I didn't notice an angel where we were going to church
20:35
now until the last couple of weeks. Can you speak of what you know about those angels? I guess she's
20:42
wanted to know if, if that's identifiable or something you've seen? I've seen angels 2,000 feet
20:48
high, probably even higher than that in heaven. So just to what every side imagine is there.
20:54
And I don't know that typically it's certain, you know, a tribe of angels or something like that.
21:01
I just know that they do have many different sizes of angels. Do you, this is never a question
21:08
that has never been popped to my head, but if you've seen 2,000 foot angels and you've seen
21:12
angels that are probably roughly your size. Yes. So are massively tall angels by definition
21:20
massively more powerful? Is that what the big means or what would you say? Possibly, but
21:26
maybe possibly not. It's just that God loved making different types of angels or the hosts
21:32
and he practiced well at doing that. Okay. Cool. All right. Cheryl is asking this question.
21:42
She goes, I've heard you speak about how our loved ones in heaven can go to a portal on special
21:46
days for us and sing happy birthday. For example, is the reverse true? My husband went to heaven
21:52
less than two years ago. Can I sing happy birthday to him on his special day and have him hear me
21:58
singing it? I'm sure that you could. I know that I have sung different things like to my father,
22:07
like on Father's Day or something like that. I know that sounds odd, but I do really love my
22:12
dad and a great relationship with him. And yes, and I know for a fact that Father has said you
22:17
can sing what you'd like to them and he'll make sure they hear it. Yeah. Now I've said,
22:23
this is maybe years past, but I've, you know, before I heard that you maybe can speak directly
22:28
in there. They hear it in the spirit realm or something. However, but I've said, Lord, would
22:34
you give my dad this message to tell him like, and I've said, like one time I said, tell my dad,
22:39
I forgive him for those things. I don't even know that if that's appropriate thing because he's in
22:44
bliss. Why would he need to hear that? But that's, that would be my question. What kind of things
22:51
can you send as a messenger or ask God to set an angel and tell your dad, you know, can you say
22:56
something like that? Tell him I forgive him. You mean on earth or in heaven? No, I'm saying,
23:03
you know, he's in heaven now and you know that when he left, he left a mess like that was the case
23:09
with my dad. And if I would have said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I mean,
23:15
that was years past, but what do you think about that? You just say, no, no, don't go there because
23:20
he's already happy. He doesn't need that. I think that I don't think I would mind you saying that
23:27
and all of somebody. I think it would be all right to say that. Even though they wouldn't still have to hear it. Yeah,
23:34
because they already, yeah, I hear you. It's not like his soul needs to be unburdened for what he
23:42
did. So it's just words of love, I think. Yeah. Okay. Dolores is asking this, do regular common
23:50
people from different generations mingle with one another? For example, would an auto executive that
23:56
went to heaven in 2022 mingle with the poor widow from Elijah's days, would they have things of
24:02
interest to talk to? I think anyone who you would meet there would have, there's almost everybody's
24:11
going to have something that they would love to talk to about you to you or with you. And you would
24:17
find it very fascinating. So people still love to have conversations. They like to reason together,
24:22
talk together. They love to share things. I mean, that never stops happening. Not here on earth or
24:27
in heaven. Well, and then is there the sense that throughout eternity or as long as you're on heaven,
24:34
one day, it's everyone's going to be on new earth. But as long as you're in heaven,
24:39
are people making new friends all the time? Or do they kind of establish their friendship
24:44
thing and their friends hang? Oh, they make new friendships all the time, no matter where they
24:50
go. They do. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, Tracy. Oh, this, this does occur to me to ask this question
25:00
because you've talked because we said a minute ago about the portals in heaven. And you know,
25:04
your loved ones can look down on special occasions. Can't with that being possible,
25:10
could someone, this is probably a dorky question, but because someone say, hey,
25:15
they should do her girlfriend from earth and now they're all both in heaven together. And he says,
25:19
come on to the portal. I want to, it's my daughter's birthday. I want to say, I want to see them and
25:24
come and see where my daughter, what my daughter's up to. Could they do something like that? Or is
25:29
it only for personal family? You know what I mean? I think a lot is for family, but I think you could,
25:37
there's people who would push doing anything or talking about anything to anybody if they could
25:42
there. So yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of these questions are questions that you don't, it's not
25:48
like you walk around knowing the answers to all these deep questions, but yeah. Yeah. Okay.
25:57
Tracy's asking this, I'm a worship dancer. Can you elaborate a little more on what
26:02
happens when we minister and dance? And this seems like it's a common question. People want to know
26:07
when I do this on earth, what's it, what's happening? What is it accomplishing is, I think, is what
26:16
she's saying. What happens when I dance? I mean, that could go a bunch of directions. What is the
26:21
Lord doing? What's happening in the spirit realm? I mean, is, would you have any thoughts? Because
26:26
you're a seer. Do you see people dance and then see things happening because of it?
26:30
I see a lot of mostly music. Of course, I do see some dance. And sometimes you dance, you're not
26:38
even on the floor, like in the throne room, they have a lot of dance and pageantry and stuff in
26:43
there going on. It's absolutely beautiful. And of course, there's ways that you collect things
26:50
as you dance. And then it's represented in some other way in heaven, like you create artwork or
26:56
paintings by your dance. Even though it is with dance, not with your paintings, it's just something
27:02
that's created as something to remember that about. Okay. And back for those that are dancing on earth,
27:11
when you've seen people with the pageantry that God loves on the earth and they're waving their
27:15
flags and they're dancing, does it affect the angels around them when they do that? Is something
27:23
being triggered in a good way when they dance? And I think that's what she's trying to get at.
27:29
Do angels respond? Does our blessings drop down that we don't see? What is the dance
27:36
accomplished? Or is it just dance? I know dance is considered a high praise. It even says that it's
27:43
in the Bible. And so yes, even some of the hosts are absolutely amazed and really love the warfare
27:53
that takes place as a dancer. When you dance, like in the spirit about things, so that is definitely
28:00
something that takes place. And all three of my daughters are dancers. They would have to be
28:04
wore in dance in the spirit for people to be healed, for messages to be sent to be received.
28:10
And so I would definitely know whether it's dance, whether it's music. A lot of things are created
28:16
in the spirit. Okay, awesome. Sarah is asking this, are there, you've seen gemstones in heaven,
28:25
and I think I've heard you talk about the crystal sea and stuff. She says, is there gemstone art
28:31
in heaven that resembles stained glass? Have you seen? Absolutely, yes. A lot of people have
28:37
those in their home there. Really? Especially if people were artisans in that. My grandfather
28:45
made stained glass wonders. Okay. He's got some he's made in heaven. Wow, very cool. And I mean,
28:53
you know, it makes me wonder, because you said that guy will put favorite pictures of yours
28:59
that are on earth, or you'll show up at your mansion and there it's hanging. And I'm curious if
29:03
God would do the same thing. Not that you would know the answer to this, but that if you if someone
29:08
made stained glass on earth, they show up and God said, this is one that you made. I really,
29:12
especially loved, I kept it. And here's it. That was that sound like something he might do just
29:17
because that's who he is. I think he probably would. If people gave him any high gifts, he's
29:24
going to love him anyway. Yeah. And even he has some favorite things that he likes, anything
29:29
he may with life with colors, things like that. Whether you're young or not young, he loves people
29:35
when they give him gifts. Cool. All right. Let me see. We're five minutes out here. We got time
29:42
for a few more questions here. George is asking, when some people are dying, they reach out or
29:47
call for their family members who have died before them. They act as though their family members are
29:52
right there in the room with them. Do you know, do they really see their loved ones and do they
29:58
come? I guess they're asking, do their loved ones come to help with their transition to heaven?
30:03
Can you share about that? I mean, I have no idea. I think sometimes they do. I do know for a fact
30:08
that some people have seen their family members, like maybe within a week of passing or something.
30:14
I think it's something that God just does to encourage people. And so I just know that it does
30:19
happen. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Rachel's saying, when we are reunited with our loved ones that are
30:28
already in heaven, to them, will it feel like it's been a long time since they've seen this? Or will
30:33
it only feel like seconds or days since they've seen us? I think it's just seconds. Really? Oh,
30:44
yeah. They don't miss someone being gone 30 years or something like that. All they can think about
30:48
is can't wait to see them again when they see them. And so for them, you've only been gone for a short
30:53
time. Okay. Wow. Okay. And Andrew's asking, when and why were the host, Michael's army created,
31:06
was it after Satan's treason, specifically to deal with him or was it actually before
31:11
Satan's treason? In other words, you've made it very clear that the only reason there's an army
31:16
is not to protect heaven. God doesn't need an army to protect heaven. So when do you know when
31:23
the army was created? Was it after the fall of Satan? I think the army was been around a very
31:31
long time. They even wondered why they were created one time. Really? To fight. Yeah,
31:37
they were there for the enemy, for who became an enemy. So maybe they only understood what
31:44
they were being trained up for when that fall happened. Yeah. They were taught war and they
31:49
had to run maneuvers and do all kinds of stuff like that. Really? And that one was how loose
31:55
for a fallen heaven. They knew who their enemy was. Interesting. All right. Here's another question
32:02
about the Michael, the captain of the warrior angels. Is it Martha's asking, I believe the
32:06
angel Michael is the captain of the warrior angels and Gabriel is the messenger angels.
32:12
Are there other types of angels with specific purposes? I'm guessing there'd be lots of them
32:17
with specific purposes. There are so many, I cannot number them. There's many, many, many, many.
32:25
There's ones who are couriers, of course, the scribes, the Bible talks about them, helper angels
32:31
that help all over heaven doing things like that. Of course, there are the hosts of heaven.
32:35
There's ones who serve in different places and who keep the treasures
32:42
shined up and all kinds of things like that. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It makes sense that he might
32:48
even have thousands of different kinds of angels, right? For categories that we've never even thought
32:53
about. So, yeah. Man, just that's right. Me, A, N, G, S. Does God really cast out your sins into
33:01
the sea of forgetfulness? If you brought up your past, would he not know of it? I think most of the
33:07
time he wouldn't because he does cast it there and he's not going to think about it. I tell people,
33:13
stop reminding him of your sins. He won't know what you're talking about if you've repented.
33:18
Yeah, boy. I could have used that understanding years ago when I kept repending over and over
33:25
and over and over to make sure I got it right. He's probably saying, would you stop repending?
33:32
Okay. Jamelia, lots of interesting names today. Jamelia, have you seen inside of the courtrooms
33:39
in heaven? What's happening in there? What do they look like? Do they look like a courtroom on earth?
33:44
The judge sits on the bench up there high and then there's a defense in both sides?
33:50
I have absolutely been to the courtroom in heaven. Actually, there's more than one.
33:57
I guess outside, not outside of heaven, but in the atmosphere of heaven, it's invisible.
34:05
I know this sounds crazy. You can actually see to it. You can see that it's there.
34:09
Then of course, it's a courtroom that's actually in heaven. Yes, I've seen both. Like anything
34:15
else, God sits as judge. Jesus is our lawyer and Satan gets hauled up there about different
34:23
things sometimes. Other things get harder, but justice does take place in those courtrooms.
34:30
So it does look like a courtroom as we would know it. Well, they have one that looks very
34:34
supernatural. They do have one that looks like what you would call a courtroom, maybe not exactly
34:40
like that. So they're both different than I've seen. Okay. All right. Here's the last question here.
34:47
Natalie is asking, what is your favorite thing about Jesus that you would like to describe?
34:53
What's your favorite thing about? Of course, you'd have thousands of things, but what stands
34:57
out to you? I think his eyes. I think his eyes are so amazing. I never get tired of whenever
35:05
I'm around him. I always want to look at his eyes. They're beautiful, very beautiful. But he also does
35:11
have a, I almost want to say a cynic sense of humor. I mean, he was very bold about the things he
35:18
said on the earth to those who were not doing right. Like one of my favorite ones is, are you
35:25
you're a white and sepulchral school of dead men's bones? Yeah. You thought of the religious hierarchy.
35:30
I think both of those probably, those two things are probably my very favorite thing about it.
35:35
And he holds both of those at the same time. He, you know, he's got that serious side and then the
35:42
clever fun side. Yeah. So good. So good. Well, Kat, that's our time. We need to let you get to
35:49
your moving and rest in between and all of that. So I appreciate it very much. We'll spend more
35:54
time the next time talking about revealing heaven.com, but we're going to revealing the
35:58
heaven.com to see her, to get her books and all that. And there it is. Katcur.com is where you
36:03
can support her. The only place you can support her is online because she doesn't ask for money
36:09
in any other way. A lot of people keep trying to pretend to be her. So all right. Thanks so much,
36:14
Kat. Tomorrow, everybody is Robin Bullock. We're looking very much forward to that. When you see
36:19
Robin Bullock, he almost, I think he always has that pin that you created. It says, I don't do
36:25
demons. He wears that on his coat and everywhere he goes. So it's a, so that that'll be him right
36:31
there after people see this. Yeah. Thank you very much. We love you. Bless you. Have a good time
36:36
with your staffs. We'll see you again soon. Okay. See you later then. Bye.
