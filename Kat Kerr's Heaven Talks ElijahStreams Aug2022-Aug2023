Happy Wednesday, August 17, 2022. 
01:38
Welcome to the broadcast. 
01:40
It's going to be a great show today. 
01:42
We have Kat Kerr as always. 
01:44
It's going to be right an hour show starting now. 
01:48
She's got some other things she needs to do. 
01:50
This is the day before Eric Trump comes. 
01:54
So Eric Trump will be here tomorrow. 
01:56
Do not miss this. 
01:58
Be sure and text your friends. 
02:00
Call your friends and let them know. 
02:02
We've got some great questions for Eric. 
02:04
It's going to be great. 
02:06
Oh, by the way, yes. 
02:08
Thank you, Julie. 
02:10
It is 8 a.m. tomorrow. 
02:12
I would have forgotten that. 
02:14
It's 8 a.m. Pacific time. 
02:16
If you're on the East Coast, it will be 11. 
02:18
It's 8 a.m. in the morning. 
02:20
That's when we could get him. 
02:22
We're happy to do that. 
02:24
We did that one other time with General Flynn. 
02:26
It is 8 o'clock in the morning Pacific time. 
02:28
So there you have it. 
02:30
I'm just making sure I'm not missing any notes here. 
02:32
Before we bring Kat on, 
02:34
let's bring Mike and Lori Sally on. 
02:36
Let's talk about the wells. 
02:38
They are spearheading the whole thing, 
02:40
the whole project. 
02:42
I can't wait to hear all about it. 
02:44
So Mike and Lori Sally, take it away. 
02:46
Yeah, go ahead, Lori. 
02:48
We are so excited to update you 
02:50
specifically about the water wells 
02:52
in Uganda. 
02:54
I think one of your shows you shared about 
02:56
that we had had 300 
02:58
salvations. Well, now it's up 
03:00
to over 800 people 
03:02
who have given their lives to Jesus 
03:04
because of these water wells. 
03:06
I was just in shock. 
03:08
Who knew that Jesus, we know he can turn 
03:10
water into wine, but who knew 
03:12
he was going to make these water wells 
03:14
and share 
03:16
the gospel in such an impactful way. 
03:18
People just be... 
03:20
I had always hoped 
03:22
that maybe a person 
03:24
or two would come to Jesus 
03:26
because of this, but I had no 
03:28
idea that this would be 
03:30
an evangelism tool where 
03:32
hundreds and hundreds, 
03:34
and we just think we're just getting started. 
03:36
We're just getting started. We're now doing a well 
03:38
a week. Every week, one well. 
03:40
So, wow. 
03:42
So we're up to 
03:44
47 new wells 
03:46
that Elijah Streams has provided. 47. 
03:48
I was looking 
03:50
at the big organization that does work in Uganda 
03:52
and all of last year 
03:54
and then all they do is water. 
03:56
All they do. And they did 42 
03:58
water projects, not even wells 
04:00
in the entire year. 
04:02
Really? Yeah. 
04:04
It's incredible the pace 
04:06
and the excitement of the people 
04:08
and I was surprised as well 
04:10
as how many people are coming to know Jesus 
04:12
because of this. It's crazy. 
04:14
It's not normal, actually. 
04:16
It's something God's doing. 
04:18
The anointing is all over this project 
04:20
and just the investment 
04:22
that people are making. It's incredible. 
04:24
I wanted to share one of the stories. 
04:26
So I was asking my team, like, tell me 
04:28
what does it look like? I mean, how is this happening? 
04:30
How are they sharing the gospel? 
04:32
Because, normally, I mean, 
04:34
pastors are out there sharing all the time 
04:36
and in this one particular area, 
04:38
so Elijah Streams, 
04:40
we are drilling wells 
04:42
in different parts of Uganda, 
04:44
not all in the same exact spot. 
04:46
So it's in different areas. 
04:48
One area that is really, really dry, 
04:50
it's a drought area 
04:52
and so it's kind of like 
04:54
the forgotten people. It's drought. 
04:56
They don't have a lot of government 
04:58
assistance. They don't have many 
05:00
organizations that are coming there to help 
05:02
and so what they've been doing 
05:04
is as the 
05:06
water company is coming out 
05:08
with their equipment, 
05:10
they're renting a 
05:12
speaker and hooking it up 
05:14
to a car and they're 
05:16
driving through the village 
05:18
and they're kind of announcing, 
05:20
hey, we want you to know what Jesus is doing. 
05:22
There's people 
05:24
that love Jesus, 
05:26
that are responding to him 
05:28
and they care about you and he cares about you 
05:30
and they want you to know about him 
05:32
and so then they start sharing the gospel 
05:34
and then right behind them, not very far, 
05:36
there's these huge, 
05:38
massive trucks that have 
05:40
these huge drilling 
05:42
implements and things 
05:44
and my team is telling me that 
05:46
not only are the water wells 
05:48
an amazing thing, but the fact that 
05:50
we're using this equipment, 
05:52
the technology 
05:54
that we're using to drill these wells 
05:56
is abnormal for them because normally 
05:58
when people come and drill a well, they do it by hand 
06:00
and we're thankful for those 
06:02
that are able to do that, but it's 
06:04
not as efficient because you can't go as deep, 
06:06
it's actually dangerous to do it like 
06:08
that, but people are in awe 
06:10
and imagine if it's not every day 
06:12
you see massive trucks coming 
06:14
in, you know, whenever 
06:16
they're in these villages, when strangers 
06:18
come, everybody stops what they're 
06:20
doing and they run 
06:22
and they want to know what's going on 
06:24
so they're using that first 
06:26
introduction of here's why 
06:28
we're doing this and then they're watching 
06:30
the process the entire time and then 
06:32
when they hit water, 
06:34
then when they hit water, they do a big 
06:36
commissioning and they gather 
06:38
everybody together 
06:40
and that's when their hearts are 
06:42
touched and they were telling me this 
06:44
story about this one woman, she's 
06:46
71 years old and to me 
06:48
when I hear 71, that doesn't seem 
06:50
that old because I'm, you know, I'm in my 
06:52
50s so 70 doesn't seem like it's that old 
06:54
but in Uganda that is old 
06:56
the life expectancy isn't that long, we know 
06:58
Jesus can do it 120 
07:00
years more than that, but 71 
07:02
she's considered an elder in her 
07:04
community and my team is telling 
07:06
me that she has 
07:08
zero faith, normally in Uganda 
07:10
you find people that are either, they 
07:12
adopt something, whether they're really born again 
07:14
or not and they say born again, we say Christians 
07:16
in the states but they always say born again 
07:18
and that means you're really born again 
07:20
she didn't 
07:22
believe in anything or she didn't 
07:24
really ascribe to any particular thing, she must 
07:26
have believed in a higher being because 
07:28
she testified that 
07:30
she used to say to 
07:32
whatever higher being she was talking to 
07:34
if somebody would come and solve 
07:36
this water crisis because 
07:38
I've been suffering, my parents were suffering 
07:40
my children are suffering, now my 
07:42
grandchildren are suffering 
07:44
and then whenever we came in 
07:46
and drilled this water 
07:48
and she saw the water coming 
07:50
she just started yelling 
07:52
God is alive, God is alive 
07:54
God is alive 
07:56
that's amazing 
07:58
she was so excited 
08:00
she truly was like 
08:02
the woman at the well because she 
08:04
then gave her life to Jesus 
08:06
people followed suit, they 
08:08
followed her, they thought if she 
08:10
believes in Jesus, I want the same Jesus 
08:12
and it was remarkable 
08:14
so Steve, over 
08:16
800 people 
08:18
I can't 
08:20
I mean I do but it's like 
08:22
I mean 
08:24
I thought maybe a person 
08:26
or two would come to the Lord because of these 
08:28
wells, I had, I never 
08:30
saw this coming, not even close 
08:32
and we're just getting started 
08:34
one well a week 
08:36
it'll probably increase 
08:38
unless you run out of land to drill wells 
08:40
I don't think we'll run out of land 
08:42
there's a lot of people who contact us all the time 
08:44
really? 
08:46
oh yeah, all the time 
08:48
tell me about that for a minute 
08:50
do other people call and say bring a well here 
08:52
or what? I get emails 
08:54
every week from people that hear about 
08:56
what's going on with Elijah's streams 
08:58
and how we're providing this water 
09:00
can you do one for me 
09:02
here's somebody I know in this village that needs help 
09:04
here's a school that needs help 
09:06
I don't think we've gotten close 
09:08
to tapping out the potential yet 
09:10
and so it's pretty exciting 
09:12
just let those that are watching know 
09:14
it's not as easy as 
09:16
just people contacting and saying hey I need 
09:18
a water well here because we're trying 
09:20
to work with reputable well drillers 
09:22
that we can 
09:24
make sure that we're going to go deep enough 
09:26
and the water is going to be sustainable 
09:28
because you hear stories of water wells 
09:30
that were drilled by 
09:32
different organizations and 
09:34
maybe they're drilling it and go deep enough 
09:36
and then it ends up running dry and that's what 
09:38
we don't want that to happen so 
09:40
we're trying to do it through relations 
09:42
I know you brought a video 
09:44
your daughter Caitlin made this video 
09:46
so let's watch that video 
09:48
about it's kind of the latest 
09:50
I laughed because 
09:52
he said we're emptying hell 
09:54
and we're populating hell 
09:56
but you can populate 
09:58
but we understand what he means he said 
10:00
we're doing damage big 
10:02
time to hell I mean we are literally 
10:04
coming against 
10:06
hell so let's watch that 
10:08
video 
10:36
this year 2022 
10:38
the recharge plants have been started 
10:40
so your denerasty 
10:42
is not only providing clean water 
10:44
but is emptying hell 
10:46
and populating heaven 
10:48
by souls coming to the kingdom 
10:50
and we talk about your Elijah's things 
10:52
so everyone prays for you 
10:54
and God bless you so 
10:56
very much 
10:58
Mike and Lorde Salle 
11:00
this is amazing before the launch 
11:02
of this power hall 
11:04
Moscow has been preached 
11:06
and about 15 people 
11:08
have accepted in Christ 
11:10
as Lord and Savior 
11:12
and even land 
11:14
has been donated 
11:16
to start a church 
11:18
in this place 
11:20
this is a testimony this is amazing 
11:22
these are 15 souls 
11:24
they have come to the kingdom of God today 
11:26
because of the donation 
11:28
of the power hall 
11:30
thank you very much 
11:42
it's so exciting 
11:44
he's like a kid isn't he 
11:46
well I'm like a kid 
11:48
you know I'm sitting here 
11:50
you guys are the same thing 
11:52
look what's going on 
11:54
I mean I can't believe it 
11:56
I do believe it but 
11:58
we are above and beyond 
12:00
anything I think any of us 
12:02
expected to happen 
12:04
wait to see what God is doing 
12:06
for sure 
12:08
well thank you both 
12:10
for coming I see Kat is now here 
12:12
so blessings to you both 
12:14
I appreciate it Mike and Lorde 
12:16
you're working with us very strongly 
12:18
to look into water situations 
12:20
that we will be talking about 
12:22
very very soon here in the states 
12:24
you are here and we're looking at 
12:26
a lot of different things related to the water 
12:28
so we'll be reporting that 
12:30
and a lot of people don't know 
12:32
we're helping a lot of other people 
12:34
even not related to the water 
12:36
but everyone who sows into this ministry 
12:38
receives a reward 
12:40
from him 
12:42
I mean 
12:44
without you know he says 
12:46
even if you give so much as a cup of cold water 
12:48
to one of these you will not lose your reward 
12:50
can you imagine the rewards 
12:52
God's passing out in heaven and on earth 
12:54
thank you to all of our viewers 
12:56
we appreciate it very much 
12:58
so thank you Mike and Lorde 
13:00
we'll see you soon and we'll bring on Kat 
13:02
bless you guys 
13:04
okay so without further ado 
13:06
let's do Wednesdays with Kat and Steve 
13:08
music 
13:24
and there she is hey Kat 
13:26
how are you 
13:28
I'm great thank you 
13:30
so good to have you back 
13:32
I got my Disneyland tie on 
13:34
and tell people why it's 
13:36
okay to still love Disneyland 
13:38
even though we hear some of these bad things 
13:40
you know 
13:42
I always look at the roots 
13:44
of something or the foundation 
13:46
of something 
13:48
and well 
13:50
we can even look at the throne of God 
13:52
Satan has taken many things 
13:54
that are actually some of the father's images 
13:56
the way he operates 
13:58
and he is 
14:00
on the earth polluted them 
14:02
and made them not good 
14:04
but that doesn't mean it's okay 
14:06
to partake of Satan stuff 
14:08
I'm just making an example 
14:10
Walt Disney was 
14:12
put on the earth by God 
14:14
at the time he was put on here 
14:16
and he was put here to create fun 
14:18
in family entertainment 
14:20
that's why people think well he doesn't care about entertainment 
14:22
well they have it in heaven people 
14:24
movies in heaven is all kinds of 
14:26
roller coasters because God knows 
14:28
we need fun 
14:30
and heaven I say is a good bit fun 
14:32
it is holy 
14:34
is pure there's nothing defiling 
14:36
there's no profanity 
14:38
there's no wickedness anywhere in heaven 
14:40
not in anything to create or make there 
14:42
but Walt had this passion 
14:44
in his heart to make a place 
14:46
that families could come and bring their children 
14:48
because even in those days 
14:50
there was a lot of craziness going on 
14:52
in the 60s 
14:54
and things weren't turning in the best 
14:56
direction in that time 
14:58
and so many things were going on that were not good 
15:00
he was determined 
15:02
and he really fought hard 
15:04
well in Orlando especially to get the land 
15:06
for Disney World 
15:08
but the reason he created that in those characters 
15:10
was so we could have something to laugh at 
15:12
and have fun 
15:14
and he is not happy himself right now 
15:16
with stuff that's going on 
15:18
but it is going to change 
15:20
and the father has adamantly told me 
15:22
it's going to change 
15:24
so a lot of maybe people might end up 
15:26
being removed and have this replaced there 
15:28
because I know when Walt was on the earth 
15:30
he was adamant about keeping it 
15:32
at a level 
15:34
that what was produced 
15:36
and the content that was produced 
15:38
not just at that time but for years to come 
15:40
could be enjoyed by family, by children 
15:42
and know that they were going to see something safe 
15:44
and when Disney World was open 
15:46
I actually went to the park here in Florida 
15:48
the first year they were open 
15:50
it was so many masses 
15:52
of people were coming 
15:54
to enjoy 
15:56
and talking about Disney 
15:58
I always appreciated 
16:00
was he always showed 
16:02
in his movies or any of the other things he created 
16:04
you knew the difference between 
16:06
good and evil 
16:08
and every time good would be the victor 
16:10
in the movies and any of the sets he made 
16:12
and he made sure 
16:14
that you knew that this was evil 
16:16
and it was dark and it was not good 
16:18
and yet this was filled with life and light 
16:20
and so I loved it 
16:22
the heroes always saved the day 
16:24
and it overcame 
16:26
every evil obstacle 
16:28
or thing that was in any of the movies 
16:30
or things he produced 
16:32
and so I always appreciated that with Walt 
16:34
and if he was here today that's exactly 
16:36
what would still be happening 
16:38
instead of compromise 
16:40
and darkness invading parts of that 
16:42
there are going to be some 
16:44
covert activities going on in there 
16:46
and no one's going to know anything about it 
16:48
except God himself 
16:50
but things are about to start changing 
16:52
in Disneyland 
16:54
and in Disney World 
16:56
and I don't know if that means something 
16:58
might close for a while or things are being changed 
17:00
or things there's going to be so many things 
17:02
accelerated in these days 
17:04
where darkness is going to be pushed back 
17:06
and that doesn't mean 
17:08
it might close completely 
17:10
but what it'll mean is darkness will be pushed out 
17:12
of places and out of 
17:14
entertainment especially 
17:16
and those who make wicked 
17:18
movies will bomb and they'll lose their shirt 
17:20
if they keep doing it 
17:22
when this whole thing shifts 
17:24
so I do 
17:26
appreciate Walt and all that he created 
17:28
for families 
17:30
if you ever go to either one of those places 
17:32
you can see his own personal comments 
17:34
on the walls in the place 
17:36
and he was so appreciated 
17:38
the people who helped to build the place 
17:40
and the ones who work there now 
17:42
his own comments about how he feels about them 
17:44
he appreciates 
17:46
all of their efforts to help everyone 
17:48
have the time to make it safe 
17:50
and he called them a team 
17:52
he never took 
17:54
direct credit for everything 
17:56
he always gave credit to everyone 
17:58
who was a part of what he did 
18:00
which I also admired in him 
18:02
that he considered everybody involved 
18:04
and he wasn't just the only one that was doing anything 
18:06
and then of course we know 
18:08
there's other people involved in that place now 
18:10
that is not Walt's plans 
18:12
or his ideas 
18:14
some of them that are being put out there now 
18:16
and even in the new things that are being made 
18:18
there's a whole entire different content 
18:20
in it 
18:22
that most believers or even good moral people 
18:24
would not appreciate 
18:26
but just wait and see 
18:28
that will also change 
18:30
I'm glad you see your Donald Duck 
18:32
it's such a special place 
18:34
they opened the doors 
18:36
the year I was born 
18:38
1955 
18:40
I met my wife across the street from Disneyland 
18:42
at the convention center 
18:44
on our honeymoon 
18:46
it's just a real special place 
18:48
and yeah 
18:50
there'll be some bad apples that'll get 
18:52
gone and it's interesting to hear what you just said 
18:54
but 
18:56
some people think well then 
18:58
this must be an evil place 
19:00
don't think that Walt Disney's 
19:02
DNA is still in that thing 
19:04
I remember hearing a story that 
19:06
that 
19:08
he and his brother Roy eventually ran the place 
19:10
after he passed 
19:12
but Roy didn't want to spend the money 
19:14
he didn't want to put gold on the top 
19:16
of the castle 
19:18
there's a point or something 
19:20
and so Walt waited until he was 
19:22
got a vacation or something and he went up there 
19:24
and had the people put gold up there 
19:26
I mean I assume 
19:28
it was gold paint but anyway 
19:30
he spent the money 
19:32
he wanted top notch 
19:34
anyway so fun 
19:36
listen I know we have to stop 
19:38
at the top of the hour because of things 
19:40
that people have to do 
19:42
but anything else you want to share before we get 
19:44
into questions 
19:46
I was 
19:48
thinking of something just a minute ago 
19:50
I did want to say 
19:52
one more thing about Disney World 
19:54
I think when you're prayed up when you go there 
19:56
you may have opportunities to 
19:58
minister to people 
20:00
I'm not saying everybody there is bad 
20:02
or wicked 
20:04
some stuff going on or being controlled 
20:06
by certain people who are not 
20:08
very good people 
20:10
and I'm not going to name names or anything 
20:12
I'm just saying keep it in your prayers 
20:14
I know Walt is declaring from heaven over it 
20:16
absolutely 
20:18
and that is something God gave him 
20:20
to create 
20:22
and he was very pleased with it 
20:24
he's not so pleased now 
20:26
but it's going to change 
20:28
I just want to encourage people to make sure 
20:30
and no matter where you go 
20:32
this is just for parents of young children 
20:34
make sure you always keep your kids with you 
20:36
make sure you see them 
20:38
and know who they're with 
20:40
please don't just drop them off at some 
20:42
friends house that you don't even know 
20:44
the friends or the family 
20:46
I would do that anyway 
20:48
I always was like that anyway 
20:50
I was always very careful with my children 
20:52
who babysat them 
20:54
but if we went to a big place we made sure 
20:56
we made rules to go in there 
20:58
to make sure we all knew where everybody was 
21:00
if a child was always with 
21:02
an adult that went with us 
21:04
and these days right now 
21:06
with all the stuff going on 
21:08
that would be a good tip 
21:10
for everybody 
21:12
really really really good 
21:14
alright well I have questions for you 
21:16
a whole list of questions here 
21:18
so let me just start with the first one 
21:20
Nathaniel asks 
21:22
and I hadn't heard of this before 
21:24
but here he goes 
21:26
he says I've heard that there are angels 
21:28
that stand at the four corners of our home 
21:30
is this true 
21:32
or are the angels all over our home 
21:34
in and out so that's his question 
21:36
I think it depends on 
21:38
where you put them 
21:40
where you post them 
21:42
you are allowed to say 
21:44
to the angels who are sent 
21:46
to protect you all the time 
21:48
you and your family 
21:50
they're sentries 
21:52
and they're posted here by your home 
21:54
and they pretty much stay around your home 
21:56
you have others that leave and go with you 
21:58
when you go places 
22:00
and I just tell them I'm going to post a sentry 
22:02
at each corner of my home 
22:04
I'm going to post so many over the home 
22:06
and even down the road 
22:08
and they actually go there and that's what they do 
22:10
they watch for anything of darkness coming 
22:12
they pull down strongholds 
22:14
they shred platforms 
22:16
trying to control us 
22:18
spirits of wickedness or whatever 
22:20
of darkness that want to control us 
22:22
or take things from us 
22:24
so they do both 
22:26
they will even march around 
22:28
on your property and watch it all the time 
22:30
or you can post them as sentries 
22:32
in certain places and if you have a second place 
22:34
you can also post sentries there 
22:36
and that is their number one job 
22:38
which will protect that area that they're assigned to 
22:40
that's really good 
22:42
you know I live on acreage 
22:44
that's not all my acreage 
22:46
there's actually a few hundred acres 
22:48
it belongs to the neighbors 
22:50
but in order to keep the dare out 
22:52
I'm involved inside the fence 
22:54
so they put a fence around it 
22:56
I didn't realize this about sentries 
22:58
this is the first time I've heard you say that 
23:00
that I can recall 
23:02
but I felt I was supposed to post sentries 
23:04
and I used that word 
23:06
at every post on the fence 
23:08
around all the property 
23:10
my neighbors as well 
23:12
I said if anyone gets anywhere near us 
23:14
to try to do harm 
23:16
I want them to see these sentries as 
23:18
and I said 
23:20
let them think they're police officers 
23:22
let them whatever 
23:24
if they try to do harm 
23:26
so I don't know what you think about that 
23:28
well you can actually 
23:30
also tell them to expose anyone 
23:32
who's coming, why they're coming 
23:34
and they actually can stop them from coming 
23:36
they'll actually stop them 
23:38
they'll actually interfere with someone trying to 
23:40
come in on the property 
23:42
and that might be appearing them 
23:44
that might be them saying something 
23:46
and even if they can't see them 
23:48
they would hear that 
23:50
so that's what sentries do 
23:52
is keep things away from you 
23:54
and to make sure that your life 
23:56
and your property is safe 
23:58
so you did the right thing by posting sentries 
24:00
that's really good 
24:02
I got really serious one day 
24:04
because there had been 
24:06
evidence of an invasion 
24:08
and I thought I'm not having this 
24:10
I went to town 
24:12
I took off after that 
24:14
alright Star is asking this question 
24:16
she says some of us 
24:18
write letters to God 
24:20
just simply write things down 
24:22
to Him, to God 
24:24
does the Father receive those letters 
24:26
and if He does how does He receive them 
24:30
there's several different ways that can happen 
24:32
I would encourage you if you wrote one 
24:34
read it out loud to Him 
24:36
you can do that when you're just by yourself 
24:38
in your prayer time or just in the time 
24:40
when you're walking or just doing something 
24:42
you can actually read it to Him 
24:44
say Father I have written this letter to you 
24:46
and read it to Him 
24:48
and it's going to hear you 
24:50
read that letter 
24:52
and they probably record it 
24:54
it's probably recorded in heaven 
24:56
they do a lot of recording there's angels 
24:58
that's what they do and they're sent for that 
25:00
they actually record things 
25:02
there's couriers, there's scribes 
25:04
who write things down 
25:06
or else they write things down and you say 
25:08
or they bring messages from heaven 
25:10
that are written 
25:12
I've had both of those happen to me before 
25:14
but absolutely 
25:16
I'm just standing in a spot and just say 
25:18
to your family member 
25:20
I love you, I just want you to know I haven't forgotten you 
25:22
I'm excited about one day being there with you 
25:24
then He'll make sure they hear that 
25:26
people think everything's so far away 
25:28
but especially the Father, the Son of the Holy Spirit 
25:30
if you wanted to really say something to them 
25:32
He loves, by the way 
25:34
writing that thing down 
25:36
is an MO 
25:38
it's a motive operations of the Father 
25:40
He does have 
25:42
we know He has the lamest book of life 
25:44
we know that He has a book of remembrance 
25:46
He actually has many and they're real books 
25:48
they're huge books and He does actually 
25:50
write in them, He likes to write things out 
25:52
Christ would rather say it 
25:56
but the Father writes things down 
25:58
you know He wrote a book about your life 
26:00
before you were even born 
26:02
so I would say you writing things down 
26:04
maybe a good thing would be to get a journal 
26:06
and if you think of something 
26:08
each day to say something to Him 
26:10
then you write down the date and what you wanted 
26:12
to say to Him and make sure He hears that 
26:14
and the other thing you can do with that journal 
26:16
is when He begins to answer you 
26:18
it may be 
26:20
that still small voice inside 
26:22
but you know it's Him answering because He's answering 
26:24
what you just said to Him 
26:26
so that way you can have a two-way 
26:28
conversation and you can record it 
26:30
in a journal and then you can enjoy 
26:32
looking at it later on 
26:34
or maybe leave that for your children one day 
26:36
and they might be surprised if that's said to you 
26:38
or what you said to Him 
26:40
so authorship 
26:42
is a really big thing in heaven 
26:44
everyone has written a book 
26:46
that represents God or heaven 
26:48
or just something really fun 
26:50
but decent they're already on 
26:52
library shelves and your books are already 
26:54
in heaven 
26:56
do you mean everyone's 
26:58
written a book whether they've written it here 
27:00
or not what do you mean by that 
27:02
you said everyone 
27:04
some people still write books in heaven 
27:06
do you 
27:08
but are you saying people that 
27:10
don't write here are actually 
27:12
in effect authoring 
27:14
a book there I'm not quite sure what you're saying 
27:16
what I'm saying is those who 
27:18
have authored a book here 
27:20
those books 
27:22
I saw my own books 
27:24
in a library in heaven 
27:26
so I do know and I was told 
27:28
those who become authors is so 
27:30
important because even when 
27:32
you're gone that book 
27:34
remains here and those words will still 
27:36
be read by people and it may be 
27:38
something spiritual 
27:40
or it could be something just 
27:42
a help book or just something 
27:44
funny that's really decent and people 
27:46
love to read and there's still people 
27:48
who read books at all so you can go get them out of the library 
27:50
or you can just request 
27:52
to have one yourself there in heaven 
27:54
and you have a place for a library in your own 
27:56
mansion so people still 
27:58
still love to read 
28:00
well I thought it was cool when 
28:02
Bill Johnson had my book 
28:04
in his library if my book is in heaven 
28:06
that's way cooler 
28:08
yeah that's very 
28:10
very cool okay let me 
28:12
come back for a moment to 
28:14
this just popped into my head 
28:16
I think I'm supposed to share it like so it's almost 
28:18
15 years ago I didn't know you 
28:20
yet I hadn't heard about either 
28:22
sentries or hosts 
28:24
but I was a praying man 
28:26
and my oldest daughter 
28:28
got in trouble she gave her 
28:30
phone number to a guy 
28:32
in the market 
28:34
and I was furious not at her 
28:36
but that this would happen 
28:38
that he would have it and he started calling 
28:40
and I 
28:42
ripped into the spirit realm 
28:44
and I prayed every prayer 
28:46
every kind of emotion 
28:48
about I wanted God to take 
28:50
it take notice 
28:52
and take action and 
28:54
protect her does God 
28:56
pay attention to the 
28:58
the amount 
29:00
to me there was faith behind that emotion 
29:02
because I knew God would act 
29:04
does God pay attention to our 
29:06
how do I say this 
29:08
angry faith if I can put it that way 
29:10
angry against the devil is what I mean 
29:12
I would say that's called 
29:14
passionate 
29:16
you're fierce against what the enemy is doing 
29:18
of course the fathers can hear you 
29:20
I'm absolutely sure 
29:22
many times he's going to answer that prayer 
29:24
and it may not be the way you think it will 
29:26
happen but it will happen 
29:28
and I've also seen that 
29:30
but you know passionate people 
29:32
God those people who have a passion 
29:34
and you're expressing what you're 
29:36
feeling and what you're thinking 
29:38
especially if it's something that lines up with 
29:40
what God wants and he speaks 
29:42
in this word about protecting and guarding 
29:44
your words and 
29:46
keeping certain people away 
29:48
from you because he doesn't want 
29:50
your family life infiltrated 
29:52
by the enemy 
29:54
or a thing that the enemy could use 
29:56
against you so absolutely 
29:58
especially the words of a parent 
30:00
for the child he's absolutely going to 
30:02
pay attention to that 
30:04
that's kind of like you hear about 
30:06
mama bear I became papa bear 
30:08
I can't 
30:10
remember any time in all of my 
30:12
life I prayed that intensely 
30:14
for my daughter but I 
30:16
felt there was an urgency 
30:18
so I let it rip 
30:20
alright 
30:22
Margaret asked is God 
30:24
the father 
30:26
and or heaven 
30:28
going through time with us 
30:30
on the earth even though the father 
30:32
can move back and forth in and out of time 
30:34
is there a sense of past 
30:36
present and future 
30:38
to Jesus Holy Spirit and the people 
30:40
in heaven so I think 
30:42
I understand where they're coming from do they 
30:44
get a sense of time 
30:46
because we're in time 
30:48
I'm quite sure heaven 
30:50
is very much aware of what's going on 
30:52
in any time 
30:54
actually 
30:56
the father's omnipresent 
30:58
he knows exactly what's going on 
31:00
where's going on and everything so he 
31:02
he has to be aware of what's going on 
31:04
so he can send help 
31:06
or send words or scribes 
31:08
or couriers for whatever 
31:10
purpose so yes he is very 
31:12
much aware even though 
31:14
he's not held by time 
31:16
or bound by time and doesn't 
31:18
operate like the way we 
31:20
operate here in time 
31:22
we have hours we're awake and hours we're sleep 
31:24
they don't sleep in heaven they don't have to 
31:26
but he's still very much aware of what's going on 
31:28
and all over the earth at different times 
31:30
on the earth so yes 
31:32
he's like he's present all the time 
31:34
no matter where we are what's going on 
31:36
and of course he can still go into 
31:38
the past and see things he can go into 
31:40
the future and see things the Bible says 
31:42
he's been from the beginning 
31:44
there would be time 
31:46
from the beginning to the end 
31:48
there is a beginning of time 
31:50
that was right when he 
31:52
first made the earth the end of time 
31:54
is when he wraps it all up and then he makes 
31:56
the new earth and then we're just 
31:58
in eternity we'll be in eternity 
32:00
but during this time 
32:02
I said time during 
32:04
this seasons of our life 
32:06
where time is very much 
32:08
involved with us with heaven 
32:10
then they are seeing things 
32:12
all the time as it's going 
32:14
by but he also knows 
32:16
the end of things at the same time 
32:18
so it's like 
32:20
if we're 
32:22
agonizing in prayer for something to happen 
32:24
that we want or think we need 
32:26
or we do need 
32:28
and there is a sense where God will 
32:30
say 
32:32
it's not time yet for that 
32:34
he'll know that it's 
32:36
three months in the future so he does 
32:38
operate within 
32:40
that framework he knows that this is 
32:42
for three months from now 
32:44
that kind of thing 
32:46
he already knows that he already knows 
32:48
when things are going to happen 
32:50
and even what's going to happen 
32:52
even though people have wills of their own 
32:54
he's already actually been through all of time 
32:56
he's seen all of time already 
32:58
but right now as we're speaking 
33:00
he is watching and he's listening 
33:02
so he can 
33:04
be anywhere at the same time 
33:06
that's one of the great things about him 
33:08
so he's very much involved in our lives 
33:10
at the same time 
33:12
and even does know 
33:14
what that end looks like 
33:16
and I've already told people 
33:18
that he actually did show me 
33:20
when the end of time would be 
33:22
and it's not really a date 
33:24
it's an event 
33:26
and I've learned that about him 
33:28
most of the things he plans 
33:30
and things for on the earth 
33:32
he goes by those events that he has planned 
33:34
and those are things that will happen 
33:36
in the earth 
33:38
that he has planned are going to happen 
33:40
but he did tell me one time 
33:42
he said there will be a day that will come 
33:44
when time will be no more 
33:46
because I won't need time 
33:48
and you won't need time 
33:50
on the earth on the new earth 
33:52
we won't have a clock 
33:54
we won't have things like that going on 
33:56
we will be living forever 
33:58
and we will also plan things by events 
34:00
at that time on the new earth 
34:02
but when everything ends 
34:04
is when time will be no more 
34:06
because he doesn't need 
34:08
time on this earth 
34:10
the reason he needs time now 
34:12
is because he's sending those little spirits 
34:14
from him, that's where everybody came from 
34:16
you lived in him 
34:18
but this is what he said 
34:20
time will be no more 
34:22
when I have sent the last one from myself 
34:24
I won't need time 
34:26
that's good 
34:28
I have a question about time 
34:30
now that we're on the subject 
34:32
Manuel Johnson talks about 
34:34
he's been transported 
34:36
in the future and the past 
34:38
so have you 
34:40
well God took him in the past 
34:42
he transported him in the past 
34:44
he showed him what happened 
34:46
he was there 
34:48
and it brought healing to his soul 
34:50
because God showed him 
34:52
this and that 
34:54
I don't know the whole story 
34:56
because I'm probably not doing it justice 
34:58
but great healing came to him 
35:00
by God taking him back in time 
35:02
does God 
35:04
do that sometimes 
35:06
does he see 
35:08
a need to bring someone back 
35:10
in time 
35:12
I think that he probably does 
35:14
because I know several other people 
35:16
who have encounters like that 
35:18
and 
35:20
I have been taken back in time quite a few times 
35:22
it was all related 
35:24
to things that happened in the Word of God 
35:26
or the way he made heaven 
35:28
the way he made the earth 
35:30
it was always related to revelation 
35:32
when he takes me back in time 
35:34
like he showed me his son on the cross 
35:36
and what happened when he had his spirit leave 
35:38
he took me back 
35:40
and I saw paradise or Abraham's bosom 
35:42
while he was there with the thief 
35:44
I saw him 
35:46
also when he was in hell 
35:48
approached the gates of hell 
35:50
and they were taking him and I saw what happened on the third day 
35:52
I was taken back 
35:54
back in the book of Acts 
35:56
when the Holy Spirit came and invaded 
35:58
in the upper room 
36:00
I mean there's many times he's taken me back 
36:02
I was taken back to the tomb 
36:04
the very day 
36:06
that he came out of that tomb 
36:08
I was taken that day back in time 
36:10
and I actually felt myself traveling 
36:12
it was the one time I felt myself traveling through time 
36:14
and I told people 
36:16
it was like on Star Trek or Star Wars 
36:18
when you go warp speed 
36:20
and those like shoot past you 
36:22
it is exactly like that 
36:24
I know they probably got that idea 
36:26
from the idea zone in heaven 
36:28
about how it looks like when you travel 
36:30
but it actually did 
36:32
and I actually could feel myself moving 
36:34
whenever we got to the part of time 
36:36
God wanted me to see 
36:38
we stopped and my feet just touched the ground 
36:40
crazy 
36:42
and it's like a portal open 
36:44
and I was there 
36:46
I was literally there in that time 
36:48
and I saw Mary go into the tomb 
36:50
looking for him 
36:52
and she saw the person in the garden 
36:54
and she came out and she thought he was the gardener 
36:56
because Christ was actually standing 
36:58
in the flowerbed smelling 
37:00
the flowers 
37:02
when these things happen 
37:04
both that and all the other 
37:06
back in time 
37:08
to be very very clear 
37:10
you went 
37:12
in that time 
37:14
this wasn't a vision 
37:16
a 3D experience 
37:18
you actually were there during the time 
37:20
it actually 
37:22
I was actually there 
37:24
I was wide awake 
37:26
I don't sleep long enough to dream 
37:28
I almost never dream 
37:30
and I have sometimes 
37:32
visions but this is called 
37:34
an encounter 
37:36
an encounter is you are actually 
37:38
there 
37:40
he's not showing me a film 
37:42
my feet touched the ground 
37:44
outside the tomb 
37:46
I saw the stone had been rolled away 
37:48
it was actually quite a ways down thing 
37:50
I also saw Christ standing 
37:52
he has a back turn to 
37:54
where the tomb was 
37:56
and he was literally looking at the flowers 
37:58
because he loves flowers 
38:00
and he had just been through 3 days of you know what 
38:02
and so when he came out of there 
38:04
after thanking his father 
38:06
for all that he had done for him 
38:08
he wanted to be in the midst of the flowers 
38:10
and I actually say 
38:12
Mary surmised 
38:14
or thought he was the gardener 
38:16
and she spoke to him 
38:18
she said her name 
38:20
she knew instantly when she heard him speak 
38:22
that it was him and then he turned around 
38:24
and of course she saw him then 
38:26
and I saw that 
38:28
in person, in that time 
38:30
that's how it happens people 
38:32
and instead of bashing people 
38:34
saying why not ask God to give you an encounter 
38:36
and show you something powerful 
38:38
I've been taking it up many many times 
38:40
for me and I didn't take myself 
38:42
I have to make it clear 
38:44
I didn't take myself 
38:46
that God had purpose for me 
38:48
and he'd already told me we're going to take you back 
38:50
in time, forward in time 
38:52
we're going to give you revelation on the word 
38:54
revelation on the times you're in 
38:56
and show you things to come 
38:58
and if you remember in Revelation 4 
39:00
he actually said that to John 
39:02
I will show you things to come 
39:04
and so that's one of the things that God does 
39:06
with his prophets 
39:08
and so I was literally there 
39:10
in person remember the feeling of the ground 
39:12
the smell of the flowers 
39:14
everything about that place 
39:16
amazing 
39:18
Bobby Connor tells a story 
39:20
about going to the crucifixion 
39:22
not a vision 
39:24
not a 3D idea 
39:26
he was actually there and he said 
39:28
the smells 
39:30
the sights, the sounds 
39:32
you know 
39:34
have you been to the crucifixion as well? 
39:38
I saw a part of the crucifixion 
39:40
it was more what I heard him saying 
39:42
and 
39:44
they were of course 
39:46
very upset that he had died 
39:48
but we know that he actually 
39:50
the thing about Christ was 
39:52
he was such a powerful being 
39:54
he had to lose his soul 
39:56
from his body 
39:58
he actually had to tell it to leave 
40:00
he knew he had to die 
40:02
and so 
40:04
they probably were wondering why in the world hasn't that guy died 
40:06
they even put the sword inside and everything 
40:08
but he finally knew that it was time 
40:10
so he just lost his soul 
40:12
from his body 
40:14
and his spirit man left his body 
40:16
and then of course he was there 
40:18
his body remained on the cross until they took it down 
40:20
they were wrapping it 
40:22
the women were crying 
40:24
John was 
40:26
but John remembered also 
40:28
the words Christ said that he would rise again 
40:30
and so it was a very powerful thing 
40:32
people in the city 
40:34
people I could hear crying 
40:36
in the whole area there 
40:38
that he had died 
40:40
because they loved him so much 
40:42
he had helped so many people 
40:44
and did so many miracles 
40:46
they said you couldn't even put him in a book 
40:48
there were so many people count the miracles 
40:50
it says if the books were written 
40:52
of all the things he did 
40:54
the books would go around the world 
40:56
like the planet people 
40:58
so he was non-stop 
41:00
all the time doing his work 
41:02
that God gave him to do 
41:04
and so it was an emotional time 
41:06
but of course I already knew 
41:08
that he was going to raise from the dead 
41:10
but I had visited that place 
41:12
and then of course 
41:14
I was taken back 
41:16
when he came out of the tomb 
41:18
and then I was taken back 
41:20
when he was down in hell 
41:22
and then I was taken back 
41:24
I was taken back in time when he actually 
41:26
was sent into heaven 
41:28
and one of the angels had this urn with his blood 
41:30
because he had to pour that out on the mercy seat in heaven 
41:32
and so he showed me these things 
41:34
and he showed me the reality 
41:36
of the word of God 
41:38
it was so powerful 
41:40
but yes I have encounters 
41:42
he clearly comes and takes me 
41:44
just takes me 
41:46
like in a second and it doesn't matter where I am 
41:48
really and I gave him permission 
41:50
so it might be better if you say I give you permission 
41:52
to take me whenever you want to 
41:54
or speak to me whenever you want to 
41:56
that encourages him to do it actually 
41:58
and I don't even say that to him 
42:00
when he told me this is what we're going to have you do 
42:02
commission on the earth as a revelator 
42:04
this is what you're going to do and I said I'd give you permission 
42:06
whenever you want to 
42:08
and I guess while we're talking about 
42:10
time okay now you got me 
42:12
I have heard 
42:14
you and others talk about 
42:16
okay he said 
42:18
to the thief that was saved 
42:20
that became saved 
42:22
he said I'm telling you this day 
42:24
today you will be with me 
42:26
in paradise he didn't say in hell 
42:28
he said in paradise 
42:30
I have not heard anyone say 
42:32
during those three days 
42:34
what did he do 
42:36
in paradise 
42:38
no one's ever really related that 
42:40
to me at least 
42:42
well the first thing he did was preach the gospel to all of them 
42:46
it said he 
42:48
it said that he took captivity 
42:50
captive 
42:52
the captivity that was 
42:54
it was called Abraham's wisdom and paradise 
42:56
it is the same place 
42:58
where the dead 
43:00
we died if you were faithful and knew God 
43:02
and believed in God himself 
43:04
this is before the Messiah came 
43:06
God counted that your faith 
43:08
as being you know 
43:10
you were just and you were faithful 
43:12
so he didn't send them to hell 
43:14
they couldn't ascend to heaven though 
43:16
because Christ hadn't gone back to heaven 
43:18
pour out the blood except of course we know Elijah 
43:20
and Enoch literally were taken to heaven 
43:22
in their bodies and they're still there in the physical bodies 
43:24
I believe that they were glorified 
43:26
when he took them up to heaven already 
43:28
because they didn't have to die 
43:30
and that was the Father's choice to do that 
43:32
but 
43:34
but it is quite a thing 
43:36
for God to trust you to do things 
43:38
and share things for him 
43:40
but yes 
43:42
but that's his choice to take me 
43:44
I don't take myself 
43:46
but he actually entered into paradise 
43:48
because he had to keep his word 
43:50
to the thief 
43:52
thank you Holy Spirit said the XT 
43:54
he had to keep his word 
43:56
and he didn't say I'll see you tomorrow 
43:58
he said this day 
44:00
that day 
44:02
that day 
44:04
and so when he died 
44:06
they actually 
44:08
I think he died before the thieves 
44:10
didn't they have to come break their legs so they would die 
44:12
I think so because they had to break the legs 
44:14
and all that with the thieves 
44:16
so Christ descended into paradise 
44:18
paradise 
44:20
was not a place with rocks 
44:22
and you think well it's in the earth 
44:24
there's a bunch of rocks sitting around 
44:26
it was a city 
44:28
it was a beautiful city God made 
44:30
faithful 
44:32
and that's where his friends he called 
44:34
Abraham you know that was his friend 
44:36
many others of 
44:38
back in the Old Testament were friends of God 
44:40
because they chose to be friends 
44:42
of God and he didn't send them to hell 
44:44
they still had to 
44:46
they had to descend though 
44:48
when you believe in Christ now 
44:50
and you die you don't descend at all 
44:52
you ascend 
44:54
into heaven that's where he does the big difference 
44:56
because Christ has been there 
44:58
he made the way back 
45:00
he cleansed it he put the blood 
45:02
on the altar showing that he had 
45:04
died for everyone's sins 
45:06
and so that changed everything about 
45:08
for those who died that believed in Christ it changed 
45:10
some things happen that change 
45:12
everything and so 
45:14
yes he did go down there he was talking 
45:16
to Abraham he was talking to Joseph 
45:18
who raised him 
45:20
he was talking to all those people 
45:22
the faith of David all of those 
45:24
were in paradise and at one 
45:26
point they all exited 
45:28
and left paradise 
45:30
is empty now there's nothing there it's 
45:32
still there people actually 
45:34
asked me would Satan take it over he doesn't 
45:36
have the ability to take 
45:38
paradise over that's like 
45:40
a holy place that God made 
45:42
for those who loved him and believed in him 
45:44
and no hell can't take 
45:46
paradise and use it people 
45:48
he's never going to get paradise 
45:50
so he would have taken 
45:52
Joseph the one who was sold 
45:54
in Egypt 
45:56
he would have taken David 
45:58
Solomon and he would have preached 
46:00
the gospel and said this is what 
46:02
it means to be saved 
46:04
this is what I had to do that 
46:06
kind of thing he would have told the whole story 
46:08
he literally changed the gospel as if 
46:10
you tell people 
46:12
that Jesus Christ gave his life 
46:14
that he gave his life so 
46:16
that we might have a way to go back 
46:18
to heaven where we all came from 
46:20
there had to be a prize 
46:22
paid there had to be a sacrifice made 
46:24
and he actually told all of them 
46:26
they had like a gathering and he 
46:28
just preached the gospel to everybody there 
46:30
and everyone there received 
46:32
him as their Messiah 
46:34
they had to receive him as 
46:36
their Messiah because that's what 
46:38
makes it possible for you to go 
46:40
you know to go into heaven 
46:42
and so he did he preached the gospel 
46:44
he said he preached the gospel 
46:46
and so then he took captivity 
46:48
he captivated them 
46:50
with his love and his sacrifice 
46:52
for all for all those 
46:54
who choose him and so they then 
46:56
eventually they did 
46:58
exit Abraham's bosom 
47:00
or paradise 
47:02
and they are all now in heaven 
47:04
they don't use that anymore 
47:06
it's not used but it is still there 
47:08
it had golden buildings 
47:10
it actually had a river 
47:12
now these are spiritual places 
47:14
because you're there in your spiritual body 
47:16
I will explain to people the difference 
47:18
of being in the flesh and being in the spirit 
47:20
you have a spiritual body 
47:22
and it looks like you but it looks a lot better 
47:24
you look young you're full of energy 
47:26
and life and so 
47:28
when you died you entered into this 
47:30
spiritual round place that was paradise 
47:32
or if you were wicked 
47:34
there's a great gulf that separates those places 
47:36
I think the people 
47:38
in paradise can see the gates of hell 
47:40
and they know hell if they come up 
47:42
to the gates can see 
47:44
like it's like 
47:46
I can't think of what you call it 
47:48
a balcony they see like this big 
47:50
balcony that they can see in a far 
47:52
distance because remember the dream 
47:54
that the wicked man had 
47:56
and he wanted the beggar to bring a drop 
47:58
of water and put it on his tongue 
48:00
burning in hell that dream 
48:02
was real that was real 
48:04
and that's a good way to explain 
48:06
you read that dream and see what happened 
48:08
there was a hell he was burning in hell 
48:10
and he was telling God please send 
48:12
someone to 
48:14
earth to tell them about this place 
48:16
it's horrible I don't want my family to come 
48:18
here and of course God's answer 
48:20
to him was it wouldn't matter who came 
48:22
they're wicked in their heart and they 
48:24
don't want it 
48:26
and he said so that but he would not send 
48:28
Lazarus who was a beggar 
48:30
who was a beggar on the earth and he was 
48:32
they could see that he's eating 
48:34
he knew they were eating there's like 
48:36
a king's table a feast set there 
48:38
you still eat in your spiritual body 
48:40
people in heaven and these 
48:42
people in paradise were eating they had 
48:44
buildings that they stayed in 
48:46
they had a beautiful river they even had a 
48:48
sky because it was a spiritual 
48:50
place oh wow okay 
48:52
of the year he wouldn't take his 
48:54
friends who actually believed 
48:56
in him and lived right 
48:58
he wouldn't send them to place 
49:00
it was a dark money place here you 
49:02
are in the middle of the earth sitting next to the lava 
49:04
that wasn't going to happen 
49:06
God made this place beautiful 
49:08
and it and it was beautiful 
49:10
let me ask this one last question because 
49:12
I know we have to stop at the top of the hour 
49:14
there was a great earthquake 
49:16
when Jesus was crucified 
49:18
and graves were open what have you 
49:20
seen if anything 
49:22
as far as that have you seen 
49:24
that event 
49:26
graves open the earthquake I know 
49:28
it didn't happen I know that the 
49:30
earthquake was shook and graves 
49:32
open and people saw 
49:34
I'm trying to remember I don't know if they gave a number 
49:36
or something but it was quite a few 
49:38
it was quite a few hundred I believe 
49:40
they were actually noted 
49:42
it was noted and written somewhere I don't know 
49:44
maybe Josephus or somebody wrote that down 
49:46
but it does mention in the Bible that 
49:48
they had an earthquake and the graves were 
49:50
opened and they saw people walk it was just 
49:52
another testimony that that was 
49:54
the son of God I mean a lot of people 
49:56
began to believe that was the son of God 
49:58
cross that was the son of God 
50:00
because he knows that couldn't have happened any other way 
50:02
so that really did happen 
50:04
people came up out of the graves and they walked around 
50:06
it was fascinating 
50:08
it was fascinating 
50:10
but you know it's interesting because 
50:12
you know it shows integrity 
50:14
on your part because you're not making it up 
50:16
if God didn't show you 
50:18
you're not saying God showed me 
50:20
you're saying I didn't see people walking out 
50:22
of the grave 
50:24
people walking out of the graves when there was 
50:26
an earthquake so that to me 
50:28
that adds credibility to you 
50:30
because you could make something out of it 
50:32
I wasn't taking and showing those people walking 
50:34
but I do know that did happen 
50:36
I do know that did happen 
50:38
they still talk about it in heaven sometimes 
50:40
wow I'd love to see a video of that 
50:42
and I guess in heaven we get to see 
50:44
replays that we want right 
50:46
if we want to see what that looks like 
50:48
absolutely can see replays 
50:50
awesome I like 
50:52
those are the kind of re-runs I want to see 
50:54
that if you will 
50:56
pray for the people 
50:58
before we go and just 
51:00
bless them if you will 
51:02
Father I thank you for this 
51:04
beautiful day I thank you for your 
51:06
holy son our king 
51:08
of kings I thank you for 
51:10
Holy Spirit who can be 
51:12
our best friend but is still God 
51:14
he was sent to come alongside 
51:16
us and then when we choose to invite 
51:18
him to indwell us he actually 
51:20
moves on the inside of us and then 
51:22
he'll never stop talking to us 
51:24
but I thank you for that 
51:26
that you are very much involved in our lives 
51:28
and you do care for everyone 
51:30
and I 
51:32
pray Father that people 
51:34
have to understand they need to understand 
51:36
that when they have 
51:38
someone who belongs to Jesus Christ 
51:40
and they receive Jesus Christ 
51:42
when they move to heaven it is 
51:44
a good thing 
51:46
it is a good thing for them 
51:48
that's why they celebrate in heaven 
51:50
they don't weep and cry when someone comes home 
51:52
they celebrate 
51:54
because God loves it when one of his children 
51:56
come home one of his sons or his daughters 
51:58
they come home to heaven they actually have 
52:00
a huge celebration rewards are given 
52:02
from the throne at that time and then 
52:04
all their family and friends go to see 
52:06
this person's mansion and then they get 
52:08
undone by how beautiful and amazing 
52:10
or adventurous even 
52:12
these mansions are so powerful 
52:14
thank you Father for thinking of us in the 
52:16
past now in this time 
52:18
and in the future you know where we are 
52:20
you know that we love you 
52:22
I thank you in these days 
52:24
set a table 
52:26
and the presence of everyone's enemies 
52:28
that would be the left 
52:30
that would be the liberals 
52:32
all those evil people colluding 
52:34
and flaming together to take over 
52:36
this world which makes me laugh 
52:38
ha ha ha 
52:40
because this earth was 
52:42
made by you and your son 
52:44
and it says the earth and the focus 
52:46
now belongs to Jesus Christ 
52:48
the earth is your footstool 
52:50
because 
52:52
you're ever watching us 
52:54
thank you for intervening in lives 
52:56
people have lost things like 
52:58
their property or their 
53:00
money is running low I thank you 
53:02
right now you take out 
53:04
of your own stock 
53:06
and you give to those people 
53:08
Father because they're trusting you 
53:10
they're believing you and they're 
53:12
staying excited I thank you 
53:14
for showing yourself strong on their path 
53:16
in these days right now 
53:18
in Jesus name 
53:20
so be it 
53:22
and everyone said 
53:24
amen and amen 
53:26
I just want to encourage people to go to 
53:28
revealingheaven.com 
53:30

53:36

53:58

54:00

54:26

54:28

01:00
You 
01:31
Welcome to Elijah streams. It happens to be Tuesday, August 16, but we're recording this for a week from Wednesday 
01:42
So whatever that date is someone can put that on the screen for me. I forgot to look that up, but August this is for August 24 
01:52
Even though we're recording it on August 16. So we're on with cat. It's going to be good. So if anything she says happens to be 
02:02
Historically incorrect because more things have happened. You'll understand why so it's going to be a great show 
02:08
There's no I have no other announcement. So let's 
02:12
If you all are ready, I'm ready. So let's watch Wednesdays with cat and Steve. Here we go 
02:32
Well, hello, I don't know which to say happy Wednesday. I can't say that because it's not 
02:42
How are you doing cat you just I'm doing great. That's always gonna be my answer 
02:48
You got your you were just telling me got a brand new scarf and shirt. Is that we were saying I have everything new. Okay, the jacket which is really cool 
02:58
You can't see. There you go. You can see powers really beautifully engraved. I just got that yesterday in the shirt which I would have worn on the platform 
03:08
And my scarf and yeah I was going to the salon today and the Holy Spirit said you were in that brand new black shirt looks really nice and you wear the new jacket and I'm thinking 
03:18
I think it could get wet. You never know when you're going to go to salon was going to happen. He said no, go ahead and wear it. Not telling me why and I'm sitting in there in the chair at the salon and she's almost done with me 
03:30
When I get it when I get a call and say did you remember that you had to record something with Steve Schultz? 
03:38
No, I didn't but now I know why he told me to wear this. I walked in the door literally walked in the door and just sat in the chair so Holy Spirit needs to be your best friend. Let me tell you he'll let you know all kinds of things you wouldn't expect that he would 
03:51
And so here I am today and that's very cool. You know lately Darin and I have been practicing that every not I was I was about to say every once in a while very often now all of a sudden I'll remember something 
04:07
We went to bed and it gets cold in a certain part of our house even though it's summer and she went to bed and she and she said I think I might have left the heater on that little portable heater so she went out there and she said the Holy Spirit keeps telling me stuff but it's not like a voice 
04:25
necessarily she just all of a sudden she thinks about inside that's what yeah exactly so I keep saying thank you thank you Holy Spirit thank you, you know, I think him today. 
04:38
That's awesome. So, so it's I would encourage people when you suddenly remember something and it was important, say thank you Holy Spirit right. Yes, absolutely say thank you. 
04:51
You're so so good and he likes gratitude I found that out so. Yes, he does that that that will intensify the actual friendship one if you're thanking him all the time. 
05:03
Oh yeah, I do thank him all the time I think him the father of something I think I think I think them I think the Trinity. 
05:11
Sometimes it's the father of the Lord, most of the time the Holy Spirit is when he talks to me about every day stuff, or even reminds me of things and like I can't lose anything no matter what I can't find. 
05:23
He either shows me where it's at literally a picture of where it's at, or it just comes back. It just comes back. What do you mean it comes back what do you mean. 
05:33
If I found if I've misplaced something really important and I really need it. And I've looked a little bit for it. Well there's something I always say you all need to just learn this. 
05:44
If I can't find something I always say these words, and they always work. It's not the word is what you're saying. And I say Holy Spirit you know where everything is it was ever made that is made right now and never will be made. 
05:59
Please show me where and I say what it is where it is now. And in that moment he literally shows me like a vision of where it's sitting laying or even underneath something. He does it immediately and I say thank you so much for showing me where that is. 
06:14
Because I give him an opportunity to do something for me by saying that. 
06:19
So that's asking you have not because you asked not so I'm literally asking him. But first I'm telling them who I tell him who he is. And what he does know he knows everything that was ever made. 
06:30
No matter where it is in time he knows he knows what's made right now and he knows what's going to be made in the whole. 
06:37
The best person to ask first before you run around an hour looking say that first and just say I ask you to show to me right now. And he'll either show me or someone will yell I found whatever. 
06:50
Oh wow. 
06:52
But it's like it's something that's very quickly done immediately when I when I honor him for who he is and then I ask. 
06:58
I think that's that's one of the meanings where it says in the scriptures before you call I will answer. It's like he knows you're about to call he knows your words are forming and he already starts forming this picture. 
07:13
Lord show me that years ago and I and so when I ask him something I don't try to wait for a long time I try to listen to what the very first thought because before I call him he's going to answer so that's very very cool so awesome. 
07:29
Well you've got some thought maybe a few thoughts on your heart for when people will watch this so share that before we get into questions if you want to. 
07:39
I do actually. My husband was driving me to the salon and you know the traffic's backed up like crazy everywhere around here. They're building a few new things so the streets are backed up. 
07:51
And also if it's the time like when school lets out there's always going to be traffic somewhere in this city. And so we had a lot of time in line we were sitting in line in the traffic but I never complain when that happened. 
08:03
And so the father starts speaking to me immediately and then he took me from. I wasn't in the truck. I was taken to this place and shown something he wants me to share so I'm going to share it with everybody first time ever like just happened to me maybe an hour ago or so. 
08:21
He took me he caught me up and put me on this long winding road I didn't even know where I was at and in front of me was where I had been he said I want you to see where you've come from he said I'm going to show you a journey. 
08:35
And so I saw this long road in front of me and then all the way up where these red streaks he said that's the blood of Christ that never leaves you all the way up to my feet they came and then he said now you may turn and see where you're headed. 
08:50
And when I turned I saw still some more road because this is my journey remember I saw more road in front of me but it got more and more transparent and then I could see shortly in the distance the city of God which would be the throne room or all the beauty and splendor is 
09:07
in heaven I saw that and he said everyone who belongs to me needs to know that this is your destination he was saying not just mine everyone is a believer that is your destination this is what he said to me. 
09:21
Everyone should love one another now because I actually say the world will know you by your love for each other stop fighting. 
09:29
Stop arguing stop picking on each other stop saying things aren't even true about each other. He said you spend your time loving. So when you reach that destination, there will be an even greater celebration that you chose to love on another and be a testimony to who I am. 
09:47
And I was so undone because the splendor that looked just like the city of God that's what I call heaven city in heaven. It was like the city of God I saw all the time I could see streets of gold I could see the glorious buildings 
10:03
that were in the air they're not even on the ground I clearly knew where that was but that's what he was saying. Anyone who's a believer that's our destination we're all going to the same place. Okay this is what else he said your body may die but that's not you. 
10:20
That's part of your covering. He said your spirit man and your soul never dies so all those if you recently had someone passed to heaven I've had three really good friends recently like even in the last week somebody met passed on to heaven. 
10:35
And you know she was like in her fifties and yet she was not just ready her mansion was done and she went and I was celebrating I always celebrate when somebody goes to heaven so I have that I understand that is our home we will go there until he makes the 
10:51
way we were but this is our destination we're on a journey together that's what he's trying to say to me he was very adamant this is a journey you're doing together where you've been and then where you're going your destiny where you're going your destination is all the same destination. 
11:06
But what you do now matters it doesn't matter and having a matters how we treat each other matters if you if you know accomplish the mission he has given you but honestly part of our mission is to care about each other the Bible says to. 
11:21
You know to consider those are the household of faith or God first that means we should consider our fellow Christian members first we need to help them we need to honor them bless them and that is our goal that and let the world know us by our love how big of a deal 
11:39
that because right now I don't think they think the body of Christ or Christians are known because of our love for each other but it's going to happen and I will say this Jesus won't come back several years many years away actually before that happens but he's not coming back until we are loving one another 
11:57
because the Bible says the world will know us by our love for each other is one of the signs that that you know that we're getting close to him coming so we have some work left to do so people just forgive people just let it go loose out of your soul somebody wrong you 
12:11
and just love them anyway and the other thing you're doing is you're piercing Satan he does not want you to forgive people and love one he doesn't want us to love one another if we keep fighting whenever they even know who we are how can you operate in the power of God and 
12:27
speak for him on his behalf if you're trashing people who are the household of faith so this is a good time for you to just say I'm sorry father from this day forward I'm going to I'm going to do the very best I can and ask for more grace and get filled with your love 
12:43
and let this world see me love other believers and so that was the encounter I just have literally speaking to me I was gone in the second I was right back in the seat of the truck well of course I told my husband what just happened and he goes oh that's awesome 
12:59
he's not a man of many words but he was thought he thought it was a great thing and I said I'm supposed to share that I'm supposed to share that the next time not remembering even at that moment that it would be just a couple hours from them when I would do that so that is a word from the father 
13:15
if we are supposed to love one another care about each other help one another don't pick people's you know even if you don't have maybe you don't have a vision for what you're doing right now you don't pick other people's visions apart that's okay 
13:29
somebody happy and can I ask you a question so almost everyone has people that are I guess we would say they're in the body of Christ but they are so different than what we are there even some of them are off base 
13:49
but we know they accepted Christ but and then some are detractors and some are almost enemies and yet and yet they serve the Lord and what happens when we decide to just in our heart I guess it happens in our heart first just decide you know what I'm going to love them 
14:09
whether they ever know this or not I'm going to choose to love them what does something happen in the spirit when we do that. 
14:15
Yes, but I have to have to make clear what what what you're saying I understand what you're saying you make a decision with your soul, because your natural emotions aren't going to do it. 
14:27
You can even say, I make a choice with my will, no matter how you're feeling about it, you can actually do that that's actually something that is possible. 
14:37
You don't have to feel it for you don't have to feel it then you don't have to feel you don't have to feel you do not have to feel it. 
14:44
You're making what you declare and decree shall be established unto you and it is going to happen. 
14:52
I've had to do that several times actually, depending on what people had said have done done done to me or said to me. 
14:58
I say I choose as an act of my will to forgive them and my emotions certainly in that moment of time probably don't want that but you overrode your emotions. 
15:09
That's not like you're not being you that's using a part of you maybe you didn't use very often. 
15:14
Your will is the most powerful part of you. 
15:17
It's what it's what you display. 
15:19
I mean, know your will is what you choose to do your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you actually choose. 
15:27
And my husband has always said what you choose to do you will do. 
15:31
That's his famous quote. 
15:33
And he's very right about that so why not choose with your will the way the father decided to make it and say I choose as an act of my will not my emotions to forgive and say their name. 
15:45
And guess what the father he will write that down and he will immediately start working on the heart of the other person because you have forgiven them. 
15:54
That actually gives the father and Holy Spirit freedom to pursue that person for them to change no matter they're probably you're probably not the only one they're doing things to. 
16:04
If people are in fear or if they're in pain or if they're angry it makes them lash out I'm not giving an excuse for them I'm just telling you that's how it operates in your soul. 
16:15
As a man think it then his soul. 
16:17
So are you that's the heart of your being your soul. 
16:21
I had I had a situation. 
16:24
I don't know if I ever brought this up but there was a guy who went home to be with the Lord years and years ago. 
16:30
Okay so this is nothing current years and years ago but before he did that he tried really hard to destroy this ministry that I mean so it was a long time ago but it was this ministry. 
16:42
And I think or I feel like or I think I, I tried to forgive him okay I don't know which words to put, and I went to, you know, I had been really really sick many people know I was bed ridden my pastor. 
16:57
At that time thought maybe I was, I was depressed while I wasn't, but he said I want you to go to counseling so in deference to him I went to counseling for a few times. 
17:07
And I told this counselor a woman counselor and I told her about this guy that tried to destroy us because she was digging deep for anything that might be bothering me. 
17:18
And I said this happened this happened this happened and the guy's book was on her shelf so I knew she knew who he was. 
17:26
And so she said I want you to go up these stairs see yourself going up these stairs and open the door and it's the Lord, and you and him are going up there together, you're walking side by side up these areas. 
17:41
And I want you to tell the Lord what you think about him. 
17:47
You can imagine that was kind of, and all of a sudden now these emotions are coming up and all of a sudden I'm balling. And I said, it was like the Lord said what do you think about and he named the name and all of a sudden tears are just flowing. 
18:00
And I said he did the best he knew how to do he served you with, and that was sort of a combination cat of soul and emotion all mixed in there because I choose. 
18:12
I chose to do that talk about forgiving someone after they're gone, after it's too late to say it to them. 
18:21
You can. Well, number one, I do want to say the person who passed on. 
18:26
Yeah, they're immediately sorry for everything ever said or did you it just is a part of what happens. 
18:33
So when you die and step out of this body and your spirit man steps out, you know immediately what you did that, even if we're seeing, let's say I'm not saying murder or stuff like that. 
18:44
Maybe you were rude, maybe you were harsh to people, maybe you did something wrong against them. 
18:49
You know, immediately at that moment you're flooded with the life of God and you go, wow, I should have said I was sorry, you know, I should have said I was sorry for them what I did was wrong. 
19:00
I should have told them one day they feel still in need to tell you that. 
19:04
So they're basically at that moment saying they were sorry or repenting for doing it, even though you never heard it. 
19:10
Yeah, there is absolute forgiveness or actually a recompense for when at the moment someone dies and he's in heaven right now can't wait to see you and hug you when you get to heaven and say man, I should have been better to you. 
19:22
And you're probably saying these words, it doesn't matter anymore. But it would feel I can imagine it feeling good, really, really good to hear it. 
19:33
And also at the same time saying it doesn't matter anymore, you know, all at the same time all mixed in the same time you're really you're kind of happy. 
19:41
Yeah, they did it. They did understand. 
19:44
No, you can't you can't try to hide from truth when you're in the presence when you're in the presence there's no there's no hiding from what is true, you know what is true. 
19:54
And especially leaders in the body of Christ have a double accountability might as well bring this in your double accountability is leaders in the body of Christ and I'm sure the Lord may have something to say to you when you get in heaven he won't keep you from heaven. 
20:09
But I'm sure he may have something to say to you because the word does say that you'll be held calm for every wasteful word. It actually says that in the Bible. 
20:17
Can you clarify that you said that the other day in heaven, huh? 
20:21
You said that last time we were on the program about someone else you said he'll have something to say. 
20:27
Yeah. 
20:28
Can you postulate or even relate what type of thing he might say to someone like that? What do you mean he'll have something to say? 
20:38
I think that is done at a special appearance. I'm not saying that is necessarily done when you first arrive in heaven. 
20:44
Okay. 
20:45
Unless it was a special case, as was the case I saw the other day. 
20:51
Most of the time you'll be in heaven and you're rejoicing you're celebrating you're so happy the presence so powerful, but the more the presence begins to just invade your soul. 
21:02
You kind of know I probably should have handled this better. You don't feel guilty. There's no guilt. There is no guilt in heaven. 
21:09
Even when you come before the judgment seat of Christ and he will say things to you like, you know, I did ask you to do this. 
21:16
Like he asked, let's say he asked you to be a preacher. You decided to be a rodeo. Whatever. I'm just making a crazy. 
21:22
Yeah. 
21:23
And he did great at being in the rodeo, but you didn't ever pick up the call that he's dad. 
21:29
He will mention that to you. You'll have a conversation that doesn't mean he's going to kick you out or anything. 
21:34
But because in the Bible it says you'll be held accountable. 
21:38
So don't use waste wasteful words would be like bashing people being unkind to people saying rude remarks. 
21:45
And you're you're a believer, but you're still doing this stuff up into the day you go. 
21:50
You will realize, yeah, man, I should have not done that because truth begins to invade you. And when you kind of hear from that truth or you ignore that truth, 
22:00
that doesn't mean you won't go to heaven. That just means you are going to have a time to be talked to. 
22:06
Well, you know, I'll just end with this because I know you have the first question about something else or anything else to say. 
22:13
But I've talked about my father many times and he was in fact, he's with the Lord. He was in fact a major serial child abuser. 
22:24
He was OK. Then he got his heart right. And I know he's with the Lord. You said he's felt really good when I talked about he's with the Lord. 
22:32
You said that makes him happy when he hears that. So that was a major, major, major, major sin or set of sins or years of sin. 
22:41
So talk about the talking to that he might receive one day. I mean, how does that work? What would he say to my dad? 
22:51
Because he already knew he was wrong. 
22:53
I'm not even talking about actual sin. I'm not even talking about sin. 
22:58
Oh, that was sin. No, that was sin. His repentance of all that wiped it away. 
23:05
Oh, OK. So he's not talking about that. 
23:08
And he's not up there thinking about that anymore. He's thinking about how much he loves you and he's excited for you. 
23:13
And he knows that you're doing great things for God. 
23:16
Now, what I'm talking about are people who are like, even though they're believers, it's not really a sin to be rude. 
23:22
It's not nice. But those are wasteful words you're speaking. They are not necessary and you shouldn't be speaking on those things. 
23:29
He will talk to you. He will. He will talk to you about that, those kind of things. 
23:33
Sin is forgotten into the sea. No, there's no more remembrance of that. 
23:39
Like, no matter who's out there, if you sin and you're repented, don't bring that up to the Father again. 
23:44
If you're repented, he won't remember it. He won't remember it. 
23:48
But after you've been born again and repented, maybe you sin later, repent again, please. 
23:54
The God is not into freely sin at all. He is not in agreement with you to freely sin when you're a believer. 
24:00
That's not any kind of testimony or witness for him. 
24:03
And you just don't want to do it because people can see you acting like that and they'll think, why should I get saved? 
24:09
You act just like me. If you're sinning, if you have a lifestyle of sin, that's not a good thing at all. 
24:16
But what I'm talking about is just people's attitudes and the way they treat people. 
24:20
Those things, he will probably say something to them about because it does say, 
24:25
you will be held accountable for every wasteful word, words that shouldn't have been spoken, that were not necessary, 
24:30
that maybe hurt people or, you know, interfere with things in their life. 
24:35
Those kind of things. Because he said that in the word, he will talk to you about those things. 
24:39
But you're sin. 
24:41
I always thought, I guess I'm wrong on my thinking. 
24:45
I always thought those wasteful words and things you're speaking against people were, in fact, sins. 
24:52
Really? 
24:56
Wasteful is not sinful. There's a clear definition here. 
25:00
No, sins, the sins, the sins that you did in the earth, you have to repent, 
25:05
even if it's at the moment you die and Christ comes to you and says something. 
25:10
At that moment, you would have to say, I do truly repent because of the keys of hell, death and the grave. 
25:16
But the wasteful words have nothing to do with you getting into heaven or not. 
25:20
It's the attitude you have. It's maybe the witness that you're being. 
25:24
It won't keep you from being in heaven, but you could have probably had a lot more or done more for him 
25:29
because if you had treated somebody different. 
25:31
He's clearly saying that even when you're born again, watch how you treat people, how you handle people. 
25:38
He doesn't want people getting crushed or falsely or wrongfully accused. 
25:42
He wants that to not happen from a believer because you're actually messing with the testimony of what a believer is. 
25:49
Let's say sinners know you and they see you acting or mistreating people. 
25:53
They're like, why should I bother? You're almost interfering in more than just that. 
25:57
So those wasteful words that you shredded people with your mouth, that's not a sin. 
26:02
That's just a wasteful words that should not have been done. 
26:05
It's a waste of time to speak them. 
26:07
In other words, those he will hold you accountable. 
26:10
That doesn't mean you're going to be kicked out of heaven and he will let you know what that means when you get there. 
26:15
So no, he's not talking about sins. That doesn't mean sin. 
26:19
That's amazing. 
26:21
Well, what else do you have before we get into questions? 
26:24
Any other thing about current events or anything like that? 
26:28
I'm just excited about all the fraud exposure that's coming forth, which I'm sure everybody else is also. 
26:35
The legitimate many has meant other people coming forward to testify against the left who were a part of that. 
26:42
And I'm telling people to be the biggest, probably the biggest exposure ever in the history of the earth. 
26:48
Because of the exposure will be so deep and so wide and so complete. 
26:53
That everyone is doing anything to try to take over the world to stop our lives, steal what we have, 
26:59
or just stop the word of God from going forth. 
27:02
Anything that has an evil agenda on the left or the liberals, whatever they're doing, 
27:07
they are all going to be exposed and justice is going to be brought against them. 
27:13
And that's why I keep telling them that are doing that you better go. 
27:17
You better go be a witness and testify against what they're doing, 
27:20
because the day is going to come when the window will close and they won't need people's witness. 
27:25
They'll have so many witnesses that have been proven to be right that will legally cause legal action to take forth, 
27:31
come forth, whether it's from heaven or from the earth, 
27:34
but they're going to be exposed. 
27:37
And so that's just happened again. 
27:39
There are eyewitnesses that have come forth from all places. 
27:42
I may as well tell you because it's all over the place. 
27:44
It's FBI agents. 
27:46
I'm not saying to them to went into Mar-Lago or I can't even say the name. 
27:51
Trump's home to steal things or mess up things, which was what their agenda was. 
27:57
I don't know about them. 
27:58
I'm talking about ones who were a part of that and are no longer a part of that. 
28:02
They have got some of them who've come forward and are testifying, literally testifying, 
28:07
which God said on November the 4th, 2020, it would happen. 
28:11
So those things are beginning to happen and more and more people, 
28:15
you're not going to hear about it until it all breaks loose. 
28:18
And they have to say those famous words that the 2020 election was stolen. 
28:24
And it will be said on regular news and they won't want to say it because of the testimony and the witness and the evidence. 
28:30
They are going to have to say that people. 
28:32
And I can tell you those things are starting to come in. 
28:35
They're compiling up against the left and the liberals. 
28:38
I'm not doing it. 
28:39
It's happening because God said it would happen. 
28:42
And we just, they just had some more come forward and do that. 
28:44
So I'm always excited when truth is being told because it helps people. 
28:49
The truth makes you free. 
28:53
Are there people cat-like news anchors that we would recognize? 
28:59
Many of them who were told, you will not report. 
29:02
You will not say this because you will not say it was stolen that, 
29:07
that are going to come forward and say, they told me I couldn't talk about it. 
29:12
And commentators who wanted to tell the truth and they'll say they were, 
29:16
they told me I was not allowed to, well, that kind of thing all over the place. 
29:21
Definitely. 
29:22
Well, we're going to have all kinds of from every area from the business arena and the medical arena. 
29:27
I mean, everywhere from the financial arena, the media arena, 
29:32
there are going to be some from every one of those different areas because that's how far reaching the lie is and the deception is. 
29:39
And therefore people will come from each one of those arenas and they will testify because probably most likely they're not working. 
29:47
I mean, I didn't be working at those places right now because they were threatened with death. 
29:51
Most likely that that seems to be like, well, if we can't badger them or force them, then we'll just tell them we'll kill them. 
30:00
And I mean, again, this is truth. 
30:02
What I'm speaking is the truth that has already happened. 
30:05
And if they can't get these people who are in these positions to go along with them, they just take them, they just take them out. 
30:11
They threaten them. 
30:13
Truly they do. 
30:14
And some people won't talk about it because they're afraid for their own life. 
30:17
But there's going to come a time when they realize if they don't come forward and say something, this thing is going to come to an end where the people believe it or is or not. 
30:24
And you can't, no one can stop it from happening. 
30:26
It is coming to an end. 
30:28
And that whole foundation has already started crumbling under those people of the left and the liberals. 
30:34
It's already crumbling and they know it's crumbling. 
30:37
That's why they're being desperate, like, you know, raiding Trump's home and other things and saying, what else can we find or make up or lie about that will keep this thing going because it's failing. 
30:46
And it's failing big. 
30:48
So I just spoke the truth again. 
30:50
There are all these people from all those arenas and some people who are very high up in them, which is the testimony they really need. 
30:57
They need them to come forward and say that there's going to be a big witness protection program somewhere. 
31:03
But I can tell you right now it is going to happen. 
31:06
And so some of that just happened the other day and it's already being spread everywhere and it's true. 
31:11
They have had some come forward to that want to testify on behalf of what is right. 
31:17
So good. So good. 
31:19
I love it. I love it. Okay. 
31:21
Anything else before questions? 
31:25
I don't think anything else right now. 
31:27
I do have a question here that we can kind of start with. 
31:30
Yeah, start with that one. That'd be good. 
31:33
This is I love getting I love getting and let me tell you, I get so much mail. 
31:38
It's wonderfully outrageous. 
31:41
It takes me weeks and sometimes even months to go. 
31:44
If it's sent to me for me personally, I do go through it and look at it. 
31:48
And I do pray for a lot of people at that time. 
31:50
If it's something that's urgent, I will pray for them. 
31:53
But this little child who's nine years old, I'm just going to say her name is Andrea. 
31:58
And I'm not saying anything else about where it came from or what. 
32:02
Since God is making a new heaven and a new earth. And if you didn't know that, guess what he's going to. 
32:08
And the word does say that he is. 
32:10
So she is correct. 
32:12
Do you know what he's going to do with the moon? 
32:18
And I just love these children's questions. 
32:21
You know, they don't they don't hold anything back when they want to know something. 
32:24
They just ask what people think about what they say. 
32:28
Well, I'll tell you, Andrea, you can probably have it in your own yard on the new earth. 
32:32
I am quite sure the father can make you one. 
32:35
And so you will not miss the moon. 
32:37
And you know, he did make the sun and the moon. 
32:40
He made them himself. 
32:41
It says so in the Bible. 
32:42
Now, when he originally in the beginning, Genesis one, one in the beginning, 
32:47
when he made the earth, he lit it with his glory. 
32:50
There was no sun or moon lighting this earth when he made it the first time. 
32:55
And then in verse two, something has happened because he made it the first time and it was finished. 
33:00
It was done. 
33:01
He was done with the first time he made it. 
33:03
In verse two, it says that darkness is on the face of the deep and the water is covering the whole earth. 
33:09
Well, he didn't make it that way. 
33:11
He would have never made it that way. 
33:13
He made it the way it should have been. 
33:15
But then Saint was kicked out of heaven, fell to earth. 
33:18
He began to make the earth a wilderness. 
33:19
It says that in Jeremiah. 
33:21
And so God turned the light out. 
33:23
It also says that. 
33:24
He turned out the light. 
33:25
He took his glory off the earth and he broke the water vapor shield around the earth, 
33:30
which brought mist on it because it never rained in the very beginning. 
33:33
You need to know that too. 
33:34
Even scientists know that. 
33:36
And so it flooded the whole earth and then he made it darkness come upon it because he took the light out. 
33:41
So here's the earth sitting in verse two, right? 
33:44
It says he made it in verse one in the beginning. 
33:47
He made that means made means done, made the heavens and the earth. 
33:52
And then in the second verse, it's a mess. 
33:55
There's, there's, there's water covering the sky. 
33:58
That's the firmament. 
33:59
And it says in the Bible that he took the water off the firmament. 
34:02
He took it off of the land and began to redo the earth. 
34:06
It says that clear in the Bible. 
34:08
So then when he began to redo it in verse two, he starts that and he even says what he does. 
34:13
Okay. 
34:14
He replenishes the plans and brings them back. 
34:17
He puts the sun in the sky to light the day and the moon at night to light the night. 
34:22
It didn't say that in one one. 
34:24
And people go, well, how could this be millions of years people between verse one one, right? 
34:29
And Genesis one, two, there are millions of years. 
34:32
Oh, that's the first time I've heard you put it. 
34:35
No, there really is because it, there was no kind of time on the earth, right? 
34:40
The sun and the moon counted the days and the nights. 
34:44
When he started redoing the earth, replenishing is the correct word. 
34:48
The Holy Spirit just told me, we began to replenish the earth. 
34:51
Well, you can't read something. 
34:53
If you didn't do it before modeling your home unless you built it before. 
34:58
So you need to look at the words that are spoken unless people have written a new Bible and wiped them out and then just forget about it. 
35:04
Find one that isn't. 
35:06
It has not been changed. 
35:08
But so he made the earth in the beginning and it was done. 
35:11
It was finished. 
35:12
Beautiful. And it had a water vapor shield. 
35:15
He put around the whole earth that brought mist onto the trees, the flowers, but the light of God came from everyone who goes to heaven gets to see this. 
35:24
They go to this place and he lets you see him making the heavens and the earth light of God came from the ground and it would hit this water vapor mist. 
35:35
And part of that was part of what the rainbow. 
35:38
But the sky back then in Genesis one, one was a peachy pink. 
35:43
It wasn't blue because the sun wasn't present. 
35:46
They created that needed that to make the sky blue. 
35:51
So in verse two, it all changes when he takes the water off of the firmament. 
35:55
That's the sky. 
35:56
It takes the water off the land and starts to be replenished the earth replenish that the creatures, the plant life. 
36:03
I probably didn't say it in the right order, but he did. Then we know eventually on day 16, he made man. 
36:08
But that's this was a whole different sky. 
36:11
Same earth foundation. 
36:13
Everything sound glow was there, but he was replenishing it so man could live on the earth. 
36:20
Okay, so they could live there. 
36:22
And then he put the sun in the sky and it brought life by the day and then the moon at night. 
36:28
And it even says that so you could see at night. 
36:31
And so now we have the sun and the moon. 
36:34
The sky is beautiful blue normally in the daytime. 
36:37
And then the sky at night is dark and except the light from the stars and the sun. 
36:42
I mean, the moon, you can see it clearly. 
36:44
But my answer to Andrea's, I'm quite sure that he would be happy to make you a moon to be over your mansion or in your mansion. 
36:53
That's how cool God is. 
36:55
I could clearly see him doing that for you, Andrea. 
37:00
Very cool. 
37:01
Hey, on and creation, I've been asked this before. 
37:04
I don't, don't recall if I've asked you people have asked many times on the seven days of creation, were they 24 hour days? 
37:14
Yes. 
37:16
That's what I thought, but I wanted to double check. 
37:19
Because the Bible says it was today in the night. 
37:23
And then it was another day. 
37:25
It actually says that it says evening in morning, right? 
37:28
Evening in morning. 
37:30
24 hour day. 
37:31
Yeah. 
37:32
Six. 
37:33
Because he's God. 
37:34
That's why he spoke it. 
37:36
The word stepped out and made all of it. 
37:38
They could do it. 
37:40
They could do that as fast as they wanted to do it. 
37:43
That's why if you send an angel on assignment, like, like the, the heavens army, you send an assignment, they're back in five minutes. 
37:51
They've already dealt with what it was that you prayed about. 
37:54
And because, because there is no time. 
37:57
There's no day, no night. 
37:59
There is no time. 
38:00
There's no calendars. 
38:01
So when you send them or you pray for something, they go do it instantly. 
38:05
And then they come back for another appointment. 
38:07
I've seen that happen in heaven because I've been to Michael's headquarters. 
38:10
This is a free, free stuff now. 
38:12
I've been there and Michael's headquarters when they were sent on the mission. 
38:15
And it seemed like, you know, they were back. 
38:17
They went and dealt with it in the spirit realm. 
38:19
And then they came back for the next set of orders. 
38:22
That's amazing. 
38:23
Now you said it's in the scriptures that God turned the lights out. 
38:27
Can you tell which one that is? 
38:29
I'm not familiar. 
38:31
People read the whole book and find it. 
38:33
You're not going to. 
38:35
He won't let me. 
38:37
Okay. 
38:38
People to find them themselves. 
38:40
Steve, church and they listen to their pastor say stuff, but they don't. 
38:45
Most of them don't even go check it out. 
38:47
I admire people that search out the word to find things and see what it says about truth. 
38:52
Well, I do have some. 
38:54
He lets me quote, like he lets me cope. 
38:56
The first John 227 to let you know that you have a weapon in you. 
39:00
You never use most of them. 
39:02
And that's called, you know, the anointing. 
39:04
Yeah. 
39:05
It says in the Bible in first John 227, when you receive Jesus Christ and become a Christian, 
39:11
you get a deposit of the anointing. 
39:14
What is that? 
39:15
The anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness. 
39:18
You get a deposit of it and it says, it lives in you. 
39:21
I carry the anointing. 
39:23
I release the anointing. 
39:24
The anointing grows so much that it's like a big cloud outside of me. 
39:28
And if I walk into a place that begins to affect people, that's what Peter did. 
39:32
That's what Paul did. 
39:33
They said Peter's shadow healed people. 
39:35
It was the cloud of anointing coming from him because he did get a deposit when he got Christ. 
39:40
Christ puts a deposit of the anointing in you and it never leaves you. 
39:44
But the more you give it out, the more you get back. 
39:47
It's almost like a bank account. 
39:49
It's like an investment account. 
39:50
When you release the anointing, it grows. 
39:54
So that's what you're supposed to do. 
39:55
You've never done that. 
39:56
Make sure you start releasing it into what? 
39:58
Go in the restaurant. 
39:59
You drink out of a cup. 
40:00
You say, I release the anointing. 
40:01
It'll never leave that cup. 
40:02
The next person, it never leaves that cup. 
40:07
No, never. 
40:08
Not through the dishwasher. 
40:10
No, it's not because it's a spiritual thing. 
40:15
It comes from you, release the anointing. 
40:18
It goes in that cup. 
40:20
Every restaurant I ever eat at, I release it in the table. 
40:23
I release it in the seats. 
40:24
And so there's John. 
40:25
We've seen some people sit down in places and they jump back up. 
40:30
They're like, I don't know what that was because it would be God. 
40:33
Maybe they're not, maybe they're not, maybe they don't know the Lord. 
40:36
Maybe they're doing wicked things. 
40:37
They sit in that chair full of anointing. 
40:39
They all have to jump up and go find another place to sit down. 
40:42
So if you anoint the seat, let's say the seat in the table. 
40:47
For the rest of the time that that table exists, 
40:53
people will sit down in the anointing. 
40:55
And that's not just cat curd. 
40:57
That's anyone. 
40:58
Any believer that when you got born again, go read 1st John. 
41:03
I'll say it slow. 
41:04
1st John 2 27. 
41:07
You have it because you got born again. 
41:10
Jesus Christ literally takes a deposit of the anointing that destroys the 
41:15
yoke of darkness and he says, he puts it in you and it lives there to buy 
41:19
there. 
41:20
That means it's there. 
41:21
It's up to you to release it wherever you go, whatever you touch. 
41:24
I have my phone up here before I send the text. 
41:26
I type in, I put my hand on this, they're releasing anointing. 
41:29
When they touch that and read that text, it comes out and you get. 
41:33
Wow. 
41:34
Oh, we actually released it in the tires of our car and I see fire 
41:38
tracks because the anointing looks like fire. 
41:42
It looks like that. 
41:44
In the spirit. 
41:45
It looks like fire. 
41:46
And so when we drive our car, you see fire tracks and everybody who passes 
41:51
over those tracks, the anointing will begin to penetrate their car. 
41:56
You don't know how supernatural you are. 
41:58
There are so many things we don't know as believers unless we are told that. 
42:03
And the Bible says, I have not seen or you're hearing or entered in the heart 
42:06
or mind of man, but God has prepared for those that love him. 
42:09
Well, one of the things he's already prepared is the anointing you're 
42:12
carrying. 
42:13
We have testimonies from people that their brother couldn't stand them. 
42:16
He lost his job and they wanted to help him. 
42:19
And the one guy, the brother had the good, the brother that was living 
42:23
right had these cowboy boots that this other brother wanted all the time. 
42:27
And they went to my meeting and heard me say these words. 
42:31
And when they went home, they anointed the cowboy boots, released the 
42:35
anointing in them, both of them. 
42:37
And they called the brother said, why don't you come have dinner? 
42:40
And they said, we really want to pray with you. 
42:43
He lost his big landscape business and now he was really needing. 
42:46
He said, well, I guess I'll come. 
42:48
And he asked, can I mow your lawn to get some money? 
42:51
And they said, yeah, sure. 
42:52
So when he went to leave, they said, you've always liked these boots. 
42:54
Would you like them? 
42:56
And he goes, yes, I want those boots. 
42:58
Well, these are anointed boots people from them. 
43:01
They carried the brother and his sister while that they carried 
43:05
they put in those boots. 
43:07
A couple of days later, he called and goes, I don't know why I've been mad at you. 
43:11
Wow. 
43:13
Why am I mad? 
43:14
I care about you. 
43:15
I just thank you for these boots. 
43:16
And by the way, I just got a brand new contract. 
43:20
I got a whole new contract to do all these condos now. 
43:23
And now I've got money again. 
43:25
I want to thank you so much for blessing me. 
43:28
It didn't happen until it gave him the boots. 
43:32
He put them on and the anointing began to penetrate now. 
43:35
And do you have to be in person to lay your hands on for that to work? 
43:39
Can you send the anointing from a distance? 
43:42
That would be rare. 
43:43
That'd be rare. 
43:44
Okay. 
43:45
You can send them something. 
43:47
You can send them a card in the mail. 
43:49
Okay. 
43:50
I released the anointing and you mail it. 
43:54
And when they open it or touch it, they don't even go. 
43:57
So Kat, if I put the anointing on an envelope, 
44:03
really prayed for it, the anointing to be released on an envelope. 
44:07
It goes to the person and the person says, 
44:10
writes on it, refused, returned to center, but they held it. 
44:14
They touched it. 
44:15
That's all it takes, Steve. 
44:17
That's clever. 
44:19
I will leave places go. 
44:21
We'll say it's too late, everybody. 
44:24
And this is the best part. 
44:26
Any of those people have been watching me bashing me. 
44:29
It's too late. 
44:30
You already have the anointing in you because I put it in everything 
44:35
as we're doing these things. 
44:36
We annoy all of our stuff and put it in it. 
44:39
And you can anoint your computer before you send emails. 
44:42
And the email, when they look at that email, they open it, it goes in them. 
44:47
Even, even if you, even if they look at it for a second and said, 
44:51
I don't want to read this, but they see it. 
44:53
That's it. 
44:55
Wow. 
44:56
Okay. 
44:57
Let's ask one question about sending the host. 
45:01
Sometimes I think, well, I've really done my job. 
45:05
I've spent 20, 30 minutes sending the host all over the place. 
45:09
I'm still in bed. 
45:10
I'm doing it while I'm still in bed. 
45:12
And I've sent them everywhere and I've given them assignment. 
45:16
I think, well, I'm done for the day, but you're saying five minutes later, 
45:20
they're back. 
45:22
I always give them one more before I go to sleep because you know, 
45:25
that's seven a.m. I'm up 20 hours a day. 
45:27
So they've been getting instruction out at three a.m. 
45:29
I, I like to go outside. 
45:31
I just like to go outside. 
45:33
I don't have to, but I want to be near where they're at. 
45:36
So I go outside with my staff and every time I, 
45:39
I give them an order to command to go somewhere, 
45:42
which I'm allowed to do because Christ was, you know, 
45:45
we know he was the Lord of hosts. 
45:46
He commanded the army to things he did. 
45:48
We can do too. 
45:49
I'm not going to go through all that, but I do. 
45:51
And I'll take my staff and I hit it on the ground and I'll just say, 
45:54
I'm not going to be it. 
45:55
Go host, make toast. 
45:57
That means they're going after the dark, 
45:59
the spiritual darkness to pull it down, 
46:01
to shred platforms and they will do it. 
46:04
And you may not find out to get to heaven one day, 
46:06
but when you do that, you are having an impact somewhere. 
46:10
But back to the anointing thing for just a minute. 
46:13
When I used to speak, 
46:14
we had a whole meetings that were nothing but to teach people to, 
46:18
they knew now that according to the word, 
46:21
the anointing was in them. 
46:23
And I was like, right here in the core of your being, 
46:25
I'd had people stand up and say, okay, 
46:27
now you know you have it. 
46:28
Lay your hand on there and ask Holy Spirit to stir it up. 
46:31
And we would actually have them do that. 
46:33
And then I always had, I always did something so they could see 
46:38
that it actually did something. 
46:39
And then I would say lay hands on the person next to you and say, 
46:43
I released the anointing in Jesus name and people were falling out. 
46:46
They started laughing. 
46:48
The room was getting so full. 
46:50
I could feel the waves of anointing coming from everybody. 
46:52
And I finally would say, stop, stop, stop, stop. 
46:55
I can't stand up anymore. 
46:58
So I didn't have them. 
47:00
I actually trained them how to use it. 
47:03
And people used to go while they would, 
47:05
they would go and anoint the reservoir of the city, 
47:08
like stick their hand as close as they could to it in it. 
47:11
And they did things like they would go to the pizza restaurant. 
47:14
They worked in, 
47:15
they would touch every pan in the restaurant, 
47:17
the ovens in the restaurant, the pizza place. 
47:19
And we see anointing, which everybody who got a pizza made on that pan 
47:23
got the anointing. 
47:25
My goodness. 
47:27
Forever because it doesn't leave. 
47:29
It doesn't ever leave because it's a spiritual thing. 
47:32
It's a spiritual thing. 
47:34
Unbelievable. 
47:36
You can be doing all kinds of things. 
47:39
Yeah. 
47:40
I'm re-fired up. 
47:42
Okay. 
47:43
It's like our secret weapon. 
47:45
It totally is. 
47:46
Understand the word that clearly says it lives in you. 
47:49
What do you think? 
47:50
What did you ever think you were going to do with it? 
47:52
Yeah. 
47:53
What people, what did you think? 
47:55
It says the anointing breaks or destroys the yoke of darkness. 
47:59
That's the anointing you carry. 
48:02
And no matter where you walk, you can release it through your feet. 
48:04
I walk through the store, release it everywhere in the store. 
48:07
Every garment I ever look at on the rack, I will touch and go, 
48:10
I'll release the anointing, the anointing, the anointing. 
48:12
Everyone who buys those clothes will have that anointing on them. 
48:15
Goodness, goodness, goodness. 
48:17
You can be busy all the time, people, just for the anointing. 
48:20
I'm going to get busier all the time. 
48:22
I see myself getting very busy. 
48:24
Okay. 
48:25
I, I told this lady, no, well, I would ask this, 
48:28
but it's way too long to read. 
48:30
So I'm going to summarize what she's saying. 
48:32
She's totally into everything you're teaching even today. 
48:35
I'm sure. 
48:36
But her husband began to be. 
48:39
A detractor. 
48:40
Then he went from a detractor to. 
48:42
He didn't like it. Then he went from that to. 
48:45
To being biased against it. Then he went, 
48:47
then he became a cynic. 
48:48
Then he became a mocker. 
48:50
Now he is a hardcore mocker of everything she's doing. 
48:54
And it's hurting her marriage. 
48:56
And she's supposed, she feels like she's supposed to submit to him. 
49:00
What does she do? 
49:02
That depends on how bad it's getting. 
49:04
I can tell you right now. 
49:06
God, God, God, God, God, God, God. 
49:09
And then how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. 
49:12
God never said, he never said, 
49:15
we had to submit to the abuse of our husband. 
49:19
It's just physical abuse. 
49:21
It hasn't been physical. 
49:22
I think she would have told me, 
49:23
but it's really verbal wickedness. 
49:26
I can tell you what she can start doing. 
49:28
You need to start laying your hands on everything he's got. 
49:30
Let me see. 
49:33
Go to his closet. 
49:34
Release the anointing and all of his clothes. 
49:36
Make sure all of his shoes gets the anointing. 
49:38
You will probably see a change 
49:40
because that anointing destroys the yoke of darkness. 
49:43
He literally has a yoke on him right now. 
49:46
And when you keep going and you get darker and darker, 
49:50
it's because you know what he's doing. 
49:52
He's feeding his own soul with what he doesn't like. 
49:55
And if he keeps feeding his soul, 
49:57
that's all that's going to be in the layers of his soul. 
49:59
And as a man think it's in his soul or his heart, 
50:02
that's how he's going to be. 
50:04
That's the biggest issue. 
50:06
He's saying all that. 
50:08
It's like people watching the fake news. 
50:11
They would start out great. 
50:12
They wouldn't like it. 
50:13
Then they'd be listening and they'd be like, 
50:14
well, you know that sounds plausible. 
50:15
Well, you know what? 
50:16
I don't like the other side. 
50:17
And now they hate him and they don't even know 
50:19
why they hate what's right 
50:21
because their soul is filled with the lies and deception, 
50:25
the hate that those people who are spewing it out, 
50:28
it's going in whoever's watching it. 
50:30
The anointing can pass into people listening, 
50:34
but the bad stuff can pass into you. 
50:37
Also, if you keep listening, 
50:39
it says to guard your heart. 
50:41
That is your soul. 
50:43
For out of that soul will flow the way you live your life. 
50:46
That's what the issues of life is. 
50:48
Your whole life will change by what you're listening to. 
50:51
And it can even be your own words 
50:53
trashing something all the time, 
50:55
which is what he's doing. 
50:57
So he's speaking against what God has put on the earth 
51:00
and even in you. 
51:02
So you need to come against that stuff. 
51:05
You need to maybe send the host against those spirits 
51:08
of wickedness and lies and deception 
51:10
to pull that stronghold off of him, number one. 
51:13
But make sure you're releasing the anointing. 
51:15
It's the best thing you can use. 
51:16
It's the number one thing we're given. 
51:18
Even at the day we got born again, 
51:22
you got that anointing. 
51:24
That's one of the powerful things he gave you. 
51:26
It's there. 
51:27
He said it's there. 
51:28
It destroys the yoke. 
51:29
So that should destroy the yoke that's now on him. 
51:32
And you say, I'm praying and declaring 
51:35
that that yoke of darkness will be destroyed 
51:37
off of my husband. 
51:38
It can be free to love and free to live 
51:41
and free to hear God. 
51:42
And that's releasing anointing in the food he eats, 
51:45
like in the whole refrigerator 
51:47
and everything. 
51:48
Anointing in his closet, 
51:50
everything he's clothing he wears will have the anointing. 
51:52
You are so getting him consumed with that anointing. 
51:57
And eventually there is going to have, 
51:59
something's going to happen. 
52:00
And you will see it when it happens. 
52:02
That's a good thing. 
52:04
I don't think it was this woman, 
52:06
but there was another woman who said, 
52:08
my husband has finally forbidden me to watch Kat on the air. 
52:13
What am I supposed to do? 
52:15
Any? 
52:16
The same thing I'm telling the other woman to do. 
52:19
Same thing. 
52:20
Same thing. 
52:21
The anointing destroys any yoke of darkness. 
52:25
It doesn't matter what it is. 
52:27
It destroys it. 
52:29
I know we say that the anointing breaks the yoke, 
52:32
but actually the real word, 
52:33
that real word that says breaks, 
52:35
it actually means destroys. 
52:37
So it destroys all those yokes of darkness, 
52:40
whether it's hate, 
52:41
if it's deception, 
52:43
if it's lies, 
52:45
if it's an anger or unbelief, 
52:48
those are yokes. 
52:50
And that anointing was given to us so that it would break it, 
52:53
especially in our own family. 
52:55
It has a great impact on that. 
52:57
And I even tell people, 
52:58
if you're still hugging family members, 
53:00
you can say quietly when you hug them, 
53:02
I release the anointing so they don't hear it said, 
53:05
but say it. 
53:06
But I'm telling you what, 
53:08
if they live in your home, 
53:09
you have every opportunity to lay on their bed, 
53:11
put it on their pillow, 
53:12
put it in their bed, 
53:13
put it in their clothes, 
53:14
put it in the food. 
53:15
There is going to be a major reaction to the anointing 
53:19
that's breaking and beginning to destroy that yoke 
53:21
that's on that person. 
53:23
We have seen it over and over the testimonies we have, 
53:26
and just because I used to train people to do that, 
53:29
it was the first thing he had me teach. 
53:31
Besides the fact, 
53:32
I talked about heaven all the time. 
53:34
Everything he said is you will teach him how to use the anointing. 
53:37
It is a weapon, 
53:39
and they get it the day they're born again. 
53:42
So when we hug our loved ones, 
53:44
anyone that's running from the Lord, 
53:48
I'll use those words with me, 
53:50
hug them. 
53:51
We just say, 
53:52
under our breath, 
53:53
I release the anointing. 
53:54
Yeah. 
53:55
And then make sure if they're going to eat dinner at your house, 
53:57
make sure you release it in the food they're eating, 
53:59
and the plates, 
54:00
you know, 
54:01
go lay your hands on all the plates in your cabinets 
54:03
and the cups and everything. 
54:04
It sounds wild, 
54:05
but it really does work. 
54:08
It works. 
54:09
Amazing. 
54:10
Amazing. 
54:11
I'm excited. 
54:13
All right. 
54:14
All right. 
54:15
This sounds like Malachi, 
54:17
Milachi, whatever. 
54:18
Can you explain what the kingdom of God is? 
54:22
For example, 
54:23
Matthew 633 says, 
54:25
seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, 
54:28
and all these things shall be added to you. 
54:30
That's her question. 
54:32
The kingdom is the same thing Christ talked about. 
54:35
He talked about a spiritual kingdom. 
54:38
That's he, 
54:39
when he talked about the gospel of the kingdom, 
54:41
that is a spiritual kingdom. 
54:43
That is a real kingdom that operates in the spirit realm. 
54:47
You're not going to walk up to a castle here that says, 
54:50
it's not a flesh and blood thing. 
54:53
It is the spiritual thing. 
54:55
And the kingdom of heaven, of course, 
54:58
is part of that spiritual kingdom. 
55:00
But on the years you operate in it, 
55:02
by doing one of the things I just told you, 
55:04
that is a weapon. 
55:05
Clearly it is a spiritual weapon. 
55:07
And yet it says what it does. 
55:09
It clearly says in the Bible, it destroys the oath. 
55:12
You have that weapon. 
55:13
You can't see it or touch it, 
55:15
but it's in you. 
55:16
And when you begin to release it, 
55:18
it actually impacts that spirit realm. 
55:21
And you're operating in the kingdom. 
55:24
When you do that, 
55:25
because you're using a spiritual weapon it gave you, 
55:28
when you speak truth to people 
55:30
to break off deception to them, 
55:32
you're operating in the kingdom. 
55:33
Every time you pray, 
55:34
you're operating in the kingdom. 
55:35
When you declare you're operating in the kingdom, 
55:37
when you help people, 
55:38
you're operating in that kingdom that Christ talked about, 
55:41
that it was so valuable that you give up whatever you can 
55:44
to get that kingdom. 
55:45
It is a spiritual kingdom. 
55:48
When you get to heaven, 
55:49
you have the full understanding of that. 
55:51
But the weapons he gives us now here, 
55:53
it says our weapons of warfare people. 
55:56
Remember what warfare is? 
55:58
It's when you come against something. 
56:00
You fight against the darkness and the evil. 
56:02
And you think, 
56:03
I can't do anything. 
56:04
I'm just a little human being. 
56:05
Oh yes, you can if you're born again, 
56:07
because you will now, 
56:08
a new creation means you now have supernatural abilities in you. 
56:13
You have supernatural weapons to use in the spirit realm, 
56:16
that you will really mess up the devil's plans. 
56:19
You're going to mess them up. 
56:21
So that kingdom he talks about is, 
56:23
he said, you cannot see it with your human eyes. 
56:26
But it's there because you're here. 
56:28
You have a spirit man. 
56:30
You can operate through your spirit using these weapons. 
56:33
And you can do wonderful, powerful things against the enemy, 
56:36
which is one of our, 
56:38
one of the things that we're called to do as a believer. 
56:40
That's what we're called to do. 
56:42
We rule and reign with Christ when we use those weapons. 
56:45
There are spiritual weapons against the spiritual darkness. 
56:48
Spiritual darkness is always against every evil, wicked, human flesh person. 
56:54
They're wicked because they're listening to the evil spiritual realm, 
56:59
the evil spiritual beings, 
57:01
which you have power over all the power of the enemy. 
57:05
Our enemy is Satan. 
57:07
So any demons disembodied spirits, 
57:10
I can go through this whole long list about that for three years. 
57:13
I did nothing but preach about the darkness out there and how to come against it. 
57:18
I did that for a long time. 
57:20
And so it's in me. 
57:21
I do it automatically. 
57:22
But you as a believer are powerfully and wonderfully made. 
57:26
That's what the scripture says. 
57:28
He didn't leave you without help. 
57:30
Number one, the Holy Spirit is here to help you all the time. 
57:33
Christ will never leave you. 
57:35
When you invited him in, he actually does step in. 
57:38
He's in there. 
57:40
He's there to help you, to help guide you with the Holy Spirit. 
57:43
But he gave you weapons, people. 
57:45
The word of God, not the one with half the verses scripted out. 
57:49
Okay. 
57:50
I'm not talking about the one that wiped out the truth 
57:52
and they want to put their interpretation in there. 
57:54
I'm not talking about that. 
57:55
And let me tell you that's happening a lot everywhere. 
57:57
And make sure you get a Bible that has all the verses in it. 
57:59
Yeah. 
58:00
And not things. 
58:01
Some are removing chapters because they don't like what it says. 
58:06
They want to make everything okay for everybody, 
58:09
no matter how wicked or evil we are. 
58:11
Hey, that's the agenda of the left. 
58:13
Doesn't it sound like that? 
58:14
Totally is. 
58:15
They want everyone to accept evil and wickedness. 
58:17
That's why they're spreading it. 
58:19
That's why they will never make anything good 
58:22
because there's no good in them. 
58:25
They can't even think that way. 
58:27
All they can think is destroy, take, steal, crush. 
58:31
That's what they're all thinking. 
58:32
That's what that whole agenda is for them. 
58:35
And yet Christ came to bring you life and life more abundantly. 
58:40
So we're supposed to have abundant life with Christ. 
58:43
Regardless of what else is going on around us. 
58:45
And maybe if you start using the anointing for what it is, 
58:49
it is a weapon to come against the spirit of the darkness. 
58:52
You will begin to see things shift even for you. 
58:55
So good. 
58:56
He didn't owe us without his blood, the most powerful thing ever in all time. 
59:00
The only thing that wipe away your sins and give you entrance into heaven. 
59:04
Satan hates it. 
59:06
The word of God, the word spoken, the word written is so powerful in the spirit. 
59:11
Satan hates that too. 
59:13
He doesn't like the light of God in you, but he can't stop it from coming. 
59:17
The greater relationship you create with Christ, 
59:20
the more light you have in you. 
59:23
It says one time at one time, even the night will be light round about you. 
59:28
That's you going outside at night and seeing a light coming from yourself. 
59:32
It is going to happen in the manifest of sons and daughters. 
59:35
I won't just read the word. 
59:37
I actually believe it and I live it. 
59:39
I live that word. 
59:41
People who don't understand that have never lived or understood even what it was. 
59:44
Why is it written in there? 
59:46
It's not just a nice story. 
59:48
A bad thing that happened. 
59:50
It is an agenda of God to let you see yourself as a new creation. 
59:56
You get part of his DNA in you. 
59:58
You get a stone of fire that gives light to your spirit man in you. 
01:00:02
And you get born again. 
01:00:03
You get a deposit of the anointing. 
01:00:05
You are so full of God right now as a believer, but you have no understanding. 
01:00:10
Right. 
01:00:11
That. 
01:00:12
Yeah. 
01:00:13
Let me ask this. 
01:00:14
Okay. 
01:00:15
We just read seek first the kingdom of God. 
01:00:18
And then with that or. 
01:00:21
Okay. 
01:00:22
Put that aside for a moment, not aside, but let's change the subject where. 
01:00:27
God came to you and said in 20, I think it was 2012. 
01:00:32
You said the kingdom age has begun. 
01:00:35
What's the difference between seeking first the kingdom of God. 
01:00:38
And now suddenly living in the kingdom age. 
01:00:41
There's a very big difference because the word talk is about when things will 
01:00:45
actually happen. 
01:00:46
Things that will come that will bring change. 
01:00:49
It changed a lot. 
01:00:51
Okay. 
01:00:52
When John the Baptist started saying, okay, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
01:00:56
Yeah. 
01:00:57
He understood. 
01:00:58
He probably was one of the few people that actually understood. 
01:01:01
He knew heaven was about 10 days. 
01:01:03
He knew the Messiah was coming. 
01:01:05
He knew that he would die for the sins. 
01:01:07
He knew these things. 
01:01:09
And that change started when Christ was born, when he was sent from heaven to 
01:01:15
earth and planted in the womb of Mary by Holy spirit. 
01:01:19
That did happen. 
01:01:21
That happened. 
01:01:22
Things begin to change when she began to achieve. 
01:01:25
He was being birthed, not birthed, but he was being, you know, growing inside of 
01:01:29
her. 
01:01:30
Angels would come and tell her things. 
01:01:32
She knew things were going to change. 
01:01:34
She knew they would be different. 
01:01:36
When Christ born, things really began to change even rapidly, more rapidly. 
01:01:40
And at that time, Satan knew somebody had come. 
01:01:43
That's why he tried to find out from the, you know, from the wise kings. 
01:01:47
He questioned the wicked king and questioned them. 
01:01:50
But Christ was hidden and hidden and hidden, even sent to Egypt for a while because he 
01:01:55
was bringing change to this world by who he was. 
01:01:58
And then when he began to minister, then openly people began to see how things changed when 
01:02:06
he was around. 
01:02:07
And it was so powerful that he gave his life for us. 
01:02:10
When he gave his life for us, he made a way back to the place we came from. 
01:02:15
We all came from heaven. 
01:02:17
We lived in the Father. 
01:02:19
He is our Father. 
01:02:20
We are His offspring. 
01:02:21
The Bible says that the real change to happen once Christ was on this earth, it began to 
01:02:26
demonstrate and manifest the power of God. 
01:02:29
He stopped the storms. 
01:02:31
He walked on water. 
01:02:32
He increased time or he slowed time down. 
01:02:35
He created food. 
01:02:36
He made regular water into heaven's wine. 
01:02:39
You saw one miracle after another. 
01:02:41
One miracle after another began to happen. 
01:02:44
They haven't stopped happening. 
01:02:46
As the days grow closer, where the kingdom, the kingdom age would be brought to this earth, 
01:02:54
we would know more and more about it. 
01:02:56
That's part of my job is to let people know what is this kingdom? 
01:03:00
What is this kingdom? 
01:03:01
Why is the kingdom age here? 
01:03:03
So you can operate in it fully, understanding who you are, what the weapons he gave you, 
01:03:09
that would bring hope for people's lives, help for people's lives, that they would see 
01:03:14
people walking the earth that didn't sin on purpose, that could hear the word of God and 
01:03:20
demonstrate his power throughout the earth. 
01:03:22
That was the purpose of the kingdom age and it did start in 2012. 
01:03:27
All the way up to that, being a seer and understanding the prophetic, I felt something stronger and 
01:03:33
stronger coming and a lot of people announced what came in 2010 or 2010. 
01:03:41
I think that's the right way to say it. 
01:03:44
They could feel it coming closer and closer, but until the day came, and we literally in time, 
01:03:49
in time, if you were a seer, we stepped from a threshold of time into a time we've never had before. 
01:03:56
And that is when the manifested sons and daughters would be seen in the earth. 
01:04:00
That's why the earth was interveiled for us to stand up and start demonstrating who he is. 
01:04:05
The miraculous, like that people would be raised when the dead that were created. 
01:04:09
I mean, miraculous things will happen in this kingdom age, because God is going to demonstrate 
01:04:14
that he really exists. 
01:04:15
He's going to erase the great area that says there is no God. 
01:04:19
Many things are happening in this kingdom age. 
01:04:21
And the kingdom will remain up until the time when Christ is seated on the throne in Jerusalem, 
01:04:28
even after the tribulation, which is a few years, people, a few years, and then Satan will be 
01:04:35
sitting on the bottom of the pit. Christ will sit on a throne in Jerusalem as king of this world. 
01:04:42
And some people won't even put that in the Bible. 
01:04:45
That's what I said. Make sure you're looking at the right Bible. 
01:04:47
They say that these things have already happened. 
01:04:49
None of these things have happened except the kingdom ages come. 
01:04:53
People begin to speak to the weather like Christ did, and it will obey. 
01:04:57
Things that we say will begin to happen because we serve Christ and we live here for him. 
01:05:03
If you had been... 
01:05:08
Well, I was going to say, Kat, if you had been the only person and the first person who ever said that, 
01:05:14
I thought, well, Kat's going to be off here because that's not like anything I've ever heard. 
01:05:20
But years before I met you, my spiritual father, Wade Taylor, said in 2012, when it was 2012, 
01:05:28
he told me the kingdom ages come. He was 88 years old when he passed a couple of years after that. 
01:05:34
And I thought, what is he talking about? 
01:05:36
And then I later found out that Arthur Burke had said the same thing. 
01:05:40
Also, he's gotten to be with the Lord. 
01:05:42
So when you said it, that's the voice of two or three witnesses have absolutely agreed that 2012 this thing happened. 
01:05:51
I don't know why he picked out that year. 
01:05:54
I mean, Obama was in office. I mean, what did he pick that year? 
01:05:58
But I don't know what you... 
01:06:00
He loves to pick years when adversity is there. 
01:06:04
And I'll tell you why. People will actually listen because they need help and hope. 
01:06:11
Yeah. 
01:06:12
And he knew all this stuff was going to happen. 
01:06:14
He knew it, but he has got to fully expose the evil. 
01:06:18
It's not just about the devil having a heyday taken over. 
01:06:21
God is letting them on purpose expose how evil and wickedness operates. 
01:06:26
Well, socialism really does to you, but communism really does so people can see for themselves. 
01:06:31
It's not good. 
01:06:33
That doesn't mean he's doing it to hurt anybody. 
01:06:35
He's not doing that on purpose, but he has to have a time when the evil is exposed. 
01:06:40
It will be crushed and it will be pushed back because in these glorious years coming on the earth, 
01:06:46
it will be like a whole new earth, not a whole new earth, but a whole new thing happening on the earth. 
01:06:52
And favor will be given to believers. 
01:06:54
And there's people out there that wouldn't even believe me. 
01:06:56
Well, that doesn't matter. 
01:06:57
Maybe you'll be in heaven. Don't have to be concerned with it. 
01:06:59
I didn't mean that. 
01:07:00
Anyway, you cannot stop the plans of God. 
01:07:05
They couldn't stop Christ from coming. 
01:07:07
They couldn't stop the Holy Spirit from coming. 
01:07:09
They couldn't stop it from raising from the dead people. 
01:07:11
They could not stop Jesus from going in hell and wasting it. 
01:07:14
No one can stop what's going to happen this time. 
01:07:17
God's timeline. 
01:07:19
He has a timeline and the events. 
01:07:23
They're not dates. 
01:07:25
I walked up there. 
01:07:26
I didn't see one day to solve events. 
01:07:27
I saw these events happening on the earth. 
01:07:30
He didn't let me see to the end. 
01:07:33
I saw things that weren't happened. 
01:07:35
Hasn't happened yet. 
01:07:37
In heaven, you talked about, excuse me, and described that God has an event calendar. 
01:07:43
Not a date calendar, this event. 
01:07:45
But on earth, there's actually dates connected to it. 
01:07:49
We just don't know what those dates are going to be. 
01:07:51
We never know it. 
01:07:52
And when we think we've guessed it, 
01:07:54
we're almost always wrong from what I've seen. 
01:07:57
Yeah, that's what I don't ever guess. 
01:07:59
Yeah. 
01:08:00
Guessing is like wasted energy. 
01:08:02
So. 
01:08:03
You have to believe that God, you have to trust him. 
01:08:06
You have to trust him. 
01:08:08
You know, trust is very important. 
01:08:10
If you, if you, you begin to believe something, 
01:08:13
you go from believing to trusting, 
01:08:16
you actually put forth actions where you're trusting God for something. 
01:08:19
So you believe and then you begin to trust him, but there comes a day. 
01:08:23
And when you step from trust and you step into faith, 
01:08:27
you are never the same again. 
01:08:30
Never. 
01:08:31
And I had believed in God for so many years and trusted him probably for several decades. 
01:08:37
And then at one point I felt a shift in me and I said, 
01:08:42
what has happened? 
01:08:44
And a prophet literally truth called me on the phone who lives in South Carolina 
01:08:50
and said, the father had me call you to say these words. 
01:08:53
This day you have stepped into faith. 
01:08:56
Wow. 
01:08:57
Can you try to put into words. 
01:09:03
What that feels like to go from trust into faith? 
01:09:07
Cause we thought, I always thought trust was one of the ultimate things, 
01:09:11
but you're describing faith as like the next step up. 
01:09:15
If you will, what, what, what does that feel like? 
01:09:18
And if you can even think of an example, so people could go, 
01:09:22
oh, that's what I'm striving for or contending for or believing for. 
01:09:27
You want to, you want to step into faith because faith, 
01:09:31
it makes it feel the most amazing feeling you're everything. 
01:09:35
I felt such freedom, like freedom came. 
01:09:39
Freedom because I had been obeying God and I've been obeying him and everything. 
01:09:43
You asked me, I obeyed it. 
01:09:45
No matter how silly it was or why would you ask, 
01:09:47
I don't even ask him why he does anything. 
01:09:49
I, that's called trusting. 
01:09:51
When you get to trust and God says, do this and you know it's him and you do it 
01:09:55
and how amazing your life will be for that moment. 
01:09:58
But when you step into faith, everything he says after that, 
01:10:03
you were already living it on the inside. 
01:10:07
It's like there's not even one ounce of doubt. 
01:10:10
It leaves you, doubt leaves you. 
01:10:12
Doubt can't even get in you. 
01:10:14
None of the stuff that left the saying, it can't penetrate me because I'm a living in faith. 
01:10:20
I've stepped into faith. 
01:10:22
So no matter what anyone says to try to stop me from saying anything, it's not going to work. 
01:10:26
When you get to the place where you're there and God says you're there, 
01:10:31
then no matter what he says, you know that you know that you know it's happening. 
01:10:36
It is happening because you have stepped from trusting. 
01:10:40
You stepped into faith. 
01:10:42
It's an actual place that you step into. 
01:10:45
And from that moment, your faith gets so huge. 
01:10:48
It's like it's unstoppable. 
01:10:51
Not that I must have a month, but whatever God says to me or shows me, 
01:10:55
I know that I know that I know this is happening. 
01:10:58
So when you know that, you know that, you know, 
01:11:01
is living in me, it's not somewhere up here. 
01:11:03
I'm trying to find it as an example. 
01:11:06
When you know that, you know that, you know that, you know, Trump is coming back. 
01:11:11
There's no, you've moved beyond trust to faith. 
01:11:15
It's so real that no one could talk you out of it. 
01:11:18
No, they can't talk me out of it because I know it's going to happen. 
01:11:22
It is absolutely going to happen people. It's going to happen. 
01:11:25
And the great thing is you, you're standing in that faith. 
01:11:29
You know it's going to happen. 
01:11:31
Nobody can try to take it is something they can't take away from you. 
01:11:35
It isn't just something you hurt when you're in faith. 
01:11:39
You already know it's going to happen. 
01:11:41
You know it, but I'm not out there blasting people wrongfully using people. 
01:11:47
I'm not using, you know, nasty words or hurt people. 
01:11:50
I'm just not doing it. 
01:11:51
I'm going to stay right where God has me. 
01:11:54
So my words have power. 
01:11:56
They have power for hope, for blessing, for greatness. 
01:12:00
They have power in them. 
01:12:01
Part of that power is the faith that I'm in now. 
01:12:04
But anyone who is a believer can go after that. 
01:12:08
This is nothing I'm doing as hell from you. 
01:12:10
It depends on what you want. 
01:12:12
What do you want from him? 
01:12:13
Do you want to know him more? 
01:12:15
You want more of him? 
01:12:16
You want more of his presence? 
01:12:17
More of his words? 
01:12:18
You have to pursue them. 
01:12:20
Yeah. 
01:12:21
Do you want to get blessed? 
01:12:22
Well, then bless other people because you probably won't get anything without blessing. 
01:12:26
Blessing is like a seed where there's money, where there's actual health. 
01:12:29
Do you help people with things or help give revelation to them? 
01:12:33
Or maybe you're just helping them do something they really need to do. 
01:12:36
That always does something to the heart of God. 
01:12:40
So if you want to be blessed, you will have to bless first because then you're trusting God. 
01:12:46
You're not doing it to get something. 
01:12:48
Right. 
01:12:49
You truly want to bless. 
01:12:51
Yeah. 
01:12:52
I love to bless people. 
01:12:54
I love to help people. 
01:12:56
It's like, it's a part of me now. 
01:12:58
And when that faith becomes a part of you and he says it, and I know people who have already 
01:13:03
gotten there, they know that he's saying what he's saying is going to happen. 
01:13:07
That's why Hank won't change what he's saying. 
01:13:10
He knows, he knows, he knows he's already in faith for that. 
01:13:13
God said it. 
01:13:14
He showed us that he knows it's going to happen. 
01:13:17
Yeah, when you go, when you went from trust to faith, now that you're in faith, it sounds 
01:13:28
very, very powerful. 
01:13:31
Will that faith grow? 
01:13:33
Will it get more? 
01:13:34
Or is it? 
01:13:35
It does. 
01:13:36
It does. 
01:13:37
It grows and grows and like the kingdom always, always, always grows. 
01:13:42
Right. 
01:13:43
It'll never stop growing. 
01:13:44
It increases. 
01:13:46
You're going to increase in every way because it says he desires above all things. 
01:13:52
Right. 
01:13:53
That you be in health. 
01:13:55
By the way, that's living in health. 
01:13:58
Right. 
01:13:59
He wants you to prosper. 
01:14:00
Number one, above all things, he wants you to prosper. 
01:14:03
Prosper doesn't just mean money. 
01:14:05
It means the way you're living, the things you're saying, the impact you're having on 
01:14:10
people, that that's prospering in all your ways. 
01:14:14
You're prospering. 
01:14:15
That means with your relationships, with what you're doing, if you own a business, what 
01:14:19
you're doing in the church or what you're doing to help other people, there's always 
01:14:23
going to be increased. 
01:14:25
That's prospering. 
01:14:26
That's an action of life itself. 
01:14:28
That's not just here's some money. 
01:14:31
He wants you to be in that place. 
01:14:33
And then even as you will prosper, even as your soul prospers, right? 
01:14:40
Right. 
01:14:41
He also wants you to prosper and live in health. 
01:14:45
BE means a way of life. 
01:14:48
Christ became poor that we might be rich. 
01:14:51
That's his plan. 
01:14:52
Poverty is not the father's plan. 
01:14:55
Okay. 
01:14:56
So it says even as your soul prospers, you will then live in health and you will prosper. 
01:15:04
Your soul has to prosper. 
01:15:07
So if you're feeling your soul with bad news or bad words that you're speaking, or you 
01:15:12
don't even like yourself, your soul can't prosper. 
01:15:15
We can't do those other two things. 
01:15:17
Your soul has to prosper in order for you to prosper and live in health. 
01:15:22
It has to prosper. 
01:15:23
It prospers by reading the word, speaking the word, saying God's promises, saying what 
01:15:29
God is wanting to do right now, not the left, not what your friend is saying, if it's not 
01:15:34
aligning with God, the more your soul prospers, the more life it puts out, not just gets in. 
01:15:42
The more you will prosper in all your ways and you will begin to live in health. 
01:15:48
That is called divine health. 
01:15:51
Let's use this as the last question since I've done two shows today. 
01:15:54
So I'm going to cut it a bit shorter, but I'm in health, but I'm tired. 
01:16:03
So a person, and I can put myself in this, but I don't really suffer a lot from this, 
01:16:12
but I suffer some from this, where people will say, well, I don't like myself. 
01:16:17
I don't like the way I look. 
01:16:19
I don't like the way I, how much I weigh. 
01:16:23
I don't like the way, you can just list and listen to this, but you just said, if you 
01:16:28
don't like yourself, I don't consider myself a person that doesn't like myself. 
01:16:33
But I don't like certain things about myself. 
01:16:37
Talk to people and myself. 
01:16:40
How do you move that needle from, I don't really like what I see in the mirror. 
01:16:47
I don't really like what God did to make me, how he made me, to, to, to liking yourself 
01:16:54
so that you can prosper. 
01:16:55
Talk about that. 
01:16:56
I'll tell you right now, that's why you can't prosper because what is the whole thing goes 
01:17:03
back to as a man thinker in his heart. 
01:17:09
When he says that word heart, he's not talking about your human flesh beating heart. 
01:17:13
He's talking about your soul. 
01:17:14
Here's your soul. 
01:17:15
Right? 
01:17:16
This is your soul. 
01:17:17
Here's your soul right here. 
01:17:19
It's like this. 
01:17:20
There's a beautiful column with etchings and writings on it. 
01:17:23
That is your will. 
01:17:24
And on top of that is your spiritual mind, your mind, your will, and your emotions are 
01:17:29
all the layers of you, that's how you're made, and those emotions, and whatever you put in 
01:17:36
those layers, words you said about yourself, the more you feel what was the things you 
01:17:42
don't like, it's not going to change. 
01:17:45
It can't change because what are you feeding your soul? 
01:17:49
You're feeding negative things that you don't like about yourself. 
01:17:52
You don't like how you live. 
01:17:53
You don't like the way you look. 
01:17:54
You don't like what's happening to you. 
01:17:57
That's why that can't be changed. 
01:18:00
If you don't like who you are, stop saying the things about you you don't like and say, 
01:18:06
this may not be perfect when I look in the mirror, but God is going to perfect it. 
01:18:10
And I'm going to love the way I look, however way he wants me to look. 
01:18:14
I'm going to love what he does with me. 
01:18:16
I'm going to love what he says to me. 
01:18:18
My souls begin to prosper this day because I'm no longer beating it up. 
01:18:22
And I won't listen to people that beat it up because the other reason why you can't 
01:18:26
prosper is everyone around you saying negative things to you. 
01:18:29
You were just made that way. 
01:18:30
That's just the way. 
01:18:31
That's your destiny. 
01:18:32
You can't change that. 
01:18:33
You lose those words out of you. 
01:18:35
You cannot keep them in your soul. 
01:18:37
Not even words you said. 
01:18:38
You cannot keep them in your soul because that's what you will become. 
01:18:43
You will become what you were saying you think you are. 
01:18:48
And I have done this with so many people. 
01:18:50
It's almost not ridiculous, but it happens the same way every time. 
01:18:55
You have to say, I repeat for saying all those negative words about me. 
01:18:59
I lose everywhere those words from my soul, from my mind, my will, my emotions. 
01:19:03
I will not allow them to remain in Jesus' name. 
01:19:06
And then you say, I choose my will to like myself. 
01:19:11
I choose with my will to be blessed and to bless God for making me this way. 
01:19:15
I choose my will to be excited for whatever he has for me. 
01:19:20
You are then feeding power to your soul to change, causing your own soul. 
01:19:28
You don't need a whole world out there to do it. 
01:19:30
You don't even need a profit to do it. 
01:19:32
You watch over your own soul. 
01:19:35
You are the keeper and watcher of your own soul. 
01:19:37
You are. 
01:19:38
And the way you talk and the way you think, the things you choose to go watch. 
01:19:43
What are you watching? 
01:19:44
You watching murders? 
01:19:45
Are you watching things that are horrible? 
01:19:47
Are you watching profanity? 
01:19:49
Are you watching witchcraft? 
01:19:50
Because guess what? 
01:19:51
You're feeding your soul. 
01:19:52
You're feeding your soul profanity, witchcraft, and violence. 
01:19:55
Do you think that your soul is going to prosper? 
01:19:59
You need to take a whole, you need to look at a soul checkup, you need a soul checkup 
01:20:03
people. 
01:20:04
You need to see, what am I watching on a regular basis? 
01:20:06
What words are coming out of my mouth, okay? 
01:20:09
What have I looked at? 
01:20:10
What have I read? 
01:20:11
Is it negative? 
01:20:12
Is it bad? 
01:20:13
Is it wicked? 
01:20:14
Get rid of it, people. 
01:20:16
Because if you want your soul to prosper, and then you will prosper and live in health, 
01:20:21
you better be. 
01:20:22
That's what it says to guard it. 
01:20:23
You're guarding it. 
01:20:25
You don't let garbage in, and you don't put garbage out. 
01:20:28
Garbage comes out of your mouth, it goes in your own soul. 
01:20:31
Every time you blast someone, that goes in your own soul. 
01:20:34
You can't stop it. 
01:20:35
It's just the way we remain. 
01:20:37
Your soul, and what you put in it is what you will become, and no one on this earth is 
01:20:44
going to change that. 
01:20:45
You can change who you are. 
01:20:49
If you don't like the way you look, if you don't like the way of what's happening, if 
01:20:52
you're upset about everything else, you're feeding your soul those words. 
01:20:56
If you want that soul to begin to prosper and the light of God to grow in it, and you actually 
01:21:00
get happy, then start saying positive things. 
01:21:03
I'm not talking about positive, I'm thinking, you really be positive about things. 
01:21:08
Maybe you had a friend that you liked, but they always end up by saying something nasty 
01:21:11
to you. 
01:21:12
I lost all those words that were spoken against me, that were nasty, that were harmful, that 
01:21:16
were bashing. 
01:21:17
I lost everyone, no matter where they came from. 
01:21:19
If I listened to it or somebody said it, I lost everyone in the mind of your soul, Jesus 
01:21:23
comes and goes, and it's like they were never there. 
01:21:27
Yes, they're going to start to feel different. 
01:21:30
Then you begin to thank God. 
01:21:31
I thank you, God, for my life. 
01:21:33
I thank you for letting me be born this time. 
01:21:35
Thank you for letting me be great for you. 
01:21:37
Thank you for bringing happiness to me. 
01:21:40
Show me, Holy Spirit, what to say, and when to say it. 
01:21:44
I give you permission to remind me to say things that are positive. 
01:21:51
Then you are on the road for your soul to actually prosper. 
01:21:55
God can give you more, do more with you, and use you more, because He wants you to go up 
01:22:02
to a person, they go, oh, this is horrible, what's going on today. 
01:22:05
Now, these are not my own words. 
01:22:07
It's bad. 
01:22:08
Do you think that we're all going to go down a hole somewhere? 
01:22:10
Do you think I'd walk away in the store if someone said that to me? 
01:22:13
There is no way that's happening, because I'm not keeping their words in my soul. 
01:22:17
I say, well, let me explain to you something. 
01:22:19
There is a God, and He's alive, and I know Him. 
01:22:21
He's got great plans for this service, and this wicked stuff you see going on is all 
01:22:24
being exposed. 
01:22:25
He's going to move His hand, things are going to be going to happen, and you're going to 
01:22:29
be so happy with your life. 
01:22:31
So stop saying the words you just said. 
01:22:33
If I were right in front of Him, I choose to lose all the negative words, I plant positive 
01:22:38
words. 
01:22:39
I believe in the life of God, the presence of God. 
01:22:41
I know He's got great plans for us. 
01:22:43
I know these are powerful days coming on the earth, and they're watching you in the grocery 
01:22:47
store. 
01:22:48
That's good. 
01:22:51
Man, that felt good. 
01:22:55
That was so strong. 
01:22:56
Do you really believe that I said yes, and why don't you? 
01:22:59
I don't just listen to this negative garbage. 
01:23:06
It comes from hell, and sometimes I'll go, the words you just spoke, hell told you those 
01:23:11
words. 
01:23:12
If you're feeling bad, you don't like yourself, you're believing those words, and if you get 
01:23:16
stronger, you're actually repeating those words. 
01:23:19
So stop marketing hell. 
01:23:20
Why not market heaven? 
01:23:22
And that is my... 
01:23:23
Oh, God. 
01:23:24
Well, you know, this is one of those episodes that people, including myself, need to listen 
01:23:31
to more than once, two or three times. 
01:23:33
There's so much meat. 
01:23:35
You can bring hope in your day-to-day life, no matter where you go or who you see. 
01:23:40
You can bring hope by saying what is truth, and God does care, and He is doing something. 
01:23:46
You may not see enough, but you're going to see this happen, and I'll even tell people, 
01:23:50
you remember this day, when I told you things would be changed and they would be great, 
01:23:55
and you will be celebrating in the street when God brings in what He's doing this time, 
01:24:00
because He has judged the evil, and then I'll walk away, say something, people, say something 
01:24:09
that brings hope in life to people. 
01:24:11
They hear enough death and garbage everywhere. 
01:24:15
It's so good, so good, so, so, so, so good. 
01:24:18
Well, can't talk about revealing heaven.com and your other website before we close. 
01:24:23
Yeah, I do have two websites. 
01:24:26
I really didn't name either one of them, but you know, the father tells me what to say, 
01:24:30
and I always obey. 
01:24:31
He named my book, Revealing Heaven, so we made our first website, revealingheaven.com, 
01:24:37
and we have a lot of products there. 
01:24:39
We actually got some new things in already that will be taken with us to Nebraska. 
01:24:43
I'm excited about it. 
01:24:44
We have some new things that represent heaven, and that's another part of my job to reveal 
01:24:49
and create heaven on this earth, so that's what you find, revealingheaven.com, and catcur.com. 
01:24:55
That is a spiritual platform that doesn't listen to any negative or evil or wickedness. 
01:25:01
It gives you all kinds of revelation in there. 
01:25:05
We have videos you can watch. 
01:25:07
You can see interviews done by people who ask me certain questions that are really great. 
01:25:12
We have a gallery of things what they look like in the spirit realm, like I think you 
01:25:17
can see what an aquamanchen looks like that I saw in heaven. 
01:25:20
You can see how even in the transportation looks like in the spirit realm. 
01:25:25
You ride on beams of light, travel on paths of light. 
01:25:28
That's what Christ did when he stepped into the spirit realm and walked through the bodies 
01:25:33
of the people. 
01:25:34
When they were going to throw him off that cliff, he said he passed through the people. 
01:25:41
He didn't say he passed around. 
01:25:43
He took one little sidestep into the spirit realm, spirit realm supersedes this physical 
01:25:48
realm, and he passed right through the people and they never saw him. 
01:25:52
You see kinds of things like that in there. 
01:25:56
There's also all kinds of decorations and things that can train you to let you know 
01:25:59
things in a greater way. 
01:26:01
There's testimonies on catcur.com, and it's the only way to give to me online. 
01:26:08
No other person's Facebook or whatever is out there. 
01:26:12
I don't ask people to give me money in any of the videos, not on YouTube or Facebook. 
01:26:17
I'm not going to do that, but people will take my stuff. 
01:26:20
They say, well, you need to give money to this missionary camp. 
01:26:23
That's not going to be great to the pocketbook people. 
01:26:26
Other people asking me to get your money, and I'm not doing it. 
01:26:30
You have to ask to go to catcur.com, click on the treasury if you want to be a part of 
01:26:35
helping to support Heaven's plan to bring Heaven to Earth. 
01:26:39
So good. 
01:26:40
Cat, we love you. 
01:26:41
Love you. 
01:26:42
Love you. 
01:26:43
Thank you so much. 
01:26:44
Would you go ahead and pray for the people as we close out? 
01:26:47
I know you've got great declarations, so go for it. 
01:26:52
Yeah, Father, I thank you for this day, this glorious, beautiful day that you have made. 
01:26:57
A day for things to be great for us on the earth. 
01:27:00
A day for us to know you more, to hear you clear, Father. 
01:27:04
This is a wonderful day, and you have purposed this day. 
01:27:08
Satan doesn't own this day. 
01:27:09
His people don't own this day, even the person sitting in the highest seat of the land. 
01:27:14
That's stolen. 
01:27:15
But Father, we know what's going to happen to those people, and I thank you for your 
01:27:18
plan for all of that to happen. 
01:27:20
But right now, Father, I just impart the life of God, the presence of God, His will, His 
01:27:27
way. 
01:27:28
I evict all evil, every evil spirit. 
01:27:31
Get out of everyone listening to this broadcast right now in Jesus' name. 
01:27:36
I thank you for showing us how to rule and reign with Christ's Son, who actually the 
01:27:40
entire earth belongs to. 
01:27:43
If I serve, I will not serve another. 
01:27:46
There's nothing darkness in me. 
01:27:47
There's no evil in me. 
01:27:48
There's light, there's love, there's the power of the living God. 
01:27:51
Thank you, Father, for showing them and giving them a taste of you so they will run after 
01:27:58
you. 
01:28:00
Your Son died on that cross because you asked Him to pay a price, and He did. 
01:28:06
Our lives for all eternity will be great. 
01:28:08
They will be excited. 
01:28:09
There will be so many amazing things to do with you, and I'm looking forward to eternity. 
01:28:15
Right now, I'm on this earth, and I'm not going anywhere until you say I go. 
01:28:20
Father, I hope they know you that well, and can think of you that powerfully, that they 
01:28:27
know who they are in Christ. 
01:28:29
Christ in you is the hope of glory, and God is powerful. 
01:28:36
He's represented with the light of God, and the power of God, and it will cover this earth 
01:28:41
like the waters cover the sea one day. 
01:28:44
I hope you're carrying it. 
01:28:46
In Jesus' name I pray, amen. 
01:28:49
Amen. 
01:28:50
Amen. 
01:28:51
Amen. 
01:28:52
Amen. 
01:28:53
Thank you so much, Cat. 
01:28:54
You are a dear friend, and you and I just become better friends all the time. 
01:28:58
I appreciate you very much. 
01:29:01
I'd say keep the faith that you already are. 
01:29:04
I got it. 
01:29:06
So God bless you. 
01:29:08
Give our love to your staff. 
01:29:11
To the rest of you, we will see you again tomorrow at 11 a.m. of Pacific Standard Time. 
01:29:16
See you all later. 
01:29:17
How dreamy said we love her too. 
01:29:19
We sure will. 
01:29:20
Bye-bye.

01:30
happy Wednesday everyone August 31 2022 our apologies were much later than normal 
01:39
but we will recover it'll be so good it'll be worth worth the way pardon I still have a cough I got 
01:44
one cough drop left right here well we may do that I don't know how this cough comes and goes but 
01:49
it does but anyway I wanted to say to the group to the to our viewers as you many of you know we're 
01:55
off of YouTube right now we got notified either this morning or last night whenever whatever that 
02:02
happened so they decided one of our guests said something and that's strike two and and the notice 
02:10
I looked at today said one more strike and you're removed from the channel so we're trying not to 
02:15
do that but anyway we're not on YouTube today and I think I heard that it will be two weeks someone 
02:19
can mention that in my chat if it if it's two weeks but anyway we're off right now we're going to 
02:27
and yes it's two weeks at least it says so we will be emailing you daily to let you know that 
02:33
we're reminding you that we're not on YouTube so please please forward or text or email as many 
02:42
of your friends as you can and say they're here but they're on rumble only because of all of this 
02:48
junk that's going on you say it in those words or any other words but we are continuing to be 
02:56
flexible and flow with what happens so that if this goes down we have that right now we are on 
03:04
rumble we are on Facebook and we're on Elijah list calm so we try to be careful we're talking code 
03:12
today we don't have to be careful at all because we're not on YouTube so they're gonna probably 
03:19
in my personal opinion people will never forget all the times they were kicked off I doubt that 
03:24
YouTube will last but I'm not saying that as a prophetic voice but you know we're all looking 
03:30
for alternatives you know maybe when this gets over and they got new leadership maybe it won't 
03:35
matter anymore so all right let's show I want to to keep before you new ads that we're developing 
03:44
that shows the the wells the freshwater wells we're digging in Uganda we're over 50 freshwater wells 
03:51
we're digging a new freshwater well every five days there's been 300 salvations at last report 
03:57
which means there's more now and there've been eight church plants so this is because of your 
04:02
generous generous generous donations and as I've said before a significant portion of what you 
04:09
donate to this ministry not only keeps us going but we feel called by the Lord to to tide if you 
04:16
will that money into many freshwater wells it's a lot more than a tithe but God has blessed us 
04:23
for doing that so we've got a quick promo on that so without further delay let's go ahead and play 
04:29
that Emily 
04:59
you 
05:59
Thank you again so much for your donations to support this, these wells. 
06:08
The Lord thanks you. 
06:09
I can say by the Spirit, the Lord is thanking you. 
06:13
Great rewards, he says in the scriptures, even if you give so much as a simple cup of 
06:18
cold water to one of these, you will surely not lose your reward. 
06:22
So that's what the Lord said, not us. 
06:25
So thank you for doing that. 
06:28
I truly believe that the Lord has shown me that when you get to heaven one day, when 
06:32
it's your time to go, there will be little children, maybe hundreds of them will come 
06:37
up to you and say, thank you because of you. 
06:40
We had fresh water and because of fresh water, I received the Lord. 
06:43
So thank you. 
06:44
So that's an amazing thing. 
06:45
We really, really, really appreciate your giving. 
06:48
So thank you so much. 
06:50
We are in an intense time. 
06:52
We have about eight weeks, nine weeks maybe for the election. 
06:58
There are, this is not prophetic, but there are some people that say, are we even going 
07:02
to have an election because things are getting intense? 
07:05
I believe, I hope there will be an election if there is and when there is, be sure that 
07:10
you overwhelm the system by voting, but many of you, more of you voting than they expect 
07:17
to vote. 
07:18
You need to overwhelm the system because they can't recover from that. 
07:21
Greg Phillips was, of 2000 mules was on and last week or the week before and said, that's 
07:28
the way to do it. 
07:29
You got to overwhelm the system. 
07:30
So anyway, between now and then make sure the deep state is going to try and prevent 
07:36
this election. 
07:37
We know that that's what they want to do because they know they're going to lose if we get, 
07:40
if the election goes through, be sure your gas is full, keep your tank topped off, keep 
07:46
your groceries of non perishables. 
07:49
Don't just fill up your refrigerator because what if the power goes out? 
07:52
So make sure you have non perishable, we even have powdered milk sitting in there and canned 
07:57
goods and cereal non perishable things that you can open the can and make sure you have 
08:03
a can opener too. 
08:04
Because a lot of people have those electric can openers, which may or may not work if 
08:08
they do something serious. 
08:09
I'm not prophesying that I'm just saying make sure your pantry is as full as you're able 
08:14
to do it and extra for others if you're able to do that. 
08:17
So I just wanted to tell you that we are, these are not going to be a normal eight weeks 
08:22
between now and then the deep state does not like you and me and believers and conservatives. 
08:30
In fact, they, you've heard several of our guests say they basically want something like 
08:35
nine out of 10 or they want to bring the population down to 500 million, which is, which is the 
08:42
population is what that's what the population. 
08:45
I looked up what was the population at the time of Christ coincidentally it was 500 million. 
08:50
That's what they want to bring 7.5 billion down to is 500 million, which is, which means 
08:56
that it's their desire and we've said this on the air. 
08:58
This is not some shocking new thing. 
09:00
It's their desire to depopulate the earth now they're not going to succeed. 
09:05
We're going to bring Patricia Katker sorry on in just a moment and she has seen into 
09:11
the future. 
09:12
They are not going to succeed at that. 
09:14
And so we want you to know that, but we do know that they're going to want to try. 
09:18
So make sure your gas is full and you're in your pantries just full as you're able to 
09:22
do it. 
09:23
You have extra water, anything that you think you might need. 
09:26
If you can't go to the store for two weeks or three weeks, have it have a good supply 
09:32
there. 
09:33
All right. 
09:34
I think that's all for today. 
09:37
Thank you again for your support and let's bring in Katker. 
09:40
So it's Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. 
09:42
So here we go. 
10:00
Well good morning Kat or I guess you should say it for you. 
10:03
It's good afternoon in it back into Florida, right? 
10:06
Yes I am in Florida and I guess it's afternoon. 
10:12
One said that your clock was off today or something. 
10:15
It was all three of the clocks and it's not my job to replace batteries. 
10:21
Okay. 
10:22
I do sweep and clean the floors and clean up stuff and I mean, I do do that kind of thing 
10:26
a lot, but I don't put batteries in the clock. 
10:29
So none of them were right and they were one was an hour and a half off home was an hour 
10:34
off and one was like two hours late. 
10:37
And so none of them helped me and I have something to say and so yeah, go for it. 
10:46
Go for it Kat. 
10:48
The father wants you to know that you should fear never, not ever, never in this day. 
10:53
He didn't give anyone a spirit of fear in case you wonder if you have fear that's not 
10:58
from him. 
10:59
So there's number one point number one if you're in fear, I'm not saying maybe you're 
11:03
a little concerned about things, I'm thinking if you're in real fear, that is not God. 
11:07
God's not putting fear in you. 
11:09
He's not going to say fearful things to you. 
11:11
He made you powerful. 
11:12
Right. 
11:13
He gave us a spirit of a sound mind. 
11:17
Remember that right power, love and a second gave it to us. 
11:20
That's what he put in you when he made you. 
11:22
So therefore he told me to take authority over. 
11:24
So right now father take authority over all fear, no matter who's experiencing it, no 
11:29
matter where it is in this world. 
11:31
I cancel you, I evict you from everybody's home, from their soul in Jesus name and I impart 
11:38
the life of God, the love of God, the power of God, the will, his way in Jesus name, celebration, 
11:47
expectation of what you're going to do father, not what the devil has planned, who's the 
11:53
Lord of the Flies by the way, just remember that Jesus Lord of hosts, Saint Lord of Flies 
11:58
says about all the wills that he has, so we thank you this day father that fear is evicted, 
12:03
joy and celebration, which is what you talk about, it's okay to be practical, but don't 
12:09
ever let fear interfere in your life in Jesus name, amen, amen, amen, and don't take all 
12:17
the toilet paper, don't take all the toilet paper, I've been, I've been collecting it. 
12:23
We've been collecting it for a few months on, I mean, we have that much, but you know, 
12:28
we collect it while they had plenty, because I don't want to run on the TP. 
12:32
Yeah, it was a good plan, collect it while there's plenty. 
12:35
Isn't it amazing, what did we do in this world on the earth before we had toilet paper? 
12:41
You know, it wasn't that many years ago they invented that, they actually invented toilet 
12:45
paper. 
12:46
I don't want to think about it. 
12:48
Paul Harvey had a story where there was this train full of certain, it wasn't cut up, it 
12:56
was rolls or something, and it didn't make its destination, something went wrong, or 
13:00
the guy went bankrupt or something, and someone had the idea to cut these up into smaller 
13:06
rolls or something like that, and it became toilet paper, he said, let's make it toilet, 
13:11
yeah, it was something like that. 
13:12
I've tried to find that article or that audio by Paul Harvey, because you know, no one told 
13:18
the story like Paul Harvey, you know, and he goes, and now you know the rest of the 
13:24
story, you know, yes, and putting it into everybody will know the rest of the story. 
13:29
Yeah. 
13:30
Yeah. 
13:31
Now you don't see Kat, we know that the deep state hates us. 
13:36
We know that they don't, that they would like to depopulate, but what has God showed 
13:41
you is going to actually happen? 
13:44
There will be no gross massacres, there will be no mass killings or dying, nodded on this 
13:53
time. 
13:54
God sent, if you think about from the Father's point of view, he sent people to the earth 
13:59
that he needs here right now, he needs this many people, all the ones who are here now, 
14:03
he sent here specifically, he timed your birth on the earth, he needs you, and in these days 
14:09
coming months and years coming, there will be so much activity for the body of Christ 
14:14
to do, even good moral people to do, new inventions, he's still sending them people, so if it 
14:21
wouldn't be half wiped out, that wouldn't be possible, which is why, by the way, I want 
14:25
to say something, it isn't that they hate us people, it's that they're very afraid of 
14:32
us. 
14:33
Oh, wow. 
14:34
Quite a small correction in there, the Father says, Satan doesn't hate you, he is afraid 
14:40
of you. 
14:41
Wow. 
14:42
Wow. 
14:43
Satan is the doormat, we are not a doormat, we were given power and authority, he was 
14:49
not given power and authority. 
14:51
We have legions of angels, more of the hosts ever than there is a demonic, they fire out 
14:59
number them, they're bigger than them, and they're ready to do things in this time on 
15:04
our behalf, so more than ever before the activity, what you will see is activity of the host 
15:09
of heaven in this world, individually doing things for people, even in groups of people, 
15:15
you'll see a risk is being done that would not have happened in any other way, God is 
15:19
about to show off his power, Satan will not get his chance, now you need to understand 
15:25
God has a timeline, I've seen the timeline, we're not near the end, we're near the end 
15:33
of the way we will be operating because we'll be in authority, in power, we'll have the 
15:37
great positions, we'll have the inventions, that's what is planned for our lives by the 
15:41
one who made you, not the one who would like to wipe you out, the reason why he wants to 
15:46
kill, steal all of your stories, he's afraid, he knows this is not his time people, he knows 
15:53
he's trying to make a rush to take it early, and guess what, do you think the God of all 
15:58
creation is going to let the Lord of the Flies take over right now? 
16:03
I think he's about to get a lot of insect bites himself, let me tell you right now, 
16:09
what is going to happen is God's plan, not even man's plan, not wicked man's plan, not 
16:15
hell's plan, okay, I don't care what their plan is, it always fails, so don't let fear 
16:21
be the one thing that controls you, because Satan's really good at that, he knows how 
16:26
to use fear, if he can get you to think about all the negative all the time, then you probably 
16:31
will dwell on that, you're not supposed to, he's supposed to walk in power and authority, 
16:34
he's supposed to rule with Jesus Christ, I haven't seen that openly happening in many 
16:39
places, but it's going to be, to the point the Father said, that the world will want 
16:46
you as a friend or to know you because you're a believer, that is how different it's going 
16:51
to be if you want to see your future, that's your future, not running around afraid you'll 
16:56
starve to death, Satan's wicked armies will come to get you and drag you away, that is 
17:02
not, this is not the end, this is not the time of the perilous times, this is not the 
17:07
tribulation people, it's hundreds of years away, and I don't mind saying that because 
17:12
guess what, I'll still be here saying that and you'll be enjoying heaven, so you need 
17:16
to understand, you say God's will, God's way, God's will not mine, but his, because when 
17:24
you live his will his way, you'll have celebration, anticipation, expectation of greatness in 
17:31
you, you were sent here to be great, not to watch the parade go by, we're supposed to 
17:39
be leaders, we're supposed to be the ones people look up to for answers from heaven, 
17:45
and man's mindset and man's head knowledge cannot come up or equal revelation from the 
17:51
one who made us, he knows every thought of everybody, he knows where every wicked person 
17:57
is, every evil camp, every hidden thing, there's nothing hidden from him, but he's 
18:02
going to expose all of it, and then justice is coming, he is not changing what he's saying, 
18:08
if you're tired of listening, don't listen, go sit with the Lord of the Flies and get 
18:13
a big fly swatter. 
18:14
Cap, do you still believe that while the deep state, especially these last few weeks before 
18:20
the election, I'm probably going to try a lot of things, do you still believe we need 
18:23
to get our popcorn out and our cake out and enjoy the show, is this a time to enjoy the 
18:29
show? 
18:30
You know I'm still enjoying the show, I will live the way the Father talks to me about, 
18:36
you have a choice, I'm not going to make you take what he says, but it's so easy and simple 
18:41
to take what you see with your human eyes, when you don't have just human eyes and you 
18:47
see the spirit realm, you understand, they are scrambling, to hang on to anything they 
18:52
can hang on to, and that would be the spiritual wickedness and the physical wickedness. 
18:59
They know, some of them already know, this whole thing is going to fail, they know it's 
19:03
going to fail. 
19:04
They're not saying that to their own groups, but they're very afraid, because it hasn't 
19:09
turned out the way they planned, because this is, this earth is the Lord and the fullness 
19:14
thereof, it's His. 
19:17
He gets to say what happens, we need to agree with Him. 
19:21
I'm not ignoring evil, I just don't participate in it, and when you continually repeat all 
19:29
of the stuff going on, I'm saying all day long, someone says what do you think about 
19:33
what's going on, you should say I think God has a plan, I think He's in charge and I'm 
19:37
on His side, because when you keep repeating what the devil wants you to repeat, you're 
19:42
marketing health plans, make you afraid, make you weak, strip the hope away from you, the 
19:49
joy away from you, you don't want to lose your joy, that's why the celebrate thing comes 
19:54
in. 
19:55
I can tell you I'm sure that Noah, it's a good thing none of you are Noah, you wouldn't 
20:00
have never lasted 120 years and this thing won't take 120 years, but who won in the end? 
20:07
I can tell you this, the Father has a plan for you, not just your children, your grandchildren, 
20:13
your great great great great great great great great grandchildren, He has a plan for you 
20:17
if you're alive and breathing, He has a plan for you, and that is to market what heaven 
20:23
is, be a testimony of what heaven is, demonstrate the power of the living God in this earth, 
20:31
not waiting for months to go by, you have authority right now, open your front door, 
20:38
kick out the devil, kick out every word, sound, image, thought, frequency of hell, if you've 
20:43
been watching the fake news, there's no wonder you're having issues, why not make news for 
20:50
God and say what He's doing in this world, setting it up for the greatest days this world 
20:56
will ever see until Christ sits on the throne and Jerusalem and yes, He is going to do that 
21:01
one day. 
21:03
There are people whose families and friends, close family and friends are really on their 
21:09
case, I have a few of those myself. 
21:13
Mine gave up. 
21:14
They gave up. 
21:15
Okay, I was going to ask you about that, so how do I ask this question? 
21:21
Is God going to in a sense vindicate, you know, vengeance is mine and all that, we don't 
21:26
want vengeance on our loved ones and family, but justice comes and redemption comes, is 
21:31
God going to redeem, vindicate whatever word we might choose, those who have held strong 
21:39
towards. 
21:40
I will say what is word, it's in power. 
21:42
Okay. 
21:43
He's going to empower those with authority and dominion who have stood and not stepped 
21:50
back. 
21:51
They will be some of the greatest leaders in this world, people will look up to them 
21:55
because they'll know all the time, don't stop saying what God has said, you don't stop 
21:59
saying it, because He is looking to see who's saying and what they're saying. 
22:04
Okay, He doesn't have to convince me to do it. 
22:07
I've seen Him in person and heard Him in person and I've seen the future. 
22:11
I know what the future is going to be, regardless of what the devil's trying to do, he's trying 
22:15
to do his great big takeover right now. 
22:18
He already knows it's going to fail, but he's going to take as many as he can get and he 
22:22
does that by crushing your dreams, by stealing your destiny. 
22:26
Your destiny is still waiting for you. 
22:31
You have to say yes to that, no to the devil, open your front door and he did anything of 
22:36
hell out or wicked man evicted out of your home, make a habitation for heaven and heaven 
22:41
in the presence of God will flood your home all the time. 
22:45
You have a choice, you have a choice, you can follow the Lord of Hosts or Lord of the 
22:51
Flies. 
22:52
By the way, you really mean that, of course the devil can be evicted through your walls, 
22:57
but you really mean open your door and let him out. 
22:59
If you mean that. 
23:02
That way if people come in and told you all the bad stuff going on or they have predicted, 
23:07
I won't even call it, I won't even say that they prophesied it. 
23:11
A true prophecy comes from God, not man's mind, by the way. 
23:16
It's words God spoke. 
23:17
He spoke them. 
23:19
He spoke them to somebody and said, you say this, you will say this. 
23:22
He's not going to tell somebody to say something that's against what he's been saying. 
23:28
Something that's fear getting in, they let control get in, like you said, have talked 
23:33
about Steve, people trying to pressure you. 
23:35
No one does that to me now because they know what they're going to get. 
23:39
Hands laid out on them. 
23:40
That's what they're going to get. 
23:41
Maybe not in the way they want to. 
23:42
But I will tell you this, I'm not backing up. 
23:45
I'm not backing up one single word that the Father has told me to say. 
23:49
One single thing I have been shown, guess what's going to happen? 
23:53
What God wants. 
23:55
What His plan is and what people don't see because they don't really know Him like they 
24:01
should know Him. 
24:02
They can know Him. 
24:03
Let's change it. 
24:04
They can know Him. 
24:05
The more you know Him, you understand how He works. 
24:08
He is mysterious. 
24:09
He's never going to do it man's way. 
24:10
He doesn't necessarily have to make you understand. 
24:12
He just says, this is going to happen and then He does it. 
24:15
That's good. 
24:16
That's good. 
24:17
The gospel of the Prophet is different than just the prophetic. 
24:20
I love the prophetic that people can see and hear and say things. 
24:23
It's an office, it's a place you sit in and you have authority in. 
24:29
So I cannot say what man is saying. 
24:31
I cannot agree with what they're saying. 
24:33
I'm not going to agree if it's against what God has said because in the end, Steve, who 
24:38
do you think will be celebrating the most? 
24:40
Oh yeah. 
24:41
Oh yeah. 
24:42
I think you know John- 
24:43
Well, I guess what everyone else will be celebrating right along with them and they 
24:47
will enjoy the victory that's about to happen for us. 
24:49
I have no problem keeping some extra graham crackers in your closet if you want it. 
24:55
That's perfectly fine to do that and this day and age, it might not be a bad idea to 
24:58
have a few extra things around, but I do know God's not going to let anybody starve or die 
25:03
from starvation. 
25:04
He's not going to allow that. 
25:05
Okay. 
25:06
Johnny Enlo says a thing. 
25:07
He said it many, many times, so it's not one off thing, but he said it for a couple 
25:12
years now. 
25:13
He said, God had told him we are about to be safe from things we don't even know we 
25:18
need to be saved from. 
25:20
Is that a perspective you have? 
25:22
In other words, there's things that if we knew how horrific it was that God was about 
25:27
to save us from, maybe we'd even look at things differently. 
25:31
What are your thoughts about that? 
25:32
I know some of those things. 
25:34
Okay. 
25:35
Things it's hard to even say. 
25:36
But the key word is this, saved from them. 
25:39
Yeah, exactly. 
25:40
So God's plan is not to wipe us all out when he has built generations on purpose, generations 
25:49
like I'm seventh generation of really God doing things the way he wants to. 
25:54
He's been building generations with people who believe and will believe what he says. 
25:59
He's been building them. 
26:00
He's not going to, why wouldn't he let them be wiped out Steve, that doesn't even, that 
26:03
doesn't make sense. 
26:04
Okay. 
26:05
Right. 
26:06
Exactly. 
26:07
He's not going to do it. 
26:08
He's not going to get wiped out, this will not be a communist country, no matter what 
26:11
they say. 
26:13
They don't rule this country. 
26:15
No one sitting in the left or the hidden or the evil or the wicked or the White House 
26:21
or the Pentagon, anywhere else, they don't rule this country. 
26:25
We the people are in charge of this country and we will have what we say will happen. 
26:32
We will have it. 
26:33
I'm not talking about the darkness. 
26:35
What we say, justice, liberty and freedom, that is who we are, right in this moment that 
26:41
you're breathing, you're still free. 
26:44
God's not going to let that all be taken away from us, no matter how many lies they put 
26:48
out, no matter how many pictures they show people and they've not created one good thing. 
26:54
Don't expect them to do it. 
26:56
Don't expect them not to try to steal, cheat and lie again, but it won't help them at all 
27:03
because God is going to do what he's going to do and they will be brought to justice. 
27:07
I will not stop saying that. 
27:09
I will not stop saying that because that is what is going to happen. 
27:13
I trust him. 
27:15
If you know how important it was to trust God, when you begin to trust him, you begin 
27:18
to actually believe him. 
27:20
When you begin to believe him this season, you will step into a level of faith you never 
27:24
thought you could have. 
27:25
Wow. 
27:26
And after that, you are given a spirit of faith, a high level of faith and no one will 
27:32
be able to convince you that what God has said won't happen. 
27:36
They won't be able to. 
27:37
There's no way they can because you're living and walking in the spirit and not in your 
27:43
flesh head thinking and assuming and expecting what man has said will happen. 
27:50
They're wrong. 
27:52
If someone is afraid and they're struggling and they're having a hard time believing that 
27:58
and you said, if you will believe God, does that, in order to get there, does someone 
28:05
say, I don't feel it. 
28:08
It's hard to see it, but as an act of my will, I choose to believe. 
28:12
Is that how they do that? 
28:13
Absolutely. 
28:14
Because you know what you put in your soul is what you are. 
28:18
As a man thinking in his heart, your soul is at the heart or core of your being. 
28:23
It is a position. 
28:24
When he talks about the heart, he's not talking about this human beating heart, which side 
28:29
is that? 
28:30
I don't know. 
28:31
Whatever side is tongue beating. 
28:32
He isn't talking about your flesh heart when he says, as a man think it in his heart. 
28:37
He's talking about a position, very core heart of your being is your soul. 
28:44
Your soul is in the center of your being. 
28:46
Your mind, your will and your emotions, you know, that's what the devil is going after. 
28:51
Because even if he doesn't really have to do anything except control that, control what 
28:55
you believe, control what you say, control what you watch, control where you go. 
29:00
That's what he wants to do. 
29:02
We let him do it. 
29:03
Well, I stopped doing that a long time ago. 
29:05
Okay. 
29:06
I'm letting the spirit of God share with me and show me and encourage me. 
29:11
It says encourage one another. 
29:13
So if you keep sharing what the left is doing or planning or their absolute stupidity of 
29:19
who they think they are, they can't run at McDonald's, let alone this country. 
29:26
They don't know anything. 
29:27
They only know what Satan is putting in their soul, what wicked, evil people above them 
29:32
who are there controlling and some of them are about to die. 
29:35
So just get ready for that. 
29:36
Yeah. 
29:37
Wait a minute. 
29:38
Some are about to die. 
29:40
Yeah. 
29:41
Okay. 
29:42
So you did repeat it. 
29:43
So who are the some that are about to die? 
29:46
Just to be clear. 
29:47
Because you said it. 
29:48
Okay. 
29:50
This is like an Ananias and Sapphira time is what you're saying some is and I think a 
29:55
lot of order crossed over the line of living or dying. 
29:58
It's too late for them. 
29:59
What about what, because we, you know, when we think of Ananias and Sapphira, because 
30:04
I'm the one that use that, we think of people in the body of Christ. 
30:07
Are there people in the body of Christ who are about to leave this earth because they 
30:12
have chosen to not walk with them? 
30:15
I do know some are leaving the earth because their time is over. 
30:18
Okay. 
30:19
So don't confuse that. 
30:20
Yeah. 
30:21
You know, a great leader of God who died, I was not talking about, I said the wicked, 
30:25
evil people. 
30:26
Okay. 
30:27
The wicked evil who are trying to control all this stuff. 
30:30
Some of them. 
30:31
Okay. 
30:32
You may not even know who they are, but you will find out. 
30:35
You may not know who they are. 
30:36
Some of them are about to die. 
30:39
Yeah. 
30:40
I saw on the news. 
30:43
By the way, I could recommend this, there's a site called Citizen Free Press. 
30:48
It's kind of like a new dredge. 
30:49
It's conservative. 
30:50
And on that same day, I think it was yesterday, it could have been the day before, but I think 
30:54
it was yesterday, two different celebrities at the age of 32 suddenly died. 
30:59
Now, someone could say, well, that was the Vax, I don't know, but God is in control 
31:05
of life and death. 
31:06
And it was weird on the exact same day. 
31:09
And we don't know by looking at that, was it the Vax? 
31:12
Did they, uh, did they cross the red line with God? 
31:17
You know, you know, I don't know what to think about that kind of thing. 
31:19
I also don't want people, I don't want like believers and other people thinking maybe they 
31:23
crossed the line. 
31:26
You didn't cross the line people. 
31:27
He's talking about the wicked evil and some of them are hidden with evil who are actually 
31:32
the ones controlling. 
31:33
Cause I can tell you the ones in the White House aren't really running things. 
31:39
Not the real stuff. 
31:40
They're not really running it. 
31:41
They're being told what to say and told what to do by very wicked evil people. 
31:46
Some of those people, and that will affect them because then they won't have them telling 
31:51
them what to do. 
31:52
So you'll see a major thing happening in the White House, uh, probably confusion, probably 
31:58
a lot of confusion, more than normal confusion and other things began to like, it may even 
32:03
be quiet for a while because they, some of them won't know what to do now that the, the 
32:06
ones who thought they were going to take over everything, some of them are going to die. 
32:10
It's just going to happen. 
32:11
Like I said, I won't let them out. 
32:12
I won't allow them to remain on the earth. 
32:15
That is, those are his words. 
32:17
Some will die. 
32:18
I will not allow them to remain on the earth. 
32:19
So those are the ones that I'm talking about. 
32:21
I'm not talking about people in the body of Christ who maybe are messing around or something 
32:25
like that. 
32:26
I'm not talking about them. 
32:27
These are wicked evil people, more wicked than the ones in the White House. 
32:32
Are you in, I wanted to ask you about that. 
32:34
Cause that was interesting what you just said, cause we know that there's people in the basement 
32:38
as it were, or on the, on the earpiece as it were, or in literal, are you saying that 
32:44
the people that are giving the orders to the fake people in the White House, are you saying 
32:50
the people that are carrying out the orders are in a sense less wicked than the people 
32:56
that are giving them orders? 
32:58
I have to say that they are because they are, I know you will think that they, I'm not, 
33:05
I'm not cutting any of them slack and I'm not going to minimize any of the evil wickedness 
33:09
they did, but there are sort of what you were talking about earlier. 
33:13
There are more wicked people who may not even be in this country, but they're about to die. 
33:19
Some are going to die and it won't be expected and it will bring confusion. 
33:23
That's what happens in the enemy's camp when, and guess what? 
33:26
Satan doesn't even care if they die, he probably killed them and then he'll take them to hell 
33:30
and torture them more than anyone else is what he does. 
33:32
So you don't get anything. 
33:34
You gain no prize in hell when you're wicked and evil people, you get no prize, none. 
33:40
There's no prize in hell for anybody. 
33:43
And so if you, if that's who you're planning to be a part of or you are a part of it, you 
33:47
better get out of that really quick because it's telling you justice has already been 
33:51
sent, it's already been sent here. 
33:54
A gavel has already been stopped and no one's going to stop what God is about to do at all. 
34:02
And some of that, starting of it will be some, a couple, I'm not saying a lot, I don't expect 
34:06
50 people to die, but there will be a couple that will die that will shock people. 
34:11
Wow. 
34:12
And maybe that shock factor that it's like who would have ever thought that might be 
34:17
a clue that that's one of those that were removed. 
34:19
It probably may not be anybody you even have heard about, not generally like living here 
34:26
and doing stuff here because most of those people who are in this country are the ones 
34:31
who are allowing to be used, paid to be used, or do it because they love evil. 
34:37
There's people who are over this, I'm sure Robin knows about that, that are, that are 
34:42
even more wicked and evil than the ones who are in the White House. 
34:45
The ones in the White House don't have a lot of brain. 
34:48
I'm just being honest, okay. 
34:50
And their normal brain thinking of a normal human being who's been through the 12th grade 
34:54
wouldn't be trying to do the stuff that they're doing because you're not going to run anything. 
34:59
You're going to run the end of the ground, which by the way is what they want to happen. 
35:03
They want to run the country into the ground, people. 
35:05
If you voted for them, repent for voting for them, God's going to do anything against you. 
35:12
You thought you were doing the right thing because of the whichever side you thought 
35:16
you were on. 
35:17
I'm on God's side, people. 
35:18
That's the right amount of righteousness, righteousness, justice, liberty, and freedom. 
35:23
That's the side I'm on. 
35:25
And at this moment, it happens to be the right. 
35:28
Yeah. 
35:29
Yeah. 
35:30
It's not that the right is so righteous. 
35:31
It's not that the Republicans are that much more righteous than the Democrats as a whole, 
35:35
but there was a more correct stance against abortion to name the big one, to name the 
35:43
one. 
35:44
Well, I think also a lot of those people did want our country to succeed. 
35:47
Yeah. 
35:48
I mean, they may have attitudes and they may not always be thinking the right thing, but 
35:53
generally most of that side is not going to go ahead and go along with the evil at all. 
36:00
They don't like it. 
36:01
They don't want nothing to do with it. 
36:02
And even major businesses, not talking about, you know, the media and all that, major well-known 
36:08
businesses don't like what's happening because they don't want to lose their business. 
36:12
Right. 
36:13
They don't want to. 
36:14
And even some of those who've remained silent, are you there? 
36:16
The thing you're going to start saying, some who remain silent are about to start speaking 
36:21
up. 
36:22
And are there, have you seen is what got showing you people that were, how do I just ask the 
36:28
question that were, let's say just two years ago, hard core left and they believed everything 
36:36
that was being told to them about the Democratic and the liberal establishment, whatever, who 
36:42
God has been slowly but surely softening. 
36:46
Have you seen some of that? 
36:48
I think it's bringing clarity to their mind about their own life and future is probably 
36:52
what he's been doing. 
36:54
The Holy Spirit can speak to anybody, even if he can speak to people who aren't believers, 
36:58
it doesn't mean he'll live in them, but he certainly can say things to them. 
37:02
Good. 
37:03
And their own angels can say things to them, you know, in their mind, stuff like this, you 
37:07
need to get out of this. 
37:08
This is not going to end well. 
37:10
This is wrong. 
37:11
I think he probably says something. 
37:12
This all is wrong. 
37:13
I'm sure he says that a lot to them, but you're right, Steve. 
37:16
There are people who are secular people and they have decided to change what they're thinking 
37:22
because just themselves looking at their own situation, not really participating in anything, 
37:28
are going to start speaking against what's going on because it's horrible government. 
37:33
It's no government at all. 
37:34
Okay. 
37:35
It's just control. 
37:36
And that's what they want to do is control. 
37:38
They're not even thinking they're happy and they're on the wicked, the wicked in the White 
37:40
House. 
37:41
Let's just say that you're thinking how much money they've gotten, how much control they 
37:44
have, and they're really excited that this whole thing's paying off for them. 
37:48
What they don't know is they're sinking themselves deeper in a pit than they ever knew would 
37:53
happen because those who are controlling don't care about them. 
38:00
And when, if they ever went the way they wanted it to, they would be taken out too. 
38:05
So evil doesn't love anybody. 
38:08
They hate, they kill, steal and destroy. 
38:10
That's what their plan is. 
38:12
That's why that's what looks like it's happening in the White House is because their mind is 
38:16
so seared right now. 
38:17
They can't see what's right, but they themselves can't figure out why isn't this getting better? 
38:21
I mean, literally, as stupid as the things are that they put out there, they can't figure 
38:26
out why, why they're making that happen. 
38:28
They don't think it's them. 
38:30
And it is them because this wasn't happening until that happened. 
38:33
Yeah. 
38:34
Can't live on this. 
38:35
And some people keep saying what God said, he is at his limit, he's at his limit. 
38:40
God does have a limit, people, you remember he did things in the past when he reached, 
38:45
when he was done with the evil and the day thereof, it was dealt with severely. 
38:50
And so I would say, you know, you yourself though, what you can do is give hope to people 
38:55
anywhere in the store, what people talking about, what's going on, it's all going to 
38:59
end wrong. 
39:00
We're all going to hell in a handbasket. 
39:01
It was going to hell in a handbasket, be a big handbasket will be the wicked and evil. 
39:06
Yeah. 
39:07
And I know, I can see it, that there are people that are on that side that will call 
39:13
the wrong side, for lack of a better word, they, they hated Christians, they hated conservative 
39:18
values, they hated anti-abortion, they were pro-choice, and I see some of them watching 
39:25
right now, and they're now waking up, they're going, what have I done? 
39:30
But now look what I've done, how do I get out of this now that I've made my bed, you 
39:36
know, the expression, you've made your bed, now you've got to lie on it. 
39:39
What would you say to some of those people who are waking up and then going, what have 
39:42
I done? 
39:43
What would you say to them? 
39:44
I would say you need to repent to God. 
39:45
Okay. 
39:46
I mean, you repent to Jesus Christ, you know, if you ever belong to Him, the things that 
39:52
are going on now, they are not Him, this is not His plan, He comes to bring a life and 
39:57
life more abundantly, where do you see abundant life? 
40:00
Have you produced abundant life, are they talking about having abundant life? 
40:04
I'm talking about the government, the illegitimate government, okay? 
40:08
No, because they don't care what happens to anybody, they're going to use and control, 
40:12
use and control, until there's no more use and control, and if you have voted for them, 
40:17
or you're still siding with them, or you're helping to promote them, I would really seriously 
40:21
ask you to just repent for all the stuff you've been involved with, to lose all the evil wickedness 
40:26
out of your soul, repent to God, and tell Him you want to be with Him on His side, you 
40:30
want Jesus Christ as your savior, and joy will flood your soul, and guess what, your 
40:34
eyes will be fully open to the darkness trying to take over not just this country, but the 
40:41
whole world, and that won't happen until the perilous times come, and the perilous times, 
40:48
this is not the perilous times, I know people think it is, but it's not. 
40:51
I've seen some of the perilous times, I've seen some of the tribulation, I've seen some 
40:56
of Christ sitting on the throne in Jerusalem, I've seen part of the millennial, whether 
40:59
you like that word or not, the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ, which by the way the 
41:02
Father said, you're not going to stop that from happening either, so stop taking it 
41:05
out of the Bible. 
41:07
Let me, let me, you know, Kat, you know me, I don't ever interrupt in the middle of the 
41:11
show to, to pray, or almost never, because I've got, you know, we're, we're getting through 
41:17
it, but I feel led right now, there's people watching, and they're going, what have I done, 
41:21
I voted the wrong, I'm looking around, it's all falling apart, I voted for this, I wish 
41:26
I knew how to repent, could you pray for those people right now, because there's a bunch 
41:31
of them, and they're going, all I just, just need is someone pray and tell me how to get 
41:36
out of this. 
41:37
Yeah, like I said, the first thing that I would do is lead you in a prayer of repentance, 
41:44
because when you've done wrong, and when you side with absolute evil, and I tell you, even 
41:51
probably 13-year-olds, 10-year-olds know that what's being said is wrong, I mean, children 
41:56
know it's wrong, and when you have the heart of a child, there's no evil in them, there's 
42:01
nothing that, that you know that, that they've had, been taken care of, they've been loved 
42:05
their whole life, but they can look around, they listen to anything on the news, they 
42:09
know that there's a mess going on, and they know that darkness, they know what evil is, 
42:14
my grandkids know what evil is, okay, they're young, but they know what it is, and so if 
42:18
you're finally gonna wake up, because I know God is shaking some people right now to wake 
42:22
you up, okay, he doesn't want you to lose what he's got planned for you, he doesn't 
42:26
want you to miss your destiny, Satan wants to steal and crush your destiny, so right 
42:31
now we say, I say, we would just say this together, Father, I choose with my will, to 
42:39
repent of all evil, to repent of being involved in voting for evil, to repent in being involved 
42:47
in voting for evil, I change my heart this day, I change my heart to say, and choose 
42:53
with my will, and choose with my will, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, to receive 
42:59
Jesus Christ as my savior, I receive his will, I receive his will, his way, his way, I want 
43:06
his plans for this country, I want his plans for this country, and for my life, and for 
43:11
my life, I evict all evil and wickedness, all wicked and evil and deceiving words, they 
43:22
were spoken over the fake news, they were spoken over the fake news, or the illegitimate 
43:27
person sitting in the White House, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White 
43:31
House, I will lose all of them for my soul, I will live according to the Word of God, 
43:39
I invite Christ 
43:44
to abide in me 
43:46
i want to hear his voice 
43:47
i want to hear His voice 
43:49
i want to walk in the Spirit 
43:50
not to walk in the Spirit 
43:52
and not the flesh 
43:53
and not the flesh 
43:54
I choose to bind to my soul 
43:57
I choose to bind to my soul 
43:59
the love of God 
44:00
the presence of God 
44:02
the presence of God 
44:04
the life of God 
44:05
the life of God 
44:07
His will 
44:08
his will, his way, his expectation, his expectation of greatness, of greatness, and righteousness, 
44:18
and righteousness to be in this earth, to be in this earth, in Jesus name, in Jesus name, this day, 
44:26
this day, I step into a new place, I step into a new place, and I step out of the darkness, 
44:32
I step out of the darkness, I now serve the Most High God, I now serve the Most High God, I will not 
44:39
serve another, I will not serve another, amen, amen, very, very powerful, a lot of people got 
44:47
touched, a lot of people, wow, so yeah, hey, you know what, some of you watching, be sure you send 
44:53
this program to friends of yours, because there's some people that they're like right on the edge, 
44:57
and they just, you know, that you've seen them beginning to waffle about what they have believed, 
45:02
send this broadcast to them, forward it to them, or give them the link either way to do that, so 
45:08
that'd be awesome, awesome, well, you know, we have time for a few questions, anything else you 
45:13
want to say before we do that? Well, I do have a question to answer that someone has given me 
45:18
some time ago, I didn't get to answer it, they asked me, what role does Melchizedek play in our 
45:26
lives? Okay. Well, Melchizedek is a real being, he's not a human who died and moved to heaven, 
45:34
and the Bible says Melchizedek has no father, no mother, no beginning or end, which means he has 
45:41
always been with the father, and actually, Melchizedek is the father's personal high priest, 
45:49
Jesus Christ is our personal high priest, but the father is, he has Melchizedek who is sent to 
45:55
the earth on different assignments, at one point he was the king of Salem, he's one who received 
46:00
tithes, you know, when the tithes were being paid for the first time, he was on the earth, 
46:04
he received the tithes, Melchizedek has flesh, he's always had flesh, there's a whole tribe of 
46:11
angels made after the order of Melchizedek, which means they had flesh put on them, 
46:17
probably before we were born, I love the way the father says though, about any of the angelic 
46:23
tribes or the host army, he said, yes, they were made before we came, but we existed before they 
46:30
were made, because we lived in him, and so that's who Melchizedek is, and I know, is that a storm 
46:38
warning, Jen? Okay, I take power over all the part of the enemy trying to control this storm 
46:43
overhead of us right now, and I command the host to have them get up there and shred that storm, 
46:48
I refuse and review all strong winds, there'll be no tornadoes in this area, no flooding in 
46:54
this area, I'm over the weather, now under the weather, and I say, get out of this city in Jesus 
47:00
name, you will bring rain and nourishing rain, no lightning strikes, keep it in the sky, and get 
47:07
out of here in Jesus name, amen. Praise God, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, so again, 
47:13
I don't know if I did, did you have a little, I can't remember if we interrupted your flow with that, 
47:18
did you, did we get it? Melchizedek, yeah, a lot of people, they assumed that he was like one of 
47:25
Adam's sons, or they say that he was someone else who died that lived on the earth, but clearly the 
47:30
word doesn't say that, they can't figure out who he is, there are some of the living creatures 
47:36
have always, always been with the father, he didn't make them one day because he thought about it was 
47:42
a good thing, they've just always been with him, there's no way really to get people to understand 
47:46
the father has always existed, he carries time inside of him, and so that's why he's the only 
47:52
one that knows when Christ will return, nobody knows with the father, because he carries time, 
47:57
he didn't appear somewhere in time, so he's always assisted the living creatures have, the 24 elders 
48:03
have always existed, they're spiritual beings that serve him in heaven and all around heaven, 
48:08
they're not people, they're not the 12 tribes of Israel, they're not the 12 apostles, I've seen 
48:13
Peter Paul, I've seen John in heaven, they're not sitting there with a crown around the throne of God, 
48:20
so those are spiritual beings, of course Melchizedek would also be there, and people just picture 
48:25
nothing ever existed, there was a time when nothing existed, that's not true, before time was, the 
48:31
father was, the word was, which is Jesus Christ, holy spirit has always existed, but along with 
48:38
them would be Melchizedek, the 24 elders, the seven spirits of God, which are also seven 
48:44
personal spirits that serve the father, so that's a little bit of understanding and revelation for 
48:50
you for this question about Melchizedek, so he's always been, he was sent to the earth on assignment, 
48:56
and so anyway, I think that was the most important one, so if you have some questions you can go ahead. 
49:02
Yeah, okay, so yeah, we're going into questions about heaven or important truth, so Daniel is a 
49:09
six-year-old, he wants to know do we pray in heaven, I think he means either if we died and went now, 
49:16
or later on when it all goes, when we're all in heaven, do people pray or do we pray in heaven 
49:23
when we, when we go? I know one place that they, that they do make decorations and pray, it talks 
49:29
about the, this talks about in the Bible the souls under the altar of God, who pray and declare 
49:35
before the throne, and I always pictured like an altar, like you know, if you were to do into a 
49:41
traditional charismatic church or probably even other churches, they always had an altar down front 
49:46
that was maybe six inches off the floor, and people go down there to repent and do other things, 
49:50
they serve communion there, but that's not the way it is in the throne, the throne is a whole 
49:56
structure, you can actually walk underneath the throne of God, and really massive altar, 
50:02
many people go under there and they declare over their families, they also say things to God, 
50:07
not that they can't go up to a stone and say it, but sometimes they just want to do it personally 
50:11
or whatever, so that that's one example that yes, there are people who declare and who do pray in 
50:17
heaven for things going on on the earth, you know, and usually though, it's in the throne room and 
50:22
there's this huge room underneath the throne of God, the throne is high and lifted up, so nobody's 
50:28
mushed down or flattened down, so yeah, there's places in heaven, they'll go to the portal, 
50:33
which has been made, they're all over heaven, people go there to watch their family's lives, 
50:36
they can celebrate with them and different things in their life, they go there every year on your 
50:42
birthday and sing happy birthday to you, they don't miss you getting born again, they don't miss 
50:46
anything important like your weddings, your babies being born, people go to these places and they 
50:51
will declare blessings over you, they'll declare things over your life from heaven, so they don't 
50:57
ever stop thinking about us here on the earth. And when you say they declare that, that's kind of 
51:03
the same thing as prayer, right? It is prayer, except they know what's going to happen. They know 
51:08
it's going to happen. What about that, you know, you talked about under the throne, there is that 
51:12
scripture that says they were under the throne, it almost seems like it uses the word martyr in it, 
51:18
and they say to the Lord, how long till you, and I think they say, Kat, you know this better than 
51:24
90, how long till you avenge our blood, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, what's the deal with that, 
51:30
since there's no time in heaven, why are they in heaven saying how long till you get this 
51:36
I think you're not talking about like a date or a time, I'm talking, they're talking about like a 
51:40
season. There is going to be a season where a lot of that will happen, things that were done to certain 
51:46
groups of people and stuff like that, there will be a retribution brought for those people, because 
51:51
he wouldn't have made that place for them to go and declare that. So there are several different 
51:56
rooms underneath his throne, it's just, it's huge, I can't even explain or give it a measurement, 
52:02
but there are different people down there or groups of people down there, and there are, 
52:05
there are some of the martyrs, I'm not saying every martyr, there are some of the martyrs who 
52:09
really want for the father to redeem their life on the earth by bringing justice for what happened 
52:16
to them, and I'm sure that he will bring justice whenever he is, whenever he does that, it will 
52:22
happen, and it may be more towards the end than now, but he's not having them down there just 
52:28
saying that for no reason, is it hard to say it, he's going to let them say it, so I'm glad that 
52:35
he's going in the throne and that you see visibly when you go in there, but then there's some 
52:39
underneath the throne of God, where people are declaring, it says if you declare and decree a 
52:44
thing, it shall be established, doesn't it? A decree and a declaration is that you have a face 
52:52
to believe it's going to happen, it's something I will do. I was in Paris years ago and we stood 
52:57
underneath the Eiffel Tower, and the Eiffel Tower goes forever and ever, but you can walk 
53:03
underneath it because there's the post, so is that kind of what you mean? In other words, 
53:08
the Lord is high and lifted up, sort of like you might say the Eiffel Tower is way up there, 
53:13
but you can still stand underneath it and see its legs or its foundations, is it kind of like that 
53:20
when you say it's under the throne? Well, let's just say the throne is 80 feet high, 
53:27
I'm not saying it is, it is very high and lifted up because if there's not just steps, 
53:33
there's like there's steps, then there's columns, then there's a platform, then there's steps, 
53:58
that they can go up to the throne, but these are actually more private places, I don't think people 
54:04
see it underneath the steps and you can actually see the people, there's places where they go just 
54:08
to talk to God and pray and declare things, but there's people sitting on the steps sometimes, 
54:16
usually gifts on the steps, like people will leave flowers, Christ loves flowers, 
54:20
I didn't know that, sometimes you'll see desserts, because Christ loves green 
54:28
that's good, you know that's helpful because you know you think of the throne is high and 
54:33
lifted up and there's you know there's training fields of temple and all these different things, 
54:36
but you're saying, oh there's thunder and lightning in the throne room, trust me, 
54:39
people run to get struck by that lightning, it's like a myth, there's a lot of love, 
54:44
so there is all of that that talks about in the Bible, the living creatures are as high as the 
54:50
throne, I mean they're really really big and they have eyes in the front of their bodies and their 
54:55
heads everywhere, and they're always declaring over the over those, over those Father, Son, Holy 
55:02
Spirit, you know in heaven, obviously you're perfectly healthy, emotionally, spiritually, 
55:08
physically, no pain and all that, and yet, because I've thought about this many many times, 
55:14
if there's something that God gives you to drink from the throne, from the rivers of life, from the 
55:21
throne, the water that comes from under, however that goes, it seems like it would be hard to be 
55:27
edified more because you're perfectly edified, how, what would you describe as, have you been 
55:33
there and felt the feeling as it goes into war, how is it that that feeling is better than when 
55:39
you're already perfect? Well, it depends on, there's so much activity in the throne, depending on 
55:43
when you, when you're there, I mean you could be caught up maybe five times in your lifetime and 
55:47
see the throne will be there, but there's so much other activity, sometimes the river of life flows 
55:53
from him sitting on the throne, it comes all the way down the steps, people actually will lay on 
55:58
the steps and drink that, and then sometimes he'll open throughout the whole throne room and be like 
56:03
it runs through the whole throne room, then out into the city streets, depending on whatever he, 
56:09
whatever his purpose is for that, but I've been there seeing people actually drinking it as it's 
56:14
life, it's just, it's just, it's, it's, I can't explain it, it's like the greatest love you ever 
56:20
felt in your life and you just can't ever get enough of him, that's why Christ said, Christ loved 
56:27
his father so much, he was so happy when he got to leave hell and you know, came up and he was 
56:32
glorified and appeared back before his father, he was so happy when he was joined back to his father, 
56:38
but, but people who go there are undone, there's just so many things going on, but his presence 
56:43
is everywhere, but when you're there with him, is that you either watch a concert or you're in it, 
56:48
it's the same thing in the throne room, it's greater, the greater or the even the experience 
56:54
of it is greater when you're there in person, then just maybe seeing it from where your mansion is 
57:00
or being around heaven, but you're never away from his presence, but when you're there, a lot of 
57:05
people do, I keep watching the angels, I got to stop them. Well, you know, I was going to ask you 
57:09
that, Kat, because I thought you're watching, so I was about to ask you, what are you watching, 
57:14
because I've never seen you look up while you're describing it and you just can't watch it. There's 
57:18
an over top of me right now. Wow, because it was very clear to anyone watching that you were 
57:24
watching something, and so, what else can you say about what you're watching? I'm just watching, 
57:30
I'm watching part of the activity at the throne right now, and people are laying on the steps 
57:36
and the river pours over them, in them, through them, a lot of people just want to drink it, 
57:42
and it just makes you fall in love even more with the Father, and people love to be in the throne, 
57:48
and then the celebration, and you hear the voice of the living creatures in the whole stone room 
57:54
shakes, it shakes, and the seraphim dipping down out of the glory cloud, there actually is a real 
58:00
glory cloud that stays permanently around the throne, a little bit above the throne, 
58:05
and the seraphim live there, they live in that glory cloud, and they've been with him so long 
58:11
that their hair, long hair looks like blue fire, and just watching them dipping down over the throne, 
58:17
declaring over the Father and over the Son, it's amazing, I don't feel sorry for anyone who goes 
58:25
to heaven, I'm rejoicing with them, I'm celebrating with them, and don't ever feel like you've lost 
58:32
your family members if you belong to Christ, you will never lose them, they moved to heaven for a 
58:37
while, and then you will all be back together again one day, and all the things that happened to them 
58:43
in heaven, they'll be sharing them with you, they'll take you places to see in heaven, I just had 
58:48
someone just say to me, I know that my sister's up there, and I know that she's making a list of 
58:54
places to take me, and they had not even been to heaven, I said you're absolutely right, that's 
58:59
exactly what they're doing, they're not up there enjoying their life while everyone's suffering 
59:04
down here either, they know, all of heaven knows what is about to happen down here on this earth, 
59:10
they know the glory is going to engulf this earth, that people will actually carry it and 
59:14
release it everywhere around the world, they know the baptism in fire is going to be happening, 
59:18
they know that this earth for quite a while will be so filled with God, that's why there will be 
59:24
such a mass, the mass harvest at the end will be so huge, because of the glory, the love, the life 
59:30
of God, we will as manifested sons and daughters actually demonstrate the power of the living God 
59:37
to the people of this earth, either by rescuing things or changing things or commanding things 
59:42
that he tells us to say, you'll see it with your eyes, you'll literally see heaven activity with 
59:47
your eyes on this earth, and that's what's being set up, he's going to remove a lot of the evil 
59:53
on purpose, so justice is going to happen, there's no man greater than God, no devil more powerful 
01:00:01
than God that can stop any of that from happening, so I'm just celebrating my life all the time, 
01:00:08
I know I have expectancy in my heart, I don't have fear in my heart at all, I know who holds me 
01:00:14
in his hand, I know what his plans are and you can know too, because these are great days you're 
01:00:20
ending into, your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great grandchildren 
01:00:25
know they're probably adding up those years, don't try to, I don't ever try to add up the years, 
01:00:29
okay, I know God's going to do what's on his timeline, I know the greatness that's being 
01:00:34
sent to the earth, the babies being born right now are some of the greatest, the greatest 
01:00:38
prophets on the earth, some of the greatest apostles on the earth, the healings are going 
01:00:43
to be so miraculous that begin to happen, that's something else that's going to start happening, 
01:00:47
miraculous healings, regardless of what's going on around, the Bible says God sets 
01:00:53
a table that's his presence, his power, his joy, and his supply, even in the presence of darkness 
01:01:01
he's going to do that on purpose, I think that also is about to start happening. 
01:01:06
I need, I want to ask you, you said something a minute ago, I do not want that to pass because 
01:01:10
I think people would want to want you to say, this is what I meant by what I just said, 
01:01:14
you said a minute ago that they aren't, I may not quote this exactly, you said they're not 
01:01:21
out there enjoying their life while you're suffering on earth, what are you trying to 
01:01:25
communicate? I shouldn't explain to some people who don't really know God, they don't know Christ, 
01:01:31
they think he doesn't care, they don't care, and they don't see what's happening, that they want 
01:01:37
to happen, they want things to happen right now, I understand that's how you feel, but when God has 
01:01:43
a plan, if he's going to expose evil it's going to be done in this time, this would be the greatest 
01:01:48
exposure of evil on the years until the perilous times start happening and they're probably close, 
01:01:54
I can't even say a year, I know I've been taking 150 years in the future and guess what, 
01:01:59
there have been no perilous times of tribulation at that time. But our loved ones are in heaven 
01:02:04
enjoying their life, they're enjoying their life, and they're decreeing and everything, 
01:02:10
even while we are suffering. They're decreeing and declaring for God to intervene on your behalf, 
01:02:16
that you will not miss your destiny, a lot of them are after saying God, I declare they will not 
01:02:21
miss your destiny, they'll fulfill what you sent them for, that my heart is for them, that I'm up 
01:02:27
here declaring over them, I have expectancy for what you're about to do in the earth, this is them 
01:02:32
speaking to the Father about their loved ones on earth. Okay, good, good, good, I want to make 
01:02:38
sure we clear that. All right, Audrey asked, has Kat Siener interacted with John the Baptist, 
01:02:44
what is his appearance now on earth, he wore clothes made of camels here, also any idea what 
01:02:51
John the Baptist does in heaven? John the Baptist is sharing things that happened when he was on 
01:02:57
the earth, but with revelation of what happened in the spirit realm, everyone who goes to heaven, 
01:03:04
you will go and see what was going on around your life that God was doing, the things he was doing 
01:03:10
behind the scenes, the things that he did that you didn't know about, and even the apostles and 
01:03:16
the disciples all got to see that about their life, some every now and then would see angels or 
01:03:20
something like that, but their whole life lived out on this earth, when they tell their stories now, 
01:03:26
they can include, but God did this, God was doing this, and it just makes it even greater, 
01:03:32
more personal for them to share, so all those people are sharing the experiences and things that 
01:03:38
happen on the earth, but with revelation about them, that's what they're doing. And John the 
01:03:43
Baptist, his, as far as- Not wearing camels here, people. He's not wearing camels, and as far as we 
01:03:49
know, as far as we're told, his only gift was teaching and declaring, but does he, I mean, 
01:03:56
would John, even someone like John the Baptist have a hobby, a fun thing that he would do, would even 
01:04:02
he have a gift that would be different than declaring? I'm sure he probably would, it probably 
01:04:08
was something to do with the nature, maybe, because, you know, he was kept in the wilderness, 
01:04:13
isn't always being just desert, I'm sure there was maybe forest or something around him, and he 
01:04:20
loved that kind of thing, I know he didn't have a lot of time, he actually didn't hear God a lot, 
01:04:24
he had him on the back side of the desert, he would share with him things that would happen, 
01:04:29
and I can tell you this, those who told or shared, if they shared a lot in their life on the earth, 
01:04:35
they're going to share more things that they found out when they got to heaven, like I was just saying, 
01:04:39
but John is not wearing camel hair, okay, you don't wish he'd taken a bath five times, 
01:04:44
but when he was down on the earth, he was not the neatest person, I'm sure he was clean in 
01:04:49
all the other ways, but the camel hair he wore, because he had such revelation given to him, 
01:04:56
there was ways God would humble prophets, he was a prophet, Jesus called him a prophet, 
01:05:02
he also is Christ, he says, you know, he's his cousin, they hang out a lot, I see John the Baptist 
01:05:08
a lot with Christ, they were cousins on the earth, and I think he also liked sweets, 
01:05:13
I know that sounds wild, but he ate locust and honey, he loved honey, Christ loved honey, he ate it 
01:05:19
all the time, and it says in the Bible that he did like it, so I just see them a lot together 
01:05:26
in heaven, because they were related on the earth, and I can tell you this, John is not wearing camel 
01:05:31
hair, and the camel hair he wore was inside out, if you have never pet a camel, if you go to Israel, 
01:05:39
if there's a hand over there, ask him, can you touch the camel, and run your hand across that hair, 
01:05:44
man, I'm telling you, it's like little mini spikes, he wore that against his skin, 
01:05:50
it was to keep him humble, that's why he did it, it was to remind him who he was, and who God was, 
01:05:57
and you know, there was things God did to the prophets, so they wouldn't think of themselves 
01:06:03
above measure, mine is pink hair, I'll just tell you right now, I was not a pink hair person, 
01:06:10
I forget it's pink, I right now can't see my hair, and that was to separate me and make me, 
01:06:16
God wants people to notice me, okay, he wanted people to notice John Baptist, 
01:06:20
when it was his time to speak, he wanted him to look different, be different, and sound different, 
01:06:25
and I had to experience the same thing, although today it's pink hair instead of camel hair, 
01:06:30
I'm very grateful. So good, so good, I'm trying to decide which of these, because we're running out 
01:06:36
of time, so this person's saying, what do the evangelists do in heaven since their duty on 
01:06:41
earth was so winning, obviously there's no soul winning, do evangelists just have their own 
01:06:47
individual gifts, is that the point? I think some of them did, and well we know, we know that Paul 
01:06:53
did, Paul had great gifts, he worked with fabrics, he made beautiful things out of fabrics, it was 
01:06:59
a gift, and it was how he supported his ministries, how he supported himself, and people came from 
01:07:04
everywhere to buy those things, I'm sure he made robes, and scarves, and all kinds of things, 
01:07:10
beautiful things with fabrics, it does mention that in the Bible, and I'm sure when when he gets 
01:07:16
time, he probably still does, still does that, but I think that was Paul. 
01:07:22
Yeah, there you go, the best of the best. The Holy Spirit's like, excuse me, 
01:07:30
but we all know that God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest he had to put hair on, so 
01:07:38
yeah, I just love Holy Spirit though, he has no problem, you know, correcting me in the middle 
01:07:44
of everything, Paul worked with fabrics, and he did that, and he was very good at that, Paul, 
01:07:50
I'll tell you what, I see Paul quite often, he's always in the gardens, outside the throne room, 
01:07:56
there's beautiful gardens, and people come there to see him, they want to know what did you feel 
01:08:01
like when this happened, what did you think when this happened, see, is people asking questions 
01:08:06
more than anything else, and people, and of course they're going to share, so they share, 
01:08:10
they still share a lot, but they have things they like to do, some of them like to work with, some 
01:08:15
some of them like to cook or bake, some of them like to make things with their hands, 
01:08:19
I know that there were other of the disciples like Peter is still fishing, that was his gift, 
01:08:26
he fished, he fished before he became a disciple, and he fishes now in heaven, 
01:08:30
people can go fishing with him, my husband said he's going to be his new best friend just in 
01:08:34
case you wondered, and this has to be catch and release, right, this has to be catch and release 
01:08:39
because unless you get caught, unless you get, because you said they play tag or something, 
01:08:46
I don't know how you worded that, yeah, they do, and well you know I already said the creatures 
01:08:52
all talk to you, and that is no different with the fish you're trying to catch or the bull 
01:08:57
you're trying to ride in the rodeos, and someone will probably slam me for that, get over it when 
01:09:01
you get there, you want to ride one, and I'll forgive you for it, but but the creatures all talk, 
01:09:07
they have a voice, they talk to your pets, they'll talk to you a lot, I love that, it will be nice, 
01:09:12
and we just sent our mama cat went home to heaven the other day, oh wow, yeah, and this is 
01:09:17
just not strange, but just like God, my mom has a pet dog out in Arizona where she would visit 
01:09:25
her mom to her mom went home to heaven, her brother went home to heaven, but she has a pet dog out 
01:09:30
there, the same day that the mama cat went to heaven, her dog in Arizona went to heaven, 
01:09:38
oh my goodness, yeah that's not a coincidence is it, it's not a coincidence, it's not, it's not, 
01:09:44
and for anyone that's new, of course I think our poor family, we had lots and lots and lots of pets, 
01:09:52
a horse, two miniature donkeys, four dogs at one point, but a zillion's a cat, so 
01:09:58
those animals will be dispersed among family members I'm thinking, but every single pet 
01:10:07
is in heaven, and we all, there are pets right, yes, you have a big enough place for them to be 
01:10:15
in though, it's good that we're going to need acreage for that, so you'll need, you do get 
01:10:20
acreage, trust me you can have acreage, but by this time they've already made, by this time 
01:10:24
Steve they've already made friends, so they'll probably bring their friends over too, oh that'd 
01:10:28
be good, grandkids and pets, people go, you know what, they think of just nuts the way I top it, 
01:10:35
you know what, God is holy and powerful and so captivating, to be in front of the power that 
01:10:43
he carries and see him demonstrate it, but the love he has, he is love, I know Christ is love, 
01:10:50
I know that, but so is the father, you have to see that he is number one, a father with lots of 
01:10:57
children, when you come home to heaven, you come home, let's say you're married, you don't go home 
01:11:03
as husband and wife, you go home as god's son and god's daughter, you get your own mansion, it can be 
01:11:08
right next to each other, there's no problem with visiting or anything, but he, he is a father, 
01:11:13
is going to provide a place for you, and he made fun places on purpose because if you picture yourself 
01:11:21
as a dad, and let's say you have four kids, if you didn't have some way for them to have fun, you would 
01:11:26
really be. Now cat just froze on my screen folks, is it frozen on anyone else's screen? 
01:11:39
I'm listening to my staff, it's frozen on my screen, yes it's frozen, do you want to try and 
01:11:46
boot her out and have her come back? Well that was a new, we don't, that doesn't usually happen 
01:11:51
with cat, so could be the storm there, yeah they could be having a storm, so we'll see if we get 
01:11:57
her back, it's kind of at the end, if you guys are willing, want to just dismiss her, that's okay too 
01:12:02
because we're kind of at the time, if you say go ahead and, and Steve will say goodbye, just kind of 
01:12:07
let me know what to do, if anyone wants to tell me what to do. Texting chins, yeah you know I was 
01:12:17
talked about my own, my daughter had a cat, Ebony, he's a black cat, he was a black cat and he got 
01:12:24
sicker and sicker, and I was dying at the time, I was under 100 pounds, some of you have heard me 
01:12:29
tell that story, it was very near death and she was dying, and I didn't, it's not that I sat there 
01:12:35
thinking I'm dying, I knew I was very very sick and they hadn't figured out what's wrong with me, 
01:12:39
now, it'd be nice to have closer to that, under 100 pounds, but I, I remember talking to Ebony and 
01:12:47
I'd say someday, because I knew she was not going to be here really, so I was laying on the couch, 
01:12:52
sick sick, everyone's gone, Ebony's on the chair and I said someday in heaven, you and I, we're 
01:12:58
going to talk, oh their internet went out, he says they will try one more time, but I said someday 
01:13:06
you and I are going to have a conversation about all of all this, and I felt like honestly that 
01:13:11
I was communicating with Ebony a boy cat, he was a beautiful cat, but you know, because as he got 
01:13:18
sick and sicker, he couldn't clean himself, so he then became a beautiful dirty cat, but you know, 
01:13:25
it'll be fun to see what happened to Ebony and try and talk with him and say, do you remember that? 
01:13:32
That's what I think I see myself saying is to the pets, I'll say, do you remember when, if God 
01:13:37
gives me that memory, so, but we had so many cats, we were cat people and so now we've had a lot of 
01:13:43
dogs, so, well, you know what guys, it's 10 44, it went long and if they're still trying, I think 
01:13:50
probably this is a good time to dismiss it, it was a great, great show, we got good, good answers, 
01:13:55
so I'm going to go ahead and say to the people, thank you so much for the show, tomorrow we 
01:14:01
have Patel Patriot, who talked a lot about devolution, not evolution, but devolution, 
01:14:08
which has to do with the president redistributing authority to those people beneath him, 
01:14:17
so that the continuity of government can continue, he will talk about devolution and 
01:14:24
anything else God's put on his heart, he was great, this will be our second time, he's very, 
01:14:28
very popular on the internet, especially among patriots, so we remember that, so Patel Patriot 
01:14:33
will be tomorrow, it will be very, very, very good, so be sure and tell your friends, we will be, 
01:14:39
until further notice, we'll be on rumble only and when I say rumble only, I mean rumble and Facebook 
01:14:45
and theeligialist.com, just not YouTube, so with that, have a great day everyone, God bless you 
01:14:51
and we will see you again tomorrow, same time, bye bye. 
01:15:21
you

01:30
Well, happy Wednesday, September 7. 
01:34
We're recording this on Tuesday, September 6. 
01:38
So not to confuse you with the date is off behind us. 
01:42
I'm just changing a couple of things 
01:44
so this doesn't blink on us. 
01:46
Anyway, welcome to the broadcast. 
01:47
This is our second show today 
01:48
because we're recording this on Tuesday for Wednesday. 
01:51
So it's gonna be a great show with Kat. 
01:54
We just had a good one with Johnny, 
01:55
which you will have seen by the time you see this. 
01:57
But anyway, I just had a really neat time talking 
02:01
with Kat's mom. 
02:02
We need to have her. 
02:04
I can't remember her first name, 
02:05
but we're gonna have her on with Kat one of these times 
02:07
and get some of that wisdom from her. 
02:09
But anyway, without further delay, 
02:11
let's go ahead and watch Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. 
02:14
So here we go. 
02:15
There she is. 
02:32
There's our lady. 
02:33
Your mom said the pink lady has arrived. 
02:36
So I just had a really nice chat 
02:40
with your mom sitting in your chair. 
02:41
So that was a delight. 
02:43
I haven't seen her since the cruise. 
02:44
We were on, I think so. 
02:46
Well, it's been a while. 
02:47
Yeah, it's been a while. 
02:48
So tell us about the clothes you're wearing. 
02:50
Cause you said there's something special 
02:52
about what you're wearing. 
02:53
Well, this shirt right here, we have our own women. 
02:57
We have a women's group and a men's group. 
02:59
The women's group is called Wonder Women, 
03:02
Doing Signs and Wonders. 
03:04
Awesome. 
03:05
And this is actually, this is the logo we made for it. 
03:08
It looks crooked on the camera, I don't know why, 
03:10
but it's not crooked. 
03:11
Anyway, it's a W and it's got purple and silver in it. 
03:15
But that's what it says. 
03:16
It says right here, Wonder Women, 
03:18
Doing Signs and Wonders. 
03:20
And there's some of the most powerful meetings we have. 
03:22
We probably have close to 800 women, 
03:24
maybe a thousand women come from all over the world. 
03:27
I think 30 countries came the last time. 
03:30
And I'm telling you what, 
03:32
they had no problem ruling, sending the host or anything. 
03:35
It's a really powerful event when we have it. 
03:38
The men is called the Dread Champions 
03:40
because hell will dread them. 
03:42
I love that. 
03:43
Hey, can women order that shirt? 
03:45
Is that for sale on your site? 
03:47
I would say it will be very soon. 
03:50
I'm just kind of showing you, 
03:51
this is the one that we had the last time that we, 
03:54
you know, we didn't have a Wonder Women meeting. 
03:55
It's been two years, 
03:56
but we're going to have a Heaven's invitation, 
03:59
which is our premier annual event we have. 
04:02
And we are going to have Wonder Women, a separate meeting. 
04:05
I don't have dates for those yet, 
04:07
but we'll get them as soon as we can. 
04:09
But yes, this is the symbol. 
04:11
We have a different color, 
04:12
some of the different colors and everything in it. 
04:14
But the women have a powerful time when they do come. 
04:18
And then the men, 
04:18
we actually bring a prophet over from England, 
04:22
who speaks with my husband. 
04:24
And they said, I still speak. 
04:26
I still speak, people still want me to speak. 
04:28
So I still speak to all the men, 
04:30
but my husband and Nick, 
04:33
they have powerful, I forgot what they call it. 
04:38
Respiratory or what? 
04:39
Workshops. 
04:40
Okay. 
04:41
Two, two-hour workshops during that event. 
04:44
And then my son-in-law opens for me, 
04:47
that would be Ben, the megamarked canvas 
04:49
that God calls a couple very fierce against the darkness. 
04:53
He opens my meeting every time I speak at the men's meeting, 
04:57
but then I finish it off. 
04:58
So you're going to get a lot, man, when we, 
05:01
you should be getting an email soon, 
05:04
because we're finally, 
05:05
now that we're moving though, 
05:06
we'll probably wait until the office moves to do that. 
05:08
So we're really going to get all of our emails started. 
05:10
We've already designed one for Wonder Women, 
05:12
one for Dread Champions, one for the host. 
05:16
We're going to have the Guardian Zone, 
05:18
and we're going to have a spirit force. 
05:20
I think spirit force, we may already have that one. 
05:22
So we are going to really go into high gear. 
05:24
Once we get into our offices, probably this year, 
05:27
or maybe the first part of next year, 
05:30
everyone else would say this year, please. 
05:32
Yeah. 
05:33
Wonder Women logo. 
05:35
And usually what we do, because when the daughters of God 
05:39
meet, he wants them to enjoy themselves too. 
05:41
We have powerful, a powerful event. 
05:43
We have activation, we have training, 
05:46
but we also do something fun. 
05:48
We actually, we actually get one of these, 
05:51
a lot, like a human size, big camera things, 
05:55
and we go, I'll take pictures together. 
05:57
And I know that may not mean much to some of you, 
05:59
but it's really a memory of the power of God 
06:03
and the life of God that you experienced at our meetings. 
06:05
And so we do that, and everybody 
06:06
has one to take home with them. 
06:08
It's really an awesome time. 
06:10
We have a luncheon too, so I can't wait to have that again. 
06:13
But right now, I'm heading to Colorado. 
06:15
You know, tomorrow, I'll be in Colorado. 
06:17
And then after that, I'll be, of course, in Nebraska. 
06:21
Are those venues full, or can people still 
06:24
come to the one in Colorado? 
06:25
I think the one in Colorado is totally full, 
06:28
except Saturday and Sunday. 
06:30
It's a women's event. 
06:31
It's their women's meeting. 
06:33
It's activation, not activation. 
06:37
Jen, what is the name of the event? 
06:38
Gateway on Mount Zion. 
06:40
What, again? 
06:41
Gateway. 
06:41
Gateway on Mount Zion. 
06:43
I'm so focused on even going. 
06:45
Gateway on Mount Zion is in Golden, Colorado, 
06:48
mile high in the sky. 
06:50
The women's thing is full. 
06:51
That's at Copper Mountain. 
06:53
But Saturday night, this Saturday night, and this Sunday, 
06:57
this Sunday morning, they're having, 
06:58
I will be speaking, both meetings in Colorado 
07:02
at that place in Golden, Colorado. 
07:05
There's a sanctuary where they got burnt. 
07:07
Oh, my goodness. 
07:09
But they have a huge tent outside. 
07:11
So it'll be outside. 
07:12
It's probably going to be in the 50s at night, 
07:13
so that might be enjoyable for everybody. 
07:16
This Saturday night, I'll be speaking there and this Sunday, 
07:19
and that is still open to people to come. 
07:21
Nebraska, I think they still have some seats left. 
07:25
It holds 9,000 people. 
07:28
I'm sure that they opened the heavenlies with Hank Kooniman. 
07:32
Wow. 
07:33
The event. 
07:34
I think they definitely still have some seats there. 
07:36
And I don't think it costs anything to come, 
07:38
but you have to register. 
07:39
So definitely go on Lord of Host and register for that event. 
07:43
That would be the 15th, I think, right, Jen? 
07:46
Is it 15? 
07:47
Yes. 
07:49
His mission is called Lord of Host Church, right? 
07:53
And he's in the- 
07:54
Lord of Host Church, yes. 
07:55
And he is in Omaha. 
07:57
Omaha, Nebraska. 
07:58
A couple miles down the street is the Mid-America Center, 
08:01
which is where they're holding it, it's being held there. 
08:04
And it's going to be huge. 
08:06
It's the 15th. 
08:08
15, 16, 17, 18. 
08:11
Is that it? 
08:12
Well, the conference is the 15th, 16th, and 17th. 
08:15
And they're going to have Flashpoint Live there. 
08:17
They'll have Flashpoint Live on Thursday, I think, right? 
08:21
And then even Rod Parsley's coming to be one 
08:24
of the keynote speakers. 
08:25
Wow. 
08:26
He definitely does not believe us. 
08:28
The end right now, he's a powerful, 
08:30
live integrity man of God. 
08:32
And guess what? 
08:33
Well, King Christmas, I think, will speak that day also. 
08:36
And Phil Driscoll is coming to play his trumpet. 
08:40
Oh, man, I love that trumpet. 
08:42
He is amazing. 
08:43
I listened to him play live one time. 
08:47
Yes. 
08:48
And it's the only time, listen to this, 
08:50
it's the only time that I've ever listened to music 
08:53
when only the music, without words, obviously, 
08:58
all of a sudden, tears are streaming down. 
09:00
And it was like, it just completely overcame me. 
09:04
Heaven shows up. 
09:05
I know, I know he has family here. 
09:08
And I know them really well. 
09:09
And I'm telling you that man has never stopped for years. 
09:13
He's so powerful in the spirit. 
09:15
But he'll be playing, I know, for Rod Parsley's meeting, 
09:18
and maybe the one before that, he'll be playing, 
09:20
I think, that's Friday, Friday night. 
09:24
Saturday will be Brenda Kahneman. 
09:26
And then me, I'm speaking, Robin Bullock is speaking. 
09:29
And then Hank Kahneman speaking. 
09:31
Oh, my goodness. 
09:33
It's going to be a powerful time. 
09:35
That's amazing. 
09:36
And people can still get into that, you think. 
09:39
Yes, I'm pretty sure they can. 
09:40
And then Sunday is just their church, 
09:42
but I think they're holding their church there, I think. 
09:44
I'm not sure. 
09:45
But I think Sammy Rodriguez is going 
09:48
to be doing Sunday service. 
09:50
And man, he's going to knock it out of the bar, I can tell you. 
09:52
So it's going to be a very God, very, very prophet-oriented 
09:56
things from God with those powerful prophets 
09:59
all being together. 
10:00
And as far as you know, Kat, is he streaming that live 
10:03
as well, do you know? 
10:05
Will people be able to watch it online? 
10:06
I think you can sign up for the streaming, 
10:09
but you can check that out on Lord of Host in Omaha, 
10:13
Nebraska, that's his website, I think. 
10:16
But as of today, they have some seats left in the auditorium. 
10:21
Like I said, it holds 9,000 people. 
10:23
We're bringing 17 members just so we 
10:25
can have our products table. 
10:27
Geez, wow. 
10:30
There'll be so many people coming. 
10:32
And so I'm excited about what God's going to say. 
10:34
It is going to be life-changing. 
10:37
Well, I hope I know you guys will have it on tape. 
10:39
If there's something that ends up being recorded, 
10:41
maybe we can play a clip or something next time around there. 
10:44
I think that same weekend, I'm going 
10:45
to be reawaken America with Clay Clark and all of those. 
10:48
A lot of people, it's like a combination of they're 
10:52
all conservative, they're all patriots, 
10:54
but some are saved, some are not saved. 
10:57
And so there's a lot of evangelism 
10:59
that goes where Robin Bullock was there last time he didn't 
11:03
speak, but Amanda Grace goes every single time virtually. 
11:08
So this will be my second time at the reawaken. 
11:10
It's quite a patriot event. 
11:12
So that'll be fun. 
11:14
That's up in the Spokane area. 
11:16
I think it's very inspiring. 
11:17
I'm telling you, people, there are things 
11:20
that are going to be happening in this country. 
11:22
And I'm sure that you're going to find out some of that 
11:24
at that meeting, the men that Steve will be at. 
11:27
I know you'll hear a lot of that, too, 
11:29
where we're going to be, because I know the heart of Hank 
11:32
Kahneman and Robin Bullock has told me 
11:34
on what God is doing right now. 
11:37
And I know that's what their event with the Patriots 
11:39
is going to be just like that. 
11:40
But from the patriot point of view, 
11:43
this country wouldn't be anything without the Patriots. 
11:46
The Patriots stood in the beginning for this country, 
11:49
the freedom, and they're still standing 
11:51
for the freedom of this country. 
11:53
So awesome. It was an exciting time to be alive, 
11:55
and it really, really is exciting. 
11:58
Well, listen, while we're talking about jump off and share 
12:01
anything else you want to share, we'll 
12:03
have questions about heaven and things, 
12:04
but anything you want to share before we do that. 
12:07
We only have an hour today, because this is my second show. 
12:10
My in-laws are going to walk through the door, 
12:12
or my in-laws, so they'll be fun. 
12:15
The two boys are very rambunctious, so they'll come in. 
12:18
And so at that point, we may not be able to hear each other, 
12:21
so anyway, anything else that's on your heart 
12:25
about what's going on? 
12:28
I just know last night in the nighttime, 
12:30
I kept hearing the father saying to me 
12:33
that something was going to happen very soon. 
12:36
And normally, he doesn't speak to me like at night 
12:40
when I'm already in my bed, but I was still awake. 
12:44
And so I guess he decided to take advantage of that. 
12:47
I just saw him moving his hand over this country. 
12:50
Really? 
12:51
He didn't let me see what he was doing, 
12:52
but he was doing something. 
12:53
I'll tell you, I know that he said on purpose when I hit 
12:57
the gavel that last week, the gavel when it was hit, 
13:01
he said, justice was released then, 
13:02
and certain things are going to start 
13:04
happening very powerfully around this nation, 
13:07
and even overseas, that regards this country. 
13:10
And yes, he does love this world, 
13:12
and he has a lot of plans for this world, 
13:14
and his plans count, not the devil's plans. 
13:17
And we are going to see so much exposure. 
13:20
I know that's going to start happening. 
13:21
Like I already had said, there's going 
13:23
to be a couple of people die that are doing wicked evil stuff. 
13:27
I don't know who those people are. 
13:29
I do know that they will actually drop dead. 
13:31
And when that happens, you're going 
13:32
to know something significant is about to happen. 
13:34
How about that for a sign? 
13:36
That I want them to die, but these are God's plans. 
13:39
This is his world. 
13:40
He has plans for it. 
13:41
He's not allowing evil to take over, 
13:43
in case you wondered. 
13:44
He's not allowing it to happen. 
13:47
So all the things that have been said, 
13:49
this is what it's going to be. 
13:50
This is a new norm. 
13:51
No, it's not. 
13:53
Hell's trying to make it their new norm. 
13:54
They don't get a voice. 
13:56
They don't have a voice. 
13:57
They don't have authority. 
13:58
They don't have permission. 
13:58
They have nothing. 
14:00
They don't have anything to stand on. 
14:01
And even their foundation is crumbling. 
14:03
They've already been building. 
14:04
It's done cheaply. 
14:06
It's done with no intelligence whatsoever involved in it. 
14:09
You should know that by the reports coming up 
14:11
from Washington DC. 
14:13
I can just say, our lives are in God's hands. 
14:16
Our lives are going to be great, powerful, and amazing. 
14:20
That's what God has plans for all of us. 
14:23
So any of these events you can make it to, 
14:26
just make sure you stay tuned into Holy Spirit, 
14:28
if you can hear him. 
14:30
And if you don't have him, 
14:31
you should invite him inside of you, 
14:32
because let me tell you, 
14:33
he'll talk to you out here, 
14:34
or he'll talk to you in here. 
14:36
And then he never stops talking to me. 
14:38
So he's like coming into, 
14:41
I don't call them days of horror, 
14:43
or terror, or loss of everything. 
14:45
That's not going to happen. 
14:46
This is not the tribulation, people. 
14:49
The devil gets a couple of years for that, 
14:51
and it's not right now. 
14:52
And he knows it. 
14:53
And I tell you, I got a text saying 
14:55
that the left is threatening, 
14:57
saying that we should all be scared. 
14:59
I think they are the ones who should be scared, 
15:02
because the God of heaven and earth 
15:03
knows exactly what's going on, 
15:05
and he's going to do what he wants to in this time. 
15:08
So start thanking him for that. 
15:10
Yeah, I heard a major ministry got kicked off 
15:14
completely off of YouTube, 
15:15
and they keep trying to take more of us out. 
15:17
We have two strikes against us, 
15:19
but I don't have a lot of fear. 
15:20
We're on rumble. 
15:22
We may or may not be on YouTube for long. 
15:25
I think they're gunning for most of us, 
15:27
but their time is coming. 
15:28
Whoever's doing this stuff. 
15:30
They're afraid. 
15:32
Yeah, they're freaking out. 
15:34
They think if they don't get rid of us, 
15:35
the plan will fail. 
15:37
But God's not going anywhere, people. 
15:40
And he's the one in charge. 
15:42
And we all know he holds the air we breathe. 
15:45
Yeah, he does. 
15:45
And he should not have fear anywhere in you. 
15:47
I almost wore a shirt that said, 
15:49
don't let fear interfere, 
15:51
which is something Holy Spirit is always having me tell people. 
15:54
Do not let fear interfere in your life. 
15:56
Don't forget that. 
15:58
These are days of wonder and splendor 
16:00
and God's power in this earth. 
16:02
Well, and I think you were the first one that I heard. 
16:05
It was 2012, I believe, when God said, 
16:10
talk with you about let the show begin, 
16:12
was it 2012? 
16:14
It was pretty close to 2012. 
16:15
I think it may have been a little bit before that, 
16:17
because it's when the first elections were starting. 
16:23
The first elections that was won, actually won, 
16:26
and he got his seat. 
16:28
But I do know, let the show begin, 
16:31
was God knowing all this was going to happen. 
16:33
It was said before these days were in, 
16:35
it was before 2019, 2018, 17, God actually had me say, 
16:40
let the show begin, and guess what? 
16:42
He was talking about his show, not the evil show. 
16:46
Yeah, and back then we knew nothing. 
16:48
I remember you were, when you first said that, 
16:50
none of this stuff had happened yet. 
16:52
The selection hadn't been stolen, nothing had happened. 
16:55
It was just like, I just thought onward and upward. 
16:58
Well, it is onward and upward with God, it always is, 
17:01
but we didn't know what we would have to endure, 
17:05
if for lack of a better word for it. 
17:07
We didn't know this whole COVID thing. 
17:09
So God knew what they were up to. 
17:12
He did, he knew before they ever did it. 
17:14
Nothing is hidden, it says in the Bible, 
17:16
nothing is hidden from him. 
17:18
Yeah. 
17:19
And even those who believe he is not, 
17:21
will find out he is. 
17:25
Yeah, these are amazing times. 
17:27
So my wife just walked in and said, hi. 
17:30
She's got a haircut, so she's- 
17:31
Hi. 
17:32
Hi, Noreen. 
17:35
She can't hear you, but she's smiling, so anyway, 
17:37
she just came back because she's got her hair done. 
17:39
She probably didn't like that I had her come on the camera. 
17:42
Yeah, but she's just sweetie. 
17:44
We like to see her though. 
17:45
Yeah, we do like to see her. 
17:47
So, well, let's see, where do we go? 
17:50
Anything else you wanna say before we get into questions? 
17:52
I've got a whole couple of pages of that. 
17:55
I just, I have one, a little boy sent me some time ago. 
17:58
Oh, okay, all right. 
17:59
And I know it's something you have. 
18:01
So, but something very important, 
18:03
a lot of parents don't understand operations 
18:06
of the spirit realm and what certain images mean 
18:08
or even certain movies have things in them. 
18:12
I wanna encourage people to never have your child 
18:14
watch something that has witchcraft in it. 
18:16
Okay, wow, yeah. 
18:18
We know some things are fantasies 
18:20
and some are not fantasies, witches are not fantasies. 
18:23
It's something that's real. 
18:25
They spoke against it in the Bible, 
18:27
said have nothing to do with the necromancer. 
18:29
That is a witchcraft. 
18:31
And they have different levels in that whole area of, 
18:35
there's warlocks, there's wizards. 
18:38
These are dark images. 
18:39
These are dark beings that represent hell. 
18:42
And they've been around since the angels tried to, 
18:45
you know, take over earth when the watcher angels fell 
18:48
and they introduced human sacrifice during that time. 
18:51
This is a long before you were here. 
18:54
And so the dark arts have been around a long time, 
18:56
but there is no good witches. 
18:58
Just so you know, no good witches, 
18:59
no wizards, no warlocks that are good. 
19:02
They're all very evil and wicked. 
19:04
And they do all kinds of horrible things. 
19:07
And so this little boy was serious. 
19:08
He's 10. 
19:09
And he said, he says, I worked for his grandfather. 
19:14
He's the first little boy ties to me. 
19:16
I thought that was awesome. 
19:17
So we get the question, 
19:18
do you think the Habba is good to watch? 
19:22
And Jack, I won't answer that quite clearly. 
19:26
It has, is it wizardry? 
19:28
It has wizardry in it. 
19:30
Now they're showing good wizardry, bad wizardry. 
19:32
There is no such thing. 
19:34
There is no good witchcraft, no good wizard. 
19:38
There isn't, not even the Wizard of Oz. 
19:40
That was a fake, okay? 
19:41
But there's no good witchcraft, no good wizard, 
19:43
no good warlock. 
19:44
They are all evil beings. 
19:46
And I happen to know in that movie, The Hobbit, 
19:48
they have one. 
19:50
So I would say no. 
19:51
I told my grandchildren, no, don't watch that. 
19:53
I told my own children, every younger do not watch that. 
19:56
Why? 
19:57
Because it plants images in your soul as a child 
20:01
to accept the fact that they are good. 
20:03
Yeah. 
20:04
They need to be doing good acts, but they are not good. 
20:06
That's not a good title, 
20:07
or it's not a good position to have. 
20:09
No witchcraft, no wizardry, no warlock, 
20:12
should be on your list to read about or watch. 
20:15
So that's my answer, Jack. 
20:16
Be wise in the spirit. 
20:19
And make sure that you understand what God is against. 
20:22
He knows what is evil and what is not. 
20:26
And like a superhero, that doesn't mean they're evil, okay? 
20:28
But if they have a witch involved, a wizard involved, 
20:31
even though they're doing good things, 
20:33
which is not the truth, do not watch them. 
20:36
So there you go, Jack. 
20:37
Well, yeah, and you know, as a kid, 
20:39
we all watched The Wizard of Oz. 
20:41
I don't know if you did, but we watched it. 
20:43
And there was the white witch, and she was the good witch. 
20:46
And then there was the wicked witch of the East or something. 
20:49
And we always knew that witches weren't good, 
20:52
but at least for the movie's sake, we thought, 
20:55
well, she's nice, she's sweet. 
20:57
The Wizard of Oz, that character was not a real one. 
21:00
He was a carnival man who got caught up 
21:02
and taken to the Land of Oz. 
21:04
That's not like a bad place. 
21:07
But showing people even way back then 
21:10
that there were good witches and bad witches, 
21:14
that part was not real because the witches are always bad. 
21:19
And they know it, they do know it. 
21:22
And so for that reason, I won't even watch that again, 
21:25
not because of the guy who is the carnival guy 
21:28
who gets caught away in the balloon, the air balloon, 
21:31
but because it has as good witch, bad witch. 
21:34
And I'm telling you, that's gonna come to the earth. 
21:36
There'll be a whole group of them saying, look, we're good. 
21:39
You know why? 
21:40
Because the truth is that there is a guy who will be known 
21:42
and nobody will believe the lie, there is no God. 
21:44
That's what's happening right now. 
21:46
God's gonna expose all the darkness and the gray area. 
21:49
There's a gray area that says there is no God. 
21:52
That's gonna be erased. 
21:53
And he told me that himself. 
21:55
People on this earth will know there is a God 
21:57
and they don't want him or there is a God 
21:59
and they're gonna worship him. 
22:01
And he's gonna erase that lie. 
22:02
So they're gonna have to come up with something new 
22:04
to deceive people. 
22:05
And one of the things they will use 
22:07
is that there's good witches 
22:08
and they will on purpose show themselves healing people. 
22:12
All Satan has to do is remove the sickness 
22:15
off of those people because this is his plan 
22:17
to believe the lie that they are good and they are not good. 
22:22
Yeah, so good, it reminds me of anything occultic. 
22:26
I had what I would consider a divine appointment. 
22:29
I was 30 years old at the time because, or 35 
22:32
because I remember where I lived in Texas. 
22:33
I met a Toys R Us shopping for our kids. 
22:36
They were pretty young back then. 
22:38
And I'm just looking at the aisle and some light. 
22:40
He's like a 10 year old boy, eight to 10. 
22:43
And I clearly didn't work there. 
22:45
I wasn't, didn't have a uniform on. 
22:46
And he says, excuse me, sir. 
22:49
And I said, yeah, what can I do for you? 
22:51
And he goes, I'm looking at this Ouija board. 
22:53
Is this okay? 
22:55
Is this okay? 
22:56
And I said, I said, no, that is not a good thing. 
22:59
I don't even remember what I said, 
23:01
but I said him straight that this was of the dark side 
23:04
and the devil. 
23:04
And he goes, thank you for telling. 
23:06
I mean, can you imagine where that boy might've been heading 
23:09
had God not set that, that divine appointment? 
23:12
When that came out, everybody was pushing it more 
23:14
so you can contact the dead. 
23:16
I mean, this is what they were saying. 
23:18
You can contact the spiritual realm. 
23:20
They didn't mean to make it sound evil. 
23:23
And yeah, I happen to know when people would use those 
23:26
back in the day, when I was growing up, 
23:28
that demons would appear to people and then it would, 
23:31
and I'm not gonna say anything that would make kids 
23:33
want to go get one because you're welcoming 
23:35
and opening yourself up to the darkness. 
23:38
That represents evil all the way. 
23:41
There's nothing good about it. 
23:42
It's something you need to get rid of. 
23:44
If it was in your house, 
23:45
clean your house, open the door 
23:46
and kick out all those evil spirits. 
23:48
Because that is one of the main things 
23:50
that they use to fool children or young people 
23:53
to see something exciting happen. 
23:55
But you don't want to be involved 
23:57
or participate with the darkness. 
23:58
It is not a good thing. 
24:01
Yeah, that was amazing. 
24:02
Follow that one. 
24:03
I'll never forget that. 
24:05
I think, because you pray for divine appointments 
24:08
and this and that, but you're just walking 
24:10
in the toy store and this boy knew something was off 
24:13
about that game and he must've had money in his pocket 
24:18
and he wanted that. 
24:19
He thought to ask, you know, 
24:21
I'd love to know meet that boy in heaven one day 
24:23
and say, what happened after that? 
24:25
You know, you know, when we walked away, he said. 
24:28
All right, well, speaking of kids, 
24:29
I've got a four year old that wants to know, 
24:32
her name is Reagan, his or her. 
24:34
I think it says Reagan. 
24:35
I can't tell if that's a boy or a girl. 
24:37
It says, are there parks with swings in heaven? 
24:40
That's what he or she wants to know. 
24:42
Are there parks with swings? 
24:46
Yes, and when Jen gets her book published, 
24:48
I'm going to have her up her answering questions too, 
24:50
because God has shown her heaven in cartoon form. 
24:54
She's writing books about all the encounters I hadn't 
24:57
had in heaven, but on a child's level. 
25:00
And Jen knows that there's parks in heaven there are. 
25:03
There's all kinds of fun things for children to do 
25:06
and be a part of, but yes, there's parks, 
25:08
like parks you never saw before. 
25:10
They have huge slides coming down out of the sky, 
25:13
like little slides that kids slide on. 
25:15
I think that's probably where the carousel, 
25:17
there's a carousel that has living animals on it. 
25:21
I'm getting ahead of now, Jensen, 
25:22
you're telling me about my book. 
25:24
These animals are like, I'm not kidding. 
25:28
Sharks, unicorns, bears, baby dinosaurs. 
25:36
This carousel is huge, but there's not a pole 
25:38
going up through them. 
25:40
They're just standing on this carousel that's going around 
25:43
and you have the most fun on this carousel in heaven. 
25:47
And so that is part of this park that I saw there. 
25:50
And so it's real exciting. 
25:52
So you're going to love the parks in heaven. 
25:54
They're all over heaven, all different types of them. 
25:57
And so you ask a good question. 
25:58
Is there parks in heaven? 
25:59
Absolutely, yes. 
26:02
Awesome, awesome, awesome. 
26:03
Now this one says, Shannon Ray, I can't tell the age, 
26:07
but she wants to know, is there dancing in heaven 
26:12
and where they use, where they have the use of flags 
26:15
in worship, so flaggers and dancing, I guess, in worship. 
26:20
I have to say, absolutely, yes, 
26:21
I've been to the throne room many times 
26:23
and God loves pageantry, started in heaven. 
26:28
Pageantry started in heaven. 
26:30
They have these huge flags and yes, 
26:31
people actually make them in heaven. 
26:33
That's one of the gifts they have. 
26:34
They make them and they put like lions on them, 
26:38
eagles on them. 
26:40
There's some of the angelic embellished on these flags. 
26:43
And when people run with them in the throne room, 
26:45
they come to life. 
26:46
Like the lions roar off of the flags, okay? 
26:50
I'm talking about like that a lot. 
26:52
Wait, say that again, the lions roar off the flag? 
26:56
Did you just say that? 
26:57
Yeah, the low head will move like this 
26:59
and begin to roar out into the throne room. 
27:01
They can't help it with, you know, 
27:03
there's a father on the throne, 
27:04
there's his son on the throne and they get undone. 
27:07
But yes, that's the difference between heaven 
27:09
and everything is alive in heaven. 
27:11
So this flags and all this beautiful pageantry 
27:14
they have in heaven is something wonderful to see. 
27:17
You can even participate in heaven. 
27:20
And of course they have dancers, 
27:22
they have dancers here on the earth 
27:23
because I'm trying to remember the scripture 
27:26
that I know it's in Psalms. 
27:28
It says that one of the highest levels of worship is dance. 
27:32
It says so. 
27:33
And it says, when they dance and worship, 
27:36
it binds the enemy and fetters of iron. 
27:40
And that is the very scripture 
27:42
that all my daughters lived by. 
27:43
They all are parts of dance come to cushion dance companies. 
27:46
They still do dance, all of them. 
27:49
And it's a very powerful in the spirit 
27:50
and it even does, it does say that scripture 
27:52
so that when you dance and worship, 
27:55
you are binding the enemy that would be Satan 
27:57
and fetters of iron. 
27:59
So good, now you, you're talking about the arts for a minute 
28:03
and I'm trying to remember what you said 
28:05
because you had contrasted this. 
28:08
He said, now and on earth, there's worship 
28:11
other than people do art to the worship. 
28:15
Didn't you contrast that was saying, 
28:17
but in heaven, there's something different 
28:20
about the way that goes down. 
28:22
Do you know what I'm asking? 
28:23
Yes, yes, although totally is, and I was shown this, 
28:27
I was visiting Reading, California, Bethel. 
28:31
I wasn't invited to speak, 
28:32
but I was invited by their intercessors to come 
28:34
and see the healing room they have there. 
28:38
And they had artists, of course, 
28:40
their artists were over on the side 
28:42
and they were playing in worship on the stage. 
28:44
Normally, even at our own meetings, we will do this. 
28:48
We have a powerful worship, 
28:50
but we always invite artists to come, 
28:52
our own artists are there, 
28:53
and they're painting what they're seeing in the spirit 
28:56
during the worship. 
28:59
I've known they've done that several other places too 
29:01
when I've been present at meetings to speak 
29:04
and they'd have artists up there painting in the spirit, 
29:07
what they saw while the people were worshiping. 
29:09
Well, in heaven, it's a little bit different. 
29:11
In heaven, the one who's holding the baton 
29:15
to lead the worshipers is an artist. 
29:20
And they will worship to what the artist is painting. 
29:25
So as the artist is painting, 
29:27
they're painting so that the people like, 
29:30
now if they were on the platform painting now, 
29:32
you and the audience would see the art. 
29:34
That's not in heaven. 
29:36
And heaven is the opposite. 
29:37
The artist is standing with a worship team behind them 
29:40
so they can see what the artist is painting 
29:42
and what they paint. 
29:44
They worship to that. 
29:45
They worship and that's what the music, 
29:48
they're hearing music as the artist is painting, 
29:50
they're hearing sounds and frequencies and instruments. 
29:54
And I told the people at Bethel because I was there 
29:58
and I was watching the artist paint 
30:00
and I saw that going on in the spirit. 
30:03
And I actually told them, they said, 
30:05
if you can tell us something that we haven't heard before 
30:08
that we would be interested in, 
30:10
we'll let you in the room. 
30:11
That's what they said to me. 
30:13
And what I told them was that I said, 
30:14
do you know that when you have artists 
30:16
on the platform painting, 
30:18
the worship team will paint what they're hearing 
30:22
from the art so they let me in right away. 
30:26
And I saw what happening. 
30:27
I said, wow, do you all realize, 
30:29
cause I could see what the artist was painting 
30:31
and went around that side of the stage. 
30:33
When you realize that what they're worshiping 
30:35
and what they're singing is what's on this art 
30:38
coming off this canvas and they got, 
30:40
and then the artist fell out in spirit when I said that. 
30:42
So yeah, so that's one of the ways 
30:45
that things are done differently. 
30:47
They are the ones who lead the worship, 
30:49
the artist with their art creates words, sounds, 
30:54
frequencies and music as they're painting. 
30:57
And that is what they play and sing in heaven. 
31:00
Now you've talked about while we're on the subject, 
31:03
you've talked about, I think there's a scripture 
31:06
that says it'll give you garments of praise 
31:08
for heaviness or something like that. 
31:09
I don't have that memorized. 
31:11
Talk about, cause you've spent a long time 
31:13
since you've mentioned this, 
31:14
what are garments of praise actually in heaven? 
31:18
They really do exist. 
31:20
And we all know that it does talk about them. 
31:22
It talks about them in the Bible. 
31:23
He'll give you garments of praise 
31:25
instead of a spirit of heaviness, 
31:27
I think is what the scripture says. 
31:29
And it's one of the gifts the father gives out himself 
31:32
when you come home to heaven. 
31:34
And people know that I did see Whitney Houston 
31:36
go home to heaven the night before. 
31:38
She's saying in a lounge type area, 
31:42
she's saying with all her soul, yes, Jesus loves me. 
31:46
And when she did, she was receiving Christ 
31:50
the next day she passed away. 
31:53
And I was in another state. 
31:54
I think I was out west on the Western tour. 
31:57
And I was sitting there waiting to speak 
31:58
and I was instantly caught up to heaven. 
32:01
I did not know that she had passed away even. 
32:03
I was caught up to heaven 
32:04
and I was standing near the throne 
32:06
and I saw Whitney Houston up there. 
32:08
And the father was telling her how much you loved her 
32:10
and he thanked her for using her gift on the earth. 
32:13
And he was so pleased that Jesus Christ had her 
32:16
what had walked her up the steps 
32:18
and said, here father, your daughter has come home. 
32:20
I got to see all that. 
32:22
And I don't know what was going on. 
32:24
I know they were worshiping in this meeting 
32:26
that I was gonna be speaking at 
32:27
but I was up in heaven watching this. 
32:29
And the father said to Whitney 
32:31
because you were willing to use the gift I put in you 
32:34
I'm gonna give you one of my own things. 
32:37
One of his own gifts that he had. 
32:39
And he took out this little treasure box. 
32:41
It was the embellishment on it was alive. 
32:44
The colors were moving all over this little treasure box. 
32:48
When he opened it, the color garnet, it was a color. 
32:52
When I saw it come out, it came out like a color 
32:55
and it started squirreling and it became a garnet fabric. 
32:58
And it went all the way around Whitney 
33:00
and became this gown, a beautiful garnet gown. 
33:04
And he said, because daughter, 
33:05
you've been willing to use the gift I put in you. 
33:07
I'm giving you one of my own songs that only I have sung. 
33:14
And Whitney was so undone. 
33:18
She was young, she was beautiful. 
33:19
She's so filled with the light of God. 
33:20
Cause you remember she got saved the night before. 
33:23
And so she had light, the light of God in her 
33:26
and all she did was move her hand 
33:28
and when she moved her hand, 
33:30
the father's song came off of the garment 
33:33
and you heard him singing. 
33:35
Really? 
33:36
His voice? 
33:38
So let me tell you that there's no way 
33:41
you can understand the scope and the beauty 
33:44
and the power of the gifts, 
33:45
the rewards he gives you in heaven. 
33:48
You're going to get rewarded. 
33:49
Okay. If you did things for him, 
33:51
you wouldn't want to stop him. 
33:53
Some people go, well, I don't want any recognition. 
33:54
You don't get a choice 
33:56
because it's him recognizing and honoring 
33:58
what you did on this earth. 
34:00
So everywhere Whitney would go wearing that gown 
34:03
when she chose to wear it. 
34:05
And when she chose to change in her own chambers, 
34:08
it would come off, go back in, I know this later. 
34:10
I found this out later. 
34:11
It went back in the treasure box. 
34:13
Whenever she wanted to wear it, she'd open it 
34:14
and it came out the same way. 
34:16
It would come out with this color, become a fabric weight 
34:18
or she'd walked down the streets of gold. 
34:20
Never she went. 
34:21
People could hear the father singing off of her gown. 
34:24
And the father looked at her and said, 
34:26
this is a garment of praise. 
34:31
Kat, I can hardly contain this. 
34:33
When you said he's thanked 
34:35
because you're willing to use, 
34:36
you were willing to use this gift, 
34:39
was he referring to only the night before that she did that 
34:42
or was he referring to her using her gift 
34:44
during her lifetime? 
34:45
If you even know the answer to that. 
34:47
He meant her using her gift willingly 
34:50
during her lifetime. 
34:51
During her lifetime. 
34:52
Okay, so even when she wasn't saved, she was still, okay. 
34:57
She was using the gift that he put in you. 
35:00
Let me tell you. 
35:01
A lot of people are using the gift God put in them 
35:03
and hopefully they're gonna find that out one day. 
35:06
But he did let her know. 
35:07
She knew God gave her that gift. 
35:10
She knew it. 
35:11
She knew it. 
35:12
And I didn't say she always lived right, 
35:15
but she did create gospel albums with that gift 
35:18
and they're so powerfully, they're anointed 
35:20
that she was anointed to sing and worship. 
35:23
And when God sent her as that little spirit of light 
35:26
and knit her together in her mother's womb 
35:28
at the time of conception, that gift was already in her. 
35:33
When he says, the Bible says, God said, 
35:35
I knit you together in your mother's womb. 
35:38
He's not talking about putting your arms and legs on. 
35:40
We can't make a human spirit people, okay. 
35:43
Our side is creating the flesh side, 
35:46
but there's real no real life in anything 
35:48
until that spirit is attached. 
35:51
Like when God made Adam, when God spoke 
35:54
and the word made Adam and his body was laying there, 
35:57
lifeless, the father leans over 
35:59
because that's where we all came from. 
36:00
We live in him and him, we live, we move, 
36:03
we have our very existence. 
36:05
That's talking about the father and he leans over 
36:08
and breathes from inside himself, Adam's spirit. 
36:12
And he said, he received the spirit of life 
36:15
when he breathed into Adam's nostrils 
36:18
and then Adam became a living soul. 
36:21
That's what the Bible says. 
36:22
He became a living soul because that came from the father. 
36:26
The spirit and the soul came from him. 
36:28
And so that's what he means at the time of conception, 
36:31
that early, when conception takes place, 
36:34
the father sends that little soul, that little spirit and soul 
36:37
and he actually attaches the edit that daughter flesh. 
36:41
And that is when life begins. 
36:44
You know, when you're talking about God gave her that gift, 
36:47
it was a beautiful gift of, you know, 
36:49
she had the gift of music. 
36:50
So God gave her more of the same. 
36:54
There are people that are not singers 
36:57
and they may not even yet be gifted as musicians. 
37:00
And they were usually, let's say, 
37:03
a builder who loves to build, they can't wait to build, 
37:06
they've always built cause they were like the carpenter. 
37:09
Does their gift in heaven relate to that kind of thing? 
37:14
Did they use that kind of gift as well, like building? 
37:17
I think he could still give somebody a garment of praise. 
37:20
It doesn't mean he can't give them one, but for her. 
37:23
For her, that's what he chose for her. 
37:26
And you get more than one gift anyway, but I'm quite sure. 
37:29
I know that the father and the son build our mansion, 
37:33
just so you understand, it says not made by hand. 
37:36
You get a mansion not made by human hands. 
37:38
But there's places all over heaven 
37:40
that people who have a gift to build and design 
37:43
get to be a part of that. 
37:44
They work with Jesus when they get to heaven 
37:46
and build these other places, not mansions, 
37:48
but places to go and enjoy, places to have excitement in, 
37:52
places where people are going to worship in 
37:54
or be together in. 
37:55
And what he would give them probably as an awesome gift 
37:59
would be heavenly blueprints 
38:02
to build something up there in heaven. 
38:05
That makes sense to me. 
38:06
And it sounds like really good news for someone. 
38:09
I mean, I'm not a builder, but I mean, 
38:10
there are people who get up in the morning 
38:12
and can't wait to make something else out of wood, you know? 
38:16
So, all right, well, here's a woman named, 
38:19
well, she goes by the handle cupcake. 
38:23
She says, Kat, if I'm just a mom, 
38:25
wait, the spirits all over me today. 
38:27
I keep, I'm this close to weeping out everything I read. 
38:30
Kat, if I'm just a mom living in New York City, 
38:32
how much authority do I have over strongholds? 
38:35
My street, my neighborhood, my whole city? 
38:38
So that's her question. 
38:40
I will tell you what the word says. 
38:42
When Jesus Christ was talking to his disciples 
38:45
and not just to them, but any believer and Jesus said, 
38:48
I give you power over all the power of the enemy. 
38:52
That should answer your question right there. 
38:55
We are over the darkness, not under the darkness. 
38:58
Satan is the doormat, we are not the doormat. 
39:00
We get the crowns from Christ to rule and reign. 
39:03
He says, you are ruling reign with me now. 
39:05
Now that's in the spirit realm over the darkness. 
39:08
We rule over that. 
39:10
That's Jesus' choice as a believer. 
39:12
If you've been born again, okay? 
39:14
You have deposits of things in your soul 
39:17
that you use to operate in this earth. 
39:19
Most people don't find out about them, 
39:22
although the word clearly talks about them. 
39:24
But Jesus did say, I give you power over all the power 
39:27
of the enemy, you know? 
39:28
And we can assess, they're in there, 
39:31
what you can do, things that you can do. 
39:33
So there's no enemy, there's no spiritual darkness 
39:37
that should have more power than us as a body of Christ, 
39:40
us as a believer in Jesus Christ, who lives in us, 
39:44
Christ lives in us. 
39:46
And the plan of God and of Christ always was 
39:51
for us to take authority and power and authority 
39:53
in this world and change things. 
39:56
By the way, we live our life, the choices we make, 
39:59
the words we speak. 
40:00
It says, what you dare to declare and decree, 
40:03
it will be established under you. 
40:05
So you can declare and decree that the gangs 
40:08
are not taken over your city where you're at, 
40:10
you're not tolerating them anymore. 
40:12
You don't partner with hell in any way whatsoever 
40:15
and begin to evict them from your city, 
40:17
stand in your yard, stand in your house and say that. 
40:20
You're taking the realm you live in 
40:23
and you have every right to do that 
40:24
and it doesn't matter what it is. 
40:26
If it's murders going on, if it's gangs going on, 
40:29
if it's drugs going on, it doesn't matter. 
40:31
You need to take authority all over all the evil 
40:35
and the wicked spirits of darkness 
40:37
that is promoting that and powering these people to do it, 
40:40
you learn to say something against it. 
40:43
Doesn't mean you have to show up at their place, 
40:45
you have authority in the spirit, 
40:47
you can speak from where you are right now 
40:49
against all the evil darkness even going on now. 
40:53
You do not have to receive the words 
40:54
of those who are wicked and evil trying to control you 
40:57
and that means that any time in your life, 
41:00
you don't have to put up with it 
41:02
because Jesus Christ lives in you, 
41:05
he waits for your words. 
41:07
The army of heaven waits for your words. 
41:10
So what are you saying? 
41:11
Are you complaining? 
41:12
Are you, all you're talking about is a darkness. 
41:14
If all you're talking about is the evil and darkness, 
41:16
you're gonna have that all around you. 
41:17
If you don't like it, then evict it from your life, 
41:20
evict it from your home and start declaring what God says, 
41:23
okay? 
41:24
Jesus is the restorer of our souls. 
41:27
He died on the cross, you're washed clean by his blood, 
41:30
you're the power of his blood, his name, his word, 
41:33
his authority that he has given us, that's who you are. 
41:37
You are not weak, you are not forgotten, 
41:41
you were called by God and your birth was timed 
41:44
on the earth for right now to say things 
41:47
and rule against things going on in this world 
41:50
because God is setting things up 
41:53
for the manifest ascends and daughters 
41:55
to rule and reign against the evil in this earth, 
41:59
in the spirit realm where your authority is. 
42:03
So yes, you absolutely have power and authority 
42:06
over all the darkness trying to ruin your life, 
42:09
ruin your family, say something against it 
42:14
and use the word of God if you want to, 
42:16
repeat what Christ has said if you want to, 
42:18
it doesn't change the fact that he said, 
42:21
you will rule in this life with him, 
42:23
he's talking about now and in the time is to come. 
42:28
So yes, people are going to know in this world 
42:30
who knows God, who believes in God 
42:32
and who's operating and walking in the spirit 
42:35
and not the flesh, they're going to know who you are 
42:37
by what's going on in your own life 
42:39
for God is about to do in your life 
42:42
that he's going to demonstrate to this world 
42:44
that you belong to him and you believe him. 
42:47
You know, Kat, it's not lost in me that you declare 
42:51
and decree all the time for your own state, 
42:53
the state of Florida, one of the states 
42:55
that's doing the best in the nation. 
42:57
I mean, that's not lost in me, you know, 
42:59
and you have Ivana Tia lives there, Donna lives there. 
43:02
I was born in Oregon and I'm in Oregon now, 
43:06
but I met Doreen in California, two of our kids, 
43:10
we were married in California, 
43:11
two of our kids were born in California 
43:13
and I love that state and it's so hard to see it going. 
43:16
And I'm thinking to myself, 
43:18
surely there's enough saints in California that are decreeing 
43:22
and yet it seems to be going backwards. 
43:24
Has God shown you anything about California? 
43:27
Well, Steve, you're only going to hear 
43:28
what's happening in the fake news. 
43:30
I mean, all you're going to hear is what the, 
43:32
you're going to only hear what the left is saying people. 
43:34
All right, that's true. 
43:35
He knows another whole side to this world 
43:38
that is not being heard, but they're there. 
43:40
And I promise you, they are taking authority. 
43:43
They are demonstrating, they are demanding things 
43:46
to be changed. 
43:47
They are speaking against the darkness 
43:48
and the evil thereof. 
43:50
They're taking authority over it. 
43:52
Why do you think everything they've tried has failed? 
43:56
Because we are light in this world 
43:59
and they can't take the light out of us. 
44:02
They can't stop God from talking to us. 
44:05
They can't stop it. 
44:06
And I think that's why they are very concerned. 
44:10
And it's all going to be showing up really soon 
44:13
that you do have authority and you do, 
44:16
you can do something about it. 
44:17
You can stop anything going on this wicked. 
44:20
I've not stopped talking against human trafficking, okay? 
44:23
That is horrible. 
44:25
It is a crime against humanity. 
44:27
It's even a crime against God himself 
44:30
because he didn't send people. 
44:31
He didn't send anyone to have that happen to them. 
44:33
There's a real devil in this world. 
44:35
But if you advertise more for him 
44:37
and talk about him more than God, 
44:39
are you going to do anything great for God? 
44:42
Stop advertising and participating with the wrong one 
44:47
and start declaring and declaring what God has said. 
44:51
And tell God, you believe him, 
44:53
you know he knows what's going on. 
44:55
You're on his side. 
44:56
You want to speak his words against the darkness. 
44:59
And let me tell you what, 
45:00
things are going to start changing so quickly. 
45:03
But what's happening right now 
45:05
and what is about to happen 
45:07
is the body of Christ is about to get major accelerated 
45:11
in authority, in dominion, 
45:13
and people are going to know they have it. 
45:16
So good, good, good news. 
45:18
And we can declare over other states, right? 
45:22
You declare over DC. 
45:23
We don't have to just declare our own state. 
45:25
I send a host all over this world. 
45:28
Good, that's good. 
45:30
I know you do. 
45:31
I send way more than- 
45:33
I send them for 24 hours a day for two weeks. 
45:36
That's really good. 
45:38
And they'll shred platforms of evil beings. 
45:41
They'll pull down strongholds. 
45:43
They will literally expose the flesh. 
45:46
Those in the flesh who are evil and wicked 
45:48
are getting exposed every day, 
45:49
but it's going to start majorly happening. 
45:52
That this stuff is going to be shown, 
45:54
that you can't get away with this. 
45:55
This is not God's plan. 
45:57
The earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof. 
45:59
You know the Bible says that. 
46:01
You know you're part of that fullness. 
46:03
You have a light in you that he put in you. 
46:07
You have authority in you. 
46:09
You have the anointing that Christ operated in. 
46:12
First John 2, 27, 
46:13
when you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior, 
46:15
you receive a deposit of the anointing and lives in you. 
46:19
What is the anointing? 
46:20
It destroys the yoke of darkness forever, you send it. 
46:26
That's good news to hear. 
46:30
Have an ice cream after you do it, people. 
46:33
And some chocolate cake. 
46:36
Deborah is asking, 
46:37
are there any distinctions between Jews and Gentiles 
46:41
in heaven? 
46:42
That's an interesting question. 
46:44
I think of course people know your ethnicity. 
46:46
You don't really lose your ethnicity. 
46:49
I mean, if you were born Scottish or Scottish there, 
46:52
you still look Scottish. 
46:53
You know, if you were born Nigerian, 
46:55
you still look Nigerian. 
46:56
You belong to God. 
46:57
If you receive Christ, you're going to go to heaven. 
47:00
So people do know that. 
47:01
They know that about you. 
47:02
They know what you did on the earth for God. 
47:06
That's shown many places all over heaven. 
47:08
So you don't stop being you. 
47:11
You're just a greater you. 
47:13
Do the accents still exist? 
47:15
Like Australians still sound like Australians. 
47:18
Jamaicans sound like Jamaicans and so forth. 
47:20
Yes. 
47:22
And yeah, all the Irish and Scottish accents, 
47:26
they all are still there for eternity. 
47:28
They're all there. 
47:29
The accents are there. 
47:30
There's different languages, 
47:32
but you understand every language spoken in heaven, 
47:34
except one in language. 
47:36
The one language of angels that is their own. 
47:39
They do speak other ones, 
47:41
but there is one that's just their language. 
47:43
And I don't think that we speak that one, 
47:45
but any other ethnicity that's been on the earth, 
47:48
was on the earth. 
47:49
You understand when they speak to you in Scottish 
47:52
or they speak to you in Nigerian, 
47:53
they speak to you in Spanish and you're not Spanish. 
47:56
You know every word they're saying in heaven. 
47:59
Yeah, it wouldn't be hard to hear. 
48:01
So, okay, in this one, Olivia and John just died. 
48:06
This says, please ask Kat, if she knows, 
48:11
if Olivia and John made it to heaven. 
48:14
I haven't been shown that yet, 
48:16
but that doesn't mean she didn't, people. 
48:19
I can tell, if it's okay with you, 
48:21
I'll just tell you that one of our writers, 
48:23
I can't think of her name right now, 
48:25
she's written for Breaking Christian News for years. 
48:27
She's the niece to Olivia and John. 
48:30
Olivia and John was saved. 
48:32
So, my personal testimony, we know Olivia and John 
48:37
is having, even though you haven't seen her, 
48:39
so I'm able to say that. 
48:40
All right, let's see, I haven't pre-read this, 
48:43
so here we go. 
48:45
Don asked, I recently had to put down my 17-year-old dog 
48:49
in the morning of his departure. 
48:50
I was praying for God to give me strength and peace. 
48:54
Trying to get through this stuff today. 
48:55
As I was praying, I saw a group of our pets 
48:57
that had already gone to heaven sitting and waiting 
49:00
and they all had little party hats on. 
49:04
Has Kat ever seen a pets coming home party? 
49:09
Yes, I have. 
49:10
I saw my own pets. 
49:13
I had a Yorkie named Molly and I got to see, 
49:18
she was hanging on with one breath practically, 
49:21
and I think that's when I was on the Western tour, 
49:23
I was going like a six-weeks tour 
49:26
and she was not doing well. 
49:28
She was like 16, 17 years old 
49:30
and I kept thanking God for letting her last 
49:34
until I could come home and say goodbye to her. 
49:36
And he did, he was very faithful, he did keep her 
49:40
and she was not doing really well 
49:42
and I actually dressed her in a little gown, people. 
49:45
It's okay, I loved her. 
49:47
I dressed her in a little hung-going gown 
49:49
and I gave her this beautiful thing when she passed 
49:52
that I would put her in and I had it all prepared 
49:56
and I got to hold her, I got to bathe her 
49:58
and she was on her, she was breathing, 
50:02
but she recognized me, her eyes, she could smell, 
50:05
she could smell, but she knew it was me 
50:07
and she loved me very much and I loved her very much. 
50:10
And finally, I just said to the father, 
50:12
okay, I've said goodbye, please take her 
50:14
so she can go home and it was like she was gone. 
50:17
Like her breath left her, she left her body 
50:21
and I actually have seen her several times in the sky 
50:24
since then, usually when we're sending another pet home, 
50:27
she will actually come for some reason 
50:29
and be here when that pet passes 
50:32
and she goes, they go up to heaven with her. 
50:34
It's amazing the relationship 
50:36
that even pets can create between each other 
50:40
and I did see them preparing for her hung-going party 
50:44
when she got there and her favorite thing to do 
50:47
was chase the mailman to try to get the letters away 
50:50
from him and so at her thing, 
50:53
I know, I know what was happening. 
50:56
I saw her running down the streets to go chasing an angel. 
51:00
I know people think God would not do that. 
51:01
Well, you don't know what you get there, okay? 
51:04
And there was an angel dressed like a postman 
51:06
with his big old wings running and he had this mail. 
51:10
It looked like mail and he was sewn out of his backpack 
51:14
and watching to see if the dog would chase him 
51:16
and boy, she was running down the streets to go after him 
51:18
like, oh, she could get. 
51:20
And she was having the best time 
51:22
and I thought, what better thing to give her? 
51:25
She actually got outside one time, she was an inside dog. 
51:27
She'd bark at the mail slot every day 
51:30
and pull the mail out of the mailman's hand 
51:32
and he would tease her with the mail 
51:33
but she got up one time when we weren't there. 
51:36
I don't know how that happened 
51:37
but she was chasing him all over our yard when we got home 
51:39
and he was throwing her the, you know, 
51:43
the mail, like all the ads and stuff. 
51:45
He was throwing it at her trying to stop her from chasing him. 
51:48
It was funny but to see that the father loved even her enough 
51:52
to plan something special for her. 
51:54
Totally. I've also seen when we all had a dox 
51:57
and it was my daughter's doxen 
51:58
and I did see him being also welcome home into heaven 
52:02
and the dogs and other pets we had 
52:05
where they were waiting for him. 
52:06
So yes, that does happen. 
52:08
And so if you had a pet past recently, 
52:10
number one, they never went by their self. 
52:13
Normally your own personal guardian angel 
52:17
will take your pet's spiritual body to heaven. 
52:21
And they've seen that angel a lot 
52:23
because dogs can see in the spirit. 
52:25
They saw that angel with you. 
52:26
So it wasn't somebody strange. 
52:28
They just gather up your spirit and take them up to heaven. 
52:31
But Molly seems from our side, 
52:34
Molly seems to be the greeter who gets to go with them also. 
52:38
So yes, the pets can do things together in heaven. 
52:43
It's beautiful. 
52:44
And is it your testimony for lack of a better word 
52:47
that dogs and cats can or might see your angels 
52:52
or they simply do? 
52:55
What do they do? 
52:56
They do. 
52:57
And that's why dogs are a part of the things you can't see. 
52:59
It makes sense. 
53:01
I think cats see them too, 
53:02
but dogs respond differently than cats do. 
53:06
Yeah, they do. 
53:07
I think they're really busy with cats 
53:09
since they got nine lives to try to save 
53:10
and not just one maybe. 
53:12
But I do know that pets can definitely acknowledge 
53:16
when angels come in and out of here, 
53:18
when we had our dogs that were here, 
53:21
they would always follow them when they walked. 
53:23
I could see them following them in babies. 
53:26
All babies can see the angels, not just the angels. 
53:30
You're not saying some, you're saying all babies. 
53:32
All babies fresh from heaven can see in the spirit. 
53:38
They can see, and even when my own daughters 
53:41
would have a baby and my daughter would be holding them 
53:44
and the baby would be like looking at me, 
53:46
like this is me here and the baby's looking at me. 
53:49
That baby would go like this. 
53:52
That's hilarious. 
53:54
Every single time they will look at my angels. 
53:57
So I know they're seeing the angels. 
54:00
So yes, your baby can see angels. 
54:02
Now you're describing some hilarious things in heaven. 
54:06
Talk about for a minute, 
54:07
because this is a, in the natural, 
54:12
if someone only listens to the news, 
54:14
this is a painful crisis, 
54:16
horribly yucky time on this face of the earth, 
54:20
and someone would say, 
54:21
well, God would never be up in heaven 
54:23
performing all these hilarious things 
54:25
because there's more important things on the earth 
54:28
that demand his attention. 
54:31
How would you respond to that? 
54:32
I would say God is already responding 
54:35
to the stuff on the earth people. 
54:36
He is setting up and recording every single evil act 
54:40
indeed that's being done, 
54:42
because the gavel's already fallen for justice 
54:45
to come to this nation and this world, 
54:47
but the evil trying to take over. 
54:49
No one's going to escape seeing this. 
54:50
So God is doing stuff on this earth right now. 
54:53
Important things right now for what is coming, 
54:56
which is the days of glory and fire 
54:59
are coming on earth. 
55:00
Those are powerful, amazing things. 
55:02
The manifest of sons and daughters, 
55:04
she's done preparation for hundreds of years already 
55:07
on the earth for this to happen. 
55:09
He knew what was gonna happen. 
55:11
He knew people would be coming home to heaven. 
55:13
He doesn't create evil, 
55:15
but there is right now an evil devil 
55:18
who hates everybody. 
55:20
He even hates his own demons. 
55:22
He hates anybody involved with him, 
55:24
even doing things for him. 
55:26
He loves nobody, 
55:27
but God loves us for the love that you hardly 
55:30
can't understand that he sent his son 
55:32
to make a way back to him. 
55:34
He's not ignoring us on the earth right now, 
55:36
but he's also not going to ignore 
55:39
what's going on in heaven. 
55:41
He's not gonna make somebody have to experience suffering 
55:45
or agony or things that are on the earth right now. 
55:48
This is his ballpark. 
55:50
This is his, he's dealing with this. 
55:52
We're praying who are alive here. 
55:54
We're taking authority right here. 
55:56
That's what our thing is to do right now 
55:57
is to take authority. 
55:58
For those who run their race and run it well 
56:02
are not going home to heaven. 
56:03
He is not going to ignore the fact 
56:05
that he wants to welcome them. 
56:07
He wants them to feel special. 
56:09
He wants them to know how much he loves them. 
56:11
He does both at the same time, 
56:14
deal with it on the earth and loves people in heaven. 
56:18
I was gonna ask you about that because we teach, 
56:22
we've always taught as believers 
56:23
that God is omnipresent, 
56:25
which means he's everywhere at once. 
56:27
So when he says weep with those who weep, 
56:29
rejoice with those who rejoice laugh, 
56:31
he literally does all of those things simultaneously, right? 
56:35
All at the same time. 
56:36
Yes, he does. 
56:37
Someone lost a baby today. 
56:38
He's weeping with them right now. 
56:40
Someone, little kid did something funny in heaven. 
56:43
He's laughing with that. 
56:44
All at the same time. 
56:46
He definitely can be everywhere all at the same time. 
56:49
And by the way, the devil can't. 
56:51
The devil does not have the power. 
56:53
He's not omnipresent. 
56:54
He's not omnipresent. 
56:55
He's not. 
56:57
He is a created being who became very evil and wicked, 
57:01
who wants to use and take away destiny, 
57:04
steal things, kill, steal and destroy 
57:06
is the MO of Satan. 
57:08
The mode of operation for Satan is kill, steal and destroy. 
57:11
God is to bring life and bring it more abundantly. 
57:14
So there's definitely a difference between light 
57:17
and darkness and good and evil. 
57:20
And let me tell you more than ever before, 
57:22
you're seeing that a lot of people have never even witnessed 
57:25
this before in their life, 
57:26
but they're seeing a lot of it right now. 
57:28
And you're definitely me. 
57:29
You will understand what God is doing 
57:31
because it's going to start showing up unexpectedly 
57:35
and suddenly. 
57:36
When God does this suddenly, almost no one's prepared 
57:39
for it, not those believing and hoping for it 
57:41
and not the ones trying to stop it from happening. 
57:44
He is fully aware of everything 
57:46
and knows where everybody is. 
57:47
It's hiding, who's cheating, who's stealing, 
57:49
who's lying, he knows every bit of that. 
57:51
He also knows who is ready to be blessed. 
57:53
Those who are about to reap a harvest for their giving 
57:56
and they're helping and they're praying. 
57:57
Both sides are going to have what they've been. 
58:01
It's seed time and harvest right now, people. 
58:04
The harvest is coming is not the great end time harvest. 
58:08
The harvest is about to come is seed time and harvest, 
58:11
which you've been seeding over these last five, six years 
58:16
on either side, good or evil. 
58:20
You're about to get a harvest of either recompense 
58:25
and justice or blessings and suddenly an empowerment. 
58:30
And both are going to be judged. 
58:32
Both are going to receive the harvest 
58:34
that they've been planting all these years. 
58:36
So the wicked cannot stop or stop from happening 
58:39
what God is going to judge and give justice for. 
58:42
But you also can't stop the blessings 
58:45
and the acceleration in the power of God. 
58:47
That's being given to those who stood firm, 
58:49
who helped, who prayed, who did what was right. 
58:52
Both sides are going to be dealt with, 
58:55
blessed or dealt with with justice. 
58:57
It is going to happen. 
58:59
Oh, good, such good news. 
59:02
You know, we have to stop shorter today 
59:04
just because those little grandsons 
59:06
are going to bust through the door at any moment now. 
59:09
Would you pray for the people 
59:11
or whatever God gives you to pray as we close this out? 
59:14
Yeah, Father, I just speak your life into people right now. 
59:18
I impart life, the love of God, the wisdom of God, 
59:25
His acceleration, His expectation, His celebration 
59:30
for all that is about to happen, 
59:32
that is full of light, love, inventions, 
59:35
all kinds of wonderful things 
59:37
that are coming to this earth right now. 
59:39
He timed you to be here for that. 
59:42
And God, I will speak to the wicked. 
59:45
You are going to receive justice. 
59:48
And you may not like what is about to happen to you, 
59:51
so you better change your mind and get on the right side. 
59:53
If you don't want to experience the judgment, 
59:58
probably imprisonment, maybe even the firing squad, 
01:00:01
I'm just going to tell you right now, 
01:00:03
and this is everywhere, anywhere right now. 
01:00:05
God is getting ready to fulfill both of those things 
01:00:09
in the earth simultaneously. 
01:00:11
And He is going to take this earth 
01:00:14
and turn it into a place He needs it to be. 
01:00:17
The greater glory of God can be seen and known in the earth. 
01:00:21
It says, the knowledge, knowing, understanding of the glory 
01:00:23
will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea. 
01:00:26
Did you know that this earth is covered with two-thirds sea? 
01:00:29
That means two-thirds of the entire earth 
01:00:31
is going to experience the glory of God, 
01:00:33
the fire of God, baptism and fire coming. 
01:00:36
There's no one out there, no human, no demon 
01:00:38
that can stop that from falling on this earth. 
01:00:40
Let me tell you what it is to do. 
01:00:41
It burns all fear out of you. 
01:00:44
It burns all anything that you've been substituting 
01:00:47
something for God for. 
01:00:48
It's going to burn fear out. 
01:00:50
It's going to burn confusion out. 
01:00:51
It's going to burn hate out, anger out. 
01:00:54
It's going to burn out of you when it touches you. 
01:00:57
So no one can stop these. 
01:00:58
These are the things and days of God. 
01:01:01
It's the day of His power. 
01:01:03
It is not the day of His wrath. 
01:01:05
But some people are about the experience 
01:01:07
wrath because of sea, time and harvest. 
01:01:10
And there's no one on this earth that 
01:01:12
can stop that from happening. 
01:01:14
These are the days that God has decided on. 
01:01:17
These are His times on the earth. 
01:01:19
And no one can stop Him from doing so. 
01:01:21
Father, I thank you for helping those. 
01:01:23
God, to know how to take authority, 
01:01:25
to do that, to stand up for what is right, 
01:01:28
to declare and decree the goodness that's coming of God, 
01:01:31
His plans, His will, His way, in Jesus' name, 
01:01:35
and stop advertising the enemy who is a loser, loser, loser. 
01:01:41
I thank you. 
01:01:42
I'm on the winning side. 
01:01:43
God, help them to be on the winning side. 
01:01:45
Send your presence to flood their lives right now. 
01:01:48
The presence of God to flood you right now in Jesus' name. 
01:01:52
And power you, inspire you, encourage you. 
01:01:55
That, Father, is what they need right now. 
01:01:58
I thank you for giving it to them in Jesus' name. 
01:02:02
And we all said amen. 
01:02:04
Amen. 
01:02:05
Cat, tell people real quick. 
01:02:07
You've got two websites, RevealingHeaven.com. 
01:02:09
What can they get there? 
01:02:10
And then you've got catcur.com. 
01:02:12
Talk about those real quick. 
01:02:13
The comments where our store is. 
01:02:15
The Father gave me a corporation 
01:02:18
for one reason, to reveal and create heaven on earth. 
01:02:21
We reveal it through words, through meanings. 
01:02:24
We also reveal it through products. 
01:02:25
Like, I love this cup. 
01:02:27
The Holy Spirit showed me how to create this cup. 
01:02:30
And it says, I don't do demons. 
01:02:35
See that? 
01:02:37
That little lightning bolt right there 
01:02:39
is what Satan was cast out of heaven on. 
01:02:42
And the Holy Spirit said, please, add it to your cup 
01:02:45
so people can enjoy it. 
01:02:46
Every time they know, he was put down. 
01:02:49
He lost his position, his authority, and his power. 
01:02:52
And I can tell you, a lot of that's 
01:02:54
going to start happening again. 
01:02:55
So you can go there for RevealingHeaven.com. 
01:02:57
Our events are on that page also. 
01:03:00
Catcur.com is a place I call the spiritual platform 
01:03:03
for God, the Father, Holy Spirit, and Jesus 
01:03:06
to say whatever they want to say on that place. 
01:03:09
And I'm just going to remind everybody, 
01:03:12
I will never, ever message you, number one. 
01:03:16
I don't know how to message people on Facebook 
01:03:19
or any other form of media. 
01:03:21
I don't do that. 
01:03:22
I'm not going to message you and say, 
01:03:24
please give money to this missionary. 
01:03:26
Please give to this cause. 
01:03:27
That is someone trying to steal your money. 
01:03:31
You will never, ever get a message from me saying that, 
01:03:35
an email saying that, a text saying that. 
01:03:38
I'm not going to do it. 
01:03:40
So you know if that comes. 
01:03:41
That's a fraud and that's a fake trying to take your money. 
01:03:44
Don't send it. 
01:03:45
Don't give them any answer to what they're sending. 
01:03:47
Don't answer their email or their messaging. 
01:03:51
That is not true. 
01:03:53
And also, oh, she said she gave me something. 
01:03:56
What is your public Facebook page called? 
01:03:59
My public Facebook page is called the Catcur. 
01:04:05
The reason for that was when I went 
01:04:07
to make my public Facebook page. 
01:04:10
Catcur was taken. 
01:04:12
And the Holy Spirit said, just put the Catcur. 
01:04:15
And then they'll know what you. 
01:04:17
Well, guess what? 
01:04:17
It was available. 
01:04:19
The Catcur is my public Facebook page. 
01:04:21
It's also what my YouTube channel is called. 
01:04:25
And that will keep you clear. 
01:04:27
If anybody else texts you or uses my picture 
01:04:31
and says they're a different Facebook, 
01:04:33
tell them they're lying. 
01:04:35
And that is not me and pray for those people 
01:04:37
to delete them. 
01:04:42
All right, Cat, good. 
01:04:44
A quick message that tomorrow, well, Thursday. 
01:04:48
This is Tuesday, we're recording Thursday. 
01:04:51
Tomorrow for those watching, Hank Kuhneman will be our guest. 
01:04:54
So we haven't had him on for a long time. 
01:04:56
So we're really, really looking forward to having Hank on. 
01:04:59
We miss him a lot. 
01:05:00
So thank you, Cat. 
01:05:02
God bless you and your team. 
01:05:03
It was so nice to see your mom. 
01:05:04
We're going to have your mom on soon with you. 
01:05:07
And have her give us some pearls of wisdom. 
01:05:09
I miss you a lot. 
01:05:12
So listen, we enjoyed it today. 
01:05:14
It was very great. 
01:05:15
And I am really close to the spirit today. 
01:05:17
I'll tell you what, even reading about pets, 
01:05:20
I'm ready to weep. 
01:05:20
So anyway, thanks again for the day. 
01:05:23
We bless you and have a great day. 
01:05:25
And we will see you all tomorrow. 
01:05:27
God bless you. 
01:05:28
Bye. 
01:05:58

00:59
You 
01:29
Well, happy Wednesday September 14 2022 welcome to Elijah's dreams. I'm Steve Schultz host along with my wife 
01:40
We founded together both the Elijah list right there like this calm and Elijah streams 
01:46
Beginning 25 years ago. We are in the beginning of year 26 
01:50
I think if I'm saying that right bringing you the voice of the prophets and never has it been more important than in this specific time 
01:57
Frame when so much is going on many of you have heard I'm gonna say repeat it for a couple of days in a row 
02:04
We are off of YouTube until December 
02:07
First it's pretty much fine with me 
02:10
Because they're as soon as we get back on they're gonna be gunning force again 
02:14
They are trying to remove Christians that are conservative that are speaking anything on behalf of Trump 
02:19
And I will not relent because YouTube wants me to I'll get all the more stubborn and you know 
02:24
So we're trying to be wise so that we're not 
02:28
Abandoning the channel outright. We're gonna they're gonna have to force us off 
02:34
And but neither am I gonna overly try not to offend them because they're trying to be offended 
02:39
They don't want to not be offended 
02:41
They're trying to be offended so that they have a legitimate excuse 
02:44
We wait till December 31 all of our strikes disappear 
02:47
But that doesn't keep them from the next day giving us more strikes so they can take us off 
02:51
So just so you all know we will be off through and including the elections there 
02:57
But we we're gonna be on rumble 
02:58
The whole time rumble is getting just as large of views or almost as large of views as our best days on YouTube 
03:05
Maybe we're not quite there, but almost as large and we're usually on Facebook as well 
03:11
So be sure and tell your friends and family anyone that wants to know when we're gonna be on where 
03:16
Rubble and Facebook now and we will be back on YouTube December 
03:22
One I think is the date or whichever the Monday is close to that probably or whatever date is close to December 1 
03:29
Okay, so now cat will be on here in just a few minutes 
03:33
But you all have heard me talk about Mike and Laurie Sally 
03:36
Who have are helping us in two areas the wells being dug in Uganda and then the water projects 
03:43
We're working on right now. So without further delay, let's bring in Mike and Laurie Sally to kind of give us a report. Hey guys 
03:50
Hey, how you doing? Good. How's Mississippi this time of year? It's actually beautiful today. It's really starting to be fall weather 
03:58
So we're excited about that. Awesome. Now. Do you get snow? Probably not in the south. Do you do occasionally? 
04:04
Yeah, do you a couple years or so? Yeah, I lived in Dallas for a while 
04:08
And then I lived in Florida on the other side for a while. So we didn't see a lot of snow 
04:13
But yeah, we could get the you get the big thunderstorms and all that out there always that's our big thing. Yeah 
04:23
Well, listen, I know you guys have got a different things to share with us. I'm trying to decide 
04:29
Laurie should we start with how the Mississippi 
04:32
Water project came into being by meeting the mayor or where would you like to start? 
04:37
Sure, we can talk about that 
04:38
I don't know if everybody watching knows the devastation that's happening in Jackson, Mississippi, which is the capital of our state 
04:46
The water has the people have been on a boiled notice, which I don't know if that's common everywhere 
04:52
I didn't really I've never heard of it. Yeah, it's common here in Mississippi 
04:56
And I didn't really realize that till we moved back to the south in Mississippi several years ago 
05:01
It happens all the time in different areas. The water gets contaminated and so this has been something going on in Jackson 
05:08
for a really long time and 
05:10
So since you brought us on the team Steve to help begin investigating water issues here in the states 
05:16
Mike and I never realized right in our own backyard. Jack's struggling 
05:20
So we've been looking, you know knocking on doors and meeting different people about the water crisis is going on in the United States 
05:28
Which I didn't even realize it was so 
05:30
challenging here, but we were flying back from 
05:34
Vacation, I think it was in early June and 
05:37
I had actually been kind of sick the night before and had an upset stomach. So I didn't really sleep good 
05:42
So I didn't really look I don't know like travel worthy 
05:45
I actually felt like I was traveling back from Uganda like I've been on a long missions trip or something 
05:50
But I'm even that long so we are in the Atlanta airport and Mike looks across the way and he's he says 
05:56
I think that's the mayor of Jackson 
05:58
We've only seen him on TV and so I looked and I was like, yeah 
06:02
That that kind of looks like him and everybody was you know around him talking to him and stuff 
06:06
And I don't know why I did this but just in my mind just in my heart 
06:11
I said to the Lord Lord if you want to give him an encouraging word 
06:14
I I'd be willing to do it 
06:15
You're just gonna have to sit me next to him and that's just random 
06:19
I do that sometimes just to challenge myself because you know when you're talking about 
06:24
We're always talking about the prophetic and wanting to use it 
06:27
But if you don't put yourself out there, I don't know if you're not aware then then God really you know 
06:33
We didn't have an opportunity so I'm always you know since I've been walking in the prophetic 
06:36
I've been challenging myself in that so I think I said it so we get on we go to get on the plane 
06:42
you know you scan your boarding pass and 
06:44
Mike has all of the miles and he always gets upgraded any time we fly together man first-class Mike sally 
06:52
Back in the back, you know, and and he's a gentleman and always offers to give it to me 
06:56
But he has long legs so I let him sit in the front 
06:59
So I scan my boarding pass before Mike and it spits out a different seat number 
07:03
And I'm thinking oh well surely you know Mike's gonna get the same thing and he scans his and nothing happens 
07:09
And I'm like that's crazy. Well, I was gonna be sitting in a middle seat next to Mike 
07:13
And I actually love the window so this seat was the window so I said it was our last leg 
07:17
I said let me just take this seat. I'm tired. I'll sit there 
07:19
So I go and sit in on an 11 a and Mike's back in 29 
07:24
So I'm sitting down and you know just sitting there waiting the next thing 
07:28
I know the mayor comes walking down and he stops and he sits in the seat right next to wow 
07:35
And I start speeding like oh gosh did I really just say that to the Lord like I'll give him a word of encouragement 
07:41
So I just start thinking like what do you want to say God? What do you want to say? 
07:45
So we're sitting there and you know everybody's passing by and they're all talking to him then I just I don't know what to say 
07:51
I don't have any profound words. So I just turned to him and I just tell him exactly what just what I just told you 
07:58
Again, okay, I think I'm a crazy Christian. I don't know and he says to me 
08:02
He says, you know, there's no coincidences in the Bible 
08:06
That does not happen in the Bible and really he started to give me words of encouragement and I tell me 
08:12
You know, I want to pray for you 
08:13
how can we pray for you and he starts just kind of sharing his journey and how he got into being the mayor and 
08:19
He he just starts pulling out scriptures and he tells me what the meaning of Jackson means 
08:24
It means God is gracious and he just starts kind of prophesying the destiny over his city 
08:29
And I'm just blown away and I said well, I think maybe I sat next to you for me 
08:34
Not the other way 
08:36
Okay, you know, well, I just know there's more and I'll just keep praying 
08:39
So he put you know, they they take off and he puts on his mask and puts on his earplugs and he goes to sleep 
08:44
He's been on a business trip. I'm sure he's tired the whole time sitting there like Lord. What is it? 
08:49
Why do you have me sitting next to him? 
08:51
Then I remember there's a water issue in Jackson, Mississippi and their husband and I thought is that why? 
08:58
So as we're getting ready to land 
09:01
I take the last minute I have before he gets off the plane and I just mentioned to him 
09:05
Hey, we're working with an amazing group of people that really have a passion to bring clean water 
09:10
And I don't know if maybe that's why God put us together 
09:13
Do you think when we get off the plane, you know 
09:15
You can exchange numbers with my husband and we can maybe see see what God has and he says sure get off the plane 
09:21
Mike exchange numbers and he actually texted us later and set up a meeting 
09:26
Go to Jackson to his office meet with his cabinet and just share what Elijah streams is doing well 
09:33
He set up a meeting with his cabinet. Yes. Yes. It really shocked us. It was actually kind of a little 
09:39
overwhelming like to walk in there with all these and he's introducing us into the CFO and this person and this person and 
09:44
And we just start talking about the crisis and the issue and the challenges that they're having and and it really was an amazing 
09:52
Time and got to give it. We gave him some words of encouragement and in from that point on 
09:58
You know, we were gonna do some more meetings and figure out how we can help bring water clean water 
10:05
Kind of a staff stopgap measure because honestly the water system in Jackson is going to take 
10:09
millions of dollars to repair and so our our heart was like, okay, what can we do in the meantime to help people just like 
10:16
we're doing in Uganda and 
10:20
We shared with him about the water box 
10:22
Yeah, and so right after that this water crisis hit and it wasn't just a matter of we had some flooding issues 
10:29
But it wasn't just a matter of being on a boiled water alert 
10:32
It was a matter of no pressure in the lines 
10:34
And really many people that had no water not just dirty water, but no water to flush their toilets no water today 
10:42
And this is 
10:44
Yeah 
10:46
And it's this is a major city and you start thinking like wow 
10:49
This is actually happening here in the United States and so, you know, we were actually because of the live streams 
10:56
We were able to be in position here 
10:57
We were able to jump in and begin to help 
11:00
some other organizations that are that are situated in downtown Jackson and there's there's there's a couple of organizations that we 
11:07
worked with 
11:08
That were out delivering water because a lot of people couldn't even get out 
11:12
There was some elderly and some people that were just homebound for different reasons 
11:16
They couldn't even get out and get the water that was being given away. And so we got these jugs 
11:21
I think we have a video we can show you in a second here about that 
11:24
But one of the pastors that we worked with went out delivered these jugs of water to people all over the city that he knew 
11:31
We're lock-ins and so it was really ministered to him that a lot of streams came in and was being was willing to help 
11:38
Financially and also providing these water jugs. And so you want to show that video? 
11:42
Let's go ahead and play that video Emily go for it. Hey guys, my name is brother JJ Thompson 
11:47
I am the pastor here at Alternative Ministry and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to 
11:52
Let you know how much I appreciate the work and the things that you guys may do for us 
11:58
I want to think Elijah's stream you're donating these gallons of water cause we in Jackson, Mississippi 
12:04
You know, we have a water crisis 
12:06
But what we're doing we are being the middleman to help those that can't get out 
12:11
But I've been pastoring for 10 years been in minister 20 
12:15
But God is way too. I've got 60 years old to get me to do what I'm doing and I'm gonna say this 
12:20
I'm gonna be finished. I love what Paul said about pure religion 
12:25
It is happening to follow through this 
12:28
And I thank God for the passion. So again, thank you from Jackson, Mississippi. I'm brother JJ 
12:41
So that was so good, you know, he mentioned that that scripture 
12:44
I don't have it fully memorized, but it says pure religion undefiled as visiting the orphans and taking care of it 
12:49
I don't know if you guys have any more memories than I did, but that's what he was referring to 
12:52
He said, I don't know if y'all know what God said about here pure religion 
12:57
It's really in their distress 
13:00
You know, so think about they're in distress right now and we were able to go out and help people 
13:06
Deliver clean water to the elderly to the widows that were in distress because they couldn't even flush their toilets great now 
13:13
Talk about the water stations. Where are we on that? Yeah, so that's we're really excited about that 
13:18
We just got break through on that a couple of days ago and I actually have a meeting with them today after we get finished with this show 
13:24
There's these water boxes or filtration systems and we're actually partnering 
13:29
We're gonna provide three of them at this time possibly more in the future in Mississippi two of them will be with the Jackson Fire Department 
13:35
So we actually have partnered with the Jackson Fire Department. They just had the 
13:40
They're meeting with the city council that approved getting these boxes put into the fire department because that's one of the stations where people can come 
13:47
And get clean water and they've given out, you know, probably there's been six million 
13:53
Bottles of water or more given out in the past probably more than that actually by now 
13:58
And you think about these plastic bottles too, where are they going? 
14:01
They're going to the landfills and what how do we don't have a good recycling system in Mississippi? 
14:05
So this system allows people to have containers and there's a picture of Lee that we sent you guys of it 
14:11
But they can come and actually yeah, there it is right there come and fill up their containers and 
14:16
Get filtered water and then bring them back to their house and just keep coming back 
14:20
So they'll be regularly scheduled hours that they can go to the Jackson Fire Department 
14:24
And there's also a small town called Mount Bayou, Mississippi. That's a very poor area in Mississippi 
14:31
That we're gonna be providing a water box that had to have a lot of problems with their work 
14:34
These are kind of expensive. We don't normally do too much. We're telling people but I don't we isn't a cut aren't we investing a hundred thousand 
14:41
Dollars in three boxes. Okay. Okay, so that's huge investment and 
14:48
That includes now not only does that include the water box 
14:50
But the place that's hosting it like the the city or the fire department 
14:56
The water bills are covered any increase in their water bills are going to be covered for an entire year 
15:00
All the containers are covered all the training all the filtration systems. Everything is water testing the water testing regularly testing 
15:08
So it's something that we could do as a stopgap measure until they do, you know, it's Lori 
15:13
Dollars that I've actually heard a billion dollars to fix the water system here 
15:17
Really? Yeah a billion with a B. And so it's it's a big deal 
15:21
But you know, I was I was shocked you know, by the way, Elijah streams has done fifty three 
15:26
Wells in Uganda. So wow 
15:28
Over a thousand salvation. Yeah over a thousand now 
15:32
That is church is being planned and lands being given to to churches to plan because of this water 
15:39
It's it's absolutely unbelievable. I didn't realize, you know, I knew there was a problem in Uganda 
15:44
I didn't realize there was a problem here. No, I mean, yeah, we don't think of that. Well when we've been 
15:49
Examining you and us you guys and us guys 
15:52
We've been you know by trying to get some because the Lord spoke to us about Native Americans and and their needs are huge 
15:58
But they tend to be spread out 
16:00
So it's hard to put a central well in one spot because they're mild the summer will live miles away in a massive reservation 
16:07
Plus they you if you don't drill really deep which is really expensive 
16:12
You're gonna get what arsenic and things like that in the water, right? 
16:15
Yeah, there's some of the wells there that we've gotten quotes for over a million dollars for one water well 
16:20
And then you're not even completely sure it's gonna be clean water 
16:23
So it's a there's a lot more to that than just going into a reservation drilling 
16:28
It also takes about five years from what I understand for the entire permit process to get approved 
16:33
So it's very challenging. We are working on a few projects. We could talk about later 
16:37
But we do have a few projects with Native Americans that we're working on 
16:40
Um, that we believe we'll be able to to be doing pretty soon 
16:44
And on the uh, there's words. I'm looking at the note. We're waiting for cat to arrive 
16:48
So we've got a couple of minutes. They'll tell me when she arrives 
16:50
But uh on those water boxes. Did you say how many those will serve or to do or tend to serve? 
16:57
Well, we don't know for sure about a lot of people. I mean, there's still lines of cars everywhere that there's water distribution centers 
17:04
Even still today, there's lines of people waiting and that's just with the government's the government assigned spots 
17:11
There's also many churches and nonprofits that are also doing and so even the other day 
17:15
We were driving to town and we looked over and there was a church or some organization that was providing clean water 
17:20
And it was lines of cars 
17:22
Waiting waiting two and three hours in line to get to water. Well, and that's scripture that I quoted a lot 
17:30
I don't can't remember the exact quote. I've got it on a piece of paper, but I can't reach it 
17:33
But this is where Jesus says Jesus said if you even give so much as a cup of cold water one cup to one of these you'll not 
17:41
Um 
17:41
Lose your reward. Does that apply to the water boxes and the water bottles? Absolutely. Why I mean you're providing clean water, you know 
17:49
And so it's definitely there's a lot of rewards that will not be lost 
17:52
And there's a lot of people that you'll meet in heaven one day that'll be like, thank you for contributing to my clean water 
17:58
And you may be like, what did I do? 
18:00
Well, you sewed into Elijah's streams ministries and they provided a water box in Jackson, Mississippi 
18:05
And I was able to provide clean water for my kids and for my family and I was able to flush my toilets and 
18:10
Just the basic stuff and so yeah, it's it's definitely making a huge impact on people and just the heart behind it 
18:16
That's the other thing. It's like there's the practical aspect of the water 
18:20
but 
18:21
People are constantly asking me why would an organization all the way to organ care about us 
18:26
Right, and that's even more powerful sometimes and I think the physical water just to know that there's people out there that cares, you know 
18:33
And so it was great that we were positioned here in this in this state to be able to help quickly 
18:39
Yeah, and one of the things we've all learned is that you know 
18:41
When we when you agreed to come because you're you're still doing the you've gone to project 
18:47
That's your project with show mercy, but then you're working with us full time as well 
18:52
as 
18:52
As those how those work out you can work at two places full time believe it or not, but 
18:58
We didn't I think my simplistic thinking was we'll come here 
19:02
We'll start identifying the projects and we'll start drilling wells immediately and that was a that was uh an amazing 
19:10
um 
19:11
Learning process for me because I thought well as long as we're willing to pay the project will present themselves 
19:17
And we won't have to work for it, but that wasn't true. So 
19:20
Um, by the way, they're telling me that cat is here now 
19:23
So we're going to go in a second, but I want to thank you guys and honor you guys if we you know 
19:28
We go way back our our daughter used to babysit your daughters and now one's married and one's about to be married. So 
19:36
That's amazing. We you guys we've been at this for what? I said 20 years. We've known you or 
19:40
About 20 years. Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing. But you know, I'm gonna speak on behalf of you guys 
19:45
I I know your lives. I know your commitment. I know your walk with the lord and and 
19:49
I'm just very proud of you and lory. What a great story with the mayor 
19:53
Are you kidding? I mean you said I gotta end with this 
19:56
But you said lord if you want me to give him word, you're gonna have to 
19:59
Sit me down with him. You put your ticket in and it gives you it suddenly changes your seat to the one next to the mayor 
20:05
That's the other thing. I didn't say his seat got changed too. Yeah, really 
20:10
After I told him he said, okay, I have to be honest with you when he pulled out 
20:13
He said my seat got changed as well. Oh, man 
20:16
He knew that he knew and I told him and so it's so fun how god 
20:20
I mean the the the devastation and the hardship that's going right now is terrible 
20:25
But it's so crazy. God is so good to just little bitty things set you up at the right place at the right time 
20:31
I so love that. I so love that. You know, we're told to go out in the highways and byways to compel them to come in 
20:38
And that's where you know, that's literally the highways and byways and another 
20:42
Another part of that says and along the hedges. Well, what is the hedges? 
20:45
Those are where your neighbors next door are looking over the hedges going. What's with these people 
20:50
Go along the hedges and compel them to come in. So I I wrote an article about that one day 
20:55
I said, have you gone compelling lately? 
20:57
You know, so you go we need to go out and compel them to come make it feel 
21:02
Compelling to come and check out the king of guides. So god bless you guys. Thank you. We love you so much 
21:08
And we're gonna go ahead and put it. We'll see you all later and let's go ahead with cat cat and steve. Here we go 
21:30
And good morning, how are you cat? 
21:33
Oh, her sound is muted. She's muted your channel. There you go. There you go 
21:42
So good to see you they might want to square you up a little bit. You're kind of a little bit out to the side 
21:47
There you go. Look at that. How are you? 
21:50
I'm doing great ahead a little bit of time to recover from 
21:53
Though that women's conference was so powerful up in the mountains. Oh my goodness and and then I did two meetings also for 
22:01
Um, uh, where's it called? 
22:05
Gateway I'm out Zion. Oh my goodness, you know, they had a fire in their sanctuary their church 
22:10
But they've had a big tent and people are coming everywhere anyway 
22:15
The guy said he's pushing them into the into the new right now 
22:18
He's pushing them out there and they've had so many things and more actual things happen 
22:23
It didn't stop them never so 
22:25
They were down David and DD Thompson. You ever in golden Colorado make sure you stop by and see them a mile high in the sky 
22:32
They were they were just really powerful really awesome meeting. That's amazing. That's amazing. You so you were in Denver then 
22:40
No, we flew into Denver and we went to Denver and we went to uh copper mountain, which is a big resort 
22:45
They were having their women's conference there and that's really up high people 
22:50
But what a beautiful place it was and I'll just have to say this two thumbs up for Jen 
22:56
she did 
22:58
No, she was so funny and we needed that my daughter cam was thursday night and she was so right on 
23:05
Really blessed all the women and then and loved on all she's um, she's amazing my daughter even though 
23:10
I've never seen your daughter. I'll have to find a youtube of her or something 
23:13
I've never seen your daughter or heard her speak Kim has a lot of revelation about raising children to be powerful 
23:22
Children of God not way to their odor and I'm telling you their kids are really really 
23:28
Operating the gifts and everything. They're very young 
23:30
so she had a lot of really uh 
23:33
Good things and tips to give to the women 
23:35
But she also operates very powerfully and in intercession and stuff like that. So she was thursday night 
23:41
I was friday night. It was really of course. It was always powerful God showed up and 
23:46
It was life changing for the women and then of course Jen was saturday morning 
23:51
Really Jen spoke 
23:53
Jen spoke 
23:55
Let me tell you she she just blew him away and it's really very funny. She gives a single person's eye view 
24:03
of married life 
24:05
From living with us for so long and you know, we have 
24:08
Interesting 
24:09
So we have a lot of families. So she's got a lot of um 
24:13
revelation also very funny things that happen 
24:17
Uh throughout her lifetime living with different ones of us, but also her own testimony is amazing 
24:24
So but she was funny and what was it called Jen? I'm going to ask her again 
24:28
What was the name of the she named not only named her um 
24:32
Her program she had but she made a t-shirt for it and had her own little logo on it because she loves coffee 
24:39
He said coffee and comedy with Jen. This was oh look at that. She wore that t-shirt 
24:46
All right, I can tell you it was hilarious. So we 
24:51
See that video too. You have guys that have to send me a link where I can watch Jen and I can watch your daughter 
24:56
I'd love to see both of those. Oh, yeah, it was really awesome and and then of course the meetings 
25:00
We had people come from around the world to the one um that was at their church on mount zine. It was amazing 
25:07
So so good 
25:09
Well cat, let's see. Let me jump into you throw it to you and anything that's on your heart to share right now before 
25:14
We get into questions about heaven and when people ask other questions 
25:19
They're sometimes they're not about heaven, but they're almost all very very very interesting. So 
25:24
So what anything on your heart to share this morning before we get into that? 
25:28
I can just say that that um 
25:31
Sunday morning this last Sunday morning. I did spirit force in a way never done before 
25:35
Really it's so 
25:37
Um, so complete powerful that you leave that you left that meaning knowing exactly who you were in christ 
25:45
Wow, what's your whole salvation experience look like in the spirit realm? 
25:49
What are our weapons that we get is the army of god that the bible clearly says we are in the army of god 
25:55
And it was just really empowering and very very 
25:59
I had said kind of intense, but it was amazing. And so I will thoroughly enjoy doing all my spirit force meetings 
26:06
We'll be doing some more online, but I believe they this I believe if you go back you may be able to watch this one 
26:12
Yeah, that was this last sunday and um 
26:15
Is it go g o m z? I think is g o m z is their website dot or 
26:21
Yeah, g o m z dot organ dot organ or or you can go on gateway on mount zine 
26:27
Facebook or gateway on mount zion's facebook page and uh emily uh or michael one of you could you put that under the 
26:35
Rumble or in the comments. However, you do it 
26:37
Is I knew more of the youtube system than this one 
26:40
But I put it under facebook so people can see that that'd be awesome if we give them that link so 
26:45
Now can I got to ask you a question? Well anything else because I have a question to launch our other questions, but um 
26:51
And it's kind of a blended question. So let me ask it to you this way 
26:57
Um, we get from time to time people say well cat must have lots of new and exciting 
27:03
Experiences, I think you probably when you go there must you must be a little bit surprised each time with something 
27:08
He shows you that you hadn't seen before 
27:11
And has there been anything recently you think boy, I'd like to tell people about that when I was caught up 
27:16
There are things but first of all, I'd like of course to mention queen Elizabeth 
27:21
Okay, and because there's a lot of of course buzz going on about that, you know 
27:26
And I think it probably bothers me personally a little bit that everybody automatically thinks people went to hell 
27:32
I don't know why um, you know, christ is for us. He's not against this and she clearly and I just have to say queen Elizabeth 
27:39
Is in heaven people if she is there and god is giving her rewards because 
27:45
She's had one of the longest running um 
27:49
I can't remember what you think 
27:53
That allowed 
27:55
God in that country 
27:57
Okay, and and talked all the time about jesus christ on every special uh holiday they had she always mentioned to him every single time 
28:06
She had uh like a message to give to her kingdom and the people of uh, england and and the surrounding countries there 
28:14
It was always positive and she didn't just be positive herself 
28:19
She always talked about god. She talked about jesus christ 
28:23
He totally was allowed and because when when you are the head of something and you allow jesus christ 
28:31
As a monarch to come into that country there is no way she's not going to escape being greatly rewarded 
28:37
For for the longevity of her of her monarchy and how much she loved jesus christ 
28:43
So people queen elizabeth is in heaven there. That's the most important thing. I could say today 
28:49
Okay, the controversy was going on. You know, there's always so many things made up about stuff 
28:54
And she didn't have enemies against her because they didn't like it that she 
28:58
Didn't want evil and she didn't want to let certain things to happen in that country 
29:03
So there you are straight from the throne room people queen elizabeth made it to heaven really good 
29:07
Can you can you elaborate on what you said a minute ago? You said I don't I don't know why people always think people are going to help 
29:14
Now you you are one that also believes some people go to hell. I know that 
29:18
So can you elaborate on that? So is it that? 
29:22
Uh, you absolutely know many go to hell 
29:24
But is it that more people go to heaven than most of us think or what? 
29:28
Probably more people go to heaven now than ever before. Okay. It is because of the availability of the word 
29:36
Uh, you know of the message about the the kingdom christ in the kingdom that you talked about that we rule in with them 
29:43
There's so much revelation out there right now 
29:46
There's almost kind of no excuse if you have a computer have any access to a computer 
29:51
People by the millions are looking at people's sites that talk about jesus a lot 
29:57
Even if they don't talk about heaven they want to know about him 
30:00
That's good 
30:00
So I think now more because back way back in those days like in the day of jesus they of course didn't have the internet 
30:06
They didn't have television. They didn't even have radio. That's why he walked over 
30:10
He traveled so much himself to share the kingdom 
30:13
But the news about him still to this day is going around the world 
30:18
And those there are many many many more 
30:21
Millions of believers now than ever before in the world 
30:25
And ministries and places for help that there certainly would be more 
30:29
Um more people going to heaven now than ever before and yes, people do go to hell. They're wicked. They're evil. They hate everything 
30:37
Uh, their soul is so corrupted and they don't want to repent for things. You know, that's their choice 
30:43
Yeah, as the father has shared with me before 
30:47
He doesn't keep people out of heaven and he doesn't send them to hell 
30:52
Because people are always saying, you know, uh, a loving father wouldn't send people to hell 
30:56
He doesn't he gave everything he had to make a way for you to come to heaven. So that's where his love is 
31:02
He loves us so much. He loves the people in the world 
31:05
He even desires that the vial center be free free from what sin 
31:09
Yeah, sin and have his son so they could come to heaven 
31:13
He's just not going to allow heaven to be like the earth. He's just not going to do it 
31:17
He's not willing to pollute heaven to file heaven by people who bring that with them because they carry it and that's how they live 
31:24
So the father actually said tell them it's just just the opposite 
31:28
A loving father would make a way for them to come to heaven and he clearly 
31:33
And so all right by that you mean he didn't send people to hell by that. Do you mean they choose hell themselves? 
31:39
That's what he said. They choose to go there. They make up their own choice in their own will 
31:43
There's a scripture in the bible that says I make myself known to everyone. Yeah, so in their soul in some way 
31:51
He says he makes himself known that means you'll have an opportunity a choice sometime in your life 
31:58
Or he will impress upon you to know him and the scripture is never wrong 
32:02
And I've had a lot of people say I wasn't even thinking about something and sitting where just contemplating all of a sudden 
32:07
The thoughts started pouring into me that I needed to know Jesus Christ 
32:11
And then the love of God would sweep over these people and they would just be convicted 
32:17
And then they would want to know him then they would receive him. So that's how far he goes 
32:22
Yeah, make sure that they know there is a loving God 
32:26
And this whole thing that we're living in and around this world 
32:29
It didn't happen in a big bang people and there's many scientists that know that there was creation 
32:35
Creation did happen and it's even the evidence of even over the ages is very clear even in the foundation of our earth 
32:42
And the way it was made 
32:44
So I know you evolutionists you you would like to think yourself 
32:47
You get to choose everything including where you're going to end up in some wonderful place. There's only two choices 
32:53
There's either Jesus Christ in heaven 
32:56
Or you choose satan who is the lord of the flies and you will be in hell not just hell forever 
33:01
You'll be in the lake of fire forever. So I want to encourage people seeking your own soul 
33:07
What would keep you from wanting to know him? 
33:09
What would keep you from wanting to receive all that that God has for you in heaven and that christ died for you 
33:15
Do you have there's that scripture and I'm sorry part. Sorry that I don't have that reference to it, but it says 
33:21
Uh, it's it's a new covenant scripture. It says this the covenant I'll make with them after that time 
33:27
And 
33:28
It goes on 
33:30
Sorry that I don't have it in front of me, but it says no more will a man say to his neighbor 
33:34
Know the lord for the or his brother know the lord for they'll all know me from the least of the greatest 
33:39
What is that scripture referring to if you know? 
33:43
I'm pretty sure that it's referring to the times because he's talking about a time. There'll be a time that's happened 
33:48
Right, we're entering into that time right now because what he is about to do 
33:53
And there's a lot of people who don't like me talking about they don't like hank robin 
33:57
Johnny they don't like there's people who don't like they think we're rocking the boat 
34:01
No, we're trying to get you in the boat people. Yeah, so that you don't die a horrible a horrible death and end up 
34:08
Throughout eternity. No, we're gonna say the truth prophets a true prophet god will always always speak the words 
34:15
Of revelation from the father from Jesus from holy spirit and the truth is what makes you free 
34:22
Not all these other things that are lies that are deceptions. They don't make you free 
34:26
They control you they keep you trapped and so you need to know the truth so that you will be free 
34:32
And there is a way to be free from evil from from wickedness from hell from 
34:37
Satan ruling over your life 
34:39
Getting caught up in witchcraft or other things 
34:42
And you don't want to live your life like that because this is a very short life 
34:46
But the way you live this life will determine where you end up and there's two places a bend to boat 
34:52
Yeah, you do not want to go to hell 
34:56
When I started getting to know you cat and I've said this on the air once or twice before with you 
35:01
I don't know if you'll remember this may have spent probably a year 
35:04
But I was raised with the fear that my least little stumble. I would not go to heaven now 
35:10
My tradition taught that you don't there's not an eternal hell. You just burn up. That's it 
35:15
But I was afraid to just burn up and that's yeah, I wanted to go to heaven 
35:18
But I felt like I was taught that it would be really easy to be deceived 
35:25
And now I'm on the other side of that. It's on the flip side of that where it's almost like 
35:31
This is just my language not biblical language. It's almost like God's looking for loopholes to get you saved 
35:36
That's how it feels like he's going if I don't get him saved this way 
35:40
I'll get him saved that way and you know, there's that scripture. I think it's Romans 10 9 
35:43
but we can believes in his heart and confesses with his mouth and Jesus the Lord and and believes that God raised him from the dead 
35:50
from the dead will 
35:52
Be saved so there are people in various stages of maturity or immaturity who we might not even say 
35:59
God, you know, if they died they probably would say 
36:03
They they didn't make it but if if a person in the privacy of their bedroom says, you know what? 
36:09
I think I do believe that I think I do 
36:11
And for the first time he says it in his heart and says it with his mouth 
36:15
And then he dies right after that. He's he's going to heaven. Yes, he is he really is he certainly is going to go to heaven 
36:22
And yes, they're always watching from heaven. And let me tell you a holy spirit is so busy on this earth 
36:28
A holy spirit leads people of he impresses people. He's even these people who are not believers 
36:35
He's still going around those seek seeking for those who might know Christ or want to know Christ 
36:42
They they have so many angels and members of the host the army of heaven 
36:47
whose very 
36:49
Assignment is to lead people to the place where they can hear the truth know the truth or even have them meet individuals 
36:55
Who know answers that they need to know so they can get born again and absolutely? Yes, if the father said he desires 
37:03
That's a strong word. He desires the vilest most evil sinner 
37:09
Be safe because his son paid a price for everybody 
37:13
But they do have to choose and it doesn't matter if it's in the last breath 
37:18
If you did it as a child and you receive Christ in syria 
37:22
And and I tell you I remember when I got born again at age four that never left me 
37:27
I knew that I knew that I knew I was going to heaven at age four. I knew Jesus Christ 
37:32
Wow 
37:33
And so even children very young can fully give themselves to christ and they're raising an atmosphere that's so 
37:40
So bad, you know god will watch over them. It's not like it was me 
37:46
That that was me. I mean I was raised and I gave my heart to the lord very early 
37:50
I was baptized in that almost cult setting 
37:54
But I knew I'd I'd received Jesus christ. I knew about his death on the cross except for that even though there's 
38:00
And then I lived a significant portion of my life after that in all kinds of drudgery 
38:06
I don't and you know most stations and all of that. So you were talking about if somebody 
38:12
Look, I don't know how far to push this question 
38:15
But I mean if there's a current person who's a pedophile and that's during this horrible sin 
38:22
Cat and then they died but if you look back on that person's life when they were a child and they said Jesus 
38:28
I want you 
38:30
Does the lord remember that or did they throw that away in the meantime? What I keep saying he throws it away 
38:36
I know that that stuff would not be allowed in heaven at all 
38:39
And even if was like I said before even at near the death of a person 
38:45
Let's say they haven't died, but they're close to that 
38:48
Even if they're unconscious the holy spirit can speak to those people 
38:52
Wow, and that does happen because we've had people not died. It came so close to death 
38:58
That people thought for sure they would never survive and they came out of that coma or whatever that was 
39:04
And said that they were that they saw Jesus christ. I mean there's testimonies everywhere that happened 
39:09
I know like ian, you know, I always go back to ian who's the one I think he was a surfer 
39:15
Yeah, something like that. Ian, I can't remember. Yeah, I'm like jellyfish and I'm telling you what Jesus pursued him 
39:21
But through that whole time until I think he flatlined 
39:25
He was in the morning in the morgue of the hospital. I think 
39:28
And jesus presented himself caught him up presented himself and said your mother has never stopped praying for yourself 
39:36
And jesus moved his hand in this person who had he died and he saw his mother praying and crying out to god 
39:43
Do not let and she didn't know that he had died people 
39:47
She didn't even know that he was in that situation, but this was her nightly thing that she had prayed god 
39:51
Don't let my son go to hell. Please reach out to him 
39:54
I i'm i'm declaring that he will be in heaven eternity with me 
39:58
And he'll have an opportunity to know you and and in here from you 
40:02
And so because of her prayers, she was a very godly woman 
40:06
He wouldn't let those prayers fall to the ground. So when he flatlined 
40:10
And was actually falling into hell. That's a testimony falling into hell 
40:17
You have to remember that christ has the keys 
40:20
To hell death and the grave those are time frames from the time you are dying and to your death 
40:27
And any of those times if there was somebody like in's mother 
40:32
Who is faithful to him who loved him has served christ and would cry out on his behalf every night 
40:37
It says if you believe in your heart and don't let your words drop to ground 
40:41
She will not let them be wasted. He'll answer that and so that this is this was his answer to ian's mother's prayers 
40:48
And here is this this guy who was actually died flatline. He was in the morning had a tag on his toe 
40:54
And she just said because of your mother 
40:57
And her belief in me her trust and promise in me because of her own declarations 
41:02
I have to i have to take her words and give you an opportunity. Do you want me now? 
41:08
And this person caught up in the spirit somewhere not actually in in heaven 
41:12
This was outside of heaven, but it was still up in the spirit realm 
41:15
And he said, um, do you want me now and this guy began to weep and weep and say i'm not worthy of you 
41:20
I don't deserve this, you know, I was wicked and jesus kept saying yes, but your mother 
41:26
I can't let her words fall to the ground my word gives a promise 
41:30
And so he said 
41:32
Well, then he said of course. Yes, I will receive him. He really then he really started crying 
41:37
And i think christ reached out and touched him. He said life like he never felt before 
41:42
Because he remember he said he received christ life slowed into his body 
41:47
and he was so on fire uh for christ and 
41:51
He he was totally changed in that moment 
41:54
And jesus said now 
41:56
Do you want to go with me and he moved and he could see heaven behind christ 
42:01
And his hunger was so great for that. He said do you want to go with me now or you want to go back 
42:07
And ian was really struggling. He says, you know, I want to come so much 
42:12
But if I went now my mother would not know I went to heaven. So please send me back 
42:16
christ sent him back 
42:18
He came back into his body the dead body in the morgue 
42:22
He was looking over him about to do an autopsy 
42:25
And and the guy freaked out the the doctor freaked out and he goes, why are you alive? 
42:31
Sits up totally whole like he never died 
42:35
He goes, I have to find my mother and the guy goes, don't you go anywhere? 
42:38
And so this doctor runs out ian runs down the hall 
42:42
Because he probably had his wrappings on or whatever and he finds an outfit 
42:46
I think it was some 
42:48
Some kind of output, you know, uh like a doctor's assistant or something 
42:51
And he puts it on runs out of the hospital and goes to his mother 
42:55
And she was so undone 
42:57
What christ had done because of her prayers and ian goes all over the world right now 
43:03
And actually gives this personal testimony. These are those are the very words he spoke and because of his uh 
43:11
Because of his mother and what she believed and stood for him 
43:14
And he had been angry also one of the other things about ian is he got really angry about somebody 
43:21
Didn't want to forgive them either. So christ said you have to forgive that person 
43:26
So he did forgive that person and this is when he was in his spirit body 
43:30
So don't ever think that christ can't do something 
43:35
If you're standing for your family's salvation, I know the very first time I was caught up to heaven 
43:40
And christ when he was bringing me back said please tell everybody never stop praying 
43:46
For their loved ones salvation because I will be listening 
43:50
That's so easy. He actually had the keys. He was wearing the keys right then and he showed me these keys 
43:56
He said these keys don't hang on a hook in heaven 
43:59
He said uh, when you die, there's a judgment that comes it says can can you be taken to heaven or not taken to heaven 
44:06
And he has opportunity if there are people standing in in agreement or they're they're 
44:12
Declaring that their family members are those who they call family members people who they love like family. Yeah 
44:18
to 
44:19
Um that they will not miss heaven then christ has the right 
44:25
Because of our declarations 
44:28
Are we're standing what we're believing for? 
44:30
And then he has the right to use those keys and I've I've since I was shown that I've heard so many testimonies 
44:36
Just come in saying 
44:38
You know, I was one of those people I died or right at my death christ appeared to me 
44:42
And ask if I wanted him and so it is true that really does happen 
44:46
Can I ask you a question about the non-loved ones that but they're people who? 
44:51
For instance Ruth Bader Ginsburg died as far as anyone that I know knows she never received the lord 
44:57
It was totally pro-abortion, but a lot of people I'm aware of have prayed had prayed for her for years and years and years 
45:05
What couldn't you say about that? 
45:07
Sort of thing this guy'd say look all these people have been praying for you 
45:10
I have to give you one more chance that kind of thing 
45:13
I haven't seen her in heaven that doesn't mean she's not and I understand what you're talking about 
45:18
There are groups actually that um that christ or holy spirit encourage people to start these groups 
45:25
There is a group of believers very strong 
45:29
Intercessors who really know christ and have prayed in different moves of god and everything 
45:34
They have a list of celebrities in hollywood probably close to 50 years 
45:40
Wow 
45:41
Without fail have prayed for every one of these people and I did see some of those people 
45:47
Because I met someone who was a part of that group and I was I was just overwhelmed at their 
45:52
Their fierceness to have these people have christ have opportunities to receive christ 
45:57
They were they actually stood there's something about standing in the gap 
46:01
Yeah, that's another thing also that allows them to use if there's some standing in the gap 
46:05
Especially if it's a prayer of agreement, especially if it's a group and that's what they do and have focused themselves to do that 
46:12
Then those people will be given an opportunity also. That's so good that you said that because last night, okay cat 
46:17
You didn't know that I had this experience, but last night I'm praying alone 
46:22
Either that or early this morning one of those two 
46:25
Kind of runs together, but I started that scripture came to me where jesus said so I looked for a man 
46:31
To stand in the gap so that I would not have to bring judgment 
46:35
I don't have that one memories either, but I said lord you only needed one man 
46:39
Or one woman to stand a gap and at that point he said so but I found then so I then I swear by myself that 
46:45
But uh, so he there are major issues and people's lives 
46:51
Where all god needs is one person to stand in the gap 
46:55
Yes, that true 
46:56
It is true. It is very true 
46:59
But because there's there's different there's different things that make it possible for him to use those keys 
47:06
Yeah, and even for the the keys and all that other stuff came up even before all that happened 
47:11
And we know in the bible how many were just one that prayed for whole cities to be saved 
47:18
you know and that 
47:19
And uh, I and I do know that that happened also and yeah 
47:23
And god had mercy on people because that one person's staying and stood in the gap and said please don't kill them 
47:30
Please allow them to live for the purpose of having an opportunity 
47:34
He did it back in the old testament and that's before christ came 
47:37
And god god himself had mercy on people 
47:41
So now with christ and his sacrifice is made and I am serving not in any way saying 
47:46
Everyone's going to be in heaven. That is not going to happen. Right. That's right. I don't hear you say because I've clarified that 
47:52
Will be in heaven that would not have been there 
47:55
Except that he had the chance to use these keys and I'm telling you I've saw hell 
47:59
And I don't talk about it a lot because in these days 
48:01
I mean he doesn't want me to talk a lot about that 
48:03
He wants me to encourage people get people empowered to know who they are in christ because some people 
48:08
They don't even have a clue what they carry in their self as a believer and what god has given them as a believer 
48:14
And I think that meaning I did a spirit force this last sunday 
48:18
Absolutely tells you what it means to be a believer. It's very very powerful 
48:23
I wasn't expecting them to say all that that I said I thought we'd have maybe a 30 40 minute meeting and it was far beyond that 
48:29
But people were weeping in the in the con in the conversation. They were they were laughing. They were weeping 
48:34
They were so empowered and found out things they never knew about their self being a believer 
48:39
But if you're going to be operating in spirit force, you have to know what is that? 
48:44
What is that spirit force? What does it mean? 
48:47
What what does it give us to be able to do for christ and with christ? 
48:51
Then you have to know who you are first before you can even start 
48:54
I mean if you're in the military 
48:55
Let's just say the military because we are in god's army. I'm not talking about heaven's army at all the host 
49:02
They were made for that purpose but ourselves as a believer 
49:05
We do have promises 
49:08
That christ gave us about who we are and the authority we had the dominion we have 
49:12
And and that we had power over the enemy so many scriptures and those people got a lot of those scriptures 
49:18
And so but it was very powerful that for the first time they knew who they were in christ 
49:22
And they had no fear about anything. They knew they had a story how to use that a story 
49:28
It was an amazing meeting 
49:30
So it matters that you make a difference in this world 
49:33
By by sharing things with people by loving people caring about people 
49:38
And yet you cannot partake of the darkness if you can speak to people and it's not really a wise 
49:44
Decision to have a very close friend who is wicked and evil you will not win them just because you're their friend 
49:52
And most of the time the opposite thing happens. It really does 
49:55
It just has just the way it is 
49:57
That if you're not a strong believer yourself and you're saying well, I'm going to keep this friend 
50:01
I'll keep talking to them about christ. I'm not saying don't do that 
50:05
But I'm saying as your best friend 
50:07
It is wise to have someone as a believer 
50:10
Or if you could partner with you in prayer maybe go out with you to to witness and stuff like that 
50:14
Well, that's that whole scripture about don't be unequally yoked, right? It can it can apply to marriages 
50:19
It can apply to friendships. It can apply to business 
50:23
Yeah, yeah, really really good cat awesome 
50:26
You know and I the whole thing that got Ian guy that story we've talked about it before several times 
50:31
it never gets old to me because 
50:33
God is by that testimony God himself of course knew this was going to be a worldwide testimony at the moment 
50:39
He was doing it. He knew that because why don't you want that as a testimony because he wanted praying mothers and sons and 
50:45
daughters and sisters and brothers to know you can stand for 
50:48
A person and he will absolutely he had the keys of hell death in the grave 
50:52
You said he had him in his hand 
50:54
Yeah, and and you can say to the lord I mean I with that I might say 
50:58
If I had a loved one that I as far as I knew had never received christ and now he's in a coma and dying 
51:03
I would say 
51:05
Jesus you have the keys to the hell death in the grave. I'm standing for this 
51:08
I'm believing I'm trusting you for this person salvation. They didn't want it with their life, but trust me in my heart 
51:15
I know they want it now. You know, I guess I'd pray along that line right anything else 
51:19
You would be a perfect thing to say to christ 
51:22
He's waits for words like that to be spoken 
51:25
He really waits for people to say things like that 
51:28
And you know, you know, you have friends you have family 
51:32
We jokingly used to call them the black sheep. I don't know people 
51:35
What is that? Yeah, I was about being involved in darkness and stuff and it's hard to be around them 
51:41
But you love them. Yeah, that's the best thing you can do is just stain them the gap and even say you need to 
51:46
I would say that say father 
51:48
Jesus, I'm standing in the gap for this family member. This is their name 
51:52
That I don't want to see them go to hell. I want them to see 
51:55
To receive jesus christ, please and thank you for making that possible 
51:59
Before they pass and go go to hell, you know, make sure that they get to do that 
52:03
Yeah, and they actually write that down. They'll write it down and they're gonna go after that person 
52:07
I'm telling you, they'll go after them while they're living and even at their very death 
52:11
Uh at that time when he can use the keys. He uses the keys 
52:15
Almost at the point of death or right past death people go. Well, that's not possible. Well, you're not god 
52:22
Yeah 
52:23
And you can make that either so don't say that you know things when you don't know anything about it 
52:28
I mean, he wouldn't have the scriptures that stand stand with that that practice to love people to pray for them 
52:36
And that you wouldn't want to see them go to hell and yes, he will because your words allow him 
52:42
To use those keys 
52:44
By satan satan had him so nobody could use them and i'm not making that up either satan had those keys 
52:51
And there was a time back in the now when he would just go take anybody out 
52:55
He wanted to you need to you need to hear both sides of those keys 
52:59
Why did christ take them? 
53:01
Why did he take them back? Why did he take them away from him? 
53:04
Because those were there's those were made for a certain specific reason to have but there's authority in those keys 
53:12
And but to get those keys back he had to die as a righteous person 
53:16
This had to happen so that he would go into hell and he would be blameless 
53:21
He would be righteous. They gave him every authority 
53:25
To take those keys away from satan who had no right for them 
53:29
But satan takes advantage of anything he can do 
53:32
He'll lie to you if you can to see if you can 
53:35
He'll do anything he can to you and get away with it for a long time 
53:37
But in these days people are getting more and more aware. I'm not having a part of that 
53:41
I'm not participating in that evil or that wickedness. I'm having no part of it. I serve Jesus christ and I serve him alone 
53:47
Um, the enemy doesn't want to hear words like that coming from you 
53:51
But he really doesn't like it that he lost those keys and he can in no way interfere with christ using them 
54:02
I just have to point out to you those keys are real 
54:05
and they do give christ 
54:07
The ability to go even at the moment of death 
54:12
or as someone is falling into hell 
54:14
or they're being buried 
54:17
Yeah, I mean what what that's real that story indicates because you know 
54:24
I was drilled in is drilled into me as a kid. It's appointed unto men. What's to die and after that the judgment 
54:29
So they would say 
54:31
This is not possible. I can hear Ian say yeah, we'll take that up with God because 
54:35
Because they would say at the moment of death that's it the scripture says is appointed man 
54:39
Uh, uh, you know once to die and after that judgment. Well the death process can christ use the keys people 
54:48
That's good. That's really good 
54:50
The great white throne judgment. I can even tell him if they would read the bible 
54:55
There's two judgments mentioned. Okay. This is like at the end of so at the end of someone's life 
55:01
They died. Okay, they died 
55:03
There's a great white throne judgment. That's for the wicked and the dead in hell 
55:07
Okay, and they're all taken out of hell at one time when time is going to be no more 
55:12
They'll all be taken out of hell and they'll stand in this long line before the father's throne the father's throne 
55:19
and uh 
55:20
And then is that at that time is you clearly see these are all of your sins 
55:24
This is why you're not allowed into heaven 
55:26
He's actually going to show you all that and then you'll be thrown into the lake of fire at that time 
55:31
Okay, so that's at the end of time. That's that judgment. That's at the very end of time 
55:38
There's another one called the judgment seat of christ. That's not about sin 
55:44
Okay, that's not about your sin. You're in heaven. You've been living in heaven 
55:47
But time is coming almost to an end when we won't need time anymore 
55:51
We'll still exist and we'll always be the christ 
55:54
But it does say in the bible you'll be judged for every wasteful word 
55:58
Okay, this is in heaven in heaven towards the end of this time when before the new earth is made 
56:04
This will happen. But the other thing that you'll be judged for the judgment seat of christ is 
56:10
Did you ever accomplish what he asked you to do like if he called you know, this is an actual calling 
56:17
And you totally ignored and you knew in your heart you were supposed to be a certain something 
56:21
It could be and it could be a bill where you decided to be a pastor 
56:24
But that's not what you were called to do or you were uh, you were you were a builder 
56:30
You chose that over being a pastor. That's what you'll be judged for 
56:34
Did you do what christ asked you what you how does that judge when you say judge again? 
56:39
The old me would have said if i'm going to enter into that kind of judgment and god's going to judge me 
56:45
It sounds like okay now i'm going to not be saved anymore, but that's not what you're saying 
56:49
No, no, i'm not saying that the judgment seat of christ are for believers 
56:54
Yeah, who are in heaven right that doesn't take away your spell 
56:59
So what is the judgment? Do I get okay? I'm just going to be silly about do I get demerits? 
57:04
Did they take one of the rooms off my mansion? What? 
57:09
No, no, no that's not what that's about okay people 
57:13
Rewards are given for what you do in your life 
57:17
Like if you just help people love people you're getting rewarded for if you give them kind words 
57:21
If you give them something to eat if you get the money to have food 
57:24
Those are some of the greatest things you do and you'll get a great reward for that 
57:28
I know you're not doing it for that reason. I mean i've done it my whole life my dad taught us to do that 
57:32
And I never once thought wow i'll get a great reward. I thought i'm so happy that I fed someone who was hungry 
57:38
I helped to feed their family to me. It's one of the greatest blessings I can do 
57:42
For the lord, but then there's people who continually decide in their flesh 
57:47
In other words, this is your own opinion or this is what you want 
57:52
And yet there's something very much so that christ needs you to do and you know this you know what you know 
57:58
You know that you were called to do something. No, this is going to be much easier over here. I'm gonna choose this. I'll choose this 
58:04
This is what happens. Okay. You don't get any reward. This is about rewards 
58:08
Okay, you won't get any reward for the thing you chose 
58:12
You're not going to get any and it says in the bible. You will see before yourself them burnt up the rewards 
58:18
And and I clearly know I know they're not even know I was called to be a photographer 
58:24
That's my gift. That's the thing he put in me. That's my passion to do. I've known it my whole life 
58:29
That thing gives me the greatest blessing and I'm excellent at it. I mean my photographs are beyond imagination 
58:36
Even in this natural realm 
58:38
And I don't use one of those cameras that do everything for you. I have the kind where you adjust every single thing on that camera 
58:44
You couldn't ate that photograph 
58:47
And from the time I was a little girl, I would make little boxes into cameras and my mama finally gave me her brownie camera 
58:53
I was beyond excited, you know, we didn't have the money back then to get things like that 
58:57
But so that my whole passion my whole life was to be a photographer and I didn't make money off of it 
59:02
I did it for free for I did I did like weddings. I did all kinds of things 
59:06
I did like weddings. I did all kinds of things 
59:09
I it's my passion 
59:11
That gift I use all the time 
59:14
That is one of the biggest blessings number one the gift he made you 
59:18
Whether it's the best baker or the best builder or the best singer or whatever it is 
59:23
That thing he put in you. He sends this as gifts every good imperfect gift what comes down from the father of 
59:30
Like us that's him sending us to this earth for that purpose because when you go to heaven 
59:36
You're going to use that very gift. He made you in heaven. So that's that's one thing. Okay 
59:42
But a call on your life 
59:44
That he has for you and you know that call and someone even does I feel like that you're supposed to you know 
59:50
And sometimes it isn't the five fold ministry 
59:52
Sometimes it's not it's not necessarily in the actual ministry 
59:56
But it's something to do with that and God wants you to do that and you know yourself and he's told you several times 
01:00:03
That's way too hard. I just think it's going to take too much and there's people that say that 
01:00:07
That that they don't love Christ. They just think their way is better. In other words, they want his will their way 
01:00:13
Not his will his way 
01:00:15
And so there will be people who will be feared and that this is the thing 
01:00:19
At the end of the bible in the book of revelations it talks about the judgment seat of Christ 
01:00:23
And it says he will wipe away all tears. That's good. There you go people 
01:00:29
You will if you did not 
01:00:33
Take the call he gave you that he really needed you to go on the earth 
01:00:37
He won't take away your mansion. He won't take you your place out of heaven. He won't take he won't do that 
01:00:43
But it clearly says and it causes the judgment seat of Christ and Christ will make that decision 
01:00:47
He'll show you and he will show you 
01:00:49
You these are the believers. Okay, this is what I called you to do. You knew you heard me 
01:00:56
You knew I really need to do that and yet you said no 
01:00:58
I'm going to do this instead and you said no. I'm going to do this instead 
01:01:02
You don't you won't lose your place in eternity. You won't that's not what he's talking about 
01:01:06
But the rewards you would have gotten for doing what he called you to do 
01:01:10
Would have been so much greater than what you chose to do and you may have helped people and that was nice and wonderful 
01:01:16
But that wasn't what he called you to do 
01:01:18
And then the gifts that you would have gotten 
01:01:22
But you can't you can't get him now because you didn't fulfill this other thing 
01:01:25
You said in the past many times and it's hard for in our 
01:01:29
flesh, it's certainly hard for me to 
01:01:32
See god, let's say that I went there and there were certain rewards that he showed me. I'm not going to get 
01:01:38
I it seems like as much as I was so grateful that I'm still in heaven 
01:01:42
I'm he's not it seems like I would have regret and yet you said there's no regret in heaven 
01:01:48
So I don't know like like I said those aren't sins 
01:01:53
People would have regrets for their sins. They may these are not about sins people. This is all about a reward 
01:02:00
And you can think of it this way you worked for a business all the heavens not a business 
01:02:04
It's the best way to describe the people if you worked in the business and you were hired to do a specific job 
01:02:11
And you yourself decided in your own self and this is like let's say this is a huge company a corporation 
01:02:17
You hired a significant job to be over something that was so important for the whole company 
01:02:23
And you go, you know, I just I don't think I like that. I'll do that later 
01:02:26
I do it later. Do you never do it? You actually do other things within the company that let makes you look busy and stuff 
01:02:31
do you think 
01:02:33
The person who owns that company they won't fire you necessarily but you think they're gonna be happy with you if these were things that you said 
01:02:41
I I'm gonna do this is what I've been hired for this 
01:02:43
I know this is what I was called doing this company and you didn't do it 
01:02:47
It's sort of the same thing in a different scale that they couldn't reward or give you what you would have had 
01:02:54
Had you completed what you were asked to do and there's a lot of people who do that in business too because I've been in business a long time 
01:03:00
But in heaven in Christ, he knows your life 
01:03:04
He knows knew you before you were born 
01:03:06
He saw you inside the father's your little spirit of life 
01:03:08
He knew you then and he knew things you were going to be asked to do and he was sending you for a certain specific purpose 
01:03:16
But you yourself that's called deeds done in the flesh 
01:03:20
So let's just say that's what this is about. It's about deeds done in the flesh 
01:03:25
That means your own mind decided you're a believer and you love Christ, but you just add in your own mind 
01:03:31
I have a right to do this instead. You know, I'm happy doing this more than this 
01:03:35
That's what I'm talking about and yeah, there's many people do that 
01:03:38
But and I'm not saying in every way. I was perfect, but probably for the last 50 years 
01:03:44
I have on purpose focused on what I was asked to do no matter what it was 
01:03:49
If it was even if it was hard, it didn't matter to me. I focused to myself. I'm going to please him 
01:03:55
I've read the please him then please 
01:03:58
myself 
01:03:59
Yeah, the when you talked about christian photography and I can relate to that because I was a photographer 
01:04:04
I I was a people photographer and I did weddings too. So I relate to that dream was the nature photographer is 
01:04:11
You know, she had an eye for that that I just don't seem to have but I could do portraits 
01:04:16
You know to you know, at least back then before 
01:04:19
Some of the more modern ideas came by 
01:04:22
But that's a very how do I say this? That's a very 
01:04:27
Unspiritual, unreligious gift 
01:04:30
Are you saying that? 
01:04:32
By that example, uh, are you indicating that almost all of the gifts are non spiritual non religious? 
01:04:38
Are there some people whose gift was specifically spiritual? 
01:04:43
How would you define it because that's a very secular gifted most all of the gifts? 
01:04:48
Yeah, I'm not talking about we're not talking about anointing. Okay, you're talking about 
01:04:53
Callings or anointing. I'm not talking about like you're anointed to preach. Yeah for healing and stuff like that 
01:05:00
Uh, that's an assignment you have because there is no five-fold ministry in heaven. That doesn't even go to heaven 
01:05:06
It doesn't go to heaven 
01:05:07
It doesn't mean you won't be rewarded for obeying god for those calls 
01:05:11
Those are very important calls the five-fold ministry very important on the earth 
01:05:15
But the gift i'm talking about is a natural gift 
01:05:18
He gave you that when you go to heaven you will use that gift to bless everybody 
01:05:23
That's how heaven operates. He made heaven to operate that way 
01:05:26
He knew that he gave enough gifts to people like, you know, you you make great food 
01:05:32
You design things that people love and can have a good time in 
01:05:36
Or um, it's all kinds of things that you need normally in your life or would enjoy in your natural life 
01:05:43
So i'm not talking about any kind of spiritual gift. Yeah, we're talking about natural gifts every good and perfect gift 
01:05:51
Okay, I could this one 
01:05:53
Cat the one the one that I a particular gift that I 
01:05:57
A particular gift that I had I don't know if it's if it's in this category, but even as a child as I as 
01:06:03
Newspaper route and I would make money. It was a thing with me. I didn't do it for reward. I didn't even know if I was being noticed 
01:06:09
I would give 
01:06:11
Gifts I'd buy disney that tickets. I went in a contest and I give it 
01:06:15
I had a gift of giving and I've always 
01:06:18
Pursued that is that any where is that on that kind of spectrum as far as gift? 
01:06:23
I would have to say that absolutely is a gift Steve because everybody does not think that way 
01:06:28
Okay, and my family was raised that way 
01:06:31
Any way you can help any way you can bless people, you know, we're here to bless people for christ 
01:06:37
But that is that is a gift 
01:06:40
To me it's like a pleasure to be able to help people with money 
01:06:44
I love to do that and I do majorly do that help individuals help families 
01:06:50
And it says it's more blessed to give than receive 
01:06:54
And I understand that it is a blessing to give but that is like a gift that is sort of like a gift 
01:07:00
Because not everybody wants to do that and there's some people who even cause treasure chest 
01:07:06
In the back of treasure chest that you have goods or you have ways to have goods 
01:07:10
But you use that to bless people you don't have to give all your money away and there's nothing wrong with having good things 
01:07:15
By the way, you need to know that 
01:07:17
If you earn in your life and you do and and take in money and well, there's nothing wrong with you having things 
01:07:24
Okay, god's not against that it gives you great things in heaven, but don't let them have you or control you 
01:07:30
Yeah, I think where I realized there was something about it 
01:07:33
It took me years to ponder that part of my life even my childhood 
01:07:36
Because I'm thinking the one that keeps coming to mind is the one where I earned worked really hard 
01:07:41
One of sales contests and then gave these 
01:07:44
Disneyland tickets that were expensive for the day, you know to my 
01:07:47
Yes, mother's sister-in-law or something. It was in their family. They were so so poor I 
01:07:54
I completely utterly 
01:07:57
Forgot about it because I would do that all the time 
01:07:59
I wouldn't and then I would about the time she was close to death 
01:08:02
She said I'll never forget what Steven gave me Disney that I guess that I go I did and then my mother reminded me 
01:08:09
I go. Oh, yeah, so it was like it was so natural to do it. I I've never even thought about it again 
01:08:15
It was very major for them 
01:08:17
and you touched the heart of some people and 
01:08:20
And they love that in heaven when anyone does that it doesn't matter who you are 
01:08:25
They love that and I'm telling you you're gonna get rewarded for that 
01:08:28
Since we're talking sort of like rewards and rewards aren't you don't do things to get the rewards 
01:08:33
That you're you cannot escape getting them. Yeah, it's a father's delight to bless you for all that you've done for him on behalf of him 
01:08:41
Helping people loving people caring people just caring for people 
01:08:45
Comforting people when they lost somebody in being kind 
01:08:49
These are things that maybe you don't think of as important, but they're important. Yeah. Well, I like that's that's I know 
01:08:54
That's going to touch a lot of people because there's a whole bunch of givers. I know because they give to us 
01:08:59
You know here at this ministry 
01:09:01
There's a big group of givers and I keep reminding people even if you give so much as a cup of cold water 
01:09:07
Which people when they give to these wells, you know, God's gonna remember that but 
01:09:11
Yeah, the rewarded is the reward itself was the giving that's where you know if your heart's right if it feels so good to give 
01:09:19
That's what you say, but you get a lot more than that in heaven 
01:09:22
And I'm not saying that I'm not bragging or anything. I'm just saying I've seen people get the rewards at the throne 
01:09:28
And uh, some from the father some from christ 
01:09:31
But the judgment seat of christings that people don't understand is is great when you have revelation on the word to explain the revelation 
01:09:38
Yeah, the pointer on the man wants to die 
01:09:41
And then the judgment well, that's clearly not the judgment seat of christ sets at the end of time 
01:09:45
It's not the great white dome judgment. That's what that's past all of that. So what judgment is it? Yeah 
01:09:51
No, when you die it says what it's a point on anyone's to die and at that moment. There is a 
01:09:58
Salvation that's heaven itself. That's that's a judgment is the judgment is are you going to heaven? 
01:10:04
Are you here in heaven? Do they can they use the keys to go to to meet with you and ask you do you want to receive christ? 
01:10:11
So that is what that scripture means the pointer on the man wants to die 
01:10:15
and Elijah and you know 
01:10:17
We we know that Elijah and Nina didn't even need that they didn't have to die 
01:10:21
Yeah, because of what they did for god 
01:10:23
He decided to take them to take them to heaven, but I'm telling you there's they are watching us all the time 
01:10:29
They're praying over us. They're encouraging us 
01:10:31
They're sending words to us through people or through holy spirit or even through angels sometimes and god does everything 
01:10:38
He can to reach people 
01:10:41
But I do know I love the scripture says 
01:10:43
That god makes himself known to every man. That means man woman. He makes himself. That's really good to know 
01:10:51
That's really good. So people but don't stop praying for your family or your loved ones or those who are life friends 
01:10:56
Or if you're in a group that's praying for a specific group 
01:11:00
And and there are many people praying for different groups who don't belong to christ right now 
01:11:05
And and and god will reward them for that, but it's important to know that that can happen 
01:11:11
I'm really really good. Well, let me get let's hit a few more questions here 
01:11:17
Um, these are actually all this is just you and me talking this whole time, which has been very delightful 
01:11:22
You know, I can hear you know, steve. I can hear I can hear people at the same, but what about heaven? 
01:11:27
What about heaven? What's going on heaven? What does heaven do? 
01:11:31
I can see people saying that out there 
01:11:34
Yeah, that's true. You they're pulling uh 
01:11:36
Okay. Well, here's a question that involves, you know, because I was never taught about three different judgments 
01:11:41
I'm still trying to get it in my head. So here's a similar thing about 
01:11:46
Where does what take place? So joe joe's the end if I'm saying that right joe's the end joe's the end 
01:11:52
Uh, we regarding the new heaven and the new earth. She can't mention how people in heaven will all be moving to the new earth 
01:11:59
So does that mean that heaven will be emptied of humans and also 
01:12:03
I'm so reading all all the wonderful things that she has seen in heaven 
01:12:07
Like the crystal sea are all those things also going to be 
01:12:11
On the new earth or do we get to go to heaven and see them? So how does that all work? 
01:12:17
That was an excellent question. I'm very excited. That's a lot, but I can answer all that 
01:12:23
And um, I just want to remind people that we are going to have a new he says there will be a new heaven and a new earth 
01:12:31
Okay, I do know yes the the current heaven, which is a spiritual world 
01:12:38
It's not a physical world people that is the father's house. It's where he has always been. That's why it's called his house 
01:12:44
He is willing to make a new earth 
01:12:47
Much more massive than this earth. I've had he's taken me to me glimpses of of this new earth 
01:12:54
It will be one mass. We'd be glam ass and one massive ocean 
01:12:58
Now I said it says in the bible. There'll be no more seas 
01:13:03
The seas on this earth separate the land masses. Did you not know that? Okay? 
01:13:08
There is the ocean the major ocean, but there are seas that come off of that 
01:13:13
And the seas separate land masses. That's why it's called the seas 
01:13:17
They won't need seas in in heaven in the new heaven because I mean the new earth 
01:13:22
Because it's one lay a mess with one massive water around it, but it will be a huge land mass 
01:13:29
And of course the crystal sea will always be where we're at because it flows from the father himself 
01:13:34
It comes from him. So wherever he is wherever he makes worse that will be where the source of water 
01:13:41
Okay, so there's one answer there will be an ocean on the new earth 
01:13:45
there will be it'll be much bigger than this this earth here and 
01:13:50
Uh, I have to just say what the scripture says go to the end the bible people 
01:13:54
He's going to it's going to be rolled away. It's going to be taken away 
01:13:58
And he'll make a new heavens the planets will be different. I've seen a few of those really 
01:14:04
Yes, I've seen those and the father himself 
01:14:07
Will leave probably be possibly the last person to leave 
01:14:11
His house because he's moving to the new one which will be the new earth will be our house 
01:14:17
It'll be ours and his together. It'll be all ours together 
01:14:21
It's not like we're just moving somewhere that belongs to him. It's going to be ours 
01:14:25
He is willing to leave that place 
01:14:27
He's always been in to move and be with us forever and ever ever on the new earth 
01:14:32
And it will never pass away the new earth will never pass away and the heavens heavens says it will be new 
01:14:40
And I will explain to you why because when it was made 
01:14:43
It was it was stretched out and it says it was stretched out. Christ was the word 
01:14:50
Made it the father spoke, you know, the physical realm and and so the christ the word 
01:14:57
Stepped out of the father and made that and what he did because there's a place in heaven where everyone goes all your family members 
01:15:03
Have already been there. They get to watch how they made it 
01:15:08
Not having itself because it always existed 
01:15:10
But when they made the physical realm in the beginning 
01:15:13
In the beginning means in the beginning of time. That's actually what that means 
01:15:18
It doesn't mean the beginning of things existing because they always existed father son, holy spirit 
01:15:24
Melchizedek the the forliving creatures the 24 hours have always existed 
01:15:31
In heaven a spiritual world. These are all spiritual beings 
01:15:36
It doesn't mean they don't have a body that just means that they lived in a whole realm 
01:15:41
Different from ours and that's the only realm there was 
01:15:45
So within this spiritual realm the word Jesus christ made a physical realm area 
01:15:51
So that father could send us from himself to a physical earth and exist there and have a body 
01:15:58
We didn't have this body when we were in him. We were just our spiritual body was little little thing inside him living in him playing in him 
01:16:05
And so he made this decision 
01:16:07
We're going to make a physical world and a physical realm that will support that world 
01:16:11
And we will stretch it out so the word steps on him and stretches out literally 
01:16:15
Almost looked like almost like a big scroll and he stretched it out like this around a great part of the cosmos 
01:16:22
And that was within that frame of where he made all that all the planets 
01:16:26
We currently see now the telescopes is part of that physical realm and and it operates in the physical 
01:16:32
He made this beautiful place. They started putting the planets out there the stars out there 
01:16:38
The nebula they call that space art and I do too like there's a big eye 
01:16:43
There's beautiful things out out in space just floating 
01:16:46
It's really like space dust that doesn't just on its own fucking the different beautiful things 
01:16:52
They make it. It's like their art that they gave us out there 
01:16:55
Those are all physical round things and so he captured he'll keep the physical realm 
01:17:00
Until 
01:17:02
He sends the last one from himself to be born 
01:17:07
Uh on this current earth that we're in now. So nothing's passing away now 
01:17:12
There's going to be no blowing up the planet. Everybody thinks it's going to happen now 
01:17:16
It's not going to happen now. We haven't even done the things Christ said we could do 
01:17:20
And so there's still several hundred years 
01:17:22
I don't know the exact date 
01:17:23
But there's at least probably a couple hundred years left in the physical realm to operate to have babies to do things and stuff 
01:17:29
Like that and for some time after this whole thing changes 
01:17:34
And trust me it's changing because god's not done with this planet. Okay. The lord made it 
01:17:40
It's his this is the earth is the lord's and the fullness there of belong to him 
01:17:45
They don't belong to any group not democrat or republican 
01:17:49
Not not evil or good. It doesn't belong to them. It belongs to him 
01:17:53
And the father has a time line of events 
01:17:57
Behind his throne embedded in the floor and there's things on there that have not happened yet 
01:18:04
And we're not going anywhere until they're done with it 
01:18:08
So there's still a lot for us to do here 
01:18:10
But the physical realm was created on purpose so we could have a body that we could know christ receive him and then 
01:18:17
Live in eternity with him 
01:18:19
So when the last one is sent from the father and that baby is born 
01:18:23
Time will be no more. This is at the tribulation at the end of tribulation during the millennial reign 
01:18:29
People still have children so it's all the way through the millennial reign the thousand year reign of christ that that makes you happy for me to say that 
01:18:36
There'll still be children born 
01:18:38
So the earth isn't going anywhere right now 
01:18:40
But when god is ready 
01:18:42
And that last child that he sent from himself is born in the physical realm 
01:18:48
Time will be no more. That means we will be in eternal in eternity 
01:18:52
We don't need a clock and calendar to go by to live by and we won't need this physical realm 
01:18:59
It will be blended it will be blended so that in your physical body you can love 
01:19:04
Enjoy and live your life and do amazing things. We can still visit the father the throne room will still be on the new earth 
01:19:11
It talks about the new city a new city through some on the earth 
01:19:14
And it will be much much bigger than it is now. So don't worry about what happens between the time 
01:19:19
He rolls away the old stuff like it says 
01:19:23
When he rolls it all away and puts it or does away with it if he has to hold us in his hand 
01:19:28
He will so in heaven and then when he makes the new earth and he puts us on the new earth first 
01:19:36
That's what's gonna happen 
01:19:37
We will be here first on the new earth all of us together 
01:19:40
We see christ and then the father will step on the new 
01:19:44
Jerusalem and you can see it coming down from the heavens on the new earth 
01:19:48
And then we will live an eternal life that will be so amazing and beautiful and creative 
01:19:54
And exciting and adventurous and we'll be with them. We'll all be together forever forever. Let me ask some 
01:20:01
follow-up questions on this 
01:20:03
on the spiritual 
01:20:05
Place of heaven 
01:20:07
It's a spiritual place and then we're gonna one day get in the new heaven and new earth where god will come 
01:20:12
Um, okay, so right when our family those who have a precedence are there in a spiritual place 
01:20:19
There are spiritual beings out there waiting for their physical body then but jesus is in heaven and he has a 
01:20:26
Physical body right now right so then when there's a new heaven and new earth 
01:20:31
And we get physical bodies to inhabit the new heaven and earth 
01:20:36
The new heaven and new earth is a physical place and from that point on 
01:20:39
Jesus will continue to be a physical 
01:20:43
Person and then the father comes down and lives as what a spiritual being on a physical plane 
01:20:50
You're really deep you're a deep person. Yeah, I tend to you're deep, buddy. You're 
01:20:56
I just gotta know that I've wanted to ask that for a very long time 
01:20:59
The spirit realm would be done away with it. I 
01:21:02
I mean here one the physical realm as we know it now everything on this earth is only physical everything the atmosphere is all physical 
01:21:11
It will be the spirit realm 
01:21:14
That of course the spirit realm we've all received christ who lived there who are with him 
01:21:18
Had the ability to live in the spirit realm likely did in the physical realm 
01:21:23
and so 
01:21:24
That's the way it's going to be because the spirit realm has always existed the spiritual realm 
01:21:29
Which we call the unseen realm, but I see the unseen realm all the time 
01:21:34
So I know a lot about how they operate what it looks like and things like that 
01:21:38
And he only made the physical realm 
01:21:40
So we could come down here and have a body and then through our eternity 
01:21:44
It's just wonderful to have a physical body and that physical body 
01:21:48
Like enic and an Elijah who live in a spiritual world with their physical body. They look really good 
01:21:55
I've seen both of them. They look great in that spirit realm. The father just keeps him and he can he allows or permits them to 
01:22:02
Remain there. They don't age. They don't get sick or anything. They look amazing 
01:22:07
We are glorified spiritual bodies 
01:22:10
Can operate and live in a spiritual realm 
01:22:14
Like we did in the physical realm like when I say that you walk on the ground 
01:22:18
You pick things you can eat stuff you can do things with people that are fun and exciting to do 
01:22:23
You still do that now in heaven in your spiritual body 
01:22:27
But the new earth 
01:22:29
The new heavens and the new earth will still be spirit realm 
01:22:33
But but with the ability for people with a physical body to live and exist in there 
01:22:38
You won't get married. You won't have children don't want that make you unhappy. You'll be very happy. Trust me 
01:22:43
You'll be happy to be there 
01:22:45
But that's what uh, that's what the end looks like the end of time 
01:22:49
When he says the end he means the end of time having to keep track of everything 
01:22:54
You only have so many hours. You're awake so many hours. You sleep 
01:22:58
Uh, you know, I never get tired in heaven now when I'm caught up in the spiritual body 
01:23:02
But I'm never tired in heaven. And so I don't need to rest. Um, nothing wears me out. I'm not tired 
01:23:09
It's just a different way of life. It seems like the way you describe it cat 
01:23:13
It kind of seems like 
01:23:14
You know six one half dozen the other so your spiritual being in heaven it feels like you're physical 
01:23:19
When you become down in physical being in the new heaven and earth it feels like you're 
01:23:25
It feels sounds like it feels the same either way 
01:23:27
It sounds like it's kind of the same in a spiritual world in your spiritual body 
01:23:32
Yeah, you walk through the doorways. Yeah 
01:23:35
Falls you can eat the fruit do everything that's in the spiritual world because you're in a 
01:23:39
A your spirit your spirit man is living there. Your body is what is resurrected 
01:23:46
Your soul never sleeps people. That's not right. They don't know what they're saying. I'm I'm not making fun of them 
01:23:51
They just don't have a revelation. Yeah 
01:23:53
But your spirit man and your soul 
01:23:56
Never have to sleep. They're both spiritual things 
01:23:59
You couldn't look inside a person to see their soul 
01:24:01
But I know what one looks like because he showed me a human soul 
01:24:04
And I understand how it operates and why it's important to guard it 
01:24:08
And not let wickedness and evil and darkness and it's important to keep that soul 
01:24:12
Uh, you know focused on him and and not let the darkness in you or Phil would light yourself as a believer 
01:24:19
You want to keep that light getting brighter, which it does but on the new earth 
01:24:24
We've already had the resurrection happen 
01:24:26
The resurrection has happened the resurrection of the dead has happened that will happen at an appointed time 
01:24:32
On this physical earth everyone who's died that belongs to Jesus christ 
01:24:37
Their physical body is coming back 
01:24:40
It's going to come back. You'll get it back people 
01:24:42
It'll be it'll be put together with your spirit man 
01:24:45
If you've been living in heaven, it's going to be put together with your spirit man 
01:24:48
And then it's called you'll be glorified, which means you can never get sick. You can never die 
01:24:54
You'll never sin. These are for people who know christ and you will be like that for all eternity 
01:24:59
So there's still different processes. We have to go through who are here 
01:25:03
But it clearly says in the day the dead in christ shall rise 
01:25:07
That is your body 
01:25:09
Because your spirit man with your soul have been living in heaven 
01:25:14
You're in you cannot separate a soul 
01:25:17
You can't take a soul out of your spirit. You just can't do it. Yeah 
01:25:19
The way it's made but your spirit man it says, you know, it clearly says to be absent from the body 
01:25:27
That means you die 
01:25:29
Your your spirit man was taken out of your body with your soul in it and it was taken to heaven 
01:25:35
This body dies, but it says the dead in christ. That's your body shall rise one day 
01:25:41
When that happens, all of our bodies will come up your spirit man will actually go into the grave 
01:25:47
How about this it goes in gets that body and it blows up that grave no matter where you are 
01:25:53
Whether you're in an urn or whether you're in the grave you're going to come out of that and 
01:25:58
And that will be a sight to see I think it'd be one of the most exciting things that will be happening 
01:26:03
One day when the dead in Christ shall rise that means you're going to get your body back and you look really good people 
01:26:09
They'll know you're you it says you will be known as you were known on the earth that says that in the bible 
01:26:15
So if you were a male, you'll still look like a male a much better one 
01:26:19
If you are female that doesn't change you rise from the dead you get your body back 
01:26:23
You're still going to be you people will recognize and know you 
01:26:25
So don't let people tell you other things. I'm going by what the word says 
01:26:29
And when people go and when you go to be with the lord one day and other people go to be with the lord 
01:26:35
You're going to be a like a 20 or 30 something looking 
01:26:38
One woman. Yeah, and we'll but will people look at you and go. Oh, there's cat 
01:26:43
Yes, and how will they recognize you? Will your hair be pink? 
01:26:47
How will they how will people know that's cat? 
01:26:50
I mean this the answer to this question is the answer to every other question related to 
01:26:54
Well, there's something probably you're you're not considered 
01:26:58
People in heaven are known for more than just their physical appearance. Okay 
01:27:04
Everybody puts out a frequency. You know, everyone in heaven knows exactly what I'm talking about 
01:27:09
You have your own frequency that is 
01:27:12
You comes out from you no matter where you go on heaven people can feel 
01:27:16
Or hear that coming before you ever come in heaven. You're walking on having people go cats coming 
01:27:21
I can feel I can feel her frequency and and this is a true thing that happens in heaven 
01:27:26
So maybe you didn't know you have a frequency right now coming out of you. You can't hear or see it 
01:27:32
Uh, but it's amazing just just to be able to do that. So people will know you first by that 
01:27:37
Wow 
01:27:38
And then when they see you they're gonna go well, you know enough people have seen me on there 
01:27:41
It's already and uh, but people will watching from heaven right now. They'll watch me from heaven sometimes when I'm speaking 
01:27:48
They want to see what I'm going to say is wild 
01:27:51
But some people will like to watch certain people who do things that uh on the earth 
01:27:56
They want to hear what words are going to speak for christ or what miracles are going to happen and stuff like that 
01:28:01
Or what will people learn? 
01:28:02
So when you get to heaven people still want to know you they've never met you 
01:28:05
Oh, come on and they'll have meetings where you share your testimonies. Really? 
01:28:10
It's amazing 
01:28:12
People are interested even now in your we like to know and hear about people and that doesn't matter 
01:28:18
What arena that is in they want to know they want to know about you and they like personal stories to be told from the platform 
01:28:25
They love it when I talk about my family 
01:28:27
They wild stuff the crazy stuff really good. I mean, yeah hear about it 
01:28:31
So, uh, even in heaven they want to know you in here care about so what we think of is 
01:28:36
Getting together and catching up on the news. It's not it sounds like it's not unlike that in heaven 
01:28:43
Hey, come and tell us what you did in your life. They want to catch up, right? Is it similar? 
01:28:48
Something like that only mostly they just want to know you don't want to hear what you have to say 
01:28:53
Yeah, how did you feel when that happened? Where did you think when christ did that for you? 
01:28:59
When you lived on the earth at that time wasn't that amazing what happened? 
01:29:02
They talk about things like you like maybe things in history or stuff like that 
01:29:07
Uh, they don't ever discuss evil wicked things. Nobody even thinks about that anymore 
01:29:12
So they're not going to talk about that part of your past 
01:29:15
They don't they don't do that 
01:29:16
But the fun exciting things everybody does and they just want to revive you even the disciples will want to know you 
01:29:22
The prophets will want to know you 
01:29:24
Even if you want to profit they want to know certain things that you did in your life to help people of 
01:29:28
Or just things that happened in the first of that time one last question one last question about if 
01:29:35
So dureen and I let's say we're we're both 
01:29:39
Graduated to heaven and our kids are still here 
01:29:41
And then our grandkids are still here and from time to time we 
01:29:45
Would probably see their special events probably at the same time dureen and I would probably see them at the same time 
01:29:50
Yes, we list they've been different but let's say 
01:29:52
They're cousins or whatever are there situations where someone will say well 
01:29:58
What's new with your kids on the earth and we catch them up of what we just saw was 
01:30:04
So and so just had a baby. Is that kind of thing go on in heaven? Were you catching that part? 
01:30:09
Yes, about family relations and stuff like that people want fellowship 
01:30:14
I mean people like fellowshiping here 
01:30:17
If you're in the right groups of people in fellowshiping it can be a wonderful thing 
01:30:20
But everybody fellowships in heaven they go, what do we do besides they thought all we would do was just bow down 
01:30:26
Right, there's many things where worshiping is bowing down. It's a lot more than just bowing on 
01:30:32
Everything you do in heaven you will thank him because he made it for us to enjoy 
01:30:37
Or gave us the ability to be together and do things together 
01:30:40
You never stop. It's kind of it's called a lifestyle of worship you worship all the time all over heaven 
01:30:46
You know for everything and it just automatically comes out of you and so it's not like down to the earth 
01:30:52
That you have to come to one building at a certain time of the week and that's the only time 
01:30:56
I never stop worshiping him. I never stop talking about him or talking to him 
01:31:01
If I'm by myself if I'm just anywhere I do that so and having that would be normal to me 
01:31:06
And that's what people do mainly they talk about christ the things christ did the revelation they get from him when he when they get up there 
01:31:13
And they get to meet him. There's just a lot of fellowship 
01:31:16
There's a lot of events that the father plans for all of us and having to be together and do it together 
01:31:22
There's things he plans just to do with you or christ do with you 
01:31:26
So it's not like it's a boring place. There's nothing boring about it. I was like, yeah, that's amazing 
01:31:32
Okay, a lot of things together and having they really do still do things together 
01:31:36
They do really really really really good. So good stuff. I never get tired of learning more about heaven 
01:31:42
You can probably tell 
01:31:43
Uh, well tell people we've got revealing heaven calm and cat curd calm 
01:31:47
I always like to have you kind of recap what people can get there 
01:31:51
They keep you busy. I'm sure they're good at your website and 
01:31:54
Yeah revealing heaven comm is where um our our store is it's where our events calendar is 
01:32:01
And I think there's testimonies on there that people give and there's a few other things that you can learn and watch 
01:32:07
There's a lot of things that you can click. I didn't design it. I don't uh 
01:32:10
I don't even know how any that I don't know anything about wi-fi 
01:32:14
sci-fi maybe more than wi-fi. I don't know but but I know heaven fi a lot 
01:32:21
I'm really good at knowing that understanding that but so the revealing heaven comm is for that 
01:32:26
Okay, we have a corporation god told us to have a corporation 
01:32:29
He wants us to create things that represent heaven things that are in heaven 
01:32:33
Like some of the things the white people wear uh things that they would have in their mansions 
01:32:37
We're going to have a whole new list over the next year and a half probably 
01:32:42
We'll have a home decor stuff that if you come in you'd think you were in heaven 
01:32:46
Nice 
01:32:46
He really wants that to happen. He wants that to happen on the earth 
01:32:50
And his point is satan has made all kinds of things that people wear they use 
01:32:55
They talk about they play with it. They probably shouldn't play with he said he wants stuff 
01:33:00
Related to heaven that people can hold they can wear they can use they can sit on 
01:33:04
Uh things in the wall that we'll talk to you about heaven 
01:33:08
The carpeting will say things to you when you walk on it 
01:33:11
We're going to have use light a lot because light's one of the main sources of things being built in heaven 
01:33:17
Or designed in heaven is with light. You're going to see that happen all over the world 
01:33:22
By the way, that's how this is going to happen in the new witty ideas and inventions 
01:33:25
You're going to see a lot of resources 
01:33:28
And things that we use every day plus spectacular things that will be done with light is going to come here because it's all over heaven 
01:33:36
on earth as it is in heaven 
01:33:38
Is what we're going to be seeing over this next 100 years. So 
01:33:41
Don't get on your rapture rug stick it in the closet because you've got a lot still left to do in this world 
01:33:47
And we're going to enter into the great stuff and to be great for for god on this earth 
01:33:52
but my other website is cat cur.com 
01:33:54
And by the way, I don't have any other websites. That's it 
01:33:59
I have cat cur.com and that's where you learn a lot of things about the spirit realm and different things what things look like 
01:34:06
In heaven on there 
01:34:07
There's all kinds of interviews on cat cur.com and it is the one and only and I really want to say this 
01:34:14
There's no other place out there on the planet where you can give to me 
01:34:19
personally 
01:34:20
Then cat cur.com. So if you find some other other places made up with my face on it and they say things on it that is not me 
01:34:27
Yeah, and I will never ask you 
01:34:30
I will never appear on a video and say please give this much to this ministry 
01:34:34
Or if this place is doing these awesome things and I don't do it on purpose because I don't want you giving to people 
01:34:39
Who are out there and damn you so I don't do it 
01:34:42
And people actually contact us. Was that you saying to give to this orphanage? No, that wasn't me 
01:34:47
Is this who said please give this money this person who had an accident? No, that was not me 
01:34:52
You may see my face there, but it's not me 
01:34:54
I pray you do bless people if they need help and I do myself 
01:34:58
But to protect you 
01:35:00
The more the more you become known the more of scammers. Yeah people who want to commit crimes 
01:35:06
There's a lot of crime 
01:35:08
Right now on the internet. So I on purpose do not do those things 
01:35:13
So let me in person if we take up offerings if you want to give on catco.com click on the treasury 
01:35:20
And there's a place where you can do that 
01:35:22
And the people who support us are called the guardians 
01:35:25
We have the guardians zone we created and someone who looks over that that database and things and 
01:35:30
And we love and appreciate like you do Steve 
01:35:33
We probably could in some of the way do it 
01:35:35
But the blessings you give us help change people's lives 
01:35:39
And you will get reward because you are sharing if you're helping to support and give for that 
01:35:45
You will actually receive part of the reward that we get 
01:35:48
That's having but also on the surface you will be blessed. So so thank you very much for my heart for my staff's heart 
01:35:55
Thank you for being a part of what we do 
01:35:57
So that's gonna do cat. Thank you so much. It's good as always very very good always learning. So

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE - Episode 95
by Elijah Streams Sep 21, 2022
https://rumble.com/v1kxxdp-wednesdays-with-kat-and-steve-episode-95.html
or https://fb.watch/iC5L0YimJ7/ Video author slightly different

01:00
You 
01:30
Well, good morning from the Pacific Northwest in the state of Oregon. It is Wednesday, September 21, 2022. 
01:41
We're sorry, we're a little bit late today. We try, but every once in a while we don't make it. So it's going to be a good show, probably worth the wait. 
01:48
So welcome to the broadcast. We're going to bring Kat Kerron in just a moment. 
01:53
A quick couple of announcements. First of all, people that have questions for Kat, we still continue to accumulate those. 
02:00
If you'll pop that up there, go to questionsforkat.com. You see down there below, questionsforkat.com right there. 
02:10
Just like at Cinerons, questionsforkat.com. And then you'll be able to fill out a little tiny form and you type in your question in a simple, keep them really short so that we can just ask the question. 
02:20
We can't get the whole story, but just get your question boiled down to the simplest as you can possibly make it. 
02:27
So all right, I'm going to bring on Jeff here. Jeff is going to talk about the clip channel and how you find things on our clip channel. 
02:35
We're going to use Kat as an example. So Kat, go for that. 
02:38
Okay. So hello, everybody. So yeah, Kat, we've been made aware by Kat's team that she's been getting a lot of questions about different topics that Kat has talked about a lot. 
02:48
So I'm going to direct you guys over to Elijah Clips. So I'm going to do both YouTube and Rumble. 
02:54
So if you prefer one or the other, but they're a great resource. 
02:58
So first off, if you type in youtube.com and you just type in Elijah Clips in the search bar right here, as long as you spell Elijah and clips right, you'll come right up to it. 
03:08
This is the actual channel right here. Here's a couple of recommended videos. 
03:11
But if you click right on the channel, that'll take you to the homepage of Elijah Clips, the Elijah Clips channel. 
03:17
So this little, this little looking glass, this little magnifying glass, if you type in this and say you want to know about pets, you're like, what happens to my pets when you go to heaven? 
03:26
Just type in pets, hit enter, and it's going to show you all the different recommended videos regarding that. 
03:34
See cute little puppies and all this good stuff. So if you want to find out what happens to your pets, you can type in, what about a loved one and suicide? 
03:40
Same thing. You can type in suicide right there. 
03:43
Paul has done a great job of tagging these videos so that it makes it easy for you to search. 
03:48
So again, that's for YouTube, really easy. 
03:51
And if you ever curious to get a little lost, just come back to this video at like the three minute mark and it'll, you'll be able to see our tutorial. 
04:00
So if you're on rumble, it's a little bit different. 
04:02
Rumble is still in development right now, so it's not as refined as YouTube. 
04:06
So if you type in Elijah Clips in the search, you'll get a bunch of recommended videos. 
04:11
So if you just click, see it says Elijah Clips here, Elijah Clips there. 
04:14
If you just click there, that's going to take you right to our homepage, our channel of all these recommended things. 
04:22
Unfortunately, there's no magnifying glass. 
04:24
So the easiest way to do this is to type in Elijah Clips and then you go, hmm, pets, hit enter. 
04:34
Same thing. 
04:35
So what I would do in your search for that is rather than using the actual designated magnifying glass for the channel, it just does it for rumble as a whole. 
04:43
But if you type in Elijah Clips space and then whatever topic you're curious about, it's going to pull up all those videos again, suicide, celebrities, you know, whatever the case may be. 
04:55
So yeah, again, those are some great resources you guys. 
04:59
And hopefully that'll, that'll answer your questions so you're not submitting. I would, my advice would be to check either on YouTube or rumble first if you have a question and then look through those videos. 
05:10
They're shorter clips. 
05:11
You're not having to sit through like an hour and a half long episode. 
05:14
They're going to be five minutes, two minutes, whatever. 
05:17
Great resource. 
05:18
Check that out everybody. 
05:19
Happy watching. 
05:21
Thank you, Jeff. 
05:22
Yeah. 
05:23
You gotta realize that that we've been doing this every week for two years, basically almost two years or just right at the two year mark next month or so month and a half. 
05:33
And so we've answered literally hundreds of questions and some of them keep repeating over and over. 
05:38
So that that's what Jeff was saying if you try and find it first, if it's already there, because we're always looking for new questions that haven't been said so we can continue continue to populate both YouTube and rumble with those questions and answers. 
05:51
So again, go to their questions for cap.com right there. 
05:54
If you have a question for that and we'll get you on that. 
05:57
We have a list. 
05:58
These are all of our questions from viewers and we start going through them trying to be pretty methodical about getting getting to your questions. 
06:06
All right. 
06:07
Thank you so much. 
06:08
And now it is time for cats without further delay. 
06:10
Let's bring Wednesdays with Kat and Steve and here we go. 
06:32
Hello, I got my pink tie on free cat today. I think this is probably the first time in my entire life I've worn a pink tie. So only for cat only for cat. 
06:42
It looks good on you. 
06:44
Well, thank you. You're very kind. So I see your new shirt. Tell us about your new shirt. 
06:48
Yeah, we we have just of course, return from open the heavenlies and if I sound a little forced to solve the yelling I was doing, you know, it was good yelling. 
06:58
Really? Yeah. And Rod Parsley was just wild people. I mean, he looks like he's 20 years younger. 
07:06
No knew this, but he had been sick for several years. I didn't know it. 
07:10
And now he's so much better. He's healed. He's well. His wife was there too. They were so happy. 
07:16
And he was excited to be there with all these wild prophets. 
07:21
I think he's a friend of Hank Coonamans anyway, but I'm telling you what he got everybody stirred up about right now what God is doing now. 
07:29
And I think it really surprised me, but it was awesome. But every single speaker had the same the same message just in different ways that the end is not here. 
07:41
And you better be ready for what God is about to do because it's going to be powerful. 
07:45
I mean, I every meeting I got to go to to hear this because I was I loved even more excited. 
07:51
So I do know that God is up to things and I know there's a couple of people later who actually had some kind of inside information. 
07:58
So if you get a chance to go watch any of those, maybe go to Lord of Host website, you might be able to see some of those meetings that we had, but they were really, really awesome. 
08:09
They were amazing. I didn't get to see yours yet. I'm going to try and get I saw Kent Christmas's presentation was circulating. 
08:16
Were you there when Kent spoke? 
08:18
I don't think it was. I think I had just arrived. So I was actually rest. That was my only day I had to rest. 
08:25
Yeah, so I rested that day. 
08:27
But I'm sure that my team was there and they loved everything that they saw. 
08:31
We took like six or seven members of our team to handle the products table mainly, but they all got to attend the meetings to so it was wonderful. 
08:41
Now you're going to talk about your shirt. Tell us about your shirt. Can people order that shirt. 
08:46
Yes, they now can order it will be on our website in about a week. 
08:50
Okay. 
08:51
We just returned from the website. There's several new things actually that you'll be able to see there. 
08:56
I'm sure we got plenty of things in case, you know, people want to order them for Christmas or something. 
09:01
But I can tell you that out of anything that I ever wear that pen that one can I usually wear all the time. 
09:08
I didn't work today because I have this. I don't do demons. 
09:11
It opens more conversations. 
09:14
And a lot of other people have talked to said they say the same thing it opens conversations people. 
09:19
I mean, I don't do demons. That means I don't participate with them and I don't holiday them in my life. That's what that means. That means I serve the living God. 
09:26
And what an opener, you know, for that but they get where they can't stand not saying something. 
09:32
And even in the grocery line or even walking down the sidewalk people always ask me about I don't do demons. 
09:38
So we thought we'll just make t-shirts this time and take them and I'm telling you what they are amazing and they certainly are going to give a point of view from you. 
09:47
Well, you're not bashing people or what they believe, but you are taking a shot at hell. 
09:53
And, you know, that lightning bolt reminds Satan how he was kicked out of heaven and unseated. 
09:58
And so this is probably going to be one of our best sellers for this Christmas time. 
10:02
But we're going to keep an inventory because it's really a thing that's in demand. 
10:07
The cops are the tumblers. The pins are we have car magnets, which people will take pictures of our car because we have several different 
10:16
the magnets that we sell on the on the car. People will come up behind. 
10:19
We see taking pictures of them. 
10:21
So you're making this statement without even have to verbally say something. 
10:25
When you have a car magnet, this thing is about this big and this is I don't do demons. 
10:30
And then we have other ones say wonder women doing signs and I love that. I love it. 
10:35
Yeah. And we had those also for our event. We had car magnets and we had some other things. 
10:40
I think I don't know if you have a tote bag yet. 
10:43
Jen's pointing at something. I don't know what she's pointing at, but we did have some wonder women stuff. 
10:48
That's our women's group. 
10:50
And we're redesigning the logo for our men's group because we plan to have both of those. 
10:55
And of course, this may be too shiny to see, but if you've read the book, you know that one of the most important things that was put in that book was the portal in heaven where everybody who lives there goes to pray over their family members or just 
11:10
there's rose petals. It sounds wild, but there's rose petals all around and big urns and it's got peace in them. 
11:16
And when they throw them over through the portal, peace will flood onto people wherever they whoever they're trying to send those that that word of peace to them. 
11:25
But this is also something simple and it can't even hold a straight. 
11:30
You can see it. 
11:31
Yeah. 
11:32
Oh, that's the portal, right? That's the portal. 
11:35
Yeah. And it's the portal in heaven. It's got columns and at the base of the condue. See, like, what do you call them, Jen? 
11:44
Monitors. 
11:45
Yeah. And on the one side, it shows people who are in heaven when the family members are born again, they can watch it on that very those columns. 
11:54
And at the base of the other condue, let them know when they're coming home. 
11:58
Now, Kat, on that picture, while you have it there, the little tiny stick figures almost down the very bottom, those are whole. 
12:04
Those are bodies of people standing. 
12:06
So that could be like, that could be like 50 bodies of a person sitting on. 
12:11
Are these all different people from different families looking in the same portal, but they're only seeing their own family. 
12:18
And is their picture of their family filling that circle in their eyes or are just a part that they're looking at it. 
12:24
If you if you know how to actually seeing them. 
12:27
Okay. 
12:29
I'm not talking about the monitors. I'm talking about what they see. They're standing. There's usually about 1000 of them in there at a time. 
12:36
Okay. 
12:37
Okay. And so they're even with 1000, they're all seeing many different things. 
12:42
Yeah, most of them, if they're there, whatever's in their heart, they'll see their family number that they're thinking about or want to pray about or something. 
12:49
Or if it's somebody's birthday on earth, they go there on their birthday, even though they don't keep time in heaven. 
12:55
They know when and heaven when that's going to be their birthday and they go there and sing happy birthday to them. 
13:00
And then they go to different places in heaven and get gifts and put them in their mansion that's being built. 
13:05
So this is a really phenomenal thing. It connects everyone who has anyone in heaven. 
13:11
This place is something that's probably one of the most used places in heaven, besides the throne room. 
13:16
And, and so yeah, there's a lot of activity that goes down there when somebody gets born again. 
13:22
Everyone there sees that and they all start shouting. 
13:25
They celebrate that very moment. They see their family member getting born again. 
13:29
This is one of the things that they go there for. 
13:32
But it is a beautiful place and it's called the portal. 
13:35
And I'm going to see what it says here. It says heaven is cheering you on. 
13:39
God's love from above. 
13:41
And I've signed it. It's already pre-signed. 
13:44
It's like an eight by eight inch thing. 
13:46
I'm not really good. I'm the good. I'm not in marketing. 
13:50
Anyway, that's what this is. And it's in, it's in my book. It's in my first book. 
13:54
And you can see this image, but we added color to it. 
13:58
And, and Ken, are there, are there many of these portals in heaven or is there one that everyone goes to? 
14:03
There was many. 
14:04
Okay. 
14:05
They're all over them. 
14:06
They're buildings you can go to, but there are some that are outside. 
14:10
Okay. 
14:11
They're outside that you can go to outside and see them. 
14:13
You walk up to them and go look down over and see your loved ones. 
14:16
So they're not really so separated from, from us as of course we are from them. 
14:22
Right. 
14:23
Yeah. 
14:24
Well, and then Kat, if let's say you and in heaven, you won't be married. 
14:31
Let's say you and being in the gun home to be at the Lord, your best friends now in heaven. 
14:35
Do you, can you just be having any old, because there's not days and nights, 
14:39
but you're walking in heaven at some point. 
14:42
And then do you just say, Hey, Bing, let's go see what the grandkids are doing. 
14:46
Is it at a whim or are you directed by God to go look? 
14:50
Well, most of the time it's your own choice, but there are times when he lets you know he'll let you know about to come home to heaven. 
14:58
If you want to view it from here, then you can run out to the gate and meet them. 
15:02
I always wondered as a child, how would somebody know I was even there? 
15:06
Well, he showed me and it's these beautiful buildings built for that very, 
15:11
very purpose and people go there. 
15:13
They'll sing to their loved ones. 
15:15
You know, it's just beautiful to see the fact that they can still see their life. 
15:19
Now, they don't see any, you know, they don't see any of the, 
15:23
the any attacks or anything like they don't see that. 
15:26
That's not what this is for. 
15:28
This is a way for they can tend to speak over their family members and to know when they get born again. 
15:33
Any important day in their life, let's say your grandchild was graduating, 
15:37
your grandchild was graduating, you would be able to see that from here. 
15:41
A baby is being born. 
15:42
You would also be able to see that from this place in heaven. 
15:45
So they're kind of kept updated on things, important things in your life here on the earth. 
15:51
It's really a beautiful thing that God has made possible. 
15:54
The great cloud of witnesses, remember when it talks about that? 
15:57
Oh, yeah. 
15:58
You know, run your race. 
16:00
Don't, you know, run your race and remove every weight that keeps you from the end or the goal of that race. 
16:06
Yeah. 
16:07
This is the great cloud of witnesses that surround this. 
16:09
This is one of the ways that the great cloud of witnesses would be surrounding you. 
16:14
Oh, okay. 
16:15
So because I would have pictured almost in the cloud and their witnesses are almost in the air above you, 
16:20
but you're saying this is how this is what it actually looks like. 
16:23
One of the ways. 
16:24
One of the ways. 
16:25
One of the ways. 
16:26
Yeah, and meaning is I've actually seen clouds. 
16:29
Well, people would call it a cloud. 
16:31
It's probably the glory. 
16:32
Yeah. 
16:33
Every now and then I see this cloud of witnesses in a meeting like way up high above everybody watching. 
16:42
Not very often, but I have seen that and other people have seen it. 
16:45
I think Heidi Baker. 
16:47
At one time she had meetings or a facility in Florida. 
16:51
I think it was like mid-floor or center, center Florida. 
16:55
And at her first graduation from this place that she had gotten to have, I don't know how many weeks you were there. 
17:02
To complete a course, but they actually captured a picture. 
17:07
Literally. 
17:08
A lot of witnesses. 
17:10
And I think if you put maybe if you Google cloud of witnesses, Heidi Baker, you may be able to see that yourself. 
17:15
That would be amazing. 
17:16
That's what that is. 
17:18
That would be amazing. 
17:19
So what we've got a bunch of questions, but do you have anything you want to talk about before we get into more questions? 
17:25
Just exciting and exactly what God has said that people are starting to come forward. 
17:29
We can't name those names and some we don't even know. 
17:32
We do know there are several people right now who are turning to be witnesses against, you know, the one to destroy us. 
17:42
And by the way, just so you know, Kat, we're not going to be on YouTube now until December. 
17:48
So if you don't, if you don't want to speak in code right now, you don't have to just, I'm just saying. 
17:53
Some of these people I don't know, because I'm not privy to every single wicked individual who's paying for things to be done or actually in charge of recruiting people to do them. 
18:06
They have planned this whole thing well planned that you can tell. 
18:10
And probably since when we were all celebrating, I'm quite sure they decided we're going to stop all this. 
18:15
We're going to take over. 
18:16
But by the way, every single speaker spoke against that plan and they all said, we know God has got a plan himself. 
18:26
We know the miracle is going to be some said reset, some said reestablish some said that God's just going to change all of it. 
18:33
So I think the fact that we were all in one accord, not having talked to anybody, I never call someone and say, what are you going to talk about? 
18:41
I would never do that. 
18:42
I have to only say what God's saying, you know, as a prophet and most of these people didn't know until they heard what they were saying. 
18:49
So it made it very exciting for everybody. 
18:51
But that was their heart that it is not over. 
18:55
There's too many things left on this earth. 
18:57
God's not done with this earth or with us or with the body of Christ or actually with the world. 
19:02
And so I think that was the most exciting thing that happened in the last few days was being at that meeting. 
19:08
I was a warrior Alabama at the Robin Bullock place. 
19:12
What dates do you know? 
19:14
I think it's a, I think it's like, I think it's like 15, 16, 17 or 16, 17, 18. 
19:21
If you go to Robin Bullock site, you probably see that we'll have it up on ours pretty soon. 
19:25
But it's this next month. 
19:26
I'll be there for a couple of days speaking. 
19:28
Okay. 
19:29
Awesome. 
19:30
We're Alabama. 
19:31
Great. 
19:32
Great. 
19:33
Yeah, we had a lot. 
19:34
I guess I won't say the date. 
19:35
But since I'm not going to say the date and it's not that date. 
19:38
So I'll just say it this way, 
19:40
because we try to keep Robin under wraps as far as when he's going to be broadcasting at his request. 
19:45
It's a security thing. 
19:47
But we gave him a date in the future that we would like him to come on the program yesterday. 
19:53
And God told me it's going to be a breakthrough day yesterday and I've had all kinds of stuff. 
19:57
But so Julie invites Robin through his through Krista. 
20:02
I think it was the one, he's, we'd like him to come in on this date. 
20:05
Yeah. 
20:06
And, and, and Krista calls back and says, I want to throw a little monkey wrench or whatever word she, 
20:12
she says, we would like to come. 
20:13
Robin would like to come two days in a row, which he has never done. 
20:17
And he, we named the date, which we won't say just again for security. 
20:21
We won't say. 
20:22
Yeah. 
20:23
Exactly. 
20:24
Sure. 
20:25
That's why I asked Jen. 
20:26
I know it is next month. 
20:27
Yeah. 
20:28
It is sometime next month. 
20:29
So you're good for the, for the church meetings. 
20:32
There's no question on that. 
20:33
That's not an issue. 
20:34
It's like there, there was an issue with him broadcasting live and people were in the area, that kind of thing. 
20:40
I won't, I won't go into detail on that. 
20:42
But well, listen, I've got some questions and I've got a question from a 12 year old. 
20:45
If you're ready. 
20:46
So we said kids first. 
20:47
So here's, here's one for her for Olivia. 
20:50
And then I'm going to, I've got one that I've been saving to ask you. 
20:53
So, okay. 
20:54
So Olivia H 12 says, will homeless animals also boy, I almost feel, 
20:58
I almost feel the compassion of the Lord for this little girl. 
21:02
Will homeless animals also go to heaven and who takes care of them there? 
21:06
For example, are they adopted by families or are they cared for in a center? 
21:10
So she's worried about the homeless animals, which is a really sweet thing. 
21:14
What would you say about that? 
21:16
I do know what happens to the creatures, all the creatures, but I've never a child always 
21:22
or a young person always asked the most exciting questions that no one else asked. 
21:27
I guess that's what is in their heart. 
21:30
Being young, you know, they would think about the creatures and I can just say this. 
21:34
God loves every one of them. 
21:36
He loves every creature he made. 
21:38
And the ones that have a soul in the spirit, of course, are going to be in heaven. 
21:42
And that's why he had no output, every animal or species that had a spirit of life in them. 
21:50
He had them put them on the arc so that they'd be able to replenish the earth and then, you know, create more of them. 
21:56
So I would have to say that all of them go to heaven, which might be quite a shock to people. 
22:01
Heaven is bigger than this entire galaxy. 
22:04
There's plenty of room for all the creatures to come there. 
22:07
And anything that has a spirit and a soul will live forever. 
22:12
Just so you know that not just humans, but all the creatures that have that. 
22:17
And I can tell you, we know our cats do because they have personalities, they have likes, dislikes. 
22:22
They make their own decisions every day about what they'll let you do with them. 
22:26
And, you know, you all know that you're a pest to that. 
22:29
But even the other creatures, of course, I don't know about the adoption thing. 
22:33
I know that they will go home with you for a while to your mansion and visit with you. 
22:37
And it's not like a zoo. 
22:39
There's no place where anything is enclosed or kept enclosed. 
22:42
No creature has. 
22:43
And anyway, behind any kind of cages or bars, they have different domiciles and areas that they live in heaven. 
22:50
But you can go there and you can take them home with you for a while if you want to. 
22:53
If they decide to stay, I'm quite sure the father would not care if they stay, but they're all cared for. 
22:59
And if he knows when one, I think his point is he knows when one sparrow falls to the ground that they died, he knows it. 
23:09
Well, he wouldn't keep notice of something he didn't care about. 
23:12
Yeah. 
23:13
And you think about how many, how many creatures and animals did he put on the art compared to people? 
23:19
Yeah. 
23:20
Well, that's a good thought. 
23:21
That's a good thought. 
23:22
Wow. 
23:23
So he needs to know that they're all loved, everyone in their love. 
23:27
And there is a way you can go, go where they're living, wherever their habitat is in heaven. 
23:33
And they have an area that's there and you can go visit them and take them with you if you want to for a while. 
23:39
And if they want to go back, they'll just go back. 
23:41
But they're all fine. 
23:43
And God takes care of all of us, the creatures and his sons and daughters. 
23:48
Wow. 
23:49
Now you said something that was the right thing to say. 
23:51
You didn't know it was coming in. 
23:53
You talked about the size of heaven and the size of things related to God. 
23:57
And, and you talked about the new Jerusalem, the new earth is going to be so much bigger than ours. 
24:03
Okay. 
24:04
So I got to studying this and I've seen this before I got back to it. 
24:07
So I'm going to ask you this because I know you've seen the new Jerusalem. 
24:10
I don't ask you about it. 
24:11
So in Revelation 21 16, it says this city was laid out like a square. 
24:17
As long as it is wide, he measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 steady and length as wide and high as it is long. 
24:25
So here's. 
24:26
So I researched what these stadia are. 
24:29
So here's what it really, really is the new Jerusalem on this earth is 1400 and some miles wide 1400 and some miles long and 1400 some miles high, 
24:46
which is the height of some of our satellites. 
24:48
In other words, I really, then I Googled it and I doubled it checked and triple checked. 
24:54
In other words, you look at the continental United States and you take 60 percent of our land mass of the United States. 
25:02
That's the size of Jerusalem approximately. 
25:05
That's right. 
25:06
Isn't that amazing? 
25:07
So tell me more about it and how could it be? 
25:10
I mean, of course, again, because God said, what, what do you see 1400 miles in the sky? 
25:16
It's like, why would you even need to go high if you've got the earth? 
25:20
And what would you, what, what have you seen? 
25:23
Oh, because a number one of the amount of the money, the many people who will live, we're talking about the new earth right now. 
25:31
Because the new earth is where that will be established. 
25:34
That is like God's not just God's new home. 
25:38
He calls it our new home. 
25:40
So the new earth, it will be all of our home. 
25:43
And that's what we'll call it. 
25:44
This is home. 
25:45
And I tell people it can exist only because of the greatness and how huge the new earth is. 
25:53
I mean, the scope of it. 
25:55
And I'm sure it's bigger than even our galaxy could probably be half the size of the whole cosmos. 
26:00
It is so huge that it can of course sustain and nothing's going to go upside down or something because it's so high. 
26:07
But I kept telling people it is big. 
26:10
The new Jerusalem, the walls are beautiful. 
26:14
The gates are always open. 
26:17
There's never any shut gates. 
26:19
The gates will never be shut on the new earth of the city. 
26:23
They probably will call it the city of God or the new Jerusalem, whatever anybody else calls it. 
26:27
That's just a city. 
26:30
Now I have to tell you that as big as that thing is, it's only a city. 
26:34
There's many cities in the new earth, many cities and places to go visit, do things on the new earth. 
26:41
And that's one of the reasons why it is so big. 
26:45
And there's no sun or moon. 
26:48
It's lit with his glory. 
26:49
So it's spectacular. 
26:51
It shoots from the ground. 
26:53
It shoots from everywhere. 
26:55
All of the trees have light in them. 
26:58
And there's there's no darkness on it. 
27:00
There's no shadows really. 
27:04
If the light comes from the ground, there's not going to be shadows. 
27:07
And people are actually quite excited about that when they walk around in heaven. 
27:12
Now there's not shadows because the light, the glory comes from the very core of heaven, which is a world. 
27:20
It is a world and all these worlds were made after the lightness of that. 
27:25
And so it's just huge. 
27:27
All I could think of was how big it was. 
27:30
And it was so high up, but you have to understand there are some angels. 
27:35
There are angels that are several thousand feet high. 
27:39
Wow, really? 
27:40
Yeah. 
27:41
And they're in heaven now. 
27:42
They're in heaven now. 
27:43
They're in heaven now. 
27:45
You have to remember that in the very last days, there will be an angel that stands with one foot in the middle of the ocean and one foot in the middle of the land. 
27:56
And they declare things in the last days. 
27:59
I believe it's in the book of Revelation, but there are angels that high right now. 
28:04
Even just some of the hosts are like 150, 200 feet high. 
28:08
And their dwellings, they have it called their barracks. 
28:11
It doesn't look like what you imagine barracks here. 
28:14
Yeah. 
28:15
But even the army of heaven has their own area defined area that they live in and they run their missions on or their assignments on from that place. 
28:25
Michael's headquarters is a massive castle like structure. 
28:30
Also, it is, it is like shroud, not shroud is not a good word. 
28:34
I guess clouds of glory, but it's dark glory. 
28:38
People are saying it says God says I have myself in my dark clouds of glory only because they're not white clouds. 
28:45
These clouds are like a camouflage for him. 
28:48
We're talking about the father now and it looks like a million peacock feathers with eyes in them. 
28:55
Really? 
28:56
That whole cloud sometimes you'll surround yourself with that. 
28:59
But Michael's headquarters, even like I guess the circumference of where you would normally have walls around a structure or an area are these clouds of dark glory with these peacock feathers with living eyes in them. 
29:14
And that's what the purpose for that is. 
29:16
So just walking around heaven and singing and having it helps you understand the scripture, some of the scriptures. 
29:22
But that new Jerusalem is really amazing. 
29:26
Very beautiful powerful. 
29:27
That's where the throne will be. 
29:29
The throne will be there and other things will be there. 
29:32
But there's so many other things to do and see on the new earth, which is massive. 
29:37
It's just massive compared. 
29:38
I mean, there's no planet out there that's this bigger than that's going to be the new earth. 
29:45
It's beautiful. 
29:46
Well, I mean, it's like, and I'm trying to figure out, I don't know if your eyeballs in the spirit can see, you know, because the Empire State Building, then they made the Twin Towers and then the new Freedom Tower that took place and then Dubai and some of these places they've got the tallest buildings 
30:02
now on earth and there are probably a hundred and a hundred and some floors and like, but still you're like a thousand and some feet up, but this city goes 1400 miles. 
30:16
It doesn't say the sky above it is that it says the city dimensions are. 
30:22
So is there anything more you can tell about what's up there in the sky? 
30:26
Literally sitting on the new earth, it literally will come down and he says, and I do know if the father had said to me, don't worry about when everything starts to be taken apart and then put back together. 
30:38
He'll keep you safe because a lot of people go, well, if this is gone, where are we going to be between there in the new earth? 
30:43
Well, he will. 
30:44
He does impeccably everything ready. 
30:49
He himself, when it's ready for things he's going to do, it's going to be ready. 
30:53
No one's going to have to worry about being left out or lost or something like that. 
30:57
They say these things to me, but no, he's not. 
30:59
He knows where every hair on your head is. 
31:01
He's going to know where you are, no matter where you are. 
31:04
It's going to float around. 
31:05
So he will have a place for you, but he's going to make the new earth and put all of us on it first. 
31:12
So we will be on the new earth and then he will climb on this new Jerusalem city and come down out of the heavens. 
31:21
And it will sit literally on the earth and it will be that high. 
31:26
It will be that high because the earth will be so massive. 
31:30
It's not going to be. 
31:31
And you can imagine that shows you right there how big the new earth is going to be. 
31:35
Something that many miles high can sit and sit there perfectly because he made them perfectly. 
31:43
And so it's just, you're in awe of seeing it. 
31:46
But the thing that you know, the most is those gates are always going to be open. 
31:51
People will live all over the new earth. 
31:52
It'll have one land mass and an ocean. 
31:55
The ocean will always exist. 
31:57
The seas will not. 
31:58
The seas separate land masses. 
32:01
We told me the seas separate the ocean is the biggest body of water on this earth. 
32:07
And yet there's rivers that run off of it, rivers that run off of things. 
32:11
And the land masses, when the land was broken up, the original earth, when he made it had one land mass and it had an ocean. 
32:20
But when that whole thing happened in the earth, then later on, you know, verse two, there's, there's a mess going on. 
32:26
Not a mess, but it's hidden under the total water. 
32:29
You can't even see the earth between one and two or probably millions of years, literally millions of years of life here on this earth. 
32:38
And when God got ready to remake it and he, when he put it back together and he said replenish the earth, he left the land masses separated. 
32:48
All he did was take the water off of everything. 
32:50
And then he began to build up the land again. 
32:53
And then he put the greenery and the fish. 
32:55
You know, he did all that. 
32:56
And then he made man on the sixth day. 
32:58
And then he, of course, he did make the sun and the moon and verse two, verse one, he didn't need the sun and the moon in the beginning was when he made it the first time people. 
33:07
You'll find that out when you go to heaven. 
33:09
You get to go see how he did all that much. 
33:11
All that happened. 
33:12
But this new earth will be so much bigger than the one we're on now. 
33:16
Do you happen to know cat if, because I know in heaven, I think you said sometimes you can think yourself in a place or walk through a portal and you're, you're another side of heaven. 
33:28
Will that still exist that, that ability once you go into new earth or are you more now you're in your, your flesh, but it's glorified body. 
33:37
You can do the same thing. 
33:39
You'll be able to do the same thing you did before for transportation around. 
33:42
Okay. 
33:43
You do it around heaven. 
33:44
You'll be able to do that on the new earth. 
33:46
Okay. 
33:47
Okay. 
33:48
So we don't know if there'll be even the necessity or, or let's, let's have a group. 
33:52
Let's all go somewhere and take a flight from one end of the city for a couple hours. 
33:58
You know, and today's travel would take you a couple, two or three hours, three or four hours to get to 1500 miles. 
34:04
Yes. 
34:05
On the one city. 
34:06
Well that where do you have you seen planes or are they simply not necessary? 
34:11
Maybe you haven't seen planes because people like to have them and some are piloted by you. 
34:17
Most people get a star cruiser and they're called star cruisers. 
34:22
So none of that was made up by Star Trek or Star Wars. 
34:25
Okay. 
34:26
That was always in heaven first and it runs on light and they will still have them on the new earth. 
34:32
That'll still be a way people love to be able to do that. 
34:35
There's going to be trains, but not trains like we have here. 
34:38
You will step into beams of light. 
34:40
It will still take you around to the other side of on the new earth. 
34:44
There's going to be even more ways of transportation on the new earth than there even is in heaven right now. 
34:50
You can travel on light on bands of the rainbow. 
34:53
You can travel through a star cruisers. 
34:56
They have things that can take whole groups like I call them. 
35:00
He calls them MMS like a mobile mansion type thing, but it's like it's like a bus, but it goes in the air, not on the ground. 
35:07
So I would imagine, yes, you'll have flesh, but that flesh will be glorified. It'll be glorified. 
35:14
You'll be supernatural at that time, really supernatural at that time. 
35:18
And so I'm sure that will open up even more things for you. 
35:21
You can go visit other planets without a ship even to go to those other planets. 
35:25
I know that for sure. 
35:26
Yeah. 
35:27
There'll be a new a new heavens and heavens is like planets. 
35:31
It's going to be a new whole planet system and everything put out. 
35:34
Some will be for certain things to do on just those planets and you'll go there for like vacation instead of just yeah. 
35:41
Well, Kat, will people be on the new earth inventing things? 
35:46
Will technologies be being invented? 
35:49
Or is that stuff all invented? 
35:51
Well, I have to absolutely the father being the great creator with his son, Jesus Christ. 
35:58
He and the word made everything that ever was made. 
36:01
Father did it by speaking and then the word made it. 
36:04
We will more and more be able to create things, places and things like that. 
36:09
I know for a fact he told me that we would he'll send this like to a planet. 
36:13
Now we can't, we can't create people. 
36:15
We're not going to create other things like that. 
36:17
The place needs to go for people to enjoy and do things. 
36:20
You get to use your creativity. 
36:22
I'm saying not building something taking 10 years, but taking probably like, you know, I don't know. 
36:27
I don't know if there's minutes or hours or something like that, 
36:29
but it would be so much quicker to create design things and create things and put them places. 
36:35
Very good. 
36:36
Very good. 
36:37
Now there was one. 
36:38
Make sure I get to that. 
36:39
I couldn't tell if it was a child because it was under the 12 year old. 
36:43
But the question is, this is Cherie was Queen Elizabeth II aware of any of the pageantry on her love and respect. 
36:50
The world was showing her. 
36:51
Did she see any of the processions? 
36:53
Her family mourners or services? 
36:55
That's her question. 
36:57
The answer is yes. 
36:59
That's absolutely yes. 
37:00
I know she is in heaven. 
37:02
She did make it to heaven. 
37:03
And the father actually really honored her because her whole life that she was ruling allowed Jesus Christ name to be spoken, the churches to take place. 
37:15
She honored who he was and she did belong to him. 
37:19
And so I think one of the greatest honors he gave her was that she did that in her ruling and what she had made decisions on her own. 
37:26
As the as a ruler over that whole country that she opened it up at all times to Jesus Christ. 
37:33
And so that was a he honored her greatly for doing that. 
37:37
And so yes, everyone who goes to heaven, they do see that she watched the actual service. 
37:42
But I'm sure she got to see most all the things that went on in her honor. 
37:46
I'm sure that it blessed her very much. 
37:49
Awesome. 
37:50
Now, Janet's asking this question uses the word portal, but she's not talking about the portal that people in heaven looked down on. 
37:57
She's talking about an open heaven portal from the earth, you know, where people say, man, it's an open heaven over this place. 
38:04
So she's saying, how can we get open portals of heaven over our home? 
38:11
You can. 
38:14
It depends on how you're living your life. 
38:17
Number one. 
38:19
What do you allow to be shown in your home? 
38:23
What do you play on music in your home? 
38:27
What words are being spoken in your home? 
38:30
I mean, people use a lot of profanity. 
38:32
Heaven's not going to come hang around. 
38:34
They're just not because profanity is the is the only language spoken in hell is profanity. 
38:40
It is hell's language. 
38:42
It is not acceptable in heaven. 
38:44
No one does that in heaven. 
38:46
And so heaven will come where they feel like they're welcome or the atmosphere is similar to where they live in heaven. 
38:54
But I've been in people's homes and I saw open heavens over their home like right over. 
38:58
I could look up and see through it like through the ceiling of their home. 
39:02
I could see angels swirling around that place. 
39:05
I saw them on their property. 
39:07
This one man and I won't give his name because of course it's that's a national privacy and it was in Reading, California. 
39:15
And this man I was invited to speak in his home. 
39:18
The one time I went by myself, which they won't ever send me by myself again. 
39:24
10 days and 15 intercessors from Bethel. 
39:30
They invited me to come and speak. 
39:32
And so I went I stayed for 10 days with one of the one of the intercessors and got to know her well. 
39:38
And well, she was a naturalist and eight, you know, gray matter. 
39:45
I know I'm making fun of her and I love her and she knows she laughed all the time. 
39:49
But finally, my staff called and said, has she anything? 
39:52
And then she said, well, no, I'm trying to get her to eat better. 
39:55
And they said, we told you she not going to eat that stuff. 
39:57
She's not going to eat avocado, chocolate pudding. 
40:00
Well, then I'm going to happen. It's not going to happen. So I just was fasting the first few days and Margaret said, get her to an in and out burger place. 
40:10
I know that. 
40:11
That's good. 
40:13
Wow. 
40:14
But but yeah, I was invited to a Catholic bookstore to speak. 
40:19
How about that? 
40:20
To a what? 
40:21
The Catholics love the books. 
40:23
They love. 
40:24
Wow. 
40:25
They so believe in the supernatural. 
40:27
They believe in Christ. 
40:29
And in heaven, I mean, they do. 
40:31
I never, I never said that Mary was anybody more than Jesus's mother by you. 
40:35
You need to know that. 
40:36
And I said, well, if I talk, I have to say what the father's saying. 
40:39
And they said, we don't care. 
40:40
We're hungry. 
40:41
I think they had like 90 people in that bookstore, the Catholic bookstore, and they had my book already on their shelves. 
40:48
So it was quite interesting. 
40:50
You know, that whole group of people. 
40:52
But I did let them know, you know, Mary is very much loved in heaven and highly honored in heaven. 
40:58
Yeah. 
40:59
But she worships Jesus Christ. 
41:02
He had to die as her as her Lord. 
41:05
And that's why he gave his mother to John. 
41:09
Mother, behold your son, some behold your mother. 
41:12
And so that transfer had to take place. 
41:14
So he died as her Lord. 
41:17
And so anyway, I did mention that nobody care. 
41:20
They were all so excited that I was there talking about heaven. 
41:22
Some people had interpreters with them. 
41:25
But it was a Catholic bookstore, but I was invited to this businessman's home. 
41:29
And he had meetings there all the time. 
41:32
And it was the first time I ever saw the river of life flowing in someone's home. 
41:38
Really? 
41:39
I said, I didn't even know this man. 
41:41
This man is living his life right. 
41:44
Because I have never seen, I've seen it in mine sometimes, but never seen it anywhere else. 
41:49
This man was really living his life wholly on purpose. 
41:53
He was a great businessman in Reading and they couldn't get the people in the home. 
41:58
Some of them had surrounded the home. 
42:00
We're sitting outside and I went, wow. 
42:02
And I said to him, do you realize that your, your own angels are surfing on the river of life in your home? 
42:10
He said, yes, I knew that. 
42:12
Wow. 
42:13
And he was Catholic as well. 
42:15
You're saying I don't think he was Catholic besides, besides that place being invited to speak. 
42:21
It wasn't planned. It was totally unplanned. 
42:23
Okay. 
42:24
People found out I was there. 
42:26
I would speak in the intercessors, backyards. 
42:28
It started in their home. 
42:29
When you have 150 people show up, you can't just keep it in your home. 
42:32
Right. 
42:33
So they moved it outside. 
42:34
It was just crazy. 
42:35
The response from the people that were so hungry. 
42:38
But one of the places I remember very well was the Catholic bookstore. 
42:43
And how gracious the people were and how excited they were to receive heaven culture and what heaven is all about. 
42:50
But this businessman was another person that I did get to speak in his home. 
42:54
And they had so many people show up. 
42:56
They were, they were, they were filling the streets with their cars and everything. 
42:59
But that was very significant that he did have what she said, an open heaven over his home. 
43:05
And you can create a habitation for heaven is what they call it. 
43:09
They don't come and live there forever, but they'll come and go in, in the presence of your home. 
43:14
They want to see your life. 
43:15
They want to see who's invited over to hear about Christ. 
43:18
And so that's not an impossible thing. 
43:21
And does the person, does the person ask God to, you know, say, I'll do my part, but could you bring an open portal over me? 
43:29
Or does it just happen? 
43:30
And you're from what you've seen. 
43:32
I'm going to start creating a habitation for heaven. 
43:36
And then automatically that portal is one of the things that would be established over your home. 
43:42
Okay. 
43:43
Good, good, good. 
43:44
All right. 
43:45
Aaron is asking, he said, he or she can maybe be one or the other. 
43:50
I heard Kat Kerr teach about the temple in heaven. 
43:54
Is that a different place from the throne room of God? 
43:57
And then I want to add to that. 
43:59
Is it a literal temple, just like another temple, but it's just not made with hands? 
44:04
Or is it something different, but it's still the temple? 
44:09
What would you say there? 
44:10
Well, I know they don't have church services in heaven. 
44:14
Everybody's already born again. 
44:16
It's there. 
44:17
They do have different meetings in different big buildings, but that I was actually talking about the throne room. 
44:23
If anything was going to be like a temple, it would be there. 
44:27
There's the altar is there, the altar of God is there. 
44:30
And people do go there and underneath his area that he sits in, his throne is a structure. 
44:37
It's not just a throne sitting three feet off the floor. 
44:40
It is very high and lifted up and underneath that is our rooms that you can go into and to declare things for your family or pray. 
44:49
It talks about one of those places, but the altar at the top of the throne room at the top of the throne itself. 
44:57
There is an altar and those rooms are way down below that in rooms. 
45:02
I used to think, are they under the altar itself like physically under that altar? No, they're in rooms that are under that altar. 
45:10
So the altar would sit sort of at the top and there's a throne behind it and then the other throne is next to it. 
45:18
And so Jesus sits in a throne with his father, but there's other thrones there and sometimes he invites people to come and sit on them. 
45:26
Sometimes he had some for children to sit on and I think everybody, if you ever saw Colton Burpo's movie, 
45:35
he actually said he was taken to heaven and God got a little throne or a little thing and set it right by his. 
45:42
And so that just confirms he does do that. 
45:45
This is that book we're having. It's called Heaven is for Real, right? That's that book. Colton Burpo was the name. 
45:51
Yeah, under the altar. I wanted to ask you about this before because you said it before. 
45:56
I think it's in Revelation. It says under the altar, there were people that were crying out. 
46:00
And one of the times it says, how long until you avenge blah, blah, blah, our blood is something like that. 
46:07
They were the voice of the martyrs. 
46:09
Are you familiar with that very much and what's the difference between that under the throne or under the altar? 
46:17
Maybe that's all the same. What do you know about that? 
46:20
I don't know if they go. I know there's not like time. So I can't say they're there for three hours. 
46:27
Someone else is there. I can't say that. I say that that structure is so huge. 
46:32
You can imagine living creatures probably bigger than any building we have here. They're huge. 
46:39
They're standing at like the four, I can't even say corners. The throne room is round. 
46:46
That is the very center. It would be like looking at him. There's two here and two back here. 
46:54
So the four of them are always looking at him and shouting things on his behalf. 
46:59
And you have to remember some people go up to the throne room. If they're showing everything there, 
47:05
they don't even know what to think or say. They're so undone. 
47:08
The throne itself, the one the father sits on and Christ sits next to him. 
47:15
There's two arms, but those arms rest on the backs of two more living creatures that have four heads. 
47:24
It talks about them. There's four heads. Like now we know that there's four. 
47:30
We know that there's four different living creatures, but there's also two that actually stay with the throne all the time. 
47:37
And they have four heads. This is a living creature. This is not something that's just carved. 
47:43
They're massive. So this throne is so high and lifted up. 
47:47
Just because of the size of these living creatures that are surrounded and the ones that hold up the throne, the arms of the throne, 
47:55
I'm telling you, you don't know what power is. No one knows what true power and holiness is until you stand before that throne. 
48:07
And these tiny little ants of people of the wicked who think they're going to overthrow him, 
48:15
he could just suck the life away from them. They'd be dust, but he's not going to do that. 
48:19
He has plans. He follows what he has said in place. 
48:23
But there are days of reckoning. Justice is coming for them. 
48:27
And no one or nothing on the earth can stand before God and say, you're not going to do it. 
48:32
And I understand when they say that they have no clue who he is or the power that comes from him. 
48:40
And that's who you belong to. If you're born again, that's who your God is. 
48:45
That's part of the God. He had Father, Son, Holy Spirit, such powerful beings, so holy that they do have personalities. 
48:54
They do do fun things with you. They created fun and heaven on purpose because we come home as the father, son and daughter. 
49:02
He's not going to just leave you on your own to roam around there. He has already prepared a place for you. 
49:07
That's where you will live. You may have more than one place on your own property. 
49:12
Because he does do that sometimes, but you don't understand until that is why I am so fierce about having no fear. 
49:23
Why would I fear if I had stood before that throne, life coming in and out of him, seeing the lightning bolt shoot on him, 
49:33
knowing that he had decimated hell, Satan, and he knows the plans for them are nothing. 
49:41
Their plan is to die forever in the lake of fire, and he's never changing that. 
49:46
But you, you and I, who belong to him will live for all of eternity. There's no end to it. 
49:52
Life excited, life beautiful, life creating, life filled with love and his presence. 
50:01
That's who we serve. That's sitting on that throne. He knows every single person and what they're doing. 
50:07
He knows your life. He's heard your prayers. He knows your heart. He's not for you. 
50:13
We're entering into and he is setting up right now. 
50:17
Some of the greatest days this earth cannot pass away into everything he has decided to do on this earth, 
50:25
forest with us and because of him, it's going to happen. 
50:30
And no matter what people think, roll up that rapture of people and get your heart. 
50:35
Because we will be rolling with Christ in this very earth before we ever get to heaven or the new earth. 
50:43
And that's what needs to be on your heart. Not all the sad, sick stories, lame stories coming from the fake, 
50:52
the illegitimate and the wicked. 
50:55
They're in another whole book. They're not even what your name is written in. 
51:00
And you need to understand, really think about that sometimes. Talk about that sometimes. 
51:06
Because if you want the supernatural work in your life, you better be talking about it. 
51:11
Even if it's only to yourself. 
51:14
Yeah, that's good. That's really good because some people say, who do I talk to? 
51:17
And you just said, only if you only talk to yourself. Because your thoughts are like shouts to him, right? 
51:22
He hears every word. 
51:24
Oh yes. Every time you say something like, the Lord is God and there's none beside him. 
51:30
All of heaven gets excited. All of heaven can hear that. 
51:35
But the heart of God, our Father, it swells with love because he knows his son is being honored. 
51:43
And anyone who honors Christ on this earth, you're not going to ever lose your place with him. 
51:48
You're not going to lose the reward. You're not going to lose things in the exciting times. 
51:53
Your name is already on the list to be used by God during these days. 
51:57
And so you need to understand, he knows what's going on and he knows who's doing it. 
52:03
And this is going to be one of the greatest fraud exposures in the history of this world. 
52:09
And because he has his own plan and those are the plans that will happen. 
52:14
Not the other plans. 
52:16
So can you, you know, you remember seven years ago ish somewhere. 
52:20
Somewhere that you came to our room on the cruise and I said, okay, Kat, I was just getting to know you. 
52:26
And I said, are you telling me that you, you sat here like before the God of the universe and you talked with God face to face. 
52:36
And you said, yes, so my question is, how does that work if there's even any way to describe because we know God is high and lifted up. 
52:44
And the Lord's, you know, and so there's that God who is fearsome and almighty and wonderful and all these things. 
52:50
But is it through his omnipresence, you can talk with him face to face at the same time he's there, or is he go there. 
52:58
And then how would you describe the difference between sitting there talking to him face to face and the guy that's high and lifted up that you're probably not going to be chatting it up with. 
53:08
I don't know what what are your thoughts. 
53:11
I have to say it's one of the greatest experiences I ever have and I've had that many times. 
53:16
I mean, you know, before all of this started back in the late 80s, when Christ came to me and said that father and I are going to let you reveal heaven. 
53:26
We're going to take you on tours around heaven, let you reveal heaven to earth. 
53:30
We are tired of the myths and the mysteries and the lies Satan has been spreading. 
53:34
Man has been spreading. 
53:35
We're going to set that straight and people will know what how heaven operates. 
53:39
They're going to know what goes on there, what life is like, what happens when they pass away. 
53:43
And obviously, at this time in my life, I was, I mean, passionately pursuing Jesus Christ to know him. 
53:52
And they had already planned to do this with me. 
53:55
It wasn't something I said I want that I wanted what they wanted. 
54:00
That part had happened. 
54:01
I had given them permission to come to me anytime they want to say something. 
54:05
It didn't matter if they said it inside me or outside me. 
54:09
And yet this had to start at a certain time on the earth, heaven had to be revealed beginning at a certain time on the earth. 
54:15
And so that was their choice. 
54:17
And because they choose whatever they choose, I'm going to go along with. 
54:21
And yeah, visit me face to face. 
54:23
Just like what I was talking with you. 
54:25
They came through the wall. 
54:27
They don't have to walk through doors. 
54:28
They come to the wall. 
54:30
They come to the wall, a hotel and speak to me. 
54:33
And all many times they'll say things to me. 
54:35
Sometimes you'll see the father is a swirling rainbow. 
54:38
Most of the time I just see him. 
54:41
Many times I'm caught up to heaven itself. 
54:43
I've been in the throne room. 
54:45
There's besides the main throne room, there's a commissioning throne room where mantles are given out. 
54:51
The commissioning throne room is a throne room that has the altar with the horns on it. 
54:55
Those are two different authors. 
54:57
The altar before the throne is the one that is used for people to bring their prayers and their desires to the father in person. 
55:05
But then there's a commissioning throne room or mantles. 
55:08
I said mantles are given for people on the earth. 
55:10
They're commissioned at this throne room and then they're brought down to the earth and placed on the people. 
55:15
There's so much to understand about how heaven operates, but whatever they choose, 
55:20
I have stood in the presence of Holy Spirit, the invisible member of the Godhead, 
55:26
and seen fire outline his whole body. 
55:29
And he can be as big as he wants or not, but he does have a real body. 
55:33
And I've seen Jesus Christ so many times, even before I was caught up in heaven, I saw him face to face. 
55:40
Even when I was young, I would see him face to face. 
55:43
So I'm from, I'm seventh generation of believer who actually believes and lives wholly on purpose. 
55:50
And I was picked out of all those in him to represent heaven on the earth as a seventh generation believer. 
55:59
My dad lived it, his mother lived it. 
56:02
We've got his history back to the others in my family line. 
56:07
Sometimes a whole line, a certain line of believers is chosen to do certain things during the different generations on the earth. 
56:14
I am not doing this just because of me. 
56:17
I'm doing it because I represent that family line. 
56:20
And out of all those who are here, he chose me knowing what my heart was, what I was willing to do his way, his will, his way. 
56:30
It makes a difference, but yes, I do really see him face to face and I'm undone every single time. 
56:38
The time Christ came and sat next to me and actually told me what I would be doing. 
56:43
First they just announced it. 
56:45
Then later I was caught up in heaven for years and shown things. 
56:49
Then when Christ came back in 2005 and told me that I'd be writing books, traveling around the world and all the stuff that began to happen. 
56:56
I don't even think I was breathing. 
57:00
I don't even remember breathing with him sitting next to me. 
57:03
The love he had for me, the waves of the love of the father and revealing their plan. 
57:10
And they picked me because I'm a detailed person. 
57:14
I have photographic memories. 
57:16
So there's reasons why I never argue with God. 
57:19
I never tell him to do it a different way. 
57:21
And I've met a lot of people that tell God he should do something a different way. 
57:24
I don't do that. 
57:26
I don't do that. 
57:27
I honored my own father. 
57:28
I loved my dad. 
57:29
I served him also when he was on the earth, but it was just something he had already had planned. 
57:34
And I didn't say no. 
57:36
I didn't argue with anything he said. 
57:38
And that means a lot. 
57:39
So God says something to you. 
57:41
Don't argue with him. 
57:43
Yeah. 
57:44
Yeah. 
57:45
Yeah. 
57:46
And you, as a seer, you might have had a really clear connection. 
57:48
I know there's other people that are operating out of faith because they're not hearing actual words. 
57:54
And so they're going, Lord, to the best of my ability, my answer is yes. 
57:58
And then they may have to proceed without a clear direction. 
58:01
Is that also true in other words? 
58:03
I think if you ever do that, he's going to start giving you clear direction. 
58:06
Once you have actually said, yes, verbally said it. 
58:10
Yeah. 
58:11
Openly said it to him is very important. 
58:13
Yeah. 
58:14
And if you're not sure you say, I'm not sure that I really think this is you speaking to me. 
58:19
I'm going to go in the direction you want me to go in. 
58:21
So that's good. 
58:22
Open the doors and give me clarity whenever I need it. 
58:26
And you need to be like, probably more focused on what you're saying to him. 
58:31
Yeah. 
58:32
It makes a difference. 
58:33
It's not like, it's not always going to shut you out if you don't, but it opens more and 
58:37
gives because they don't take things. 
58:39
Satan steals and takes, he'll control you, he'll use you, abuse you as much as he can get away with. 
58:45
He's getting away with it. 
58:47
Well, I'm not letting him get away with anything. 
58:49
Of course, being a seer does in that way. 
58:52
Maybe it gives me a little bit of an edge. 
58:55
But, but I had always been seeing ever since I was little. 
58:59
And yes, I do clearly see, I see things walking down the street going on in the spirit realm. 
59:04
Some of them will say, just leave it, keep going. 
59:06
Sometimes they'll say to declare something. 
59:09
So my life is like, not normally any sense of the word, but I'm telling you, when you get to heaven, you'll always be able to see any of them when you want to. 
59:18
But there's coming a time on the earth, not too far in the future. 
59:23
Well, these visitations and heaven encounters will be for many people. 
59:27
They'll be for many people. 
59:29
During this time, it probably pretty much eventually you're going to go because of your staying that you made and you didn't back up and you don't bash people who are doing things for God, even though you didn't understand it. 
59:43
Whatever you do, don't side with the left. 
59:45
Don't side with evil, you know, whenever something's presented, you say, you know, I'm not doing that or I'm not a part of that or I'm not believing for that. 
59:53
I'm not agreeing with that. 
59:55
All those statements you make, every statement you make matters in heaven. 
01:00:00
It matters in the atmosphere at home. 
01:00:03
Inviting to your home because if you're watching things that are like defiling or all the time, guess what? 
01:00:11
I was in someone's home. 
01:00:13
I went there to that was my place. 
01:00:15
I was staying in and there were two demons standing right next to their television and Jen was with me and she goes, what is in this room? 
01:00:22
And I said, well, they told us to enjoy their selection of movies they had. 
01:00:27
We wouldn't watch any of them. 
01:00:29
None of them. 
01:00:31
The person who lived there had been almost killed eight times. 
01:00:34
I said, it's the movies. 
01:00:36
I just told them it's the movies in your cabinet. 
01:00:39
There's so much gross violence just knowing the titles of those movies and and the fact that those were not visitors. 
01:00:47
Those were those were residents in their home because of all the content of the evil that they had there. 
01:00:53
And I just tell people you need to get rid of this stuff. 
01:00:56
You need to burn it. 
01:00:57
I said, and you've almost been killed how many times I said such graphic violence. 
01:01:02
You invite those spirits to to get into your life, which is true. 
01:01:08
And so being a seer, it makes it different when they go places like I'm going to go stay at the holiday in somewhere. 
01:01:15
But while we were there, we we couldn't even make them leave because they were residents. 
01:01:20
They gave them by the movies they were watching. 
01:01:23
The wife decided she's not going to tolerate. 
01:01:25
So I don't know what happened when we left. 
01:01:27
But I got a couple more questions. 
01:01:29
We started a little bit late, so we'll go a little few more minutes, but two more questions. 
01:01:33
Maybe I wanted to circle back to the to the altar because you said people in heaven will go to the altars and pray and give prayers and petitions. 
01:01:42
I think in heaven at the where where the Lord is where we're gone as high and lifted up. 
01:01:47
And yet there's also decreeing you go to the rooms under the altar and you said where they're making decrees. 
01:01:54
So my general question is both for them at the altar and for those under the altar making decrees. 
01:02:00
It seems like every decree in every prayer in heaven would by definition be a perfect prayer because you're sinless. 
01:02:08
There's no guile. 
01:02:09
There's no environment. 
01:02:10
There's no issues. 
01:02:11
There's no job. 
01:02:12
So if all of these people in heaven are praying, perfect prayers. 
01:02:18
Kat, what can you say? 
01:02:20
Are all of those prayers getting answered? 
01:02:23
Yes. 
01:02:24
And amen. 
01:02:25
What would you say about the effectiveness of those who are decreeing from heaven? 
01:02:28
Does it always happen the way they know that answer because I'm getting the prayers. 
01:02:34
Okay. 
01:02:35
They go right there as the throne or like I said under the throne, I probably will do a basic sketch of that so people have a better understanding. 
01:02:45
But I understand why images are stolen by Satan and used everywhere because from a distance the throne itself looks like this. 
01:02:57
Like a triangle or like a pyramid. 
01:03:01
I would say, well, what I would call a pyramid because there's depth to it. 
01:03:06
Four sets of steps going all the way up the throne on the four sides going up there. 
01:03:12
And then there are some areas that have closed doors where people go in and pray for things. 
01:03:18
So I know what I've seen or I've been told. 
01:03:22
I can't tell things I haven't seen or haven't been told. 
01:03:26
I do know that's where people go to declare, they go to put petitions before the Lord. 
01:03:31
I would pretty much think that most of them are on behalf of their family or things going on on the earth. 
01:03:37
And I do know that from there, from the throne itself, angels are being sent. 
01:03:42
I can say that part. 
01:03:43
They're being sent all the time. 
01:03:45
They're called up to the throne. 
01:03:46
They're given messages or assignments and they leave from there and come to the earth. 
01:03:51
And I think that probably has something to do with those prayers being given or petitions being given from from those rooms underneath the altar in heaven. 
01:04:00
Yeah, awesome. 
01:04:02
Well, someone had a word for me that they heard what my father, my natural father who is down in heaven was praying for me. 
01:04:08
And so they told me what the prayer was. 
01:04:11
And it made me wonder is that you say you kind of saying you don't really know the answer. 
01:04:16
The question was, was that prayer that he asked, was it absolute? 
01:04:19
Was God going to absolutely pray because every prayer in heaven is perfect? 
01:04:23
He would think. 
01:04:24
I think there may be timing on some of those prayers. 
01:04:28
Yeah, right. 
01:04:29
If God is in the midst of drawing somebody closer to him, or maybe they're in a time of training in their life for things that he's going to give them to do or something like that. 
01:04:41
And I don't think he'll give you something that is too soon for what you're doing with you. 
01:04:47
Right. 
01:04:48
You know, for three years, especially three years in my life, when I lost my job, my great law job, they let me go because I wouldn't take another lawyer on because the Lord said they're going to do this. 
01:05:00
You're going to say, no, you're not taking on the lawyer. 
01:05:02
He said, I know that I need those three years to train you. 
01:05:05
He didn't tell me what I was being trained for. 
01:05:07
It was all this stuff I'm doing. 
01:05:09
And I said, OK, and it happened exactly the way the day he said it would happen. 
01:05:13
It happened 30 days. 
01:05:14
Really? 
01:05:15
They came in, they said the very thing he said they would say, I gave him the answer he said to give. 
01:05:20
And so from that time, I was totally blown to the Lord. 
01:05:25
And there were things he did train me in. 
01:05:27
Yeah. 
01:05:28
Go places when he said to go to do what he said to do. 
01:05:31
And for three years, he did that. 
01:05:33
So he let me know that was going to happen. 
01:05:36
I didn't know within that timeframe, he couldn't give me all that I have accumulated now in revelation. 
01:05:44
And in training and ruling. 
01:05:48
He had to have me go through that three years of preparing me that I would understand him more and understand having plans more. 
01:05:57
So yes, they're given prayers. 
01:05:59
Trust me. 
01:06:00
They're there. 
01:06:01
I know that some things are asking for things for their family members and places, maybe your areas place places. 
01:06:07
And I know the father writes it down. 
01:06:09
He likes to literally write things down, whatever said. 
01:06:12
Yeah. 
01:06:13
But he's not going to ignore them. 
01:06:15
He's not ignoring. 
01:06:16
They're up there cheering you on praying for you declaring over you. 
01:06:20
And when something suddenly happens so totally unexpected, that thing was probably an answer to the prayers of one of your family members. 
01:06:29
Very cool. 
01:06:30
You were talking about God trains you and you were training. 
01:06:33
I'm going to share this. 
01:06:34
I'm not going to give the name of the person, but there's a famous or was famous person to see she had a global. 
01:06:42
Recognize she was globally recognized. 
01:06:44
She said to me this last week, she said, I knew I watched cat cur when she worked at that church in Florida and she she did. 
01:06:54
She was in the she helped prepare food and she ministered people and she did everything God told. 
01:07:00
She didn't try to get ahead of anything. 
01:07:02
She didn't try to be something and she says, I watched her do that and now I see what God is taking her. 
01:07:07
I just want to say that because here was a person you may or may not know who I'm talking about, but she was watching you the whole time. 
01:07:14
And now she's so proud of where you come in and now she's learning from it. 
01:07:17
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about? 
01:07:20
That could have probably been several different people. 
01:07:23
Yeah. 
01:07:24
Yeah. 
01:07:25
Anyway, I thought I'd share that. 
01:07:27
And then we'll come and ask me a question or something that I was doing, but I was about the father's business that was cooking, cleaning, setting up, decorating for all those events that we had. 
01:07:39
And that wasn't my favorite thing. 
01:07:41
Isn't that funny? 
01:07:42
So it may be inconvenient sometimes. 
01:07:45
It may be inconvenient for you. 
01:07:48
Maybe you don't understand why, but if he said it, just do it, people just say yes to him and do it. 
01:07:54
And then you won't miss what he has for you. 
01:07:57
Yeah. 
01:07:58
Yeah, that was amazing. 
01:07:59
It was a good lesson for me and for people watching because I go, oh, so Kat wasn't always, wasn't born ready to be a prophet and caught up to heaven. 
01:08:07
God's giving her promotion after promotion. 
01:08:09
You served and served and served. 
01:08:11
I did. 
01:08:12
You said you got fired from that one job. 
01:08:14
Did you? 
01:08:15
I did. 
01:08:16
Well, it wasn't really fired. 
01:08:18
I made it. 
01:08:19
It's the way they give you a choice. 
01:08:20
You can stay. 
01:08:21
You can take a second attorney to be under. 
01:08:25
There was no time. 
01:08:26
It didn't make sense. 
01:08:27
Yeah. 
01:08:28
And my boss lawyer said that doesn't make sense that the board is saying you have to take a second lawyer. 
01:08:33
But I knew why that was happening. 
01:08:35
It was his way of releasing me from there. 
01:08:37
And I could see that it happened exactly the way he said it would. 
01:08:41
So I did a great job and I had great relationship with my boss, with his wife. 
01:08:48
His family came to visit him all the time in the law office, which was very rare. 
01:08:51
He was a Christian. 
01:08:53
And so he knew I had favor with the judges favor with the county clerks. 
01:08:58
You couldn't just call a judge and say, change this date. 
01:09:01
I can't make it there. 
01:09:02
No, I wouldn't tell you what they'd say to you. 
01:09:05
But some people just have favor and they go, of course I'll change that. 
01:09:09
And so there was reasons why he recognized that I had favor from God for things. 
01:09:14
But the time came when God was taking me to the next thing to repair for what he had for me, 
01:09:19
which is what I'm doing now. 
01:09:21
Yeah. 
01:09:22
And I was excited when I went home and told my husband 30 days from now, I won't have my job anymore. 
01:09:26
You did. 
01:09:27
I was excited knowing that something was going to happen. 
01:09:30
And then he told me my husband at one point wouldn't have his either. 
01:09:34
And it happened just like he said, he wouldn't have it. 
01:09:37
But he really took care of us so amazingly during that time. 
01:09:41
And then he begins to establish us in what our call was in our life. 
01:09:47
So even in the times when you don't understand, maybe you don't clearly hear, 
01:09:51
you trust him because he is preparing you for something that he really needs done. 
01:09:58
And he's always watching when you say God writes everything down. 
01:10:02
Of course, aren't angels recording things too? 
01:10:06
Yeah, there's five angels sent to be with you. 
01:10:09
I see them with some people and they're always, they have a tablet kind of a thing, 
01:10:13
not like we have here, but it's just different. 
01:10:15
But the father is the one who loves to write things down. 
01:10:19
Jesus, not so much. 
01:10:21
Not so much. 
01:10:22
Jesus has to go and speak and share and not, 
01:10:25
but the father has always written things down. 
01:10:28
He loves to write things down. 
01:10:29
He has book of remembrance. 
01:10:31
He has a lamest book of life. 
01:10:33
He has got many different books that are his own that he writes in. 
01:10:38
Okay, let me ask you. 
01:10:39
Here's one last question. 
01:10:40
This is Elaine. 
01:10:41
I'm trying to find one that's a little shorter, but Elaine's asking, 
01:10:45
Kat, I know Jesus laughs in heaven, but have you ever seen the father God laugh? 
01:10:51
A big old belly laugh out loud is a question. 
01:10:54
I was just imagining the father with his head back with long flowing white hair, 
01:10:59
just letting out a big laugh. 
01:11:01
He absolutely does do that. 
01:11:03
He absolutely does. 
01:11:06
I think I'm continually amazed by the father. 
01:11:11
I know why his son loves him so much and he does. 
01:11:15
I mean, I think the hardest thing Christ went through is the three days he was separated from him 
01:11:20
and was not allowed to hear him or anything. 
01:11:22
And he had to stand for what he knew was going to happen when he had to go over to hell 
01:11:27
and then wipe them all out later. 
01:11:29
But the father does laugh. 
01:11:31
He actually does laugh. 
01:11:32
Sometimes when people come home, 
01:11:34
he's so overjoyed that he'll just laugh out loud. 
01:11:38
And then you can't help everybody and someone will begin to laugh because like contagious. 
01:11:43
Yeah. 
01:11:44
And he does have a big laugh. 
01:11:45
It's a big laugh. 
01:11:46
His voice has got layers in it. 
01:11:48
So it multiplies the intensity of what he's saying or laughing at. 
01:11:53
Oh, I'd love to see that and hear that. 
01:11:55
Awesome. 
01:11:56
And on that question, where you said, are you actually just volunteered this? 
01:12:00
You said going up to heaven or visiting heaven and these experiences are going to be for the many soon. 
01:12:09
Roughly. 
01:12:10
You said something roughly like that. 
01:12:11
My question was right now, I know, I can, I know seven or eight to have had these encounters. 
01:12:18
I know the war details of that between you and maybe Kim Robinson, Robinson, Donna, 
01:12:26
the multiple things, but when you say for the many, are you talking about for millions upon millions of Christians will be being caught up? 
01:12:33
What would you say? 
01:12:35
I have, I'm not sure about the number, but I know that many will. 
01:12:39
And I think we're entering into a season of greatness of God being demonstrated and manifested all over the world. 
01:12:48
It's going to start happening. 
01:12:49
I do know you told me at one time he'll take whole congregations or whole groups of people at one time. 
01:12:55
So it's going to increase. 
01:12:57
It's really going to begin to increase. 
01:12:59
That was a huge word you just said. 
01:13:00
You're saying God sometimes is going to catch up a whole congregation. 
01:13:03
Yes, he did say that to me. 
01:13:05
Whoa. 
01:13:06
Dream. 
01:13:07
I used to pray that when we go to heaven, we could be go together. 
01:13:11
I don't think we pray that any more because right now all we want to do is go, whether one of us goes together, we just want to go. 
01:13:17
But it'd be cool knowing that God would sometimes take a couple or a church or an interesting time. 
01:13:26
He really did say that. 
01:13:28
Is there anything before we close that you can think of that in this hour, crucial hour that we're living in, things are happening in the news, things are happening in the church, that you would like to leave the people with? 
01:13:41
If you could just, sometimes I think, Kat, you must, I know you don't, I know you don't get anxious, probably, or fear like that. 
01:13:51
But are there times you just wish the body of Christ could grab hold of this one thing right now in this hour that they're having a hard time grabbing hold of? 
01:13:59
Is there anything like that? 
01:14:01
I think sometimes it doesn't make sense at all because God doesn't live. 
01:14:08
He doesn't live or think the way you live or think. 
01:14:11
He is God, and I'm talking about the Father. 
01:14:14
And I think the one thing he told me to tell everybody to do is still the best thing to do. 
01:14:19
You start celebrating, and I know in your head, well, all the stuff's going on, these words are being said, but when you do, God has said to do, it's him saying it. 
01:14:29
Eat, cake, and celebrate because he knows, no matter what's going on around you, what's being said, even the regulations, even the criminal acts that they're doing in our government right now, or other wicked people, 
01:14:43
you cannot let that be your new norm. 
01:14:45
It is not your new norm. 
01:14:47
God is your norm. 
01:14:49
It should be the thing you go to, the thing you talk about, the thing you're excited about. 
01:14:53
He holds time within himself. 
01:14:56
It comes from him. 
01:14:58
He knows the days are getting very short for those things to continue that you're seeing now. 
01:15:04
He wants every single thing and person and group totally exposed that are part of trying to take over. 
01:15:13
He wants that to happen. 
01:15:15
Until that time, besides just praying, giving your prayers or your praise, make sure you're praising and praying. 
01:15:23
Don't let it only go to like, I've got to pray this or else you need to pray. Sometimes praise is better than praying because he already knows what you need. 
01:15:31
Praising is actually thanking him for doing it before it happens. 
01:15:35
And this celebrate thing he wants you to do is those who've done or building layers in your soul of that celebration. 
01:15:43
And when it happens, it will be so powerful for those who have agreed with God that celebration is coming. 
01:15:52
Things are changing. It is totally going to be different. 
01:15:56
It won't be anything like it is right now. That's what you're actually doing. 
01:16:00
I would say the most important thing you do is do what he is saying himself in these days with all this going on. 
01:16:07
You celebrating victory and freedom before you actually see it happen is one of the most powerful things you can do. 
01:16:16
Not just for yourself and your family, but for the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit and all of heaven. 
01:16:23
Looking down and saying they really believe and trust you that this is going to happen what you have said. 
01:16:30
And I think that other than that is helping other people who are in a place of fear, who are in a place of turmoil. 
01:16:40
Pray for them that that fear will leave, that understanding will come, that clarity will come. 
01:16:46
They don't have to live in a place of doubt, of fear, of being taken over by the enemy. 
01:16:53
We don't belong to the enemy. You came from the Father and lived in him. 
01:16:58
He knows your name. He knows who you are. He knows what you need. 
01:17:04
And sometimes the fastest way to get things you need is to thank him. 
01:17:09
That's good. 
01:17:10
You have to pray. Well, Cece, because you need something, you pray once, then thank him. 
01:17:15
That's so good. 
01:17:16
You have to get that. Whatever that thing is, a lot quicker by thanking him and showing gratitude that you're trusting him for it. 
01:17:24
Really good, Kat. Really good. Would you go ahead and pray for the people? 
01:17:28
I know they always love it when you pray and decree over them. So awesome. 
01:17:31
Yeah, Father, right now I just take authority over all the darkness out there, the evil, the wickedness, the killing, stealing, destroying, defrauding, taking away, you know, robbing people, all of that. 
01:17:44
I take power over all of that darkness. 
01:17:46
I say it has not got permission to be here and has no right to operate in the life of a believer. 
01:17:53
We will not tolerate that continually going on. 
01:17:57
I'm an agreement with the Father that end is coming for wickedness and evil to be present everywhere. 
01:18:04
They don't have permission from us. 
01:18:07
I will give permission to nothing that is evil or darkness. 
01:18:10
I evict darkness from my home. 
01:18:13
I evict it from my life. 
01:18:15
I evict it from my city in Jesus' name and I release the life of God, the love of God, the plans of God, his celebration, his validation, 
01:18:26
his justice that is coming to this earth. 
01:18:29
He and he alone do I serve and I will serve no other God. 
01:18:35
I thank you Father for showing up and showing off on their behalf, set a place at your table in the very presence of the evil going on. 
01:18:45
That you know what's happening and you have a plan and I believe you and trust you with everything within me. 
01:18:53
I am on the same side you're on, the side of the right, the side of life, the side of love, the side of justice, freedom and liberty. 
01:19:04
Because that's life in heaven on earth as it is in heaven in Jesus' name. Amen. 
01:19:13
Amen, amen. 
01:19:15
Thank you, Kat. 
01:19:16
Hey, I think in the interest of time, let me just remind people revealing heaven. 
01:19:19
I want to do it with my finger. 
01:19:21
That is where you get the books and materials and that I don't do demons. 
01:19:26
Her website, catcurve.com is the one place. 
01:19:30
It's got spiritual resources that are free. 
01:19:33
It's the one place you can give to Kat and the only place you can give to Kat. 
01:19:37
It's right there, catcurve.com right there. 
01:19:39
Please support her ministry. 
01:19:41

Kat, thank you so much. 
01:19:45
Let's see, Barry Wench will be on tomorrow, Prophet Barry Wench, tomorrow is Thursday. 
01:19:51
Kat, you and I are taping a second show tomorrow, so we'll do that for next week. 
01:19:55

01:00
You 
01:31
Well, I would say happy Wednesday, but it is Thursday a week before you're going to see this 
01:37
We're recording the six days before 
01:39
For us you'll see on the clock behind me that it is Thursday, September 22 
01:44
You will be seeing this on the 28th. I believe I'm not right if I'm correct 
01:49
I believe it's you'll be seeing this on Wednesday the 28th. So just so you know 
01:53
This is when the words this is when the words were said and you'll see it on the 28th 
01:57
So, all right, so that's the story. We have Kat Kerr coming in here in just a moment 
02:02
Time I don't think I have any announcements. So we're gonna get right to it. So without further delay 
02:08
Let's bring in Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go 
02:11
You 
02:27
Well, there we are she is how's it going Kat? It's looking a little better right now 
02:31
Yeah, so when you're on your live on the air Kaz 
02:42
So we just for those that are watching we've been struggling with the lights 
02:45
It's a little better right now than it was. It's got you know, it's kind of we had a change in the light and the brightness 
02:51
We were trying to fix what what was broken so to speak. So anyway, welcome. Welcome. Good to see you 
02:56
So it's much later. It's actually 5 30 in the early evening for you, isn't it? I 
03:02
guess 
03:05
I'm just getting started. Yeah, this is your day. Yeah, this is towards 
03:13
Well, I mean this so that's good because that means it's gonna be a good show because you're gonna be awake and alert 
03:19
Yes, not that you aren't always so anyway 
03:22
Well, well, Kat, obviously this is today the set the 22nd, but they'll see it on the 28th. So 
03:31
Anything you want to say before I've got pages of questions, but about heaven and other things related 
03:36
But anything you want to tell the people before we get going on these questions? 
03:39
I think there's probably a little bit of something to tell them 
03:44
Sometimes I said sometimes I can't release it all one time, but I do know this for a fact 
03:50
I don't know who and I have to say that I always am honest 
03:54
I don't know who but I do know 
03:56
That there are covert people out there 
03:59
Gathering information that the other side, you know when I say the other side 
04:03
I mean, you know, if you decide not our yeah 
04:06
They have no clue about it because when you get so full of yourself and you think you've won 
04:11
And this goes for anyone if you're if you're on the wicked side and you think you've won 
04:16
That means you convinced you one that does not mean you have won in any shape or form of the word and a lot of that's actually 
04:24
still going on however 
04:26
Some are realizing even more realizing that this whole thing is going to go down the drain 
04:31
From what their plans were not our plans. Everybody knows our plans right goodness light hope love joy celebration 
04:40
So but the other side has no clue really they think they've got it made 
04:44
They think they've got the plans laid out and they're happening and they aren't happening at all and that should bring you hope 
04:51
That yes, there's more going on not seeing than stuff being seen 
04:57
What you're seeing is their plans their announcements that they generate all the time that brings no good 
05:04
If you didn't know this by now Satan, I'll just say Satan Satan can't create good. There's nothing good about him 
05:11
There's no good plans. He's never made. He's never done anything to help anybody and that's never going to change 
05:15
But the side of light is always working towards 
05:19
Great things happening more happening on our behalf on behalf of the world because this world still brought belongs to the Lord of Glory 
05:27
And he has let's say spirit realm operations for sure. You don't see them 
05:33
I see them and it's amazing the things going on that are about to happen and then on the other side 
05:40
On the flesh side, there's also stuff going on that no one is aware of whatsoever 
05:46
Which has to remain that way so always know this there's always somebody on your side 
05:52
If you're on the side of light, there's always somebody go things going on plans being made that actually will happen 
05:59
Because we who are in the light have a great foundation that cannot be shaken the other sides already been shaking 
06:07
Yeah, you remember that what the father said on November 
06:12
The fourth 2020 he said when it begins to shake and when the shaking begins 
06:18
It will not stop until everything is accomplished that he has planned and 
06:24
Therefore because that shaking has started in earnest in many places in the spirit realm and in the flesh because they're both happening 
06:33
That always tells me something is about to be exposed 
06:37
Something is about to be done and finished. So that's all I can leave you with today 
06:42
I hope that helps you to stay excited and remember to share truth 
06:47
Remember to share what brings hope and life and celebration and stop broadcasting what Satan wants to happen 
06:54
So I want to I want to ask you this now 
06:57
You have said before cat several times on a broadcast that the enemy Satan promised Hitler all kinds of things and he was going to make him 
07:05
Famous he was going to make him whatever it was and now as I recall you said since then since he he's been hanging on a hook and hell 
07:13
Is that am I saying that right? 
07:15
On a hook so on a meat hook. So what I'm so now is it or is it not true that even the deep state? 
07:22
Literal people have been promising their foot soldiers people we see on the news if you cooperate with these evil deeds 
07:30
We're going to do these good things for you. That's a lie, too 
07:33
Isn't it? It is a lie 
07:35
Well, the father of lies who is yeah is really in charge of everything even some of them don't know that they think it's them 
07:43
And it's not them. So because the father of lies Satan 
07:47
Cannot ever create anything good that is productive. It's going to bring forth help. He can't do it 
07:54
It's been it's been blotted out of his mind and that lightning bolt that you come out of heaven burnt part of his mind away 
08:00
That's what the father told me so nothing good will come from that for anyone involved in that 
08:06
That's just the way it's going to happen 
08:08
It's always been that way and I wish everybody could have been there and open the heaven leaves a meeting and her 
08:14
What was said by a couple of speakers if you can go to the Lord of hosts and watch those meetings 
08:20
You'll probably find out what I'm talking about 
08:22
They clearly exposes that deep state stuff and what's going on with them and what's going to happen according to the word 
08:29
Which is they're going to fail miserably and yet we who are here 
08:34
I will say a scripture I will quote with you until he that remains is removed the end of Christ cannot appear on the earth 
08:42
That is in the word of God 
08:44
He who remains is the body of Christ people operating in absolute dominion authority by the time those other greater days get here 
08:52
That's what will be happening. No one's going to need a rescuer people 
08:56
The only reason the antichrist comes is that people are screaming out for a rescuer 
09:00
But when we're gone and no one knows that day, but the father and it's not right around the corner just in case you wondered 
09:07
That is a scripture that is in the Bible and that's exactly what that means 
09:13
So we're here 
09:15
Not to be beat up and stepped on in the views, but we are here to rule Jesus Christ rules and mean now in this life 
09:22
And the time to come that's what's about to happen in this world 
09:26
And because that will be phone less greater than you ever imagined 
09:30
speaking to the land the sea in the air and running things for God on this earth so that it will be great 
09:37
There will be hope joy celebration and that is going to happen. That is those are the father's plans 
09:42
That is what is about to happen and you will just further further see the demise of everything else on the other side 
09:50
Because there's no one that can stand before the living God and say I'm taking over too bad 
09:55
That's never going to happen and until we are removed as the light in this world the body of Christ 
10:04
Operating in dominion in authority 
10:06
That's why I keep saying get your crown on because that is about to happen 
10:10
the other side is going to fail every single time and I think in these meetings that just happened was so fully 
10:17
explained by more than one speaker 
10:19
Including myself it was just a glorious time with the presence of God and everyone getting so excited about what was being shared 
10:29
From having what having the plans were so that's what I can tell you today 
10:32
And that's what you should expect to happen. That's what you should be talking about 
10:36
Yeah, I want to encourage those who are listening there are people that are part of the deep state 
10:40
They think we're nuts right now, but you're beginning there's some watching this that are beginning to a little way 
10:46
You're beginning to say maybe these guys maybe that lady with the pink hair is right 
10:50
Maybe that Steve Schultz of them are right. Maybe I'm on the wrong side 
10:53
Can I just say this if you're one of those people get out of there repent tell the Lord you're for you're sorry for for 
11:00
You know wanting darkness instead of like repent from it till ask the Lord to forgive you 
11:05
He'll rescue you before it's too late. So yeah, don't wait. Don't wait. Don't wait. Don't wait 
11:11
I wouldn't wait any longer if I were you. Yeah, it's right there folks, you know, you know, there are already in covert operations actually 
11:19
That are getting stuff from those some of those that you'll be shocked to find out who they are 
11:24
It's not the V person who's telling on everybody else who's involved in that 
11:28
But that's what always happens in these operations. It's always what happens when evil tries to take over 
11:34
There's already always somebody either a plant in that group or someone in that group getting 
11:41
Realization of the truth of what's happening and they don't want to do that anymore or be that anymore 
11:46
And as I've always said, please pray for their families the ones who under one stuff 
11:52
Illegally pray for all their families if they have nothing to do with that 
11:56
They don't want a part of it and yet they're probably in hiding yourself right now because of that 
12:01
So I do father I pray for all those right now who have a family members out there being evil and wicked 
12:07
Killing stealing and destroying father. I pray for their families father. You will protect them 
12:12
You will keep them you will bring them peace in their hearts and run after those who are doing that 
12:18
Let's sick Holy Spirit on them in Jesus name 
12:21
That if God has a plan for their life, they're gonna realize it and they're gonna turn and come back to him in Jesus name 
12:29
There's my prayer for the there you go. Awesome cat. Well, then well, we'll get into questions anyone 
12:34
That's new watching this cat has been and not she's not the only one many people on the earth have had this in 
12:40
Many encounters in heaven where they're caught up before the Lord cat is one of those primary ones that I know and she's she's been called 
12:47
To to bring heaven the teaching about heaven to the earth is that how you describe it cat? 
12:52
In person face-to-face commission with Jesus Christ when he informed me that father and he were gonna start taking me on chores 
13:04
of having to reveal the truth about heaven what life is like what happens from the moment you pass from this world or 
13:10
Step out of your body your physical body and what life will be like there 
13:14
That is a commission and I started back in the 80s and they have no intention of stopping it 
13:20
And I have no intention of asking them to stop 
13:26
What would you say cat 
13:29
To someone that says look we have the scriptures. They were codified. We know those 66 books 
13:36
God's told us what we want what we need to know 
13:39
There's there you shouldn't tell us anything. That's not in the Bible 
13:44
Because he's given us what we need all the things we need for life and godliness. What would you say to that? 
13:48
I think the Bible is definitely 
13:52
One of the most basic things you need in your life because it gives you truth 
13:56
Truth about Jesus Christ truth about life and death 
13:59
Truth about who we are is the body of Christ and it clearly says in there that he gives his power over all the power of the enemy 
14:06
And if you don't know what that is you need to know what that is 
14:09
He fully intends for you to understand what that means and also what what we have the right to do in this world as 
14:16
Kings and priests and to our God which it also states those are positions of authority and dominion and 
14:22
Some people can they'll read scriptures and they may understand they may not understand 
14:26
But when things change and these times are definitely changing 
14:30
Yeah, the messenger and has always sent a messenger John the Baptist was such a messenger 
14:38
He was changing everything by the word God gave him to speak that the Messiah was coming 
14:43
Then we would no longer offer animals of sacrifices back in those days that totally changed everything 
14:49
For those who believed in Jesus Christ's our life is changing their understanding the revelation was changing 
14:55
We're in one of those times right now where you need to know who you are and use the authority 
15:00
He gave you right now and therefore that is why he's revealing himself the father of the Holy Spirit 
15:05
Revealing how heaven operates what he has given us to do in this world if he says the earth is crying out itself 
15:12
For the manifested sons and daughters to stand up and say and do things 
15:18
To impact this world. That's what I share 
15:21
It is 
15:22
Scriptural and it is in the Bible and I had a personal commission and you all know even in the Bible people had personal commissions given by God 
15:31
Given by the Lord, then that's what they did while they were here on the earth 
15:34
I am no different than those other ones. Okay, and because I was asked and I said yes, that is what I am doing 
15:41
Yeah, good good good stuff. All right 
15:45
Deanna's asked the question. It's it's her granddaughter's question 
15:49
So I'm gonna read you that question and then I'm gonna add a couple more to it myself 
15:54
She wants to know are there schools in heaven and I'm gonna add to that 
16:00
The details are their classes are their courses are their trade schools any of those type of things any or all of those are none of those in heaven I 
16:10
I don't know about the trade schools 
16:13
I think that anything you don't know how to do or you would like to do horseback riding skydiving 
16:19
I mean, I can I'm just listing a bunch of things if you really have been doing that 
16:22
You go to the one who knows how to do that and yes, they will teach they teach people 
16:27
They they give classes and teach people 
16:29
But there is word university, which is the main one that everyone goes to when you come to heaven everyone 
16:36
revelation on every single scripture in the word and 
16:39
The ones who wrote those books in the Bible teach those books with revelation to you when you come to heaven 
16:47
There are classes. There is a specified place called word university 
16:51
Whoa, and I think pastors are the most excited people when they go to that go to those classes and they've learned the full revelation 
16:57
Of what the word what those words meant when that they were given and but being able to see or meet those 
17:04
Who wrote those scriptures who after they got to heaven were given revelation on that? 
17:08
That was going to be what their assignment was and also there's royal university that teaches you how to rule and reign 
17:15
Really not just not necessarily in heaven, but in the world to come on the new earth 
17:21
There will be people who have positions to be over certain areas 
17:24
In that at that time and you learn how to do that at royal university 
17:29
So those two places I know I've seen them word university and royal university actually do exist in heaven 
17:36
Yes, you will attend classes not in a school room behind a hard desk 
17:41
I'm not going to tell you how they do that, but it's in different places throughout heaven 
17:45
Even in the celestial realm that these classes take place in it 
17:48
You are so amazed and I'm done by what the father has to share with you when you get there 
17:54
I was totally going to ask you you mean sitting at desk like I'm picturing these school desks 
18:00
Where somebody walks by knocks your papers off just to have fun 
18:03
So this is not behind the desk. Nope. It's not like that. Okay. Very cool 
18:09
All right. Now, how come you said I'm not going to tell you how is it kind of a more secret or we just wouldn't understand 
18:16
How the learning exciting ways exciting ways that has taught you I want you to find that out when you get there 
18:21
Okay 
18:22
I'm gonna ask something my wife and I were talking about this thing where you've heard me talk about our loved ones that went before us and 
18:29
That didn't agree with the things we're doing like the stuff you and I are doing now 
18:33
people that are now going to be with the Lord and 
18:38
You know, we were talking about it was hard to visualize 
18:42
Even now them and even though we know they understand everything. It's hard to visualize them. They're going 
18:48
Wow, look what Stephen dream doing or doing because they always didn't like what we were doing 
18:56
You said they will be saying that it will be saying that they will be so fully 
19:00
Understanding what God has given you to do in this world and it will be excited. They'll probably watch a lot 
19:07
Don't watch a lot. Oh, that's a good word 
19:11
Well, that was my supposition I was saying I think they might from time to time 
19:16
Look down and say let's see what Stephen dreamer up to now because they're doing this prophetic and you know now 
19:22
They understand it. Okay interesting. So that for a lot of people who had people that went to be at the Lord 
19:28
They never understood what you were doing with the Lord now. They're cheering you on from heaven 
19:33
Yes, and I want you to repeat this one thing and I'm going to ask the next question 
19:38
But repeat to me what you said if you remember it and if you don't know, but the moment someone steps out of their body 
19:44
What they understand you said the moment they step out 
19:48
They understand you leave this physical body behind your spirit man is free from this physical body 
19:55
The presence of the Lord will begin to invade you right then it doesn't wait you get to heaven 
20:03
You already can feel his presence all around you joy floods your soul. You're so excited 
20:08
You know when you're going your guardian angels right there with you 
20:12
You'll see your guardian angel for the very first time if you've never seen them before 
20:15
There's probably more than one you'll see them right there 
20:18
They're waiting to take you home to heaven and that is the very first thing they experience is seeing their guardian angels 
20:25
And they're going to know they're the guardian angels and they'll introduce yourself to you and they'll tell you you've got to go home 
20:31
We're going home take you home to the glory 
20:33
We're going to the heavenly realm and we're here to take you and it's going to be okay 
20:38
But then excitement begins to pour into the heart when they realize they see their body 
20:43
They can clearly see their dead body 
20:45
Yeah, that they can feel and touch their self because of the spirit realms all around inside the physical realm and they're now 
20:53
There's spiritual bodies and they're they're able to touch they feel joy. They feel celebration. They feel excitement and 
21:00
And so that's what happens very first thing happens when you step out of this body 
21:06
You will get it back people even if you're cremated 
21:09
It's okay if you do that because God knows where every single ash is every cell of your physical body 
21:16
He's gonna bring it back together one day and you will have it back 
21:20
You know when you said 
21:22
Well, but well, I was gonna say but I had heard that before not only from you 
21:26
But someone else that God knows where all the pieces are and I'm thinking I don't necessarily want the old pieces 
21:31
Just give me a new body. Why do I want the old pieces? Did he literally get the pieces? 
21:38
He can find every single bit of it and he will put it back together 
21:42
Wow, okay, love your body because it will young it's gonna be young 
21:48
Yeah, there's no age in the spirit realm. You will be young. You'll be filled with life. You'll be strong 
21:55
The possibilities of what you will experience just because of what you are experiencing now 
22:00
It's okay. He's gonna give you your body back people, but it will not be old 
22:05
It will not be any cap. There'll be nobody blind sick lame 
22:09
None of that will be in your body once you get that body back 
22:12
So cremated or not God God takes the pieces and puts it all back together cremation. Nothing 
22:21
Yeah, put it all back together 
22:24
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. All right here. In fact, you kind of know this is different. I thought it might be similar 
22:30
Okay, Amy's asking this question when people freeze their embryos like IVM in vitro 
22:37
Fertilization when they freeze their embryos are there spirits? I don't know if she means souls 
22:44
Are there spirits frozen with them or does the spirit still live in God until it's implanted? 
22:51
That's the question normally it is after the conception has taken place 
22:57
It was it would be after conception is taken place. So I don't think the spirits in those embryos 
23:02
That's like the egg, right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, once it's implanted and I have no 
23:08
I have no opinion of my own ever about what people think I think about that. I know that when conception takes place 
23:16
Either from intro in how do you say that in vitro fertilization in vitro? 
23:22
Yeah, that conception must take place 
23:25
It has to so that has to they have to meet together like they would even in in the natural way and at that second 
23:33
At the very second that that implant takes place and there really is life right there 
23:39
That's when life begins. That is when your spirit body and soul is attached 
23:45
God can't attach it. There's nothing to attach it to. Yeah, put it in an egg 
23:50
He you have to have that conception take place. It's the best way easiest way I can say that and I know people 
23:56
Understand what I mean life begins a conception 
24:00
We cannot make a spirit and we cannot make a soul 
24:05
So our part is the the physical part and once that conception takes place 
24:10
Holy spirit will bring down from the father a little spirit of life 
24:15
Which is your spiritual body and your soul and it says it says in the Bible God said I knit you together in your mother's womb 
24:24
Well, he said that because he's the only one who can do it 
24:27
He's not talking about putting these arms and legs on people 
24:29
He's talking about your spirit man and your soul 
24:32
Being attached at that time of conception because they grow together the spirit and so grow with your body 
24:39
They grow and so that's when life begins. So no matter what they're trying to say through abortion 
24:44
It's not true. That's my people 
24:47
That's a baby that is a baby and that baby was sent from God and heaven 
24:52
It's little spirit and soul was knit together at the time of conception and from that time 
24:56
It grows through the different stages until it's time for it to be born 
25:00
It doesn't become a living human being when it's born. It already is on the inside of the mother 
25:05
Okay, yeah, I want to ask you probably the most controversial question. I've ever asked you I've known you for seven eight years 
25:12
I've never had the guts to ask this 
25:15
I'm gonna ask it today. So 
25:18
We all know the horrors of rape a woman women that get raped and out of those rapes sometimes there's conception 
25:26
What do you know of anything has God shown you anything about what how in the world does he then 
25:34
Put a spirit and soul in that 
25:36
Is he there's a plan of salvation kick in at that moment for for this little 
25:45
What what can you say if anything about that any babies any and all babies? 
25:50
Even if they're like a week old in the womb or something else they all go to heaven when they pass every one of them 
25:56
Goes to happen when they pass they're innocent. They weren't a part of that, but I will tell you why it happened Steve God makes 
26:04
I could call it a protocol. I don't want to call it a law 
26:08
There are laws of creation if you want to call it that the way it happens 
26:12
There's just the way it happens and God made that a 
26:17
Protocol he will not change or take away 
26:21
Because there's so many to send the way he ordered it to happen is at the time of conception 
26:27
No matter how the conception takes place if that is that is joined together if the eggless one is joined together 
26:34
That is true conception 
26:36
He always made it that when that happens 
26:39
He will send a send a spirit and a soul in an innate in a body and send that and attach it 
26:46
He can't take that away 
26:47
There'll be too many ways for the enemy to get in to prevent things or not have things happen 
26:52
And so that baby can still be kept and watched over it can still be raised even if he sent them as a prophet 
27:00
I've known quite a few people that were born because of that and the mother still wanted them born and they're in their 
27:06
And their destiny still happen 
27:08
So I know those aren't the best of circumstances 
27:11
Yeah, but I will tell you that when that takes place no matter how that takes place when conception takes place 
27:18
Life will happen and there will be that joining together when God said I knit you 
27:25
That means anyone who was sent by him. I knit you together in your mother's womb 
27:30
That means he attached that little spirit with someone at that dot of flesh that was just created by conception 
27:37
You know, do you know anything about the scripture where David says in sin? 
27:41
My mother conceived me has God shown you what that meant at all. Do you are you familiar with that scripture? 
27:47
Yes, he basically says it's in my mother. I don't know. Maybe perhaps she didn't know 
27:54
Possibly she didn't know that there was a creator or didn't do even that wasn't even her thought pattern of doing that 
28:00
But I'm glad David remained. Yeah. Yeah, for sure 
28:05
No, I knew he would become David when he sent him when he needed to gather in that mother's womb 
28:10
He knew who he would be when he grew up. He knew that would be David. He knew that would become King David 
28:15
It's amazing. Amazing. All right, Aaron asked my son is down nine 
28:20
But when he was young maybe two or three while in his bedroom 
28:23
He said he saw the spooky bats going in and out of the spooky castle 
28:27
I'm positive. He was seeing the spiritual world. This hasn't happened since but how can I encourage this gift? 
28:33
Is he a seer? I feel like he has a big calling that I don't understand and I want to make sure we don't miss it 
28:40
It sounds like he was seeing spooks 
28:42
It that that could be for many reasons. I'll take a little bit of time to explain each 
28:49
It could have been something that went on in that house before they bought it 
28:53
If they this is a thing if you buy a home as we live in form 
28:57
You better evict everything out that you don't want there 
29:01
Open your front door because of people did wicked things in that home or they operated in witchcraft in that home 
29:07
There are they'll be spirits that just remain they just do and so it's up to us to cleanse that home 
29:14
I've done it every single time. I've moved if I didn't have a brand new home that was built by me 
29:19
Which I haven't so we always evicted everything out in Jesus name 
29:23
We took communion and to cleanse the home we poured it some of it on the land outside and if anything was there it left 
29:31
So I would suggest to her she do that first 
29:34
Because if they had a place it was operated in in different ways or they watch things all the time in there 
29:41
There were life witchcraft or 
29:44
The darkness, you know all kinds of things go on in movies now 
29:48
Spirits are attached to those movies and you don't want that to remain either 
29:53
There's different reasons how that could have possibly happened and he may have seen it 
29:57
Sometimes when children are younger their eyes or some some of them are still open to spirit realm some or not 
30:02
I would certainly pray for him to lose that from his soul 
30:06
But I wouldn't pay attention to what he said to her if he sees more if you begin to see angels and other stuff 
30:12
Without her coaching him or anything 
30:14
I would totally write it down in the journal and share it with him when he gets older 
30:19
But that he saw either he was just having a bad dream 
30:23
Maybe somebody watched something or went somewhere and brought something back with them all these things are reality in the spirit realm 
30:30
You cannot go visit places that have evil in them and leave and think something's not following you 
30:35
Yeah 
30:36
Responsibility to guard our children from all that stuff and not participate in any of it because you actually are almost putting a 
30:43
Welcome mat out for it to come. Yeah, and so someone if someone says 
30:49
Don't get that house or don't go into that house. It's haunted. There's a there are ghosts in there. You're saying they're not ghosts 
30:56
There's what? 
30:57
They're familiar spirits 
31:00
Even not it's not that it's not a ghost is usually somebody who died and that was their spirit remaining that does not happen 
31:07
It could be it could be demonic 
31:10
It could be and but there's those those are evil spirits 
31:14
But a familiar spirit can look like somebody you knew once before and they will like I just spoke about 
31:21
Sometimes I'll hang around in different houses 
31:23
That was not the person who lived there before and that was your dead spirit. That is not what you're seeing 
31:28
There are things called the familiar spirits in the spirit realm that are dark from are from the enemy 
31:33
And they will try to influence people sometimes they make sounds in the night and stuff like that 
31:38
Open your front door. Say I evict all familiar spirits. I did all wickedness and evil anything of saying I evict you from this place 
31:45
In Jesus name and they will have to go. I know some people who think it's funny. I don't think it's funny. I don't think that any 
31:54
Partnership or of anything to do with Satan because eventually it will bring control over your life and 
31:59
But those things like that that people call they're not you're not haunted by a person usually 
32:04
They're saying the person who lived there through their spirit behind your spirit goes one or two places when you die 
32:09
It either goes to heaven or to hell. There is no hanging around on the earth not not for humans not for human 
32:17
Okay, now let's see. I lost here it is 
32:19
I I came across a piece of paper when I was preparing for this the other day and this is from last year 
32:25
almost over a year ago and 
32:27
So so I thought well, I better ask her question and here's the question is Proverbs 31 
32:32
This is Francis Hansen is Proverbs 31 a real woman 
32:36
It's almost seems like Proverbs 31 is an unobtainable goal for women. She's what it what what were your thoughts? 
32:44
I would say it's not unattainable or he wouldn't put it in the word 
32:49
Okay, it is not unattainable. It's what it's really about what your heart desires for him 
32:55
Are you spending time with him? Meaning Jesus Christ? Are you running after what he has what he says? 
33:00
Are you hungry for his word yourself? 
33:02
Only the enemy would be telling you that is unattainable 
33:09
The truth is what's put in the word and talks about it could have been somebody who was alive at that time and they 
33:16
Operated like that. They operated in holiness. They love people. They help people 
33:20
They they really wanted to know the Lord at that time. I can just tell you I know people who live that way and 
33:26
That is not unattainable. It's not 
33:28
We live holy if he says in his word be holy as I am holy 
33:35
He's saying you can become that that's guess what that means. You don't sin 
33:40
Well, you know, if I can say because my wife and I've talked about the Proverbs 31 
33:44
This is not our question or this is Francis 
33:46
but I remember going over this years ago and and 
33:50
You know, it is true that this woman Proverbs 31 rises up early before everyone else 
33:55
Fixes the food makes this thing then she's in business 
33:58
Then at the during the day and she runs the business affairs 
34:02
It seems and then she's back to fixing the food and I think there's some people that says 
34:06
I don't have enough energy in my life to ever have to be like that 
34:10
And I I kind of think that's what they're talking about. They're talking about becoming that woman 
34:14
I think you could have that kind of energy if you ask for it. Okay, you have not because you asked not people think 
34:22
For whatever reason they think I can ask for my rent to be paid 
34:26
I have food on the table. We're safe and protected. You can go beyond that. You 
34:33
You can ask for strength for energy 
34:36
You can ask for for for more of God of him 
34:39
You can ask him that and I can tell you I begin to learn how to ask and I didn't hesitate to ask if there's something 
34:46
I desired or wanted that would help what I'm doing for him 
34:50
But but that is not unattainable. It is not 
34:54
Thing is this 
34:56
Basically, he was saying she had integrity in her life. Well, she said she would do she did it 
35:03
And this is really the truth. Well, she said she would do she would do it 
35:06
She put her hands to something she finished it 
35:08
She didn't abandon it and that that has in someone who is a believer that goes a long way 
35:15
With the father that you're showing him 
35:17
I'm serious about representing the body of Christ. I'm representing Christ on this earth 
35:21
I represent heaven on this earth you need to have integrity in your life 
35:25
And if you if it's getting hard you ask God to send help you can say father 
35:29
Some me help to do this or have sent me to someone that can explain how to do it better 
35:33
There's all kinds of things you can ask him, but don't reject the whole thing 
35:39
And having integrity it goes a long way not just with God 
35:43
But with people watching your own life that if you promise to do something you do it 
35:48
Can I ask you a question about that about asking thing because you're you hit on something that's really intriguing to me 
35:54
And I practice I play with it 
35:56
I experiment with it and I and I have said to dream my wife 
36:00
If you knew the things that I asked for and the things that I prayed for 
36:05
Yeah, you just wouldn't leave because sometimes I'll just I'll go into I want I want my memory to be like this and I'll do I'll 
36:12
Describe Bible characters and I'll describe people with you know 
36:17
Photographic memories and I want it to be this plus this plus this now 
36:21
And I I feel like in different areas and I'm just talking about many many different areas 
36:25
I pray I feel like at this stage in my life at 67 
36:28
I'm just beginning to see some of the prayers. I've been praying for different things 
36:33
Happen. I mean, are we literally leaving on the table? 
36:36
Prayers that we if we only prayed them God would do for us in our have you seen anything ridiculously crazy that some we prayed for and God just did I 
36:46
Think it depends on the timing is everything with God, although he doesn't go by time itself 
36:52
Timing is everything in our lives. Where have we gotten? What level are we at? 
36:57
Are we pursuing him do can if he gives us stuff will it make it squander on ourself it gives us wealth 
37:04
And we're not ready to handle it. Well, make us lose everything we have because we begin to have greed for that 
37:09
God is not against giving people wealth at all 
37:12
But what would you do with it if you know that that matters to him very much? 
37:17
He doesn't want you to lose where you already have with him because you're you're tempted now by wealth and some people are 
37:24
I happen to know that I will have great wealth because I'm already using mine to help people 
37:29
I'm already doing that and my goal is to be able to help people with things that they never could have or do 
37:34
That is my heart. I love people so much. My dad did that 
37:38
I my dad was a great example of taking stuff 
37:41
We hadn't owned that we needed we gave away because we love people so much 
37:45
So what are your plans? And I think that means so much to God if you gave you this 
37:51
What would you do with it? No matter what it is you're asking for what would that do? 
37:55
For you or how would that better help you do what he's assigned you to do? 
38:01
I was born with a photographic memory. That wasn't something he reached in and put it was already in me 
38:07
I already have a great memory and 
38:09
It does help in everything that I'm doing because I remember every time I've been taken to heaven and forget any of it 
38:14
Wow every time. Yes 
38:17
Wow, but I'd love to have that. I love that. Okay, so yeah, so you would encourage people to pray 
38:24
Bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger prayers, but maybe but Lord, you know the timing Lord 
38:30
You know when you know how that's not my business to know 
38:34
I would say make sure you consider 
38:37
What would you do with it? Yeah, or any God he obviously can give whatever he he wants to give you can give it 
38:44
But what would you do with that? Yeah? 
38:47
More important to God and I'd write down something if you wanted something that much 
38:50
I'd write it down father really would desire to have this 
38:52
This is what I would use it for 
38:55
This is why I would want you to give it to me 
38:57
This is how it could better help the the kingdom operate or you can use me in the kingdom better 
39:02
If I had this that would mean more to him than you just saying I want this 
39:07
Well, right, and I guess in my mind that was implied, but I hear I see what you're saying state 
39:12
You're saying come right out and tell the lawyer. This is 
39:16
Yeah, and hold yourself to the fire because he will you know 
39:19
Oh, yes, you're right. So 
39:22
Okay, this I'm gonna read to because this lady 
39:26
She's waited for a year and a half. So I'm gonna ask a second one from her 
39:29
It says we do communion daily from obedience, but as we participate 
39:34
Meaning in the flesh. She's saying in the physical is what she's saying. Is there anything actually happening in the spirit? 
39:40
I'm thinking maybe the lightning power of God would be released or something similar 
39:44
but she's wanting to know what actually happens in the spirit realm and 
39:47
And if you're if you're sincere about it does something happen in the spirit realm every time you 
39:53
Drink eat this bread and drink this cup, you know 
39:57
I do know this to the father that is a holy act and it is a holy thing 
40:02
To remember the death of Christ 
40:04
It really is and I think it should be in the heart of every believer to do that at least somehow on a consistent basis 
40:12
I do know that sometimes when you take it healing can come 
40:16
Um 
40:17
faster 
40:18
By taking that cup and it's even taking the cup represents healing 
40:23
It's one of the things he gives us or that happens. So a lot of times healing happens when you're taking communion 
40:30
Things are brought down from heaven and put on the inside of you when you're taking communion 
40:34
It definitely things happen in the spirit realm 
40:37
The enemy is you sometimes who's been bombarding you a lot and you take communion over that and say 
40:41
Uh, I recognize your blood and your body being broken for me that I can be free 
40:46
And I'm declaring that I will be free from these attacks of the enemy. You would be shocked at how quickly that was taken from you 
40:53
It's what are you taking it for just like I was saying before he watches the heart to see 
40:59
Why is this important to you? What are you thinking this represents? 
41:03
It represents all that his blood does for you all that sacrifice and all the stuff that he's laid down in his own life 
41:10
To so that you can have more of him 
41:12
You can understand him better have more of his 
41:15
More of his presence around you and I also know this it literally will evict every single thing off your property 
41:22
That does not belong there no longer 
41:24
No, no matter how it remained I already mentioned that to take communion if you're having things going on in your house 
41:29
It's not you open the door evict the enemy go outside take communion and say this is your holy communion 
41:35
Representing your blood and your body and I pour it on the land to redeem the land 
41:41
And this property to be used for the kingdom because I will no longer tolerate the enemy's presence 
41:47
And I promise you hosts from heaven will come down and they'll rip everything off of there and evict it because you did that 
41:55
You know 
41:56
I this makes me think of a question that's been happening in the last year or so that 
41:59
I'm because all my life because I was raised in the church. Although it was illegalistic in the first half or third of my life, but 
42:07
I've always said the name of Jesus in the name everything was in the name of Jesus 
42:10
We always we never forgot to say in Jesus name or the name of Jesus, but later in this part of my life. I'm 
42:17
tuning into 
42:18
How much incredible love the father has for his son 
42:23
And the name of Jesus wasn't just saying the words, but it was like what he did on the cross and oh my goodness 
42:31
The love that this father has for the son 
42:33
So when I say and I pray this in the name of your precious precious son now 
42:37
My heart is filling up as I say that is that a more effective prayer with the Lord, especially when it's from the heart 
42:46
I would say anything that adores the Lord is powerful in the spirit 
42:51
Anything that recognizes his authority 
42:54
His right to rule is very powerful in the spirit and I do encourage people to do that 
43:00
It's not you're not saying just a rote thing like that's like written in a book 
43:04
You're not just reading that it has to come from your heart and your soul when you say that 
43:09
And you are recognizing his authority his dominion 
43:13
He trashed hell on his own 
43:15
Crushed the enemy took back the keys to hell death in the grave 
43:19
And opened it and made it possible for those who believe in Christ to go to heaven 
43:24
And no longer have to go into Abraham's bosom or paradise so many things happen that was crucifixion 
43:30
We haven't really talked a whole lot about that 
43:32
But absolutely yes, the more you honor it the way you honor it 
43:36
It totally is going to uh, it totally is going to affect the father 
43:40
And I mean in from the father's perspective two people can be praying 
43:44
Uh seriously one person says in the jesus name the other person says in jesus name 
43:51
One of them may have 
43:53
That love for the father that only the father would know no one else could see that looking upon right 
43:58
And he would he would see a different kind of a prayer and you know, they both sounded that's that's fascinating because 
44:05
To me it gives me motivation to 
44:07
Tap into what it is that i'm saying. Why am I saying it in jesus name? So 
44:12
All right, uh, do the prophet jenny asked do the prophets in heaven listen to what his god is telling his prophets right now 
44:21
For example, does isiah listen to amanda grace? 
44:24
And already we can say johnny or any of those or hank or whatever or and try to decipher the 
44:29
Okay, so let me read for example does isiah listen to 
44:33
Amanda grace or other prophets and try to decipher the riddles 
44:37
From the word she receives i guess i guess she's asking if prophets in heaven are trying to decipher riddles 
44:43
To me it would seem like there wouldn't be a riddle in heaven anymore 
44:45
But anyway, what i don't think there would be a riddle in heaven 
44:47
I think they would have full understanding of what was being said 
44:51
And by the way, they do watch they do watch they watch us they watch meetings in different places 
44:57
Uh, if you were a member of a certain church, you probably would still watch to see what's going on and just declare over people still there 
45:04
There's many different reasons for watching 
45:08
Either prophets or pastors or people like that, but they they are being watched by those in heaven. They certainly are 
45:14
Yeah 
45:15
Okay, um, let me see this one. Uh, uh, I didn't read it fully. So i'm just going to read it live 
45:21
Nancy asks scripture tells us over and over to watch 
45:24
Be alert for the lord's return. How do I obey those commands? 
45:29
When i know the lord is not returning as in the imminent rapture 
45:32
Any time soon. I think it is in part. She's saying a misapplication of these scriptures that prompt so many 
45:40
People to constantly it seems referred to waiting for the lord's coming 
45:45
I'm not quite sure of the question there, but maybe you can get my favorite scripture explains all of it 
45:52
It says, uh, um, jesus christ 
45:55
Occupy until I return 
45:58
Um, occupy is taken dominion taken authority over all the gardens. Is you ruling as a king and priest? 
46:05
Before him on the earth and they don't want anything to end too soon 
46:09
They they know christ doesn't know the day, but the father knows the very day that christ will come back 
46:15
But until that time you're not supposed to be sitting somewhere just talking about that 
46:20
It said clearly occupy which means take authority that means you're actively taking authority over the darkness 
46:26
That means you're actively operating with you with 
46:30
With all the power that christ gave you on the earth. That's what we're supposed to be doing 
46:34
We're not trying to always look like we're going to escape 
46:38
And I say it because I know some people are looking at it right now. Let's all just escape. We'll be gone. It'll be over 
46:45
No, you're leaving out the best half of what still has to happen on this earth 
46:49
It's a testimony of the of the sacrifice of jesus christ by us operating 
46:54
In authority like he did the things I did christ said you will do also and greater things in those you will do 
47:04
So we haven't done those greater things some people. I've even done the first things 
47:09
And and he's not taking anybody off this earth in a rapture until that has happened 
47:14
That's why you have to have understanding of the spirit realm how to operate in that what your authority is 
47:19
How to use your authority how to operate with your dominion the weapons of warfare he gave you 
47:23
That's why so much of that kind of thing comes out of me 
47:28
He wants them to know how to do that because we will demonstrate and manifest the power of the living god 
47:34
To this earth that there is a god 
47:36
That's the whole point of it 
47:38
Is a god and that the darkness does not rule the darkness does not have more power 
47:43
Than a believer does and that's why you hear that from me from hang from johnny 
47:48
I can go down this long list. Yeah why they talk so much about that 
47:51
That's what you're supposed to be doing and people just want to sit on the rapture of praying every moment. He's going to come 
47:58
And yet you're asking christ forget all the things you're supposed to have demonstrated on your behalf 
48:03
Forget all those things that the body of christ will be doing one day to demonstrate who you are in this world 
48:08
That's what you're saying when you say all you want to do is escape 
48:11
If you happen it will happen one day 
48:14
But I still think the greatest proof of what you do is when he said 
48:19
He's not coming at this time. It will happen at a time. But until then 
48:25
Occupy which is in an authority until I return. So that's what we're supposed to be doing 
48:32
That's what we are trying to show people to do 
48:35
You're not supposed to be running in hiding. It doesn't say hide in the hills. It doesn't say that these are not the perilous times 
48:41
They're not anything like the perilous times 
48:43
And you know, we were I was always taught that word to occupy. I meant stay there stay put never meant 
48:49
But I was not taught that we're occupying force. So an example of that is 
48:54
Yeah, when when the world war two when we took over japan, we had to 
49:01
Occupy that land for a season and believe me. We were in charge 
49:05
We told the leaders of japan. You can do this. You cannot do that. We we were in charge 
49:10
We were occupying force. And so god's saying occupy as a force 
49:16
Where where you're in charge even to see even satan wants that that's what satan's going to do right now 
49:22
He's trying to occupy 
49:24
People who don't want to be occupied people who don't want him don't need him. They're already set with god 
49:30
They already know what the purpose is in this world and since we know that there's no way that's going to be taken away from this 
49:36
by some squany 
49:38
Want to be leader from anywhere from hell. That's just not going to happen 
49:43
And therefore that's why this is going to be such a crush 
49:46
It's going to be crushing to the darkness because we still have to do those things that christ talked about 
49:52
He wants to see us do the greater works the greater works is raising from someone from the dead that was just 
49:57
That's a greater work. I say well, we have to be at least raising the dead 
50:01
Okay, we have to be doing these things because christ said these things i did 
50:06
You will do also and greater works you will do 
50:10
He wants those greater works seen operating around this world because we belong to him 
50:15
And that won't happen for everybody's just with out of here 
50:18
And I will say this for him. He said please tell them that I said the rapture will not be a rescue party 
50:25
The rapture will be a celebration of glory. That's good. That's good. That's good. In other words, you say these words 
50:32
You say these words the rapture will not be a rescue party. It will be a celebration of glory 
50:38
Good because we're operating like him to the point where he can't bear to be without as well in other words by the time 
50:45
He has the celebration. It's a celebration event 
50:49
We were already celebrating on the earth. He just came and got us and the celebration 
50:54
Amplified is kind of what I'm hearing you say 
50:57
Yes 
50:58
Okay, okay. Good. Good. Good. All right. Hannah is asking god is three part being father son 
51:04
Holy spirit and we are three apart being body soul and spirit 
51:08
But did jesus have his did jesus have his own body soul and spirit 
51:14
While on earth i'm not quite sure why they're asking this question 
51:16
And if he was god in the flesh did the other members of the trinity make up his spirit and soul well 
51:23
That's complex. I don't know. I guess they're trying to figure out the god head 
51:27
Within jesus the father's to me. I am in him 
51:31
We are in each other. I think that may be what she's trying to figure out. What did we made up? 
51:35
What was he made up of? 
51:36
I could certainly tell you that when christ was on the earth 
51:40
He had to be willing to have a body 
51:44
There would be no reason for christ to come as christ. He was the word 
51:49
That's who he was he worked with the father. They made everything the father would say what he wanted the word would step out and make it 
51:55
That's how that worked. That's why christ made everything. There was it was ever made 
51:59
The word was to say the word was with god and was god 
52:04
Right the word became flesh. It even says that that means he got a flesh body so he could rule in this world 
52:12
Indominion in authority. Okay 
52:15
He had to have flesh on him so that he could live holy 
52:19
Give this the permanent a sacrifice of him dying for us and then the fact that in his spiritual body 
52:26
He wasted hell. He wasted it 
52:29
He melted the faces of hierarchy of hell took the keys of hell death in the grave away. He knew that was a plan 
52:35
It was finished for salvation on the cross 
52:38
But he still had to descend to take back our authority that god gave adam that adam gave to the enemy 
52:45
There was all this reason why it all had to happen 
52:48
But I can tell you for sure that was jesus christ 
52:52
Okay, who had a flesh body born from the womb of a woman the holy spirit over overshadow mary's mary's womb 
53:00
and holy spirit planted 
53:03
Christ who had to become a seed the word had to become a seed 
53:07
And that was brought down from heaven by the holy spirit overshadowed mary planted that in her womb 
53:13
That happened to no one else ever on in all of time 
53:18
That's the only time that happened because he was the son of god 
53:21
And mary couldn't have that happen from a man. So it had to be planted in her womb and christ was planted 
53:28
Okay, the word was planted. He had flesh on him because of that 
53:33
He had to have the flesh to give us authority in the world and because adam was flesh and he gave him the authority 
53:39
And then he gave it away christ had to come in the flesh and that was his own soul and his own spiritual being 
53:46
He was all spirit. He already had a soul 
53:49
He had to be willing to be made into a seed by the father and then brought down and planted in mary's womb 
53:55
That's how it happened. That's why it's called an actulate conception 
53:59
It was done by holy spirit and sent by the father and then he grew up. He was born 
54:04
He had a body that was a real bus body. He had to have blood in his body or there couldn't be a sacrifice 
54:13
All this is boots and revelation that was given to me 
54:16
So i've always known that christ was always had a i have to say the word always had a spiritual body 
54:23
And even though he has a flesh body, he still can step inside the father 
54:27
Holy spirit can still step inside the father. It can still be the three in one even though he has his glorified flesh 
54:34
Yeah, it's just a it's a phenomenon. I you know, I used to read those scriptures about 
54:39
I think it's either john 14 or 17 where he says you and me and i and you and 
54:43
And us and them and he's talking about that thing and I always thought it just was like a it was like poetry 
54:49
We're so united that's like urin s and we're that he wasn't talking poetry wasn't he was talking about reality 
54:55
Talking reality. That's crazy because it's a crazy reality who but since you told the story where jesus stepped inside of you 
55:03
When you got saved that's the first time I realized. Are you kidding? I know the holy spirit comes to live with us 
55:08
But I didn't realize that it was literal that jesus steps inside you 
55:13
It's literal because he has unlimited 
55:17
Layers of himself the father has unlimited layers. Holy spirit has unlimited layers. That's how he can be everywhere all at the same time 
55:23
That's why holy spirit can do that when you invite holy spiritual and value as a believer 
55:28
He sends a whole layer of himself in you and it literally lives in you and he will guide you 
55:34
He will protect you. He's not just walking alongside. He actually comes inside 
55:39
When you does 
55:41
Cat when you pray to the lord and let's say you're talking to jesus now 
55:45
You're a seer and you've been there, but he's living literally in here 
55:50
So when you're praying to jesus, are you praying to what you see? 
55:55
Are you praying to who you know up there because you've been there or are you praying knowing? 
55:59
He's right inside you. So you're literally talking to him inside you. What is the fuel? 
56:04
When he comes in person to see me, it's not the him. He's still in me. He's still in there 
56:11
And so it's holy spirit. He comes on assignment 
56:14
Uh to personally talk to me because when he leaves from that encounter, he leaves and goes back to heaven 
56:21
When the father comes he'll walk through the wall 
56:23
He'll come wherever he wants to say something to me and he comes in person 
56:28
And I see him face to face because I am a seer 
56:30
I see the fire blazing in his eyes with love for all of us 
56:34
I I see I can feel the power and I see that rainbow coming in and out of him in waves 
56:40
You can actually see the little spirits and souls of all of living in him riding on those. Oh you oh, you're seeing those 
56:47
That's amazing. Wait. Yeah. I mean, I figured it was good enough amazing enough to see him 
56:51
But while you're seeing him you're seeing the spirits that he still has with him. Yes. Wow 
56:58
Wow, wow 
57:00
Jesse saw him and Jesse was caught up 
57:02
He was caught up in the flush his whole body was taken to heaven 
57:06
And he began to get weak and they had to give him this copper colored fruit 
57:10
And that would give you energy because you were there in the flesh and that body physical body wasn't prepared to be 
57:16
In that atmosphere for very long it would begin to affect you 
57:19
I don't ever have that because I'm taking in my spirit. I'm taking out of my body 
57:24
My spirit is taken to heaven by holy spirit by the Lord 
57:27
To be shown things on purpose. But when they come here, it's them coming 
57:31
They come they share the Savior they want to and then they leave that doesn't take away Christ living in me 
57:38
That doesn't take away Holy Spirit. Yeah, it's hard to grasp that because he is him. Yeah. Yeah here. God. So you can be 
57:47
This is interesting cat because I read you something from the year and a half ago where they want to know 
57:52
When you do come in and hear what happens there 
57:56
Here's the one that's from right away right now 
57:58
And this is cat being a seer tell us what what what she sees what you see when a person 
58:03
This water baptized can she can she tell? 
58:07
As well what is happening there in the heavenly realm at the exact same time is something happening in there or 
58:14
Are they just watching I don't know what fully with the question 
58:17
There's always something happening when you do something that's a greater commitment to Christ 
58:22
Always something is recorded in heaven. It's recorded from heaven 
58:26
It's also written down in your book that he's writing that the father's writing continue writing your book 
58:33
He wrote every day of your life before you were born 
58:35
But he adds continually to that book with the things you choose to do yourself 
58:40
There's also books of commitment 
58:41
There's so many books the father has a whole library of his books that he's written in 
58:45
And of course there's something very powerful when you get born again 
58:49
But even the water baptism thing is representing us dying with Christ and then rising again 
58:55
That that is something that will happen in the future eventually 
58:58
But that does actually represent that it gives you a closer commitment to Christ. I was four 
59:04
Um, I was four when I got born again, but I was 18 when I was actually water baptized 
59:09
And I felt a greater uh impartation from really 
59:14
When I when I went under that water and came back up 
59:17
I was overwhelmed by the presence of the Lord at that time because he was there 
59:21
That's amazing, you know, because again as your testimony 
59:28
That is true is that you felt and saw and felt Jesus step inside of you and yet years later 
59:33
You get water baptized and you feel a greater power and annoying. Yeah, that's amazing 
59:39
Go ahead. Don't leave me alone 
59:42
So 
59:43
Generally saying you need to explain that you need to explain the scripture 
59:47
Okay, Jesus said father me and you and you and me. I pray that one day 
59:52
They will also be that way 
59:55
Okay 
59:56
I pray that what happens then because when you go to heaven if it never happened before you can totally step into the father 
01:00:02
Holy spirit will step into the father. Jesus will step into the father and you will be one 
01:00:07
He will not have said those words. I pray that they be one even as we are one 
01:00:11
Inside of each other you actually can do that in heaven 
01:00:14
When you have died and moved to heaven 
01:00:17
Well, uh, yes, but to clarify then but didn't you say there's a certain amount of that? 
01:00:23
You just said of course that he will step inside of you now 
01:00:27
and 
01:00:29
So maybe you can clarify what happens in heaven 
01:00:34
When that has already happened to some degree here on earth. He steps inside of you. So how is it just more? 
01:00:40
When you're born again 
01:00:42
Well, I don't know when yeah when you're born again. He stepped inside of you. You said Jesus 
01:00:46
So what so when you when it says that and the word that he's right 
01:00:50
So when you go to heaven 
01:00:52
And he steps inside of you. What's the difference between that and the earth thing that happened? I guess 
01:00:58
I think that that that is the very first time he was stepping inside of you at your invitation 
01:01:04
And your invitation to receive him as your savior you're receiving him as your savior 
01:01:09
And and he does when you say that father. I'm not father. You say uh to the lord 
01:01:14
I receive you as my savior. I repent of all my sins ever committed right now 
01:01:19
I don't I don't want that in my soul right now. I'm asking for you 
01:01:23
To indwell me the bible says he indwells you it says that and he does step inside of you 
01:01:29
And you sometimes he will say things to you and that's still small voice you hear sometimes is him 
01:01:34
Yeah, and yeah, I guess I've always wondered how do you tell the difference between him and the holy spirit talking to you? 
01:01:41
I mean, you probably know because you know their voices more, but I think I think it depends on how long you've been listening 
01:01:47
Because I can tell the difference. Yeah 
01:01:49
Yeah, right now I get an impression. I see a picture. It's all like thank you. Holy spirit kind of or I'll just say 
01:01:56
Thank you Jesus, which it means all the above. I guess it's the lord, you know, uh, let's see, uh, 
01:02:07
Okay, this must have been some something you said the last show 
01:02:11
You said you pray once and then you keep thanking him 
01:02:15
So send the uh, that's an interesting send the uh, I guess I'm a bit confused 
01:02:19
I heard that if you have to pray more than once that it has not been in faith 
01:02:23
Are we to continually pray over and over the same prayer for unsaved loved ones? 
01:02:29
I think that uh asking for things from the lord 
01:02:33
Not necessarily the salvation thing. Uh, I would tell people. Yes, you should not stop praying for them 
01:02:38
You don't have to pray every day every night, but I would totally say uh to to make sure that you're just saying, you know 
01:02:46
It's a declaration you're making. Yeah 
01:02:48
You're making a declaration and it says what you dare to declare and decree it shall be establishing to you 
01:02:54
So if you're declaring that you know that your love them will know christ 
01:02:58
That they will receive christ and they will be with you in eternity 
01:03:01
Which is one of the most important things you can say in your whole life for your family members 
01:03:06
That is surely going to happen. He will pursue them 
01:03:09
So that that will happen and so I have to say it depends on what you're saying and what are you asking 
01:03:15
Yeah, your family member to be saved is different than saying. I need this. I would like to have this 
01:03:21
I would love to go there. There's different reasons and different type of prayers that you pray 
01:03:26
Of course, the most important one would you be stand in in that place? 
01:03:30
It says stand there for when you should stand there for and don't step back about your family members knowing him 
01:03:37
Uh, he is going to do everything he can in possibility 
01:03:41
And there's a woman that I that I've been friends for years and years and she said her testimony is 
01:03:47
Years and years ago 
01:03:48
She prayed for her mother to be saved as far as she kind of presented it as if she prayed once and that was it 
01:03:54
From that point on she said thank you lord that my mother is saying to that you're gonna say 
01:03:59
And that's kind of a variation on a theme right that works the same way 
01:04:04
Right, that's whatever your soul is whatever strengthens your soul more 
01:04:09
If I ask for something which is rare, but if I do I just I personally just thank him after that 
01:04:16
Okay. Yeah, that's 
01:04:19
Thank you for blessing me for this 
01:04:21
Thank you for helping in this that what I'm seeking after 
01:04:24
I I'd like to thank him and I think a lot of people don't think 
01:04:28
I think they should I remember Lord came to me a long time ago and said it would be wonderful 
01:04:34
If my people were more grateful. Yeah 
01:04:37
Yeah 
01:04:38
Well, it's a it's to me. It seems like it's a higher level prayer because to pray and pray and pray and pray 
01:04:44
For this is lovely to get saved for 20 years where this person's prayed at once and thanked him 
01:04:50
For 10 years. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you 10 years later because god without faith 
01:04:55
It's impossible to please god and right gratitude is okay that I mean that's a higher it seems like it's a higher level 
01:05:01
But I think you will take either one 
01:05:03
One 
01:05:05
Does show that your faith is grown 
01:05:07
If you can just ask that one time and your faith is there to believe for it and then thank him after that 
01:05:13
I think that's probably how most of the people I know that's how I do it 
01:05:16
But it depends completely where you're at what level you're at as a as a Christian and a believer 
01:05:23
They may for a while feel like they have to 
01:05:25
Keep saying something is better than not saying anything or not even asking at all 
01:05:30
So it depends on the level of the person who's doing that 
01:05:34
But it's certainly blessed the lord when you say it enough to and believe this is going to happen because I'm trusting him for this 
01:05:40
to happen and then thank him for 
01:05:43
Awesome now linda's asking how do how do you pray for people? 
01:05:47
Who are hateful and evil and she says in a meaningful way what she's saying is how can I meaningfully pray for someone who is just 
01:05:55
Full of hatred and evil. That's what she's saying. I guess she's wanting to know how to pray 
01:06:00
I think you do that as an act of your will and not from your emotions 
01:06:06
Your soul has three parts your mind when you think about 
01:06:09
Your will what you choose to do and your emotions that display what's going on on the inside of you 
01:06:16
I think you can totally even though you somebody despises you they abused you a lot 
01:06:21
You don't do that as an act of your emotions. It's not an emotional thing 
01:06:25
It's a statement made by your will and you say I choose to my will to forgive this person 
01:06:32
Then god will actually act like you forget them 
01:06:35
But you cannot keep bringing up the thing that they're doing. I think that's more important than saying 
01:06:41
You know, how do I do that? 
01:06:43
But your will your will is the strongest part of you and your will can actually override your mind 
01:06:49
What you're thinking that can override your emotions what you're experiencing in your feelings 
01:06:54
Your will is what really matters because that's what really moves thing is your will 
01:07:01
Kat the 
01:07:03
We've talked a number of times about abuse and there's 
01:07:06
innumerable viewers that are watching right now who are abused by a parent one or more both one or both 
01:07:12
um, I was one of those um 
01:07:14
A lot of those parents that did the abusing have died. Some went to heaven. Some we don't know. They may not have made it 
01:07:21
So there's these wounded souls left behind 
01:07:25
Who have not figured out or been able to forgive 
01:07:29
The parent now the parents gone they may or may not be in heaven 
01:07:32
How does that person forgive in a way that heals their soul when 
01:07:38
It ended badly. There were never good words. They were abusive 
01:07:42
It's going to be the way the father showed it happened. It is using the keys to the kingdom 
01:07:50
It's losing every unkind hateful abusive 
01:07:54
Word or action ever done to you by that person and you say I lose that in jesus name and jesus comes down 
01:08:01
It says he restores our soul. He will literally come down and pull that out of you 
01:08:06
He'll pull it out 
01:08:08
And that is the number one way to do that and then you don't have those thoughts can't keep returning to you about that 
01:08:14
The ending is going to give you those thoughts every day if it's still in you 
01:08:18
If it's in you he's going to mess with you if you don't want him to then you have to get that out of your soul 
01:08:23
And when you lose stuff from your soul, it's gone. It doesn't return 
01:08:27
It's gone 
01:08:28
Then you bind the things of god and I choose instead to bind the love of god the life of god 
01:08:35
His plans his will his way into my life that I will keep 
01:08:41
And guess what you're going to think about 
01:08:43
Not the abuse you're going to think about the love of god the life of god 
01:08:47
And then you will be totally free from all those thoughts of that. You know, no matter how long it happened 
01:08:52
It will be gone 
01:08:54
okay, is it fair to say or 
01:08:58
Accurate to say that even with this what you just said 
01:09:01
There would be some people that got their soul was so damaged that it will tend to be a little bit more of a process than an event 
01:09:07
They'll end up having to do that a few times 
01:09:10
In other words, because they haven't figured out 
01:09:12
You may have to do it a few times any time it begins to rise up. You say no satan. I'm not taking that back 
01:09:18
I have loosed it from my soul 
01:09:21
It is not coming back in Jesus name and some people have to because they the experience it was so long 
01:09:27
But there will come a point where you say that that is gone and it will not come back 
01:09:33
But I have prayed with people who went through three marriages of horrible abuse 
01:09:39
And I had just been shown this by the father and I went to new new 
01:09:43
I don't know where it was New Jersey Genu 
01:09:46
I went to New Jersey and I was invited by a pastor and his wife to speak in New Jersey 
01:09:51
I went back many times by the way and he went in the store to get milk or something 
01:09:55
Milk or something and those few minutes his wife turned to me. She said I don't know why I know this 
01:10:02
But you're here to set me free 
01:10:04
Should I've been abused in three marriages and I still have nightmares of the torment? 
01:10:09
What do I do? 
01:10:10
And I said I can show you in three minutes if you're really going to mean this you said I will mean it 
01:10:15
What do I do? I said you choose 
01:10:19
You choose to use the keys to the kingdom and you're going to choose in the name of Christ to lose all of the abuse 
01:10:25
You can name the people I use I lose the abuse from and said the man's name 
01:10:31
The other abuse from this person the other abuse. I will not keep any of those thoughts any of those feelings in his motion 
01:10:36
I lose them all in Jesus name right now 
01:10:40
And a minute later Steve she turned to me in the car and said 
01:10:45
I am so free 
01:10:48
I 
01:10:50
It's gone. It's gone. I I can't even try to bring it up. It's gone. It's gone. I'm a new person 
01:10:56
And she just grabbed me and how we should I don't know what to say 
01:10:59
I said this is what the keys of the kingdom were always meant for 
01:11:03
You can lose the bad stuff and the evil and the abuse and the harsh words and the critical 
01:11:09
unjust judgment lose it 
01:11:11
Lose it and then you say and I did say after you've done that I said let's bind the joy of the lord 
01:11:17
I actually say let's bind the joy of the lord you choose to bind the joy of the lord his love in his life 
01:11:22
And it was that one minute later. She her face had light in it because she was so crushed with life itself 
01:11:29
And she married a pastor wanting to be free. She said but even though I've been married a few months 
01:11:36
It's still it's still there. So that's because you have to get it out 
01:11:39
You have to choose to get that out and I went over the period of seven more years and it never came back 
01:11:45
And not only her but her 16 year old son or 17 year old son at the end of my meetings 
01:11:51
Brought them up front. She said they want to do the same thing because they see that I'm so changed 
01:11:55
They did the same thing 
01:11:56
They lost all the abuse the words of abuse the actions of abuse by those by those men 
01:12:01
Loosed them all from their soul and they bound the joy the lord and the love of god 
01:12:05
And they were jumping up and down and they said it's gone. It's gone. I 
01:12:09
She she when I come back two years later the the woman said it's never come back to me 
01:12:15
It has never come back to my son 
01:12:18
You know that I mean I wish there was a magic bullet where we could teach this to the entire body of christ because 
01:12:24
It's so powerful. I mean I've used loose from my soul 
01:12:27
A whole lot of times with this because I've been in process 
01:12:31
Um, you know, maybe some of it was from abuse, but by the time I met you most of that abuse was healed 
01:12:36
Uh, but it took me decades cat when maybe it could have taken me minutes 
01:12:42
Because I didn't know this because it's fairly new teaching but and when the father came to me 
01:12:48
And I was actually in my room when he came to me 
01:12:51
He said what am I about to train you and it will change the way the body of christ lives 
01:12:58
He said in these days. I don't have six months. I don't have a year for them to get whole 
01:13:02
I don't have that time. I need them to be active and I need them to be free 
01:13:08
He says so I'm about to show you how to use the keys to the kingdom 
01:13:12
Uh in with revelation and that's what I'm going to show you he said and with these keys with this revelation 
01:13:18
You can lose wishcraft from your soul 
01:13:20
All abuse any satanism anything you've done concerned the darkness words that were spoken actions that were done even as a child 
01:13:27
Things you saw happen like trauma and all this violence stuff 
01:13:31
He said you they can lose it in minutes. That's what he said in minutes 
01:13:35
Oh, man, they lose it my son's name. He will come and pull it out of them 
01:13:39
But then they need to find love and life and things about whatever they choose 
01:13:44
You know god's love price love his life his joy his celebration and he said and that 
01:13:50
Can never be taken up by anybody 
01:13:53
And he said if it's a hard time, it's been a really hard time in a long time 
01:13:57
They may have to repeat that because the enemy will try to bring it back 
01:14:02
It's gone at that moment because he took it out 
01:14:04
But he will try to represent that by giving someone a dream or a nightmare and you I would tell them 
01:14:09
Why would you I'd sit up saying I'm not taking that I refuse to take it because he wants you trapped 
01:14:16
He wants you to be controlled 
01:14:18
But this is exactly what the father told me and that was the first time I actually got to use it outside of my own life 
01:14:23
So I'm gonna bash you somewhere. I don't know they bashed me. I turned around from them and went I lose every wicked 
01:14:29
I'm kind word spoken to me right now and by the love of god. I turned around at that moment. How are you doing? 
01:14:36
It was gone. It was gone. I had to prove that myself 
01:14:39
Me and Margaret used to do it all the time and Margaret is the one who realized you can do it as a as a lifestyle 
01:14:46
She said well, I did it four times this week. I went. Are you kidding? 
01:14:48
Really a one-time thing she goes. Oh, no, we're supposed to be doing this and the Holy Spirit said she's right 
01:14:54
You're supposed to be doing it as a lifestyle because satan and wicked man will present themselves to you all the time 
01:15:00
And that's how you handle it. You get it out of your soul 
01:15:03
So if you're going through the grocery store and someone 
01:15:06
Decides they don't like you and says something mean 
01:15:09
Maybe you're not wearing the mask that they're wearing and they're they're mean to your faith 
01:15:13
You might have to go outside and lose that from your soul or lose those 
01:15:16
I would do that or just turn right around in front of them 
01:15:20
I wanted them to know I was free and I sometimes did it on purpose to show them. I am free 
01:15:26
It's gone. They wouldn't have heard me say that 
01:15:28
And they're like, what are you doing? I went being free 
01:15:33
You mean right there you would just lose it from your soul in front to their face 
01:15:37
Are you saying I would why they didn't mind giving it to my face 
01:15:42
That's hilarious 
01:15:44
The fight is in the story of our souls and if we know how to use the keys to the kingdom 
01:15:49
I can do it every time 
01:15:51
Wow 
01:15:52
I live that way 
01:15:53
That's why I could easily forgive those two people who made a blog to bless me 
01:15:58
I sincerely could really forgive them because I had been living that kind of lifestyle 
01:16:03
I keep nothing in here that is not god 
01:16:07
That's good. That's good. Ken. Well, I don't want to hit any other subject because I want people to end on this one 
01:16:13
Pat would you just pray for the people especially in that vein what you were just teaching anything that 
01:16:18
Anything else the lord would give you so 
01:16:20
Yes, and any in any walk of life no matter who you are how old you are 
01:16:24
You probably have experienced some kind of trauma or unjust judgment 
01:16:29
Spoken over you criticism harsh criticism 
01:16:34
Even witchcraft spoken over you. You don't have to keep any of that in you 
01:16:38
The keys of the kingdom were created for us to be free 
01:16:41
And so I will just pray this is what you would pray 
01:16:45
I choose as an act of my will 
01:16:48
To lose from my soul and sometimes I lead whole congregations 
01:16:52
Any witchcraft any wicked thoughts any actions any trauma any violence 
01:16:58
Anything I watched that I had not wanted to see any anything my eyes saw that they shouldn't have seen 
01:17:05
Any perversion I lose it all if somebody practice that in my home 
01:17:09
I'm not keeping that in my soul if I heard it. I lose all of it in Jesus name 
01:17:14
And it's going to go right now 
01:17:16
And then I make people wait because I have to see christ come down and you pulls are them 
01:17:22
Sometimes it looks like gray matter. Sometimes it looks like really 
01:17:26
And and then when they're done with that I'll say okay now 
01:17:29
We're going to bind the things of God and then once you have done that it doesn't matter what it is 
01:17:34
It could be perversion you watched online 
01:17:36
It could be things that you read books you read about witchcraft 
01:17:40
Any of those things you can lose all that you have to name what it is and lose it from your soul 
01:17:44
So that it would be taken out and then you say I choose with my will to bind 
01:17:50
The life of christ his joy his celebration 
01:17:55
His validation 
01:17:57
His plans for my life those I bind to my soul 
01:18:01
And Jesus name and then he will actually come down and walk down and put them in your soul 
01:18:06
And that is what you'll think about every day. That is what you will repeat every day because it's in your soul 
01:18:12
If you find out you're just sad, I want to tell you sadness is a is also one of the enemy's greatest plans 
01:18:19
He can make you sad over nothing. You don't even know what you're sad 
01:18:22
Lose the sadness if you if someone has passed away lose the grief 
01:18:26
Retain the memory and the love you have been the but loose all the grief especially if they 
01:18:33
Did abuse you you want to lose all that from your soul? You don't want to keep it 
01:18:37
But it doesn't matter what it is if it blows the enemy if it was plans the enemy to control you 
01:18:43
To harm you to crush you to steal your joy your destiny 
01:18:48
I mean the enemy tries to do that. He'll make you sad if you don't get it out 
01:18:52
It'll go to a oppression and then depression and then it can keep going further 
01:18:57
And you don't even know why you're having those experiences is being put in there by an enemy you 
01:19:02
Get it out 
01:19:04
Cat is that the same thing or does it accomplish the same thing? 
01:19:08
Because we weren't talking about deliverance 
01:19:10
But do some people lose from their soul and all of a sudden they've had deliverance from the demonic 
01:19:15
Is that well actually the father said it would accelerate the one thing he said to me is it will accelerate deliverance 
01:19:21
Okay 
01:19:23
I was a woman and she had had witchcraft spoken over her and they had uh in her family and they had books 
01:19:29
She said a red book one never never received it. She said but something's controlling me 
01:19:34
She said this after meeting it was like out west somewhere and and nobody was around. I said, you know what loose that book 
01:19:41
Loose the book if you remember the name of the book loose it because if you saw what it still went in your soul 
01:19:46
So first get rid of that so she got rid of that 
01:19:48
I said now you're going to evict you're going to loosen your soul the witchcraft trying to operate with you 
01:19:55
Up with you gonna lose it and she got to the words. I loose and tried to say it 
01:20:01
She couldn't even say she said something is choking me and my goodness 
01:20:04
Tell you the reality of the stuff and I said I put my hand here not hard 
01:20:10
And I said I want you to shout Jesus Christ after I say I choose to lose 
01:20:14
And you say I I choose I choose Jesus Christ 
01:20:18
I choose Jesus Christ as soon as you say that you say I lose witchcraft 
01:20:23
And she did she said I choose Jesus Christ and all of a sudden she goes I lose witchcraft 
01:20:28
And she said I felt it leave me 
01:20:32
I am free. I am so free. Thank you for helping me. Thank you for helping me 
01:20:37
And so in caught the father who told me you can lose those things that are trying to control you 
01:20:41
Uh, if you still do it in Jesus name, I've had people who were thinner 
01:20:48
These girls wanted to commit suicide because their boyfriend dumped them 
01:20:52
That's a serious thing and all I could think about was suicide suicide. So my one sister called me and said well 
01:20:59
I know they're not believers, but what will happen? I said, let me call them 
01:21:03
And I told him I said you're about to do something in the name of Jesus Christ 
01:21:06
You have to be willing to use his name if you want to be free and she goes I'll use his name 
01:21:12
I'll use his name. So what she's doing is reaching out to christ 
01:21:16
As her deliverer. That's what she was doing 
01:21:20
And so she said I I received christ 
01:21:23
I'm going to speak in his name should I choose with my will to lose suicidal thoughts 
01:21:29
And deep breath over and she said the guy's name 
01:21:33
I lose it now in Jesus name and then she stands for a minute and light came from her face 
01:21:39
And she said I'm so grateful to have Jesus Christ in my life now because you remember she had to receive it 
01:21:46
Should I have him in my life? I have no thoughts of suicide. There is no grief. Nothing. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone 
01:21:54
She said I'm going to follow him for the rest of my life and this was someone my sister just met on the street 
01:21:59
And and she looked like she was in really really not a good way. So 
01:22:05
guess what 
01:22:06
She's Jesus name 
01:22:08
It's like when people quiet up for healing you remember in the word when he said they asked him to be their healer 
01:22:13
He said that was the same as asking me to be their savior 
01:22:18
And he said not only to the people not only are you not only are you healed but your sins are forgiven 
01:22:25
Yeah 
01:22:29
So if you find someone in turmoil 
01:22:31
Tell them to do that. Tell them they have to choose Christ 
01:22:35
He is the deliverer and the restorer of our soul and no one else can do that for them 
01:22:40
You may go through a course for six weeks, but but is that going to get rid of that or is it going to make you feel better? 
01:22:48
Yeah, I mean it makes me think of I've had 
01:22:50
Um, oh, this is not anything recent or anything, but the some deliverance ministries 
01:22:55
They'll take you through 
01:22:57
hours and hours of stuff and it's complex and it's helpful and they name it 
01:23:01
They name the demons and they they cast a matter or whatever 
01:23:04
But what I'm sensing from you is you can get the same place. He took someone else four to eight hours to do 
01:23:12
That's right in in minutes if you know, it's not like there's 
01:23:16
It's not like what they're doing is wrong. It's just more like but it's not right at the same time if you can do it this way 
01:23:23
Is is it's for the kingdom age is for us operating in freedom and that you have to be free from the enemy 
01:23:30
Are free from things that crush you and take your life away from you 
01:23:34
It is really that simple and like I said, you may have to do it more than once if you've been if that's been happening a long time 
01:23:40
Yeah, it will it will it will have to leave you it will have to leave you and the same thing cat if someone is 
01:23:49
Again, I'm not asking for myself. Although there were times I used to have this but if someone 
01:23:54
Said I've done everything I can I can't forgive this person. I can't forgive my father. I can't get forgive my mother 
01:24:01
Do they do that? Do they say I lose unforgiveness for my soul? Is that what they could absolutely lose the 
01:24:08
Unforgiveness from their soul you can lose unforgiveness 
01:24:11
You can lose a fence from your soul any of those things that that be set us to hold us back 
01:24:16
You absolutely can lose all or any of those things from your soul 
01:24:21
Really the reason why you're doing it and experiencing it is because it's in there 
01:24:25
You know if someone's having an issue whether it's rage or anger or they're just they can't have any control of themselves 
01:24:31
It's always always a soul issue. It is always what's in your soul 
01:24:38
Awesome. Well, cat. Thank you so much. Um, hey quick. Tell people about your two websites and how they can get 
01:24:45
a hospitalist tell me to say one more thing 
01:24:47
Okay 
01:24:48
Okay, let them know that because they are the guardian over their soul of their children or the watcher over their soul 
01:24:55
Whether you adopted them or they are your own 
01:24:58
If someone's been bullied at school or maybe they were showing something 
01:25:02
They don't want to see and they keep seeing the images 
01:25:04
You can lay your hand on their head and you say as the watcher over their soul 
01:25:09
I choose with my will to lose from my child's soul 
01:25:15
All of the unjust criticism the cruelty the lies the abuse I lose it now the bullying 
01:25:22
I lose it from the soul in Jesus name and Jesus will come down and take the out of your child's soul 
01:25:27
And then I choose to bind the love of God the life of God to their soul and I have heard from parents 
01:25:33
That said it was gone when they prayed that over their children 
01:25:37
Well, and you could do that if there sound asleep, right? Didn't you say that one? 
01:25:40
You can do it while they're asleep 
01:25:41
It's what you're saying that you're believing for them and that means even children who were in an abusive situation and adopted 
01:25:51
Some of those things will hang around with those children if it just has been proven 
01:25:55
And so cash or try to help them but the help they need is for Christ to restore their soul 
01:26:01
So you as a parent have the right to pray that over any of your children's soul 
01:26:06
Those who you take care of like a child if you have adopted them 
01:26:10
And I was called down to Orlando to a teen center 
01:26:15
And I taught this to every worker in the center that probably was about 80 of them 
01:26:19
And they were crying after I was done because they said when he used to sit here with its drugs or its abuse 
01:26:27
We have to work a whole year just to gain their trust just to help them get rid of what they're experiencing inside 
01:26:33
We will be able to do it immediately 
01:26:35
And then that whole year can be spent 
01:26:38
So let me know Christ to learn how to operate with Christ and and they I heard from them since and they said is 
01:26:44
Spend the game changer for that whole place in Orlando that's been around for years 
01:26:50
They now lose all that stuff from their souls 
01:26:53
So good so good. Wow. I'm glad you added that part too. Okay. Go ahead and talk about your two websites now that 
01:26:59
Thank you for adding that stuff too. Yeah, I have a revealing heaven calm, which is the name of my book 
01:27:05
That's my main website where you can get products you can find out events from there 
01:27:09
I think there's testimonies on there. We're about to upgrade that one and also cat her calm 
01:27:15
That's k a t 
01:27:17
k e r r.com 
01:27:19
It's where you can get a lot of revelation given there's um tutorials on there teaching you some of the stuff 
01:27:25
I've been sharing say how to do that 
01:27:27
There's also a gallery that shows some of the things in the spirit world that they actually look like some in heaven some around the world 
01:27:34
And it's the only place you can give to me online 
01:27:38
I do not ask people to give to other people or the organizations because people are out there trying to cheat you 
01:27:45
Prove you that it's me saying this is a good thing. Give to it. I'm not going to do that 
01:27:50
If I was going to ask you that I'd tell you in person or write you maybe a personal letter or something 
01:27:54
But I'm not ever going to ask you to to give to them 
01:27:58
Okay, because that's your own personal decision if you want to give to somebody 
01:28:02
But if they're saying that's me saying that it is a lie 
01:28:06
It is not true. So don't believe anybody who sends you stuff like that 
01:28:09
They'll take my pictures and make a fake facebook or a fake youtube and they try to do it all the time 
01:28:15
But the stuff I say on my own is where truth is 
01:28:19
If i'm if i'm interviewed by people from my own website 
01:28:23
That is truth the truth makes you free 
01:28:26
Not lies and deception and I pray that you are free today and you can operate with christ in this day 
01:28:33
To give powerful things for him to be great for him 
01:28:36
In jesus name 
01:28:39
Amen, amen cat. Thank you so much. We love you. Love your team and I say give our

01:00
You 
01:30
Hey, well happy Wednesday, October 5 2022. I'm Steve Schultz founder along with my wife of Elijah list calm and Elijah streams that you're now watching 
01:42
So be sure by the way to subscribe to Elijah's calm always free 
01:46
But that way when the show is over 
01:48
Sometime by the next day, we'll send you that program by email in your inbox and other prophetic words come out that way, too 
01:54
So quick let's run it the quick spot Emily if you will about the water wells 
01:59
We're digging so you guys can be reminded of this amazing stuff. You're helping us do go ahead and run that 
02:14
Giving a cup of cold water is a simple way to show someone they are valued 
02:21
That you care about them 
02:25
When Jesus talks about this 
02:28
Maybe what was trying to say if someone cares enough to stop and think about what you need 
02:36
Or what might help you and 
02:40
They actually do something about it. Wow 
02:45
Sacrificing for the benefit of another 
02:47
That is loving your neighbor 
02:49
Thank you for loving us 
02:52
For giving us a cup of cold water 
02:55
You give me a cup of cold water and me 
03:00
And me 
03:02
And me 
03:26
That was so good the young woman there that was telling that little sermon at whatever we might call that 
03:34
That was really even a teaching from the scriptures. It was so good. So I love that 
03:39
We are now we have not we're not only digging wells in Uganda 
03:42
But we we've dug some in Nepal and more to come and then we are providing fresh water now in several different ways in the state of Mississippi 
03:51
We're providing some water boxes that were put we're installing at some fire departments where people can come and fill up with clean water 
04:00
clean filtered water because 
04:03
Jackson 
04:05
Jackson, Mississippi. I think it's not Jacksonville Jackson, Mississippi has had a lot of water issues 
04:09
And so we're providing cups of clean water or in this case gallons and gallons of clean water at a time 
04:15
So there is some of the equipment that Emily was said we were going to show this last time. That's a water box see 
04:22
They're filling there's someone comes in at the fire department fills up their own water with their own buckets 
04:27
And we we're installing I think four of these either three or four depending on we've had we paid about a hundred thousand dollars to get 
04:34
These really expensive water boxes that are mobile 
04:38
But they they filter the water and so it's clean and send the local fire departments 
04:43
And let us put them there. So you see right there in the box. It says Elijah streams. So excellent 
04:48
So thank you for showing that and we appreciate that now quick quick 
04:52
Let me read this thing we have we're going to start every day giving you a 30-second spot about one of our 
04:59
Episodes of American Warriors. I produced this as executive producer along with my brother Warren Schultz. So the Schultz brothers are doing that 
05:06
Here's the one that we're that's running today on rumble. So when you go to rumble and American Warrior 
05:10
This is the episode premiering today. I'll just read this hundred year 100 year old Dick Higgins was only 20 years old on December 7 
05:19
1941 and he was asleep in his barracks when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in his typically understated way 
05:25
He says quote the turkeys woke me up. He tells his experience of that horrible morning 
05:31
And what it means to him now 80 years later 
05:34
So that is premiering on rumble as soon as this is over 
05:37
You can go to your we run rumble as it is now and you can just go put type in American Warriors 
05:43
And you'll see that episode. I think we called it. I survived Pearl Harbor World War two Navy vet dick dick Higgins 
05:49
So, all right, I think the only other announcement I want to tell you now listen really closely on this 
05:56
Because we've we've been asked to agree not to say the name in advance because some of the security issues are surrounding it 
06:02
But you might remember that I've said whenever we say there's a special guest 
06:08
For the next show, you know who that is. It's a very important thing, but we're not saying the name 
06:13
So tomorrow there's a special guest at the normal time and you know for those of you who are not following 
06:19
You just know that it's going to be one of your favorite guests of that is always on and we have a special 
06:25
Treat that not only is tomorrow Thursday going to be that special guest 
06:29
But Friday is going to be that special guest the same one. He's going to come two days in a row 
06:34
So that's going to be a really neat profits and Patriots broadcast 
06:38
So don't miss that both tomorrow and the next day at 11 a.m. Pacific time 
06:45
That special guest I almost said the names 
06:47
So all right. Well, it's time to bring in cat cursor. Let's introduce the show with here's cat girl that intro 
07:00
Good morning cat. I we were gonna put chocolate cake in that. Can you hear me? All right? I can 
07:16
We're gonna put chocolate cake so far. It's showing angel food cake, but that's that's a that's a good kind of game 
07:22
Anyway, welcome cat. How are you today? 
07:25
Well excited. We are back, of course from our covert activity in 
07:31
Mid-Florida that was actually during the storm people really really which really never affected us and by the way 
07:39
It actually had to skirt Jacksonville. It wasn't even allowed to come to Jacksonville. I don't know if anybody knows that 
07:44
No, we didn't know that I actually hit it with my staff and 
07:48
People think what is this crazy stuff you're talking about taking authority over the weather 
07:52
the other thing is I 
07:54
Never intended just so people know the weatherwaters have very specific 
08:00
Assignments when one starts to come when it's in the midst of it and even after it's done or goes off the coast or something 
08:07
I know that about maybe probably close to a third of America is in drought actually a lot of it's in drought 
08:15
So I fully intended to send that storm all the way up around the coast to where those drought areas were and if one comes 
08:23
Again, I'm going to send it out over the west because they they really are in serious drought 
08:29
And I think California's had fires already 
08:32
Have had fires, but we won't have any fires here 
08:35
We had plenty of rain and I'm not ignoring the fact that it did some damage down in Tampa 
08:41
But that wall of faith that we built is all along the east coast 
08:46
So I'm gonna have to get with a group 
08:48
seriously on the west coast and teach them how to build that wall of faith that 
08:54
Lines up with what the father said is when he made the ocean 
08:58
He made boundaries for the ocean and even says so in the word of God 
09:02
Then he made the land in the sea. He told the sea you will not pass over the land 
09:07
You must stay within the boundaries. I said for you true 
09:11
As weatherwaters we began to say that because most of the storms always would come up the tip of Africa up the east coast 
09:18
and then you know do damage everywhere and so 
09:21
We decided to use the words that God spoke himself and say you can't go beyond these bounds 
09:27
You will not come ashore and do destruction and we started doing that 
09:32
No storm has been able to come in along the east coast at all and they would even try to get close 
09:38
And they'd be bumped back out the sea 
09:41
We have records to prove that and so does the meteorologist. They don't know what's wrong 
09:45
That's what they say. We don't know what's wrong. And so it kind of has to sneak around how to come up the other side to do something 
09:52
But we drove through it on the way home from down near Orlando 
09:58
Yeah, the only thing we got was somebody's 
10:01
Construction orange cone was in the road. We did hit that but that was about it 
10:05
Now can't what do you say now some of people say well point out that that the Fort Mayer Beach area got hit really hard 
10:13
There was an island out there 
10:14
So is that an area where you weren't dealing with Fort Mayer? So you know? 
10:20
What would you say? 
10:22
It's on the west coast of Florida. Okay 
10:26
It's on the west coast of Florida 
10:28
So we have found that we can build these walls wall face by agreeing with what God said to the ocean himself 
10:36
And that's why that has worked powerfully here, but no one on the west coast has picked it up 
10:42
I I thought that to everybody no matter where you are in the Gulf. They've started to do something about that now 
10:49
But it's mainly that wherever you're at wherever you live is where your greatest authority is 
10:55
Okay, that's just the way it is right now. I'm sure it wasn't going to be anywhere 
11:00
We go, but some people are just beginning to take authority real authority over the storms and over the destructive weather 
11:07
I'm not changing what God put in place. He had these seasons for different reasons 
11:12
He needed them for the earth to either rest to be nourished or to make way for new growths to come 
11:18
There's a reason why he created weather, but he didn't create destructive weather 
11:23
Yeah, I see what you said authority over the storm 
11:26
He had authority over it because he was righteous of course as the son of God 
11:30
But he knew that he could speak to the weather and he was trying to teach the disciples to do the same thing and 
11:37
So that was one of the things given to me to start weather warriors and teach the body of Christ 
11:44
How to come against destructive weather and there's too many testimonies even talk about all over this country 
11:51
From people who operate in that who do take authority over it and know what to declare to it no matter 
11:58
whether it's a tornado if it's an earthquake if it's a flood whatever it is and 
12:03
We've been really successful according to the word of God taking authority 
12:08
That's just a work Christ did works the works I think you will do also that includes the weather 
12:14
But we are not we don't live on the West Coast 
12:17
I was in central Florida and 
12:20
Central Florida didn't get very much anything of all happening and we were even there during part of it 
12:26
And there was some wind some palm fronds and there was some rain 
12:30
But even in that place so I think the hardest hit was where it came in 
12:34
I think Punta Gorda and Fort Myers not that people weren't praying they were praying 
12:39
I'm sure some of them were praying but 
12:41
Really how to make a stand for where they live that destruction will not happen and cat 
12:47
Can I ask you a question about you? Let's see. I'm from California initially. I'm in Oregon now 
12:51
I was born in this state Oregon, but I was raised in California 
12:54
There has been so much drought in that state now if there was a big old front even if it was almost a 
13:03
Dangerous amount of water you would almost think that we'd need that thing to come 
13:08
Assure, how would you pray? 
13:10
It'll say if you live there and if you were if you were making a stand in Southern California where it's such a drought 
13:17
How would you make the right kind of stand so it's not destructive? 
13:20
But it gets that water in where it's needed. How would you pray? The first thing is I would begin to command low pressure systems to form 
13:28
Or to come a low pressure system is what brings the rain and actually God based the operations of weather on 
13:37
Pressure systems a high will bring in a dry cool air 
13:42
It helps with humidity if you have serious humidity stuff like that not that you'll take it away forever 
13:47
But we can actually make the temperature adapt to that so a high pressure system 
13:53
Will actually destroy a storm it will so if you have high pressure coming in you want the rain to remain 
14:01
Then you command the high pressure system to go off either to the west the east or wherever you need to go 
14:06
It to go to or you just command the low pressure system to come through quicker and bring rain 
14:12
That will not be destructive and you see it's it's really a whole thing that you're taught and there is and I always teach it 
14:19
For free and I try to do even at meetings when I go to them because they make a major difference 
14:24
People have stopped tornadoes may then go back up in the sky 
14:28
They have stopped lightning from striking and just circle in the sky 
14:32
They've they have caused the whole areas of their city not be destroyed because they've been speaking against when the weather people say 
14:39
You know, this is what's coming. This is what what this is what's involved in it 
14:43
Then you would know I actually have a manual a very simple 
14:48
For different things that when they start to come what you say 
14:52
Before it gets there while it's there and even after it leaves if you need rain 
14:56
You need to pray you just you can say I pray for rain 
14:59
But you need to command the low pressure system because you get to command 
15:03
You command because Christ commands not everything and not people ever 
15:07
You're not going to command people that's a waste of time your authority is used in the spirit realm 
15:13
But the devil has learned for many so many years how to take advantage and use weather to do destruction 
15:20
He didn't really have the right to do it, but he'll do whatever he can get away with so that's why the father had me begin 
15:26
Weather warriors and we have had floods recede 
15:29
I'm not kidding 
15:30
We've even put out forest fires in certain years because we would command a low pressure system to come with a great amount of rain 
15:37
And just rain until the fire was out 
15:39
There's all kinds of things you can do as a believer 
15:42
You don't have to sit there and be destroyed at all 
15:44
But if you need rain you can say father I declare rain to come in Jesus name 
15:49
I command a low pressure system to be in the form right now 
15:52
It will bring rain and the rain will remain until our ground has been watered and the earth has been nourished here 
16:00
And then it will go that's that simple. It's your faith 
16:04
It's still faith Steve. You still need faith. Yeah, you start trusting God 
16:10
Then you actually believe him and at one point you step into faith and from that moment in your life 
16:16
You should continue to let that grow and that's where the words we started speaking against 
16:22
I knew because when I was younger I would watch the weather just to see what they're gonna say 
16:27
And I would sometimes say that is not gonna happen 
16:30
Not understanding even what what authority I already had and the things wouldn't happen 
16:35
And then the fathers are doing the start weather warriors 
16:37
It'd be one of the first things the body of Christ will come in agreement 
16:41
Wow their denomination or whether they like anybody or whether you know, I don't like them 
16:46
There's this and that they won't care if destruction is had that way 
16:49
They will want to do it together. We have about 60,000 people who are now involved in weather warriors and pray in 
16:56
Really 60,000. Wow. Okay, so there'll be a time on years when we speak and these things will happen and people always say 
17:04
The manifest and sons and daughters will come in the land to see in the air 
17:08
But they don't know what that means. This is one of those things 
17:10
You will speak and the weather will follow the pattern the father made it to follow with no destruction involved 
17:18
and I had already spoken before when the father took me into the future and showed me a 
17:24
serious earthquake it was in California and I don't know who know who did this, but the father said this is 
17:31
This is a greater work that is coming and I know people for years have prayed 
17:36
But more people in California talk about the big one coming then they do stopping it. Yeah, they do 
17:41
Yeah, the words are seeding your atmosphere people is seeding your atmosphere 
17:47
Well, this always happens here. Well, probably will if you don't stop saying it your words have power and authority 
17:52
so I was taken into the future not not a long way and I saw a serious earthquake come and 
17:59
Expressway systems collapse buildings collapse people were dying and I was I was standing there and of course in my spiritual body 
18:06
But I was watching all this and all of a sudden one young man stands up and says I command you to stop moving earth 
18:15
I command you to cease earthquake, and I command you to put it back the way it was before you came Wow 
18:24
Those words the earth came back together the buildings came back together and the people who died were no longer dead 
18:32
Wow 
18:33
To me very poverty said that is a manifested son of God 
18:37
And that's what I mean when I say that the land the sea and the air will have to obey those 
18:41
That follow Christ that believe in him that do the works in greater works 
18:47
You will do also that was a greater work 
18:49
So it is going to happen people will begin to get it 
18:53
They'll get it and they'll start operating and it doesn't have to be everybody in the city 
18:57
But he does need people who actually believe 
19:00
What that you know there's a scripture that says if you confess with no believe what you're saying don't doubt your heart 
19:05
You should have what? 
19:07
You should have what you say. Yeah, whatever you say that is that is walking in authority 
19:13
That's called dominion in authority. That is occupying 
19:17
Occupy until I come Christ. Yeah 
19:20
That doesn't mean sit on your rapture rug 
19:22
That means take authority where you see that it needs to be taken and operate in the spirit with your faith and 
19:30
That faith does please God and you when you the more faith you have in the greater it gets then the greater things 
19:36
You'll be able to do for Christ or with Christ and the thing about the faith thing is that you know 
19:41
I pointed this for years in practice now and then 
19:46
God knows the exact level of faith that's emanating from you whether it's vibrations or whatever it is 
19:53
He knows so one you may have a minute from now an increased faith 
19:58
But five minutes from now it may reach a level of faith 
20:01
I think is that true your faith can grow even in a moment and all of a sudden grow very quickly because as you're speaking and 
20:10
Eventually we will when we move and get out of the place. We will have news and media 
20:16
Program or network. I'm not quite sure what it is and we will actually 
20:21
Teach people that way through those resources of having 
20:26
We're gonna have a weather. We're gonna have a weather. We will have a weather channel 
20:30
But we will all in the body of Christ begin to speak to the weather and we will keep our cameras where with it 
20:35
So they can see what is happening 
20:38
They speak the truth. This is what the father said. This is being added to your list 
20:43
And then you'll go broadcast things where things are happening and then you they will speak over the reporters 
20:48
One of our people will speak and you begin to see changes and people will join them. Wow cat 
20:53
And that's why the earth will be a totally different place to live in and God wants it to reach that level and 
21:00
Operating at that level see if you can see there will be no use for the antichrist 
21:04
No, there will be absolutely no need for him because the body of Christ will be operating in power authority with Jesus Christ and 
21:12
The mass miracles and the things that people see changing. They were one after they're after Jesus Christ at one point 
21:18
They don't want to know him and so that is one of the reasons why some of the harvest will be so great 
21:24
But I'm not talking about the last 
21:26
Harvest before we all get out of here 
21:28
But I will promise you there will be a catching away because he said there would but the rapture will not be a rescue party 
21:35
This is from Holy Spirit himself. The rapture is not a rescue party 
21:39
It will be a celebration of all of us operating such power authority that God just has to have us 
21:44
That's why that's good 
21:46
Christ will not be able to appear or have authority on the earth until we're gone 
21:52
Because he can't you serve the authority? We're already operating in after all these generations 
21:58
He won't be able to do it and the Bible says into he that remains is removed 
22:02
That's the body of Christ the antichrist cannot appear and so we have to get greater in authority and dominion 
22:09
And our faith is going to change. It's gonna get greater 
22:12
And so he gave us weather warriors sort of this is how you start this is what you begin 
22:17
Yeah 
22:17
And people faith everywhere has grown so much to see even in this storm that went on there 
22:24
Well, I was rescued there were miracles that happened because people were declaring and taking authority and 
22:29
I know two places not this time 
22:32
But one of them when there was great floods coming and God said tell them to begin to stomp on the ground and command the water 
22:38
To go down and before their eyes it did really happen in more than one place 
22:42
Okay, I wanted to ask you right a few minutes ago, and I wanted to get circled back to this 
22:46
You said I took my staff and I pounded it down. So my question was 
22:51
You were you're in Jacksonville, Florida? 
22:53
Harry, did you do it there? Did you do it on a map? You have a map in front of you did it on a map? 
22:58
What what what did you do that had the that had the effect that you're talking about? 
23:03
That was before I got to Jacksonville, Florida. Okay, we had to leave Orlando in return 
23:09
of course because well, we just had to come back and 
23:12
And so I actually started speaking to it when I was in Orlando. I didn't waste any time 
23:17
I went out and sent the host on as the host are always sent to shred the bands of the storm. So these hurricanes 
23:25
We we know pretty much how to speak to them and we know there's gonna be some kind of results 
23:30
Every now and then one's actually stopped and it never goes anywhere or it's shredded in the morning 
23:35
But this storm here that we just had come here was I know that the devil's real purpose was to set it up through the entire 
23:43
State of Florida mass destruction. Well, that was not gonna happen 
23:46
Not on my watch or the weather warriors watch and I was not tolerating it even coming through my city 
23:52
And I did hit it with the staff. I hit it and I said you're gonna get off and you're gonna go quickly 
23:57
But when you go through the wall of faith that's been built along the east coast because if it was going to go back out 
24:03
In the ocean actually had to go through that side of it. I said when you go through there, you will be shredded and 
24:11
The next day after that happened people woke up in this city and went where did the storm go? 
24:18
Where did it go? It was in pieces people. That's where it was. It was in pieces 
24:22
Well, even the tail of the storm was not allowed to stay on the east 
24:30
You mentioned the bands the destructions in the bands a lot 
24:33
So do you speak to the bands and say I want you to disintegrate you? You know, do you speak to them? 
24:38
Do you name bands to having to go and shred those bands of the storm? 
24:44
Okay, because one this one of those bands begin to separate it loses power. Yeah 
24:49
No, I send the host to do it. Yeah 
24:53
That's good. And so the one clarification when you so before you were in Jacksonville 
24:58
But because you had authority over Jacksonville, you were in Orlando area. You took authority with your staff 
25:05
while you were in Orlando about 
25:09
Something to represent in my staff that that's where I hit the storm 
25:12
But when I got here, I actually went out to the beach area 
25:16
Okay, I guess some of the bands were beginning to come through we kind of got ahead of it 
25:21
And I my husband with me and we stood right out there and there was rain and there was wind blowing 
25:26
I I told I told it again 
25:28
It was getting offshore and it was going because I was standing in why that wall of faith that was built 
25:34
It goes out some miles offshore along the and I was standing there 
25:39
And that's when I was telling you will be shred as you go through there gonna be shred 
25:42
You will have no longer have the image of the hurricane and when that begins to fall apart the storm falls apart 
25:49
It just does and then the high pressure can grow the high pressure going up into the storm 
25:54
That's what it was saying also in Orlando 
25:56
I've come in the pressure to begin to raise because when the pressure goes up the storm can't get any 
26:02
Greater it can't and then it will actually begin to be downgraded 
26:07
And I remember in Hawaii when that huge massive storm was due to hit the next day and all the weather channels were saying 
26:14
Hawaii will be wiped out 
26:15
We have powerful weather warriors in Hawaii and I told them to agree that that the the host would come and take the head off 
26:22
The storm just take it off the storm. It would fall apart 
26:25
And I still we somewhere have a copy of that weather report from the Hawaiian Islands the next day going 
26:32
what 
26:34
happened 
26:35
There was nothing left of it. It was nothing. It was like something came and took the head off of it 
26:39
It fell apart completely 
26:43
Destruction was there ever we don't understand and then they then we would take other channels 
26:47
And they were all beginning to say that that year was a great year to to take authority and people everywhere begin to take it 
26:53
And so we actually saved some of those weather channel reports and them saying we don't know what happened 
26:59
It's gone, but this one especially I think all of my friends and the weather warriors in Hawaii said you stayed up 
27:05
You did a great job. The head of that storm was totally just taken off. There was no I left 
27:11
there was no kind of nothing left and 
27:13
So people need to know that if you have received Jesus Christ, he said I give you power 
27:19
I give you power the things I did you will do you should expect to do them 
27:23
But if you never step out and I'm not saying God, I pray this won't you can go ahead and still say that if you want to 
27:30
He wants us to take authority. He wants to see us rule 
27:34
Jesus Christ said you'll rule with me now in this life 
27:39
So you're saying it's not that you should say dear Lord, please take the story 
27:42
It's like saying I take authority over this storm. That's a totally different thing. It is a totally different thing 
27:48
It's called it's called you're using faith 
27:51
Yeah, the Lord said when I return will I find faith? 
27:55
He said that in the word because he wants to see us use our faith and yes 
27:59
we were given authority in the earth as the body of Christ and 
28:04
We demonstrate that by doing those things and it's going to get greater and greater 
28:08
So the days that we're now are not the end of everything because we've only just begun to do these things 
28:15
Yeah, and the father wants them seen for generations to come 
28:19
us taking authority and what we do is we represent Jesus Christ 
28:24
We show people that he's real because we're using his name 
28:28
We're doing the things that he did and that's what he said to do. You cannot use them against people 
28:33
I have to keep saying that because people want you know want to send a host to kill their whatever or whoever 
28:37
That's never gonna happen. They're not gonna do that, but you need to understand who you are first 
28:43
Who are you? What are you talking about? Do you talk more about the devil's exploits? 
28:48
Or Christ's conquest because you should be talking about the kingdom the kingdom of the gospel the kingdom of heaven 
28:55
That's what should be coming out of your mouth no matter who you talk to you can't repeat everything the devil is doing 
29:00
That's all that's gonna be in your soul. That's the only conversation you'll have with people 
29:04
How is that directing them to know or want to know Jesus Christ? 
29:09
And when you do these things 
29:11
You you must be very aware that you what you did and what you with that wall of faith that you built and what you 
29:18
Go out there with your staff and you might literally be saving billions upon billions of dollars in damage 
29:26
And I know of course you always have people usually Christians 
29:31
People don't make fun of us or lapidus the Christians who are clueless to who they are themselves 
29:35
Say we're wasting time or we're not supposed to be who are we Jesus Christ? And I always say I'm just like him because that's why 
29:42
That's why I received him. That's why he wanted me to do this. This was his commitment to us 
29:48
Take dominion take authority. That's what he said to us 
29:52
He didn't say to be afraid and run and hide. Yeah 
29:55
He was very clear the works I do you will do and greater works in these because I go to the father is very very clear, isn't it? 
30:03
And yet you'd be surprised how many people bash the weather warriors for taking authority 
30:08
And I'm like, well, you don't even know what the word says 
30:12
Well, you know, and then there's exactly the works of Christ. That's what we're doing 
30:16
We're trying to help people save lives, you know, let them know he cares, you know 
30:21
He's the one he's the only one who can give us authority to do this 
30:24
But you still have to choose to do it 
30:25
So don't waste your time bashing people and this is what the father said if they're out there bashing the good works 
30:32
We're doing that's because they have no they have no vision their self 
30:36
They have no plan their self to do anything with God 
30:39
So what they do is go around and find people who are doing and they spend their time bashing them 
30:43
Yeah, it's yes 
30:46
That's not helping the body. That's certainly not helping the image of Christ was so slow on another and care about one another 
30:51
If you don't want to do it, that's fine pray for the people who do 
30:56
Yeah, I mean we used to call that there wasn't I won't say the gentleman's name 
30:59
I'm sure he's alive anymore, but after Walter Martin died 
31:03
Who was a pretty well balanced teacher another guy came along and he became a heresy hunter 
31:08
And all he did was look around for all the errors that the body Christ and he decided he was God's gift to point out all the errors 
31:15
And there was no life in that 
31:19
Yeah, yeah, it was not a gift it was a 
31:22
It's almost like a curse. It was like taking the enemy's accusations 
31:26
You know anyway, it's it's really bad. So what'd you look up? You looked up at something just now you looked up? Oh 
31:36
There's all kinds of things in this room to look at if I was gonna get distracted. Yeah, anyway, well anyway 
31:43
High-fiving each other see that's what they're doing. Awesome. I love that 
31:46
I mean, they have a lot more sense of humor than we really don't they 
31:50
I mean, there's some serious ones. I think you said before but there's also some hilarious ones and that's their gift 
32:03
They're angelic gift is there funny and they're humorous and there are some that are very funny and God always sends them with one who is not 
32:10
He explained to me the two scribe angels were signed to me. They're still here because I haven't written book three yet 
32:20
they'll be with me until I'm done with book three and 
32:23
One is very serious and you know, he likes he likes 
32:28
He likes setting the fire of God places to do things to wicked people and and he would rather do about they talk about that kind of stuff 
32:35
He's out, but the other one is hilarious 
32:37
And I'm gonna tell you the names but one actually means holy one and the other one who's funny. It means humorous 
32:45
Humorous he kind of bugs the other one and father said this is why I do is that there's no other way? 
32:52
Really to have them rub against each other, you know, like a husband or wife dust 
32:58
We help each other kind of die 
33:01
We learn to die 
33:03
Yeah, you know, I don't think of the angels is needing to learn that or learn to die. Yeah, but you're saying they need to learn too, huh? 
33:10
So the father will find total opposite 
33:14
You didn't send them on assignment. He'll let them know I'm watching you 
33:21
Seem more real now every angelic being whether a member of the host of the under Gabriel or under Michael 
33:29
They have personalities. They have favorite things. They like yeah, like where they like to see they like to eat 
33:37
I do know they eat man up with the more than men and heaven people and 
33:42
And people always ask me I want yes 
33:44
You will get to meet your angel and know them in heaven and they won't belong to you and they won't serve you like a butler 
33:50
So I've had that question asked to 
33:52
No, no, they're they're free from having to take care 
33:55
But you will get to see them and I'm always amazed at they have their own places. They live in heaven. They have 
34:05
They do have angel games, which is probably where the Olympics came from. I'm quite sure 
34:12
And it's sort of like extreme sports. It is like that but but the angels with the 
34:18
What the way he's he's gifted them because they 
34:21
Very cool the things that they carry the things that they can do and stuff like that 
34:26
They do and it's not the only reward they get is that Christ is always there to watch them and they love that they love him 
34:33
Very much, especially the army does a lot 
34:36
but but they 
34:38
Actually will fellowship during big meetings, which is one of my favorite things to do is sit there 
34:43
I just got back from open the heavenly and 
34:45
And angels were everywhere 
34:48
They're saying hello to each other. They they will give each other if they want it to become 
34:53
They don't know everybody every angel doesn't know every single angel in heaven. Okay, there's millions of them there 
35:00
And they do they have friends they have friends they do things with and everything in heaven or they help work on projects in heaven together 
35:06
But the one thing they always do is sometimes we will exchange like an address with somebody back 
35:12
Yeah, I say hi. Oh gosh. I like your story. I I'm so happy I can meet you 
35:18
You came from a home state can can we kind of stay in contact to let's change addresses 
35:23
We used to they exchange feathers with each other. Oh, really 
35:31
Wow, so it's almost like a friendship rain a friendship necklace a friendship feather 
35:37
So wow and I so I see that a lot in big meetings because everybody's guardian angels come with them 
35:43
They come and they get to attend the meeting they'll sit there and they get more excited sometimes 
35:47
I think from the people do 
35:48
Hearing what's being sad because they know what truth is they recognize it 
35:53
But they do they do have friends and sometimes they get to see them if you go to the same meeting 
35:58
Maybe three years later or something else though. They they still know that they know each other, so I love that I love it 
36:04
Well, Kat anything else before we I've got questions for you. Did anything else that you want to share? 
36:10
Before I was mainly going to talk about the weather thing so people would understand 
36:15
Now literally there were millions of people praying I got I got so many tests and so many messages people saying we're standing with you 
36:25
We're praying we're agreeing with you in florida in florida, you know for everybody that was there 
36:29
And I love to see those kind of reports that people are with us together with the body of christ praying for one another 
36:36
And so that also I've seen a lot more of that happening 
36:40
That the body is becoming closer the body that's listening that knows that there is a god 
36:46
they love jesus christ 
36:48
And it may be some simple person 
36:50
You've never heard of before but some of them are some of the best intercessors ever 
36:54
And now along with their intercession they actually will command the army of heaven also 
36:59
They'll command they'll send the host now in their prayer closets 
37:02
They'll do it all the time and they make strategic times on their even on their calendar to send the host different places 
37:08
So that makes me happy seeing people step into something that christ clearly did 
37:14
He commanded the army of heaven and the things he did that is one of the things that we will be doing 
37:20
And it's really starting to make a major difference in the atmosphere of the spirit realm itself 
37:28
And even now when I go places, I'm seeing less and less darkness 
37:33
spiritual darkness 
37:35
over places because of people taking authority and 
37:39
Bearing yes, I am 
37:41
And I know the news the fake news are never going to say anything about it 
37:45
But I can tell you from the ones who know about the foundation of this whole woke thing this whole thing 
37:50
That's been been trying to shove in our faces 
37:53
Is falling apart and the spirit realm can't lie 
37:58
The spirit realm shows clearly what's happening in the spirit realm between goodness 
38:03
Between the light and the darkness and and of the evil 
38:07
You know god over the evil and what's happening in there things are already changing 
38:11
Setting up for what's going to happen in the natural that I am probably the most excited about 
38:18
awesome, so yeah, I mean we 
38:20
You've talked about this like they're 
38:23
um 
38:24
I mean we could get off in all kinds of tangents here, but I mean you talked about 
38:28
One day and I can't christmas. I just saw him 
38:31
prophesy 
38:32
Not not necessarily the one where you were all right, although I saw that too, but he's quite a prophet 
38:37
But he said at times coming when god's going to wave his hand and a lot of people who are stuck in 
38:42
Homosexuality will just begin healed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and you've mentioned that 
38:49
Is that part of what you're saying and things are getting ready to fall apart? 
38:52
um from the dark side 
38:54
And is it is that is god chipping away at at that? 
38:59
for instance that area of 
39:01
Sin homosexuality and one day he goes okay. That's enough the rest of it just goes 
39:05
And it and it's just largely gone or what I think for him. It's more 
39:13
Of the layers he's building around okay 
39:16
Okay, I know you said chipping away. I understand why you said that but but for god when things begin to change 
39:21
It's what he's putting there. Okay, but he's putting in places or over places over cities 
39:27
I can see layers of light 
39:29
Uh hovering over whole cities and the darkness when they see that begin to leave that area they don't want to be 
39:35
They don't want to get caught in that when when it gets brought down to over these different cities 
39:40
And and you know it says he even says can a city be changing today? 
39:45
You know, uh, when I know they were talking about israel can Israel be saved in a day 
39:49
There will be times in that thing that begins to happen 
39:52
It will it will begin to happen and I do know he specifically mentioned 
39:56
And groups of people to me probably maybe I don't know five six years ago 
40:02
Maybe even before that before that he did but even more so now that yes 
40:06
All a lot of these people who are in confusion who's believed deception and living a different kind of life 
40:11
It will be in a day in a day 
40:14
He will wave his hand and and every single one of these people 
40:18
Involved in these certain things their eyes will be open and they will dump the darkness and run into the kingdom 
40:24
They will run so good so good man. I hope there's angels high-fiving with that too 
40:30
I mean, yeah, that's such good news because 
40:32
It has gotten to be so dark and we've talked about this 
40:37
And starting about seven eight years ago when we were talking about you said it's not really actually getting darker darker 
40:42
It's that he's ripping the veil off. He's exposing how dark it's been 
40:48
So in reality, you know, I use the term chipping away, but you're saying in reality 
40:53
He's putting layers of light and light and light and pretty soon. That's all that can remain. It sounds like 
40:59
Yes, because see the the evil 
41:02
Can't operate in an atmosphere of nothing but light 
41:05
They can't I'm talking about people at this point. Yeah 
41:08
They really can't operate when the presence of god is so great 
41:13
There's no evil spirits around 
41:16
To help commands, which they don't think they can command, but they're just being used by the devil 
41:21
Uh, there's not a lot they can pull on to do evil things. That's basically the way it is the regions of light 
41:27
Evil will not want to be there 
41:29
Crime will not be even evident in regions of light and that's what he's really beginning to prepare the regions of light to be shown 
41:37
um 
41:37
he reveals the good 
41:40
And exposes the evil and all these several years he's been doing almost nothing but exposing evil 
41:46
But the whole time he's been exposing the evil. He's preparing to take that away 
41:51
And in when in doing that he makes deposits. I think thank you, holy spirit 
41:55
He'll begin to put deposits of his presence deposits of the glory of god deposits of all these different things over areas right now 
42:04
And now the wicked the wicked the spirit in the spirit realm they can see it 
42:08
They don't want nothing to do they they can't stop that from happening 
42:11
And I don't care how long people have been evil or evil spirits been wrong. They cannot stop god 
42:17
From doing what he wants to do 
42:20
When he has people on the earth willing to work with him to do those things that makes us 
42:27
very 
42:28
dangerous against hell 
42:29
Can I ask you this about the air? We've talked about it in the past. I think I can't remember what you said 
42:35
Well about hollywood because it's one of the darkest areas 
42:39
Of sin because there's so much junk going on behind the scenes 
42:43
Even a cultic worship and all of that kind of stuff luciferian stuff 
42:48
Is the same thing happening as god even as we speak is he building layers of light? 
42:53
If you've seen any of that 
42:55
In hollywood or what he is but actually the angels that the city is named for 
43:01
City of angels is what lost the angeles. The word angeles is angel people 
43:05
Yeah, it's the city of angels and it actually will be probably called the city of angels 
43:11
Uh, I do know that when I was there a few years ago and I was speaking 
43:16
I was shown these angels that have been there forever 
43:20
With these urns and they were pouring out 
43:23
Before the last time I when I left they actually poured oil on the whole city and anointed that city in the spirit realm 
43:30
Whoa god 
43:32
Whoa, so that's really good news. Yeah, that would that would be something I would try and pray out of you 
43:37
Thank you for doing it because a lot of people there's a lot of people that have been praying for that 
43:41
and there was someone that I 
43:42
Talked to a number of months ago and they said well, we were going to minister 
43:46
And then they learned out some of the actual occultic things that were going on where they were going to minister 
43:51
And I think they pulled off because they didn't realize the darkness that they were dealing with so 
43:57
Yeah, I just think god's gonna need to help them. Well, I've got some questions here 
44:01
Let me start with the kids one seven-year-old mackayl m-i-k-a-l. I don't know if that's a 
44:07
Michael or mackayl. I don't know. It's a boy or girl. Sorry, but mackayl wants to know 
44:12
Why did god create adam as an adult and not a baby? That's what mackayl seven-year-old wants to know 
44:18
There's a very good reason because he needed people on the earth 
44:24
A baby can't have a baby people and that's what he made adam and eve so that they could create 
44:30
They with him 
44:32
And bring all those 
44:33
I don't know how many they ended up by doing together themselves 
44:36
But the reason why he made it male and female was when they come together 
44:40
Of course, you know babies come and those little spirits of life that live in the father 
44:46
At the time of conception 
44:48
He takes one of those from himself and knits it together in the womb 
44:52
With that little daughter flesh that was just created and that is when life begins right then 
45:00
And that's when the baby begins to form and grow and then eventually it's birthed into the earth 
45:05
And uh, and he made this so that we we all lived in him. We were little spirits who were still us 
45:11
Um, we didn't really have a name yet 
45:14
And maybe not all of our personality was there, but you can think of billions of them living in the father 
45:20
Crazy and that's that's where we came from 
45:24
Okay, now adam's body was made 
45:27
but we 
45:29
Lived in god our little spirit a little spirit person with our soul in the spirit 
45:35
And that's how he creates human beings at that little dot a flesh at conception one of those and he says I knit you together in your mother's womb 
45:43
That's what he did 
45:44
Because you were still you that's what he said. I knit you together 
45:48
So he's saying you were with him 
45:51
I don't think people even get that and that you together 
45:55
But you were already here but in him 
45:57
So he took your spirit with your soul in it and knit that and attached that to that little dot of flesh 
46:03
And then the spirit grows 
46:06
with the baby inside the baby 
46:08
and uh, and so 
46:11
He's ever been you've been from the beginning to the end because you were there with him in the beginning of time 
46:17
And you've been to the end when we won't need time because god's already been there 
46:22
We were in him and we would move in and out on the rays of the rainbow 
46:26
We saw everything that there was out there to see 
46:28
You know, that's an interesting question of this young child because I never really stopped and pondered it 
46:33
But the only two human beings that ever lived that were never a baby first 
46:37
We're adam and eve unless i'm forgetting something 
46:41
You know, I think 
46:43
Is this when he when he made animals 
46:45
He made animal he made the chicken people not the egg first. Yeah 
46:50
Yeah chicken that could lay eggs, but he bought the all the animals were created also that way 
46:57
Okay, he didn't send them to the earth to be little baby things 
47:00
He sent him as you know, those who could create the little baby the chickens were laying the eggs 
47:07
Okay, yeah, but they got he didn't send an egg to exist on its own 
47:11
So that's just the way he's always done it. He made sure that those babies when they came 
47:16
They had parents to take care of them 
47:19
His whole thing about be fruitful and multiply 
47:21
Yeah, he ranked with all these adult creatures and adam and eve and then he says now multiply and fill the earth 
47:28
um, it wasn't I mean in in human thought it takes 
47:33
weeks 
47:34
Before all of a sudden the babies are coming all over the earth, right? So 
47:38
But through the animals, but all right, so Julie is our producer Julie Smith, you know, Julie 
47:43
So she don't ask me if I would ask you this question. She says okay to use her name 
47:47
So she's saying can't my mom passed away two years ago today 
47:51
She was a mighty warrior over her family since she passed 
47:55
I've seen many prayers. She's prayed for her family 
47:59
Come to pass and I know many more will as well 
48:02
A couple of days ago. I asked the lord what mom is doing right now and I immediately heard quote 
48:07
She's cheering you on close quote. I know this includes prayers over her family 
48:13
Yet has the lord revealed what else what else cheering us on 
48:17
Means in heaven and do our loved ones in heaven fully know our destiny on earth that is still yet to come 
48:23
So what he's asking? I guess what does it all mean cheering him on a lot of questions? 
48:27
But I can I can't answer I can't answer them 
48:31
I do see people cheering us on my own dad 
48:35
Um every now and then I'll hear him say something and not not real often 
48:39
Every now and then he'll say that was that was great. You did a great job. You got it that time 
48:43
I mean, I don't have to say that 
48:46
That was pretty pretty close to my dad 
48:48
And um, but I do know they go to the portal that we have shown people pictures of that 
48:54
And um and actually I might as well show it now 
48:57
But we actually created a smaller size to them 
49:00
So almost anybody can get them if you want to give them as gifts or something 
49:03
Uh, I just had it in my heart is one of the most important things that the father gave me was to take me to this portal 
49:09
They're all over heaven 
49:10
They're huge beautiful buildings that people go in there and walk up a stairway 
49:14
They literally look over a railing and when they look down 
49:17
They see their loved one on the earth now one thing they don't see they don't see death and destruction 
49:24
But they see you uh when you get married they see when you have a baby 
49:27
They know if you've been rewarded for something they know if you did good deeds 
49:31
Uh, but every year on your birthday, they especially go there and declare over you 
49:36
They sing actually happy birthday to you and yes, they cheer us on because god 
49:42
What he knows when something's gonna happen. So he'll let us know he'll let everybody know 
49:46
Uh, your loved one is about to have a child. You need to go to the portal so you can watch it 
49:51
And so people get to watch these things and they're going. Yay. That's great. Yay. We're so happy 
49:56
And so they don't miss those happy moments in your life. And so that's what he meant when he told her 
50:03
That she was cheering her on she was cheering her family on and the other thing is the prayers she prayed 
50:11
My dad prayed my grandmother prayed my great-grandmother prayed 
50:15
It's still circling in the atmosphere until they are fulfilled. That's all my dad 
50:21
I know he prayed for every one of us. I know he did. I know he prayed for certain people 
50:25
And if I'm in a place where it was that he was I can hear the words 
50:30
I can go into a building and hear prayers that were already prayed 
50:34
And somebody invited me they built uh, they took a piece of property and they built um a christ a church 
50:40
And then across they built a big school 
50:42
And they always felt the presence of god in the school 
50:45
They didn't know why so they invited me to come to walk in there. Did I see anything? 
50:49
Did I hear anything and I was almost went down on the floor 
50:53
Really of prayer. I found out it used to be a place of prayer not labeled a place of prayer 
51:00
But great intercession took place in that building 
51:04
And I literally could hear the prayers and I began saying out loud what I was hearing and they they got totally undone 
51:11
That this is where the students now go in this place that has the presence of god so strong because prayer took place there 
51:18
And that's incredible 
51:20
Sometimes people walk past me steve and I hear things coming off of their clothing 
51:25
Really? 
51:26
Yeah, such as give an example 
51:29
If you can think of one well, sometimes it's good sometimes it's not really good 
51:33
Okay, I know one time I was out somewhere 
51:35
Excuse me at a place a nice place people went there to have fun and stuff. I think there was like a 
51:41
Sort of like an amusement park type of thing 
51:43
There are people coming from all over the world and I would see things with them that weren't really good 
51:48
And so I just on purpose. I didn't want to necessarily stand next to them 
51:54
Uh, I might start saying something to the spirits who are with them and then the people I don't I don't want 
51:59
I don't want to make people afraid so I'm gonna go off somewhere 
52:02
Then I would speak against the spirits I saw with them 
52:05
But I was standing in line to get on this boat ride 
52:09
And and there was a woman there and I won't tell you what her she wasn't from America. She's from another place 
52:15
Demons started coming out of her 
52:17
Really and I turned around 
52:21
And I shoved my husband 
52:23
I shoved him. He's always he's used to strange things like this 
52:28
I said get back and get out of the line 
52:31
Well, he didn't even wait any more just because he said what I've said their demons coming out of that lady over there 
52:35
And I want to say something about it, but I can't do it behind her and I'm not getting on the boat because I'll be saying 
52:39
I'm on the boat 
52:41
And I did I broke the power of the enemy off of her life. I commuted them to go 
52:45
Uh, or to shut them out. Were you talking out loud cat? Were you talking out loud that she could hear this or what? 
52:50
No, no, she couldn't hear me. Okay. You need to hear me 
52:54
They needed to hear me. Okay 
52:58
They probably were leaving her because I was behind her. I see. Okay. Well, that's helpful right there 
53:03
So the presence is with me all the time men or where I go 
53:06
there's always things reactions in the spirit realm if I go somewhere 
53:11
And it's no different than no different than paul or peter is that when you walk past them his shadow heal them 
53:19
That was the cloud of anointing coming from him 
53:21
Well, I have a large cloud of anointing and it impacts whatever is going to be there with me 
53:26
So I think that's what happened, but I wanted to say something so I knew I couldn't say it right then because 
53:33
The lady would have to be afraid and leave and so I went off where they could hear me 
53:37
Um, but I didn't go on the boat with her because I knew I'm gonna be laying hands on her and then they'd throw me out 
53:44
And um, I was wanting to help her 
53:47
Yeah, but I see things I see things like this everywhere and I'll let god tell me pray for them 
53:53
Uh, that's dude. That's for someone else to pray for or whatever 
53:56
So tell me what to do about each situation with that one was I was kind of kind of surprised 
54:02
And I mean they were like a lot of them coming out and I'm like, I just wanted to put you get back 
54:10
That was really good 
54:12
I gotta pray I gotta pray so he goes, okay, but let's go up here. Okay. Go ahead and pray and you know, my husband is 
54:19
The perfect person for me because he doesn't get excited about much. No, he's very mellow being is is a mellow guy 
54:26
He's 
54:28
Yeah 
54:31
I won't say any more about all that, but anyway, he's great. Yeah 
54:35
over it 
54:36
And uh, and some I could see leaving from where they were just leaving they would just disappear, disappear, disappear 
54:42
And then I just left 
54:44
I sent the presence of god to that woman to begin to surround her that she would know christ 
54:50
And so but that's the whole thing about me going anywhere even to the mall. It's like not normal 
54:56
Yeah, well, I understand that more and more. Hey talk about for a minute. Okay. You said like of our loved ones 
55:03
So I would have for instance in my loved ones 
55:05
I'm sure that I had a lot of them were praying families 
55:08
But many of them had really really wrong doctrines 
55:11
But they loved god to the ability that they were able to love him 
55:15
They understood about the cross more or less they got that but they would be praying now with their prayers 
55:22
Although albeit sometimes they would they were probably prayed amiss. They were praying 
55:28
Make them Sabbath keepers lord and god wasn't interested in making them Sabbath keepers 
55:32
He was interested in making their followers of christ. Would their prayers be circulating and accomplishing things? 
55:38
I think the prayers that that remain are the ones that you usually pray over your family members 
55:45
Okay, it's always about christ to know christ to have a great relationship with christ to understand who they are in christ 
55:51
Those kinds of things like that those those are the prayers my dad prayed and my grandmother prayed 
55:57
Or for people she knew that didn't know christ those prayers remain 
56:01
They're productive prayers. Yeah, and he won't remove the words the words that you speak actually remain 
56:08
They saturate your clothing 
56:11
So or they saturate you 
56:14
Depending on even what side you feel with the darkness you feel the light 
56:18
Um, but but a lot of people like the building I walked into the prayers and the words and the and sometimes it was worship 
56:26
I heard saturates the walls 
56:30
Wow, that's what heaven also, but it saturates that place 
56:36
And is the lord cat is the lord? 
56:39
How do you know how to ask this question is the lord therefore constantly hearing those prayers in the air? 
56:45
Yes, even though it may be two or three generations later. He's hearing those. He's still hearing those prayers 
56:52
Yes, that's fascinating because I've never been caught that 
56:55
You know, we've always always thought their works do surely follow them and you know, he remembers the prayers 
57:00
But I think of them as they were prayed and he's got them in his hand or a bucket or something 
57:05
But you're saying no, they're circulating even come up before the throne of god. Okay 
57:10
Interesting interesting. All right. Let's see. You've got a time for a few more questions here 
57:16
Um, okay. This is a cute one. This is a mom asking about 
57:20
her two-year-old son since 
57:22
Mallory is asking since I began commanding the host 
57:26
A few months ago almost to the day my two-year-old son began talking to me about cow c o w cow 
57:33
In his room every night. He smiles at him talks to him tries to feed cow his snacks shows cow 
57:39
His toys and has described him as what I believe to be a host 
57:43
Have you ever seen one that looked like a cow? My son has always seemed to see in the supernatural even as young as he gets 
57:50
Interesting question 
57:52
Probably more than likely is a member of the host because I keep telling people most of them look like creatures 
57:59
like 
58:01
The royal guard all look like lions 
58:04
That is a tribe the host as well as gaverals are all made angels are made in tribes the first tribes were in heaven 
58:12
And so all of gaverals has they different tribes of angels some are the guardian angels some are like scribes some are 
58:19
Like courier angels some would be for different 
58:22
They're bringing mantles down or they bring body parts down from the warehouse 
58:26
Those are all tribes and those members of those tribes do the same type of thing 
58:31
Because he needs so many to do different things. They would do that 
58:35
The hosts are also made in tribes and that is usually depicted by they are usually 
58:42
Like assigned to one type of thing like they wore in one type of a battle or they wore with certain weapons 
58:49
And when he needs those weapons he sends them to the different places he needs them in 
58:54
some of the hosts are 
58:56
Are a weapon themselves the way he puts them together and that's hard to explain but most of the hosts of the armies 
59:03
of heaven I see them as creatures 
59:06
And there are some that have heads that look like 
59:10
Remember the ox? 
59:11
Yeah, yeah, what did he say one has the head of a what? 
59:16
Yeah, that would be like a cow 
59:18
Yeah, it would wouldn't it it would so he might well have seen 
59:22
Yeah, something that would have had of an ox it would look like a cow little boy. Oh interesting 
59:28
fascinating, okay, so 
59:30
Okay, Susie asked is we get a lot of questions about have you seen this person or that person in heaven 
59:35
Here's Susie Goose is her handle Susie Goose asked has can't see never can either in heaven 
59:41
I've been studying Jeremiah and Daniel and though the king never can either acknowledge Daniel's god is real 
59:47
And encourage people to worship Daniel's god 
59:49
Did he finally do the same that's her question 
59:55
About that I'm pretty certain that he is there. I mean even the fact that he recognized god for who god was 
01:00:02
Um, that was actually why the father created a paradise which is in the earth where 
01:00:09
Were the those who believed in god before christ came along they believed that there was god 
01:00:14
He wouldn't they died he'd send them there. He didn't send them to hell or hades 
01:00:18
That was for the wicked and the evil and of course that place is empty because when christ died on the cross 
01:00:24
One of the things he did when he went down into the earth 
01:00:28
Before he went into hell 
01:00:30
He had to go into hell it mentions that he had to take back the keys of hell death and grave wipe up hell 
01:00:35
Show Satan that he had no power over the son of god 
01:00:38
He was in paradise first and when he was there 
01:00:41
Uh christ saw ever ham isaac jacob but many more who believed and knew there was god and would speak to god 
01:00:49
They didn't call him a sign or something christ actually went there and it said christ led captivity captive 
01:00:57
He preached the gospel to all those in paradise 
01:01:01
and once 
01:01:02
christ 
01:01:04
Left hell on the third day and came back in his body when he was the first resurrected from the dead 
01:01:10
At that time many of those all left and went up to heaven when christ finally went back to heaven 
01:01:16
To pour out his blood on the mercy seat 
01:01:18
That's what happened after he came up into the grave and he told mary remembers he told mary 
01:01:22
I had to go to my father and your father that was father god in heaven 
01:01:26
And he had to pour out that blood on the mercy seat as evidence that he paid that price 
01:01:31
And at that time all the ones who who received him of course in in paradise 
01:01:37
And you also remember that it said that people saw the dead walking around 
01:01:43
Yeah, yeah, they did 
01:01:45
hundreds of them that they saw them walking around 
01:01:48
And that i'm quite sure happened at the time that probably when christ was preaching to them 
01:01:55
When he was what speaking to them 
01:01:57
Yeah, when they they all received him every one of them in there 
01:02:01
Yeah, you can imagine how long that had been going on adam and eve were there 
01:02:06
I mean a long time 
01:02:08
Prepared a long time 
01:02:10
well, okay, um 
01:02:12
I I wanted to ask a follow-up question on that because never can answer you hadn't seen him 
01:02:16
But you you're you're assuming that he probably is there I've wanted to ask what about cyrus? 
01:02:21
There's a scripture that says though. You did not know me 
01:02:24
I did this and this and this through you, you know and people talked about trump being a modern cyrus 
01:02:31
But that scripture says that though cyrus did not know him. He had a calling honestly 
01:02:36
Do you know anything about whether cyrus ended up in heaven? 
01:02:39
No, I don't know anything about that the father will probably tell me now that you asked that question 
01:02:43
He probably will eventually tell me uh 
01:02:46
I have I have seen many many many many many many many people in heaven 
01:02:50
Some people think there's a handful there and they'll know there's a lot of people 
01:02:55
There are millions of people already in heaven 
01:02:57
So it's not like it's like you sort of walking in new york city and thinking can I see somebody? 
01:03:03
It's almost kind of like that. There's some yeah 
01:03:06
And I don't just walk around and have been looking for somebody they always escort me where they want me to go 
01:03:11
Or what they want me to see uh seeing I do know john Wayne made it 
01:03:16
That was really good. I know the disciples are all they're except not judas 
01:03:21
Yeah 
01:03:23
at all 
01:03:24
And neither hit people you know that may um 
01:03:28
Come into the question that I wanted to ask one of the okay, so 
01:03:33
Here is sherry is asking this 
01:03:36
at the time of the new earth 
01:03:38
Okay, the new earth is created. Where is hell located? Is there any way the spirits of the people in hell 
01:03:44
Will be destroyed so that they do not have to suffer forever. So that's an interesting question 
01:03:50
That is not what the word of god says at all 
01:03:55
Hell will be empty because nothing will be in hell and this whole earth will be gone 
01:04:02
It says so in the bible 
01:04:04
He's going to wrap it all up. It will not exist at all 
01:04:07
But the lake of fire will exist but it won't be on the new earth 
01:04:12
But it will be forever where whatever he put that 
01:04:15
Uh, it's still be a spiritual place of torture not a physical place 
01:04:21
Um, so I just know that the lake of fire will exist. It says they'll burn forever never 
01:04:27
That's why it's important to pray for people. I have a question to ask about a follow-up on that because I've known some people 
01:04:33
some are even close to me 
01:04:35
Relative wise but one of them 
01:04:38
Anise told me a few years ago. Well, you know, she's got a church and she's 
01:04:43
She's a co-pastor at her church 
01:04:46
Uh, but she says but we don't believe in hell anymore. Now. I'm assuming she believes in jesus christ 
01:04:52
Talk about if you if you have anything to say about 
01:04:55
Because you're not saved by 
01:04:57
The way you correctly believe on hell you're saved by grace 
01:05:00
In in in jesus christ as your savior to talk about what you would say to someone 
01:05:06
Or about the situation where someone says I just don't believe in that. I don't believe in hell. What what would your thoughts be? 
01:05:14
Well, the first thing I would do is tell them my experiences that I had when I was taken into hell 
01:05:19
In a while I was taken there and explained that this word of god that 
01:05:24
That god had written 
01:05:27
Is uh, it's a book to live by it really gives you the truth about how to live how to live for him with him 
01:05:33
And his plans his plans he had for man his plans 
01:05:37
He had for this earth and then of course 
01:05:40
We know the end when he says the end will come and the bible says the end will then come 
01:05:45
That means the end of time. We won't need time anymore 
01:05:48
But this earth we're on right now will not exist it clearly says he will make a new one 
01:05:54
That doesn't mean he will remodel this one again because the new one will be so massive 
01:05:59
Uh, even just because the city of god that's going to be on there. He would have to make it massive 
01:06:03
Yeah, probably gonna be bigger than our whole entire galaxy the new earth 
01:06:07
I would really assume to do that. I've seen parts of it that I can tell you that 
01:06:12
We don't need time. We won't need calendars things are always done by events in heaven 
01:06:16
And you know, there is the jewish people have a calendar they follow. Um 
01:06:22
Just so you know, not everybody in heaven is a jew 
01:06:24
Uh, there are jews there who receive christ and many of them do that right almost at their death 
01:06:30
Many of them. He'll appear to them. He just does 
01:06:33
Um, he appeared to those who were in abraham's bosom or paradise at the same place 
01:06:39
And god kept them because of their faith in him for believing that there was a god 
01:06:45
The world talks about that too 
01:06:47
But everything changed when christ came and died for us from that moment christ is the one you paid the price 
01:06:53
That all evil and every sin that could ever be committed. He had to carry that in his body 
01:06:58
That was destroyed on the cross and he's the only one who can say 
01:07:03
I receive your repentance and yes, uh, yes, I will when they ask him to be their savior 
01:07:09
That's what you're doing. You're saying I recognize who you are. You're the only one who can forgive sin 
01:07:14
So i'm repenting on my sin. I want I want to belong to you 
01:07:17
I'm inviting you to come and and be in me and be my savior forever. That's a significant thing because there's no other being 
01:07:26
ever 
01:07:27
That ever existed that paid the price for your sins to be forgiven 
01:07:32
So just because you say well, I like how they do this or we do it this way because of this 
01:07:38
Uh, your life at one point you must give it to jesus christ. You must receive jesus christ 
01:07:43
And uh, the one good thing that's uh, is happening now is christ does have the keys of hell death in the grave 
01:07:50
Which means he can go 
01:07:52
At the very moment of your death and say do you want me now if you've got people praying for you to know him 
01:07:58
That's surely going to happen 
01:08:00
But you're the only way into heaven 
01:08:03
Is through jesus christ 
01:08:06
There's no other way. Yeah 
01:08:08
Didn't send you to hell on purpose. He actually made a way because he loves you. He made that way 
01:08:15
Back to him where you used to live in him. He made a way and that's what the word says 
01:08:20
christ paid the price 
01:08:22
No one else paid the price and he was god 
01:08:26
And yet came to the earth lived the man lived righteously 
01:08:30
And was he laid down his life and paid the price with his blood 
01:08:35
That that blood when you receive christ washes away every sin you ever had like you never did it 
01:08:42
That gives you entrance into heaven when you die 
01:08:45
It gives you all the eternity to be with them when your family members who go there 
01:08:49
That's what you do. You're securing that for for your all eternity 
01:08:54
That's good. Would you believe something is good? That is not 
01:08:58
well, i'm god 
01:08:59
showed you how 
01:09:01
Multiple times at least i i think and because he wanted people to know hell is real 
01:09:07
Otherwise, he kind of just kept it to himself and said they'll find out 
01:09:10
You know, but he's he wants you he's taken other people to hell as well so that they can talk about it 
01:09:16
Right other people kind of like you as well. I have a question about 
01:09:21
I wanted to ask you this before I don't think I ever have when we lived in him before 
01:09:26
We lived in the father before 
01:09:28
And he's getting ready to send us down to here's mom and dad and he knows this is where he's 
01:09:33
Does he 
01:09:35
Tell let's say me does he tell me when I'm in him. This is your life. This is what you're going to go through 
01:09:41
these are some of the things you're going to 
01:09:44
affect you and do you still want to go do you receive this 
01:09:48
this um 
01:09:51
Plan for your life or or is that none of that 
01:09:53
It's shared with us. We just come down and what happens. I think there's a part that is shared 
01:09:59
um, I remember laying in god's hand and him talking about 
01:10:04
Really really some of the things he told me wasn't just about my life, but the future itself 
01:10:10
Uh, but I clearly remember laying in his hand looking at him. I would lay like on my stomach and just stare at him 
01:10:17
I was so fascinated with him 
01:10:20
and uh, there's a holy hill inside of him 
01:10:23
And we could choose to run up that hill and he would put his hand 
01:10:27
This is deep stuff inside of his mouth and we would climb in and then he would bring us out and he would that's how 
01:10:32
I was in his hand. Wow 
01:10:35
and it says 
01:10:36
Who shall I have my tent? Who shall ascend my holy hill? 
01:10:41
um 
01:10:41
That holy hill is inside the father 
01:10:45
And there's a lot of footsteps going up. There's some going up and coming back that didn't mean you weren't important 
01:10:49
That means you made a choice even then. I'm gonna pursue. I'm gonna I'm gonna know him 
01:10:54
I want to know this person that I'm living in we knew we were living in him because we would write out the rays of the 
01:10:59
Rainbow when it would go in and out of him because the stones of fire were in there the river of life which produced that 
01:11:05
Holy, uh, it looks like the northern lights. It's bands that come in and out 
01:11:10
Like there's a band of teal blue 
01:11:13
Gold I mean they just come out the most beautiful 
01:11:15
But there's always these little spirits that can we can jump on them and ride in and out of him 
01:11:20
That's what we used to do. We couldn't leave him. We couldn't live somewhere else in him. We live 
01:11:26
We move we have very existence. Oh, wow. That's how that goes. That is exactly what that scripture means 
01:11:35
And the other half of that scripture says the prophets and poets of old have spoken of these things 
01:11:42
So there was a time on the earth when prophets who knew this and God showed them 
01:11:47
They knew that's how we lived we they knew it 
01:11:52
And so people think well, there's nothing in there. Yes, there is you need to read your bible more 
01:11:57
We lived in the father 
01:11:59
He was our father. We are his offspring the bible is very clear about that 
01:12:04
Well, guess what when I had a child that was my offspring that came from out of me 
01:12:09
So everyone who ever lived or existed on the earth they all we were all at one point in him 
01:12:16
And he didn't start sending us 
01:12:19
Until he made Adam 
01:12:22
Right 
01:12:27
Made the body 
01:12:28
Then the father the the word stepped out because that was Jesus's name also when the father spoke 
01:12:34
the word stepped out of him 
01:12:36
And made a form in the ground and they made the body of Adam and it was perfect and amazing 
01:12:42
But there was no life in it 
01:12:44
Then the father leans over who was carrying Adam's spirit 
01:12:48
And it says he breathed the spirit of life 
01:12:52
Into Adam's nostrils and Adam became a living soul. That's exactly what the word says 
01:12:58
That's proof we came from the father and he was our dwelling place 
01:13:03
And I love that scripture because I know what that means 
01:13:05
And that's what you were 
01:13:08
You remember him 
01:13:09
Did you said you remember him talking to you about did did he tell you anything about what your life would be that you would ever remember that? 
01:13:17
And you know, I didn't always remember that but there came a point in my life where he began to show me 
01:13:22
Okay, you know 
01:13:23
When he was training me to do things he actually caught me up and showed me 
01:13:27
And then of course there was the time in 2010 when I began to say to him 
01:13:32
I want my heart to be like your heart 
01:13:36
I want to be just like you because you know, you say that to your father if you love your father 
01:13:40
You say that to your father 
01:13:42
I want to I want to be I mean, of course, I adore Jesus christ and still do he was my beloved 
01:13:47
He always has been I spent 20 years just 
01:13:52
Approaching christ to know him and one day he walked in the wall of my house and he's never stopped coming 
01:13:57
So he was first I I received christ at age four. That's a long time ago 
01:14:03
A very long time ago. So good 
01:14:06
70 human years ago 
01:14:08
I was born and then four years after my birth 
01:14:12
I could see angel. I mean, I already saw angels. I saw them. I wanted to know him in our home 
01:14:18
We heard about Jesus every day of our life. It was just the way my dad was. That's what he he loved the father 
01:14:23
He loved the son 
01:14:25
So I grew up knowing them but at one point I went hey in Sunday school. Hey, I need to receive him 
01:14:31
I know I want to receive him. So I actually asked christ repented of my sins. I don't know what they could have been at age four 
01:14:39
But I received christ and I literally he appeared and stepped inside of me crazy 
01:14:45
He is in there and no one on the earth could convince me. He's too late people 
01:14:51
Oh 
01:14:54
For that's amazing 
01:14:56
With him the angels over in the room were applauding. Uh, they were writing things down in heaven when I got at age four 
01:15:02
I 
01:15:03
Understood this 
01:15:05
That's amazing 
01:15:06
Well, it sounds like to me you are you are you sound like you are almost a protege 
01:15:12
If I can use that term the same way akeana was at four or five or six 
01:15:16
She's drawing masterpieces of art. You're at four five and six and you're walking a masterpiece with the lord 
01:15:23
There are some people that are so far out 
01:15:26
ahead of 
01:15:27
The rest of it because you were born with it would be like putting a genius only instead of making you a genius 
01:15:32
Which you might be you made you go ahead 
01:15:36
But that's why I have such a passion to tell people 
01:15:40
Yeah 
01:15:40
There came a point when he said you can't keep this anymore yourself 
01:15:44
And he put me in places not meetings. I never shared ever shared in meetings. I didn't really want that 
01:15:51
I never wanted attention. I didn't want to draw attention to me. I had one friend in school because I had a tribe at home 
01:15:57
I didn't need a lot of friends 
01:15:59
But I had uh, I had some of heaven's wisdom and every now and then I would just share a word with somebody 
01:16:05
And it would kind of freak him out because I knew exactly what it was 
01:16:08
I needed and I would say it and I would just I would walk away 
01:16:11
So my life and I'd see things all the time. I tell my dad my mom would just keep telling me I was strange 
01:16:17
Compared to the others. I was strange. Well, RJ was there. He was kind of strange too. Anyway, um, 
01:16:23
But but yeah, I I knew this inside 
01:16:26
Christ is real and he's in me 
01:16:29
And I would tell other kids and they go what what what? 
01:16:34
How can I see him? I know you need to invite him in yourself 
01:16:36
But that was the atmosphere we grew up in so for the Holy Spirit that was normal 
01:16:43
Uh, I wouldn't say familiar at all. I'm not familiar with going places 
01:16:48
I'm always undone when he takes me but that is choice 
01:16:52
but but that's why I was sent 
01:16:54
And I was choosing in a generational line of many people for generations who love god serve god 
01:17:00
Obey god. I was part of that generational. So this is actually a generational thing. I'm doing 
01:17:05
That those who went on before me in these generations whose platform or whose steps I followed in 
01:17:13
I was chosen this time to do this. Yeah, very profound 
01:17:18
Well, cat, um, I'm looking at a time. I've got another show to do at one o'clock 30 minutes from now 
01:17:23
So we kind of have to wrap up this but I'll tell people that clay Clark will be on in 30 minutes at one o'clock 
01:17:29
So I'll be back here 
01:17:30
After catching a quick bite or something. So I don't waste away, but cat tell people about revealing heaven.com and cat cur.com 
01:17:38
so they can 
01:17:40
avail themselves we have two websites one is revealing heaven.com. That's where you can find out about 
01:17:47
The commission I have is to reveal heaven and create things that represent heaven on the earth. That's why I do 
01:17:54
That's why we have a business. That's why we have a store 
01:17:57
That's why he has to make products that can 
01:18:01
Let people know that there's a god or we say things against now when I put things against the enemy. It's satan 
01:18:07
Okay, that is our enemy. It's everybody's enemy. Even if you're working for me still your enemy people 
01:18:14
Uh, and so we we create things and put them in in our store and when we travel we will sell them 
01:18:19
We have a lot of new stuff 
01:18:20
I'm about to do like a kind of commercial thing later 
01:18:22
And show them on many things the father wants things to be worn by people that talk about him that talk about god 
01:18:29
Talk about being good or that warns people against the evil. He says satan's had products out for years 
01:18:33
It's about time we had some 
01:18:36
Yeah, so we we have a lot of new stuff to put this revealing heaven.com 
01:18:40

I hope you enjoyed it. 
03:06
We were in Korea. 
03:10
We took on Marines and headed to Vietnam to evacuate refugees. 
03:16
We had no idea what we were going to find. 
03:20
I don't even know that I necessarily knew my dad served in the Navy at that point. 
03:30
The war wasn't a popular war and we weren't popular because of that. 
03:34
So I never talked much about who I was or what I was. 
03:38
I turned on the TV and I sat on the bed with my wife. 
03:41
And I watched the people running from the buildings. 
03:45
And I turned to Judy and I said, I've seen this before. 
03:48
She said, where? 
03:49
I said, Vietnam. 
03:52
I said, where do you think you have PTSD? 
04:01
And I said, how could I dock? 
04:03
My boots never hit the ground. 
04:07
My time when born in the Durham was when I grew up. 
04:10
I guess I got a foundation of what I wanted to be and who I wanted to be. 
04:19
Amazing story, amazing story. 
04:22
I hope you'll get it. 
04:23
It's on both YouTube and Rumble. 
04:24
In fact, let's pull up that sheet here. 
04:25
Thank you, Emily. 
04:26
So it's on the Rumble channel. 
04:28
It's rumble.com slash American Warriors 22. 
04:32
And then on the YouTube channel, this is the same YouTube.com slash American Warriors 22. 
04:38
So don't miss that. 
04:39
It's on either one of those channels. 
04:41
We're just doing a lot of great service to the veterans of the nation from all the wars. 
04:48
World War II, Vietnam, Korea. 
04:51
We'll be doing things probably in front regarding those who are in Fallujah or Iraq or all of those places. 
04:58
There's stories, many, many, many hundreds or thousands of stories to tell. 
05:02
But Bible says no greater love does anyone have that except when they lay down their life or another. 
05:07
And that's what these people are doing. 
05:09
So we want to honor them strongly. 
05:12
So all right. 
05:13
I think that's it for our announcements. 
05:16
So without further delay, let's bring in Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. 
05:20
Here we go. 
05:37

05:48
Well done. 
05:49
Yeah. 
05:50
Well, you know, we kind of got on last minute today. 
05:52
So welcome back, Kat, as always. 
05:54
So good to see you. 
05:55
How is your, this is the beginning of your day, even though it's two o'clock, right? 
06:00
Yeah, it is. 
06:01
I get up probably around noon. 
06:04
I did go to bed this morning at almost 7 30 a.m. 
06:08
Wow. 
06:09
Sleep at least four hours because I'm up for 20 hours every day. 
06:14
I've been packing because if you all don't know, we're moving not out of the city. 
06:18
We are moving and I'm right now sitting in the midst of everything's, 
06:22
a lot of it's packed. 
06:23
So I had to unpack stuff to get ready for today. 
06:27
Really point where you know, you're going to be done in a few weeks. 
06:30
So, but you got to kind of keep stuff out to put on. 
06:33
And I bought some stuff for my trip to warrior, Alabama, 
06:36
which I'm very excited about that. 
06:38
So it's just been not as easy to get stuff out and get it ready because place has 
06:43
to be painted. 
06:44
The flooring has to be replaced and you know, a few other things. 
06:48
So we're right there at that, that ready to cross over into our new home, 
06:53
which I'm very excited about. 
06:55
But I'm happy I'm here and I'm happy I'm here right now on the earth. 
06:59
I'm very excited. 
07:00
The father's been speaking to me about quite a few things. 
07:03
I can probably mention a couple. 
07:05
I can't tell you the other things right now, 
07:07
but he will tell you eventually. 
07:09
Okay. 
07:10
I am going to mention again about the storm that came through. 
07:15
And I want to thank all you weather warriors. 
07:17
I know you, you know, now the minute something comes up, 
07:20
the tip of Africa, which is where most of these storms form and come across 
07:25
here to, to America and had its normal MO the way it normally operated would 
07:32
come straight across, you know, the Atlantic and then just hit the whole 
07:36
east coast and go up the east coast in New York sometimes. 
07:40
But the weather warriors have been taking authority over the weather, 
07:43
especially the storms. 
07:45
We haven't reached, you know, as powerful as Christ did, 
07:49
but that is his goal for us to speak to the land, 
07:52
see in the air for anything's causing issues and to make it straighten up. 
07:56
And we know that Jesus stopped the storms. 
07:59
We have a right to do that. 
08:00
We actually should be doing it on a regular basis. 
08:03
So we did start attacking that storm, sending the host to shred the 
08:07
bands of the storm so that the eye would not be formed. 
08:10
And we started doing that right away. 
08:12
Well, the storm changed many times. 
08:14
If you haven't heard this report. 
08:16
And at the very last moment, I actually hit it with my staff. 
08:21
I said, you're not coming to my city. 
08:23
You have no right to be here. 
08:24
And it had already by that at that point was downgraded from crossing 
08:28
over land. 
08:29
We really did what they said it would, because we have the final say. 
08:33
We as the body of Christ have the right to not have destruction done to 
08:37
our lives, to our property at any time whatsoever. 
08:41
And so when I did that, it went around Jacksonville actually went off 
08:45
a shore early and it never actually fully came through our city at all. 
08:49
But I did go up to the beach anyway. 
08:51
And I kept speaking against it, telling it that it would not do 
08:55
severe damage to people that would go up these coast and come inland 
08:59
or bring some relief about a third of our country right now is actually 
09:03
in drought. 
09:04
So you need to be praying for low pressure system to people who are in 
09:08
those drought areas so that rain will come and nourish the earth and 
09:12
nourish the land. 
09:13
And that's why the father made weather. 
09:15
He never made it to destroy that's the enemy's plan. 
09:18
So I just want to give an update on that that we were all busy. 
09:21
Many thousands of people were praying. 
09:23
Thank you for your prayers. 
09:25
And a lot of miracles have happened. 
09:27
I'm probably get some of those together. 
09:29
Maybe the next time I'm on, I can read some of the miracles that 
09:31
happened during the storm. 
09:32
But you know, God's ear is always tuned into us, his children. 
09:37
So thank you all for praying. 
09:39
Thank you all those who helped in those cities. 
09:41
Thank you for the volunteers are still out there cleaning up other places. 
09:45
I think I don't know if it's South Carolina, Virginia and North 
09:48
Carolina, one of those were kind of were hit, but not as severe as they 
09:52
said. 
09:53
So thank you for your prayers. 
09:54
They do make a difference. 
09:55
It's awesome. 
09:56
Now, Kat, you mentioned a second ago, you're going to be with, 
09:59
you're going to be a warrior Alabama with Robin bullet. 
10:02
Go ahead and put up that slide. 
10:04
They, it says the church international, which is Robin bullet, 
10:09
Robin and Robin. 
10:10
You can just watch the name or both Robin welcomes Kat October 
10:13
15 and 16. 
10:15
So I assume by this announcement that there must be some seating 
10:19
laughter. 
10:20
Is this, is this tickets or is it first come, first server? 
10:23
Do you know? 
10:24
I think it's first come, first served. 
10:26
Now he is in his new place. 
10:28
He has a place that's still in warrior, but it's much bigger and 
10:32
of course more improved. 
10:34
He was in a place that maybe could hold maybe 200 people, I think, 
10:38
and they would, they began to get so overwhelmed. 
10:41
They could not get all the people in there. 
10:43
Wow. 
10:44
When I came, they couldn't, they were inside rooms. 
10:46
They had cameras in there and people were so excited to, 
10:49
to get to hear the prophets that really do know what God is 
10:52
saying. 
10:53
And I really am looking forward to it. 
10:55
I helped to, when he first found the place, I actually was there 
10:59
in the city and prophesied over it and said what God would do 
11:02
for him and what would happen. 
11:04
He would have that piece of land. 
11:06
It's very strategically located. 
11:08
Two places you should always look for. 
11:11
If you're, if you're building a place that God is going to do 
11:13
stuff from, you should live on the highest hill in the area. 
11:17
Oh, wow. 
11:19
Oh, really? 
11:20
In the center is where you need to be. 
11:22
The center is very important because the epicenter of anything 
11:25
is where the hardest thing hits and that includes the power of 
11:29
God. 
11:30
And I do know that's what's going to happen there. 
11:32
So I'm very excited about being there and getting to bless his 
11:35
place, the place that God gave him there. 
11:37
It's going to be very powerful. 
11:39
And that is, that is this hell from that place and also all over 
11:44
this earth just because that we're both there together, 
11:47
speaking and speaking for God. 
11:49
That's good. 
11:50
I just realized, yeah, that's like three days away. 
11:52
Yeah. 
11:53
15 and 16. 
11:54
So they've written me a note and I assume they'll put this underneath 
11:58
your comments under YouTube. 
12:00
I'm sorry, under rumble. 
12:02
We're not on YouTube. 
12:03
It's a 204 camp drive in warrior Alabama. 
12:06
They said it is free. 
12:08
No registration is required. 
12:10
And services will also be live streamed. 
12:12
So if you can't go, you can watch it. 
12:15
I'm assuming those are probably, do you know if those are evening 
12:19
only cat or do you know? 
12:21
I probably think Sunday isn't Sunday is Sunday morning. 
12:26
Okay. 
12:27
That's okay. 
12:28
I'll make sure I sleep later. 
12:30
Yeah. 
12:31
Saturday night and Sunday morning. 
12:33
I think that's when the meetings are and I'm telling you their 
12:36
worship is really out of this world. 
12:38
Really is like very powerful stuff happen. 
12:42
Angels come and go and things happen even during the worship. 
12:45
And, but I'm excited to be with someone who understands and believes 
12:50
not just having, but the heart of the father and how God operates 
12:53
and what's going on in the spirit realm right now. 
12:55
He's very big and understanding of the spirit realm operations 
12:59
and has been involved in a lot of stuff for God doing things like 
13:02
that. 
13:03
So, and I call her lady Robin, by the way. 
13:06
Yeah. 
13:07
Robin and lady Robin. 
13:09
Robin and lady Robin. 
13:10
So by the way, they're telling they've typed in this. 
13:12
So on Saturday is seven PM central time, which is their time 
13:16
period and Sunday is 1045 central 1045 AM central. 
13:20
So it's one evening and the evening in the morning. 
13:23
Okay. 
13:24
It's in the morning where the day that Robin and cats. 
13:27
Yeah. 
13:28
That's going to be awesome. 
13:29
So now I'm going to go into questions on having anything else. 
13:31
Make sure I give you time. 
13:32
Anything else? 
13:33
Any other questions? 
13:34
That's it right now. 
13:35
Okay. 
13:36
So I'm going to start with it again. 
13:38
Anyone that may be new cat has been to heaven. 
13:40
He catches you up. 
13:42
And would you tell people, you know, Paul, 
13:45
it's believed that Paul went up to the third heaven that it was 
13:48
himself. 
13:49
He was writing about. 
13:50
He said he didn't know if he's in the body or out of the body. 
13:52
So how would you describe it when he catches you up out of the body 
13:56
in the body? 
13:57
What would you say? 
13:58
I understand that also. 
14:00
I know Paul did. 
14:01
He went a couple of times. 
14:03
I think John, the beloved, has one of the best examples in the 
14:07
book of revelation. 
14:08
I think revelation four, where he talked about when he was in the 
14:12
spirit on the Lord's day, that's the way he lived in the spirit. 
14:17
It means many things can happen that don't normally happen. 
14:20
And that's when he heard the voice and he was told, you know, 
14:24
and he saw a door open and they, they took him up. 
14:27
He literally went up to heaven and was standing for the throne of 
14:31
the father. 
14:32
I don't know if you all realize this, but in the book of John itself, 
14:35
and I'm talking about revelation right now. 
14:37
This is much later in his life when he would say, you cannot see the 
14:40
face of God and live. 
14:41
And yet God on purpose, the father caught him up before his throne. 
14:45
And he saw that living rainbow. 
14:47
He even says it in there. 
14:49
He saw the rainbow like unto an emerald. 
14:51
That was probably the color of teal. 
14:53
And he saw him described him, the fire in his eyes, the lightning, 
14:57
the thunder, the living creatures. 
14:59
I mean, that was a very accurate description of what I see when I'm 
15:03
taken there, but he was taken before the father's throne. 
15:07
Jesus is not the one who has the rainbow coming in out of him. 
15:11
That is the father. 
15:12
And I know the father did that on purpose because here's John living 
15:15
a righteous life on the earth, still carrying out what he was sent 
15:19
here for. 
15:20
And yet he was caught up to heaven without dying and saw the face 
15:24
of God himself. 
15:25
So that tells you right there, if it's God's choice, yes, it can 
15:29
happen. 
15:30
And because you're born again, you're dependent of your sins, 
15:33
you're righteous. 
15:34
You have entrance into heaven. 
15:36
You have the ability to, when you pass from this world, 
15:39
to go live in heaven. 
15:40
But the fact that he could see the father's face before he died is 
15:44
very significant because he was born again, you know, 
15:49
filled with Christ, doing his work that God gave him to do. 
15:53
His sins washed away. 
15:55
That gave him the ability at that time to be caught up and shown 
15:59
the throne of the living God and all the things that go on there. 
16:03
Paul was so overwhelmed because I think so many years later, 
16:09
there was more things that could be understandable to John. 
16:12
I'm sure that what Paul, you know, Paul didn't know what in the 
16:16
world to say to people about what he saw there. 
16:18
There's so many things that are so supernatural, unless God 
16:22
pulled you on purpose to explain and gives you revelation about 
16:26
what those are. 
16:27
Revelation changes everything that comes from the heart of the 
16:30
father. 
16:31
And the Bible says, we shall not live by bread alone, but by 
16:34
every word spoken from the mouth of God. 
16:38
So yes, God can give people things directly from him to say 
16:42
on the earth. 
16:43
And there's a scripture right there to prove it. 
16:45
And that's what he does with me. 
16:47
He'll come in person or he catches me up to heaven or other 
16:50
places in heaven. 
16:51
I've been taken back in time, forward in time. 
16:55
And let me tell you something. 
16:56
If you're a believer, you've already been from the beginning 
16:59
to the end and the end to the beginning before he made the 
17:03
earth. 
17:04
He could time came from the father. 
17:07
He could go back as far as he wanted or even forward into 
17:11
eternity if he wants to. 
17:12
And we all lived in him when he did that. 
17:15
And we would ride out on the rays of that rainbow that comes 
17:18
in and out of him like the northern lights. 
17:20
That's what we used to do when we lived in him. 
17:23
And him you live, right? 
17:25
You move, you have your very existence. 
17:28
And that would be in the father that we lived in him. 
17:31
He is our father. 
17:32
So there's some correct scripture revelation for you. 
17:36
And one, I like to bring this up every few months for those who 
17:40
may be new is you tell an experience once where you were, 
17:43
you, you're shopping, you lift up to get something on the 
17:46
shelf by the time your hands up there, suddenly you're caught 
17:49
up. 
17:50
You have an experience. 
17:51
I don't remember if it was minutes or hours or longer. 
17:54
And then you have the experience. 
17:56
You come back and your hands still up there and you put it in 
17:59
the basket. 
18:00
Am I saying that about right? 
18:02
Yes. 
18:03
But in heaven, there's no real time. 
18:06
Yeah. 
18:07
They don't have clocks up there. 
18:09
They don't have to keep time because you're living in 
18:11
eternity right now actually. 
18:13
But there is a difference on how long I can gauge that by how 
18:17
long I'm not here or I'm taking my spirit. 
18:20
Man is taken out of my body. 
18:22
My body is kept alive by Holy spirit. 
18:25
And like the thing in the grocery store, I'm sure seconds, 
18:28
probably maybe three seconds, two seconds go by. 
18:32
If you're going to reach for something, I use my cup for an 
18:35
example. 
18:36
If this is on the shelf, let me get in there. 
18:39
This is on the shelf in the store, right? 
18:41
And I'm reaching for it. 
18:42
I touch it. 
18:43
He takes me to heaven. 
18:45
My hand is still in the store on the thing. 
18:48
And a second later, I'll be back and put it in the cart. 
18:51
But in heaven, I could have been taken to three or four 
18:53
different places in heaven and shown that. 
18:55
That is the beauty of heaven, that there's no real definition 
19:00
except, you know, how many places you saw. 
19:03
And even though I was gone for a few minutes down here, 
19:06
because that's eternity and there is no time, I could go to 
19:10
several places. 
19:11
I do know one time I was taken for four hours Earth time. 
19:15
I just happened to glance at my clock right when he's told me 
19:19
I'm taking you. 
19:20
And then I was gone when I was back in my body. 
19:23
Four hours Earth time had passed. 
19:25
And that was when he was teaching me about the keys to the 
19:28
kingdom, how to bind and loosen things from your soul. 
19:31
So your soul can be free that it can prosper. 
19:34
Well, and when you, when you say it was four hours at Earth 
19:37
time, because you, you saw it on the clock, would you have, 
19:42
if someone had said when he got back, you told Jen, your sister, 
19:45
this has just happened to me, if you were to describe all the 
19:48
things that happened during that four hours, would it have 
19:52
seemed like it would have taken longer than four hours? 
19:55
If that had happened in Earth time, do you see what I'm saying? 
19:58
What might, I know there's no time in heaven, but if you had 
20:01
done all those things on Earth, would it have taken four hours 
20:05
or maybe a lot more than four hours? 
20:07
Would you guess? 
20:08
I, I, I can't gauge that. 
20:11
The spirit realm is so different from this natural realm, 
20:14
this physical realm. 
20:16
Every moment passes by in this physical realm. 
20:19
So you know what that time is allotted for. 
20:22
And that's why people can plan events and stuff. 
20:25
That's how they have to plan. 
20:26
I mean, in heaven, the events could just go on and you go 
20:29
right to another one, or you get to go visit other people. 
20:32
And you don't have to have an appointment to do that. 
20:34
You don't have to have a schedule thing for that to happen in 
20:37
heaven. 
20:38
It's just life. 
20:39
It's just the way life is. 
20:40
I did get shown a lot though. 
20:43
And I have great understanding not only of how our soul operates, 
20:47
but what our soul looks like. 
20:49
Our soul is a literal thing. 
20:51
It's not just a little wispy thing that appears and disappears. 
20:54
It's one of the, it's the very core and heart of our spirit man 
20:57
is where our soul is. 
20:59
It's your mind, what you think about your will and your emotions. 
21:02
Now in saying that, I'm not talking about your brain. 
21:06
Your mind is not your brain. 
21:08
Cause in heaven, you live there when your body has died, 
21:11
your brain is in your body, obviously. 
21:13
You have buried or whatever's been done to it. 
21:16
You still have a mind that's a spiritual part of you that 
21:19
thinks and chooses and does other things. 
21:22
Your will also is with you in heaven. 
21:24
You couldn't decide what you wanted to do. 
21:26
And your emotions are definitely in heaven. 
21:29
You can be very expressive about a lot of things. 
21:32
So having a great understanding God calls me a soul doctor now. 
21:35
And he said people really want to pursue that can be soul doctors. 
21:39
You can help people lose things from their soul, 
21:41
the tragedies, the traumas, the fear, 
21:44
but then you bind the holy things, the powerful things, 
21:47
the love and the life of God to your soul. 
21:49
And nobody can take that out of you. 
21:51
When you have bound the things of God is the keys to the kingdom. 
21:54
What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. 
21:57
What you lose on earth will be loosed in heaven. 
21:59
And you show me in great detail how to use those in that 
22:02
four hour time span that I was gone from here. 
22:05
Wow. 
22:06
Now, because you're talking about the soul, 
22:08
I'm going to jump to the fifth thing on my fifth question on my list. 
22:11
And then I'll go back to the top because this is, 
22:13
this will just, you know, pick you back on top of this. 
22:16
So a person by the name of Sunday asks, 
22:19
I have heard cats say that our soul does not sleep. 
22:23
And she said that a few times. 
22:26
My question is what does our soul do while our bodies are sleeping 
22:30
or our dreams, the journey of our soul? 
22:33
Now, I think this person's asking about physical sleep, 
22:37
but I'm thinking you might have been talking about the default 
22:41
doctrine of soul sleep. 
22:43
So I don't know for sure if she has the same angle of what you 
22:47
meant when you said our soul doesn't sleep, but maybe you did. 
22:50
Go ahead and touch on any of that that you like. 
22:53
Well, the one thing that they're talking about, 
22:56
that people think that when you die, you're doing nothing. 
23:00
They think that your body, you're in your body, 
23:03
your body goes into the earth or gets pre-made, 
23:06
and therefore it can't do anything. 
23:08
They don't understand the soul. 
23:10
The soul is a spiritual, fully spiritual part of you. 
23:14
And it says to be absent. 
23:16
This is when you pass away. 
23:18
The Bible says to be absent from this body is to be present 
23:22
with the Lord that clearly tells you when your body dies, 
23:26
out of this body steps your spiritual body that looks like 
23:29
you, but much younger, is very aware of everything. 
23:33
It has memory. 
23:34
It still has emotions. 
23:36
And the excitement fills your spirit man because you know 
23:40
you're going home to heaven. 
23:41
When you step out of this body, the body, 
23:43
when the dead in Christ shall rise is your body you had. 
23:47
And then the soul, that spirit man, 
23:50
when soul will be joined back together on the day the dead 
23:53
in Christ shall rise. 
23:55
All those living in heaven will come back with Christ 
23:58
and they will get their bodies back and their bodies 
24:00
will be glorified at that time. 
24:02
So your soul does not need sleep. 
24:04
It's a spiritual thing. 
24:06
People do not sleep in heaven. 
24:08
They don't need to. 
24:09
You don't get exhausted. 
24:10
Your body doesn't have to be rejuvenated. 
24:12
You're living in the life of God there. 
24:14
But your spirit man has a literal life in heaven 
24:17
like you sit on your furniture in your mansion 
24:20
because you're in a spiritual realm. 
24:22
Those are spiritual things prepared for you. 
24:24
Your mansion is a spiritual thing, 
24:26
but it's literal because it's in the spirit realm. 
24:29
You, therefore, in that spirit realm can eat amazing food. 
24:33
You can go places, do things. 
24:35
So your spirit man is very active in heaven while your body 
24:38
is resting because it died. 
24:41
Some people don't even understand something that simple. 
24:44
But your spirit man still can make choices 
24:47
and understand things, get more revelation. 
24:50
You can learn to do new things in heaven. 
24:52
And so people are very active in heaven. 
24:54
No one's sitting around just resting in the arms of the Lord. 
24:58
If they did it, it was just because they loved him 
25:00
when they were near him, but they're not literally sleeping. 
25:03
And so your soul person, your soul and your spirit 
25:08
do not need to sleep. 
25:10
And sometimes he will catch you up and do his things 
25:13
with that spirit man while you're sleeping. 
25:16
And people have already proven that 
25:18
because they go into a foreign country. 
25:20
People recognize him later, say, 
25:22
you came and prayed for me and they never left their bed. 
25:24
And so you have your soul that are all you. 
25:29
I know this is really deep for some people, 
25:31
but that's how he can take you somewhere 
25:33
more than one place at the same time. 
25:35
And that will begin the increase. 
25:37
Oh, really? 
25:38
He can take a person more than one place at the same time? 
25:42
Yes. 
25:43
Oh, I haven't heard you say that one. 
25:45
That's interesting because you've taught about layers 
25:47
for years and years. 
25:48
So I've heard that. 
25:49
I didn't realize. 
25:50
So I've had people thank me for being in Argentina 
25:56
and different places. 
25:57
They've thanked me for. 
25:58
And I never was there to my knowledge. 
26:00
I mean, I've never been there on purpose. 
26:02
Okay. 
26:03
And yet they've thanked me for coming. 
26:05
And so that happens. 
26:06
But you're saying he could take me to Argentina 
26:09
and New Mexico at the same time. 
26:11
Yes, because you have layers of you. 
26:13
And actually the father's probably got more than anyone else, 
26:16
but the father is a many layer being. 
26:19
Holy spirit is a many layer being. 
26:22
It's one of the ways we're made in their image. 
26:24
Our soul has layers. 
26:26
The layers are not like this. 
26:28
They're like, I'm going to have to bring a model of something. 
26:32
But I've already got, I've already drawn the human soul, 
26:36
the spiritual one and one that would look like a model 
26:39
you could hold in your hand, take apart, 
26:41
understand how you're made. 
26:43
But that's one of the beautiful things about being made in their image. 
26:46
They all have layers of themselves in their soul. 
26:49
That's how Holy spirit can be everywhere, 
26:51
all at the same time. 
26:53
And if you, if you get born again, invited Christ in your heart, 
26:56
then it says he moves in. 
26:58
It says that he lives in you. 
26:59
It says that. 
27:00
And then he can influence you from inside, 
27:03
but you can also and then invite Holy spirit to indwell you. 
27:07
And then he takes a layer of himself literally and sends it to you 
27:12
when you invite him in and he moves in there too. 
27:15
And then it says in the Bible, when Christ sent him, 
27:18
he walks alongside you. 
27:19
But when we start inviting him, which is what he wants, 
27:22
you give him permission to indwell you, 
27:24
then he can speak to you from inside. 
27:26
So you'll hear him all the time speaking. 
27:28
Now I've heard, I've read where Paul said, at least in one place, 
27:32
he talked about, I think some of it was when he was disciplining the church, 
27:36
but there might have been another time when he said, 
27:39
when you're there and you come together, I'm with you in spirit. 
27:41
And I always thought that meant I'm with you. 
27:44
I'm with you in spirit. 
27:45
I'm for you. 
27:46
But I think, does it mean more literally like he really was there? 
27:50
I think sometimes he probably was there to observe. 
27:54
Yeah. 
27:55
Sometimes he sends you places to observe things. 
27:57
Sometimes you actually speak to people. 
27:59
Sometimes he makes it like you're in a place praying for people 
28:02
or even part of a meeting somewhere. 
28:04
And that has happened to several people and not just several quick, 
28:07
excuse me, 
28:08
quite a few people who've had that happen to them on a regular basis. 
28:12
And that is one of the things, 
28:14
if you give permission to the Father, 
28:17
the Holy Spirit to use you in any way they want to, 
28:20
but it's going to begin to increase because we can, 
28:23
in the natural, 
28:24
be in other places at the same time, 
28:26
but in the spirit we can, 
28:28
if that's what the Father wants, 
28:30
can take us to different places. 
28:32
And your layer of you looks just like you. 
28:35
Looks just like you in there. 
28:37
Yeah. 
28:38
Do you, do you recommend maybe not even just once, 
28:41
but every night when you go to sleep, 
28:43
say, Lord, if you can use me while I'm asleep, 
28:45
I give that permission to do that. 
28:47
I would totally say that. 
28:48
Every night even. 
28:50
You say it as often as you want to, 
28:52
because when you begin to show him, 
28:54
you believe that it's possible. 
28:56
You believe he does do that. 
28:58
And he did it in the Bible with Philip. 
29:00
Now, Philip, he just transported him physically in places, 
29:03
which he also can do that. 
29:05
And he looked for Philip, you know, 
29:07
he ran right up next to the chariot, 
29:09
that tells you how fast he was running. 
29:11
And God had an appointment with him to speak to that person 
29:13
in the chariot. 
29:14
And when he was done, 
29:15
he was no longer there. 
29:16
I said he was no longer found, 
29:18
but he was found in another place. 
29:20
So there are examples in the Bible 
29:22
about being transported in the spirit, 
29:24
but people don't understand what they mean. 
29:26
So some of them don't read them. 
29:28
There is a question that I think is one of the best 
29:31
as a supernatural God, 
29:33
because everything has the ability 
29:35
and made us in certain ways that he can do things like that 
29:38
with us. 
29:39
Now there's a question also on my list today that says, 
29:42
from Simone and the question is, 
29:44
when Jesus lived on the earth, 
29:46
did he still have layers of himself in heaven 
29:49
when he lived here? 
29:50
That's the question. 
29:51
Um, I don't know that he did. 
29:53
I think when he came that was, 
29:55
that was that had to totally be him that had to be his. 
29:57
He was in his spiritual body, but God put flesh on him. 
30:02
It says the word was flesh. 
30:07
He had flesh put on him. 
30:09
Jesus used to be all spiritual body. 
30:12
He was a spiritual being. 
30:13
He didn't have flesh on him at one time. 
30:15
But when he said yes to come and die and walk this earth 
30:19
as a human so that people would know he was here, 
30:22
know he was real, then he had to have flesh put on just 
30:25
so people could see him. 
30:27
He has still got that flesh. 
30:29
He's got the same flesh. 
30:30
You can see the holes in his hand. 
30:32
And actually, they're in the wrist. 
30:35
You can see all the things on him from his crucifixion. 
30:37
He actually does have his immortal body. 
30:39
He's in his immortal body, but looks very similar to what 
30:43
he did when he walked on this earth. 
30:45
Yeah, so good. 
30:46
OK, good. 
30:47
Now, here's a Daisy, age 11, is asking this. 
30:51
Was it the Holy Spirit's horse named Thunder, 
30:54
one of the horses in the chariots of fire 
30:57
that took Elijah to heaven? 
30:59
OK, so that's the question. 
31:00
I guess you must have said that the Holy Spirit had 
31:03
a horse named Thunder. 
31:04
I haven't heard you say that. 
31:06
OK, so I don't want to know if that's 
31:07
the same horse that took Elijah. 
31:09
That's what they do. 
31:10
I'm not sure which horses were used. 
31:12
I'm sure there was more than one, though, 
31:14
to take that chariot. 
31:17
Jesus does have a horse named Lightning. 
31:20
And when he says in the Bible, my Lightning 
31:22
goes from the east to the west. 
31:23
He's not talking about natural Lightning, 
31:25
but he's talking about his horse that he rides. 
31:28
He rides it quite a bit in all over heaven, 
31:31
outside of heaven. 
31:33
And Holy Spirit, and he do ride together sometimes. 
31:36
And that was probably especially before he 
31:39
had flesh put on him. 
31:40
They're very close. 
31:42
I mean, they are all God. 
31:43
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is a triune Godhead, 
31:46
which means that they all rule together. 
31:49
But they each all have their own body. 
31:52
And some people picture, because it's a spiritual body, 
31:54
that you can't actually see it. 
31:56
But that's not the way it is in heaven. 
31:59
So that is, I know for sure, it probably 
32:01
was Lightning since Jesus sent that chariot. 
32:05
He sent that. 
32:06
The Lord of Hosts, I'm sure some of the hosts 
32:08
were even present also when Elijah was caught up 
32:11
in that chariot. 
32:12
But that was a physical thing that happened. 
32:15
And yet he was still seen, especially by Elisha. 
32:18
I did see him go up in that chariot. 
32:21
OK, cool. 
32:22
Now, Kathleen is asking, will tattoos 
32:29
show on a resurrected body? 
32:32
So your resurrected, will tattoos still show? 
32:37
I can't say that they would, because that was something 
32:41
you had done on the earth. 
32:43
And I do know that when your body is resurrected, 
32:46
it's going to be new. 
32:47
It's going to look young. 
32:49
I don't know that you will keep marks from the earth 
32:51
at that time on your body. 
32:54
I know that God's going to put some on you 
32:55
when you get to heaven, it says so. 
32:57
So God puts a mark in your forehead and a mark in your hand. 
33:02
It says that in the Bible, the city of your God and your God, 
33:06
you'll be marked with those marks in heaven. 
33:08
So in other words, if you had other ones that stayed on you, 
33:11
he wouldn't be able to do that without erasing them. 
33:14
So I believe probably that when you get your resurrected body, 
33:19
I don't think that there'll be earthly tattoos on me at all. 
33:22
OK, good. 
33:23
Yeah, you know, I'm being the purist. 
33:25
My idealist is maybe a better word. 
33:28
I don't like the idea that Jesus still 
33:30
has holes in his hands in heaven. 
33:32
I want him to be all healed up. 
33:33
But I get the point. 
33:34
We can see what he did for us. 
33:37
But I find myself often when you describe that, 
33:39
I go, I don't want him to have holes anymore. 
33:42
I want him to be healed. 
33:43
It's the evidence. 
33:44
It's the witness. 
33:45
It really is the witness that it's him. 
33:48
And he loves those marks because he did for us the fact 
33:53
that they pulled the wool over Satan's eyes. 
33:56
In other words, Satan would not have ever wanted to kill him, 
33:58
had he known what was going to happen after that, 
34:02
that he would show up in hell, wipe up hell, 
34:04
take the keys of hell, death and grave, 
34:05
and we very jumps on off of Satan, which the Lord did that 
34:10
right before he came out of the grave when he was down in hell. 
34:13
It says he crossed over hell. 
34:15
And so he would have never, ever wanted for that to happen. 
34:19
And yet he encouraged them to crucify Christ, 
34:22
although that was the plan for Christ to give himself. 
34:26
And he said, no man takes my life, but I lay it down. 
34:31
He actually said that about Calvary, 
34:35
that he laid that life down. 
34:37
So I don't think had they wanted to kill him 
34:40
and he wasn't supposed to do that, 
34:42
they could have never killed him. 
34:45
I have a question about hell, you 
34:50
talked about Hitler is now, even literally, 
34:53
on a meat hook in hell. 
34:55
You said that. 
34:56
And last time you were on, we talked about there is no let 
35:01
up that the punishment is forever and ever and ever. 
35:05
And you mentioned that in so many words. 
35:07
So my question is, are the people like Hitler suffering? 
35:12
I don't know how to ask the question. 
35:14
Are they suffering much worse than someone that just says, 
35:18
I don't want Jesus, I don't believe in it. 
35:21
I'm sorry, I just don't want it. 
35:22
And that person now doesn't go to heaven. 
35:25
Is suffering equal? 
35:27
Or is there some that are tortured more than the other? 
35:32
I think the more evil you are, he puts it in their face. 
35:37
Because they think they do. 
35:39
Most evil people who have actually 
35:40
made a covenant with Satan to be evil on the earth 
35:44
and Hitler did do that, he thought 
35:47
and was promised a position. 
35:49
And Satan has always done that. 
35:51
You all remember when Christ was in the wilderness 
35:53
and that was his time of temptation. 
35:55
And Satan appeared to him and he said, 
35:57
you see all these amazing, beautiful cities that belong to me. 
36:00
I will give you them if you bow down and worship me. 
36:04
And that's what he wanted. 
36:05
Of course, Christ said, get away from me. 
36:08
He only serves the living God. 
36:10
But even that happened then, because that 
36:12
was his mode of operation, Satan will go to people who 
36:15
don't care about life itself that want to be wicked 
36:18
and he'll make a pact with them. 
36:20
If you're as evil as this and tell somebody 
36:22
he wants them to do, I will give you power on the earth. 
36:25
And then when you get to hell, I will give you places 
36:27
to rule and reign. 
36:28
He gives nobody anything except torment. 
36:30
And he makes it, he mocks them in hell. 
36:34
He just got them to be stupid enough 
36:36
to be wicked for him thinking he was going to celebrate that. 
36:39
Let me, oh, excuse me, I've got to take a drink, just a minute. 
36:42
Go ahead, take a drink. 
36:43
I'll do that too. 
36:44
Well, no. 
36:46
Yeah, so because there's a part of me 
36:47
that says if somebody just, I don't want this Jesus, 
36:52
I don't believe it, I think it's a fairytale 
36:55
and they just reject him, that seems 
36:57
like a hugely different thing than what Hitler did 
37:00
and some people who are torturing children. 
37:02
And so I wondered if their punishments were very... 
37:05
It is worse. 
37:06
It definitely is absolutely worse. 
37:09
But the thing is, God desires even the violent sinner 
37:13
to be free because of the price his son paid, 
37:17
the price he paid for sending his son 
37:19
that is available to anyone who will receive it. 
37:24
It's not God's wish. 
37:25
And I don't think hell was ever created for people 
37:29
to suffer in, that was a place for the demons to stay 
37:33
until their extreme punishment, 
37:35
even they get punished later, 
37:37
they won't have any ability to rule. 
37:39
And I do want to make one actual comment. 
37:44
They are tortured, everybody in hell is tortured 
37:48
by all kinds of horrible things up until the day 
37:52
that the dead in Christ rise 
37:54
and even after the tribulation and all that time is over 
37:57
when it's all over that God intends to do, 
38:00
Christ ruling on the earth, that big final last battle 
38:03
when the last one is sent from God himself 
38:07
to be born in the earth, time will be no more. 
38:10
The Bible says that at that time, 
38:12
we will all be in heaven, of course, 
38:15
being celebrating and everything, hell will be empty. 
38:19
There will be a time when hell is empty 
38:21
because that's not their final place of torture. 
38:24
The lake of fire is clearly talked about in the Bible. 
38:27
They will all be thrown into the lake of fire 
38:29
that will not be on the new earth 
38:31
or even around the new earth 
38:32
that will be in a whole different place. 
38:34
And that's where they will spend eternity 
38:36
burning in this lake. 
38:37
And even Satan will have no power in that place. 
38:41
Nobody will have power 
38:43
and it will be their captive prison for all of time. 
38:47
They will be let out from hell so the books can be read. 
38:50
We will not be at that. 
38:52
We will not be at the great white throne judgment. 
38:53
That is for the wicked. 
38:55
So you will not be present there 
38:57
and God will read all the sins they did 
39:00
and the rejection of Jesus Christ 
39:02
and why they made their own choice 
39:04
and they're gonna know why they made that choice 
39:07
and then they will be cast into the lake of fire. 
39:09
So there's something worse than the torture 
39:12
that in torment that goes on hell now 
39:15
but everybody will be tormented the same at that time. 
39:17
It won't be like different, different, different things. 
39:21
And we've covered this a number of times 
39:22
what I'm about to ask. 
39:24
And that is God will, if people are praying 
39:26
and standing for a loved one, 
39:28
you've said many times he will then obligate himself 
39:31
to answer that prayer by going to them 
39:33
at the moment of death and say, do you want me now? 
39:36
It gives them one last chance. 
39:38
So it's not like someone said, I don't believe it. 
39:41
I think it's a fairy tale. 
39:42
They'll have an opportunity for a moment in time 
39:44
at least to see him in his glory 
39:47
and then reject him or not reject him. 
39:50
Am I saying that right? 
39:52
I think anybody who has somebody passionately praying 
39:55
for them to know Christ and you know 
39:59
that they'll have the opportunity, but he has the keys. 
40:02
That is the clear evidence, Steve. 
40:05
That's why he took the keys Christ 
40:07
when he was on the before the third day, 
40:09
end of the third day, when he was resurrected 
40:12
and came back into the tomb. 
40:14
The last thing he did was wipe up hell. 
40:16
He literally melted the faces of principalities and powers. 
40:20
Those are high level demons 
40:22
that sit on thrones around the world. 
40:24
They do not live in hell. 
40:26
I mean, people don't understand that type of thing, 
40:28
but they were called into hell 
40:30
to see Satan torture the son of God. 
40:32
Yes, that was the plan on their side. 
40:35
It never happened. 
40:37
Then he took every gemstone off of Satan, 
40:39
which was his pride. 
40:40
He took them off of him and took them back 
40:43
that God had put on him. 
40:44
And then the last thing he did was take the keys 
40:46
of hell, death and the grave. 
40:48
The Satan did not have supreme authority 
40:52
to hold people there. 
40:54
If there was a reason why that was given, 
40:56
the Bible says it's appointed unto man once to die. 
41:01
And then at that moment, the judgment, 
41:04
that's not the judgment seat of Christ 
41:06
and that is not the great white stone judgment. 
41:08
At the moment they died, there has to be a judgment. 
41:11
Does he have the right to go to them 
41:13
and say, do you want me now? 
41:15
Are there prayers that have been put forth 
41:17
for this person that he can use that key, 
41:20
whether it is as they're entering into hell, 
41:23
as they're being buried or at their moment of death. 
41:26
Those are time, those are like windows of time 
41:29
that he's allowed to use those keys, not years later, 
41:32
not months later, he can do that. 
41:34
But it's appointed unto man once to die 
41:36
and at that time, the judgment is made in heaven. 
41:40
Can Christ go to them? 
41:43
That's why it's important to never stop praying 
41:45
for your loved ones, those who are like your loved ones, 
41:48
that they will know Christ, 
41:49
that they will be in eternity with you, 
41:51
don't stop praying that. 
41:53
And Christ said to tell people when I came back, 
41:56
they will be surprised when they get there, 
41:57
some of them, even though they prayed for them, 
42:00
to find out that they actually did go there. 
42:02
And of course, he has to ask them, 
42:04
he doesn't just say, I'm here to take you, 
42:06
he must ask them, do you want to receive me now? 
42:09
And then they still have to repent and repent to him. 
42:12
There's a few, I don't know how many, 
42:15
but there's a few who said, no, I'm not wrong with you. 
42:17
And you would think they've become so insane 
42:19
that they just don't want anything to do with them 
42:21
and then that seals their. 
42:23
That seals the weather. 
42:24
So either, I think I asked you this about it 
42:26
because this was the thing when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, 
42:30
some people were declaring her already in hell suffering. 
42:33
And I didn't feel right to me, 
42:35
not that I claimed to know whether she was or not, 
42:38
but I know whole women's groups 
42:41
who stood for Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
42:42
for years and years and years. 
42:44
So God, by that, God would have obligated himself 
42:47
to give her one more chance. 
42:49
If everything you're saying is true, which I believe it is, 
42:51
he would have said, do you want me now? 
42:54
And I'm sure we probably did do that. 
42:57
And I can also say this that I personally know 
43:00
there's been a group of people for almost 60 years 
43:03
praying for celebrities in Hollywood to know Christ. 
43:07
Wow. 
43:08
They've been praying that they even, 
43:09
I even got one of the lists one times 
43:11
of all those that they were praying for. 
43:13
Some of them are still alive on the earth, 
43:15
but I have seen, I haven't had time 
43:17
to write a list down or anything, 
43:18
but I've seen a few of the celebrities in heaven 
43:21
because they did either at that moment of death 
43:24
or them knowing. 
43:25
Now, it was easier back in the day 
43:27
when people knew and believed there was a God 
43:29
and there wasn't heaven in hell. 
43:31
A lot of people would have at that last moment 
43:32
say, hey, I'm receiving Christ. 
43:34
They would have automatically done that, 
43:35
knowing where they would go. 
43:36
But in this world today, 
43:38
that's not even taught a lot in a lot of places. 
43:41
But I'm grateful to God that he did allow that window, 
43:46
those windows of time. 
43:48
And that's why Christ, 
43:49
one of the reasons why he had to die. 
43:52
And you know, people go, well, it was finished. 
43:54
It was finished on the cross for your sin. 
43:57
But he had to go back and take back our power 
44:00
and authority and dominion. 
44:02
He gave Adam and Adam gave it away to the devil. 
44:05
There had to be a way that somebody could enter 
44:07
into that realm and because they were righteous, 
44:09
had the right to take it back. 
44:11
And that is exactly why, 
44:13
one of the reasons why Christ didn't just go back 
44:15
to heaven the minute he died when he left his body. 
44:17
He asked his spirit to leave his body. 
44:20
It didn't go up to heaven at that time. 
44:22
And even when he comes out of the grave later 
44:24
and Mary sees him, he says, 
44:25
I have not been to the Father yet. 
44:28
So that clearly tells you he didn't go up to heaven 
44:31
when he died on the cross. 
44:32
He descended into paradise, 
44:34
which is where he counted people faithful 
44:37
because they believed in God himself. 
44:39
And when they died, they were taken to paradise, 
44:42
which is still sort of in the middle of the earth, 
44:44
but you can look down and down and across. 
44:46
You can see where the gates of hell are. 
44:48
These are spiritual places. 
44:49
You're not going to go down there and find the people. 
44:52
But it does talk about Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, 
44:54
and that Christ went and led captivity captive. 
44:58
That means he captivated them with his death 
45:00
and with his willingness. 
45:02
He went down there to share the gospel to them, number one. 
45:05
And then he went across on his own, 
45:07
which no one had ever done to show up at the gates of hell. 
45:10
So he could then on that day, 
45:13
when the Father made it known, 
45:15
it was time for him to stand up 
45:16
and the power of God shot through him. 
45:18
And he basically wiped up hell at that time 
45:21
before he went up and got his body back. 
45:24
Awesome. 
45:25
All right, this is probably a quick answer, 
45:27
almost a yes or no kind of. 
45:28
Mary is asking, do you by any chance know 
45:30
if Vincent Van Gogh is in heaven? 
45:33
I don't know. 
45:34
I haven't, I don't know. 
45:35
I haven't seen him. 
45:36
Yeah. 
45:37
I know that we get lots of questions that it's not like 
45:38
God takes you all over to heaven 
45:40
and shows you 2,300 people. 
45:42
No. 
45:43
Yeah. 
45:44
So, okay, Simon asks, 
45:47
it's humanly possible to speak something into, 
45:50
oh, I guess. 
45:54
Oh, okay. 
45:55
This is a statement on a question at first. 
45:57
It's humanly possible to speak something into existence 
46:00
as we are made in the image of God. 
46:02
Success coaches call it manifesting 
46:05
and meaning the secular world 
46:06
do it to create a life they love. 
46:08
What does the Father think of this? 
46:10
And can we as believers use this gift 
46:13
in a similar way, 
46:14
or does he want us to do things different? 
46:16
So what, how? 
46:19
Well, there are some things that people 
46:21
in the secular world kind of understand. 
46:24
They're not sure exactly how that kind of thing operates, 
46:28
but I'm telling you the manifested sons and daughters 
46:31
of God are mentioned in the Bible itself. 
46:34
It says the earth is crying out and is in travail. 
46:37
So a lot of the stuff going on in the earth right now 
46:40
isn't saying the end is here to get out. 
46:42
It's the earth saying, okay, 
46:44
manifest sons are a stand up and start speaking 
46:47
of the power of God and the life of God 
46:49
into this world that needs it. 
46:51
So things can change at different times on the earth 
46:54
when we do that. 
46:55
I mean, it's gonna happen. 
46:57
That's one of the reasons why Jesus isn't coming 
46:59
to take people away in an escape plan, okay? 
47:03
He's coming to set us on fire with baptism and fire 
47:06
to let us allow us to carry the glory of God 
47:08
and release it all over the earth. 
47:10
This is the knowledge of the glory 
47:11
and the understanding of the glory of God 
47:12
will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea. 
47:15
That's us taking it and shock waves of that 
47:18
will go through the earth and things will happen immediately. 
47:21
There's too many things left that we have to do 
47:23
that the Bible says we will do, 
47:25
but a manifest and son and daughter to God is that, 
47:28
that this talked about in the word. 
47:30
It's us going to higher levels, believing in God 
47:34
and knowing him, understanding what he wants done 
47:37
and knowing that we are allowed to do these things 
47:39
because it was given to us by Christ to do these certain things. 
47:42
So I don't know about what they're doing 
47:44
or what a man themselves are doing. 
47:46
I do know people do get what the ideas do come from heaven 
47:50
and many of those are just taken to the earth 
47:52
and they go around there to drop into the mind of man 
47:55
so that certain things can and will be created. 
47:58
But as far as that statement, I'm not sure probably. 
48:01
Well, and you know, there's just me guessing what he means, 
48:04
but could he mean, I think as Job, 
48:09
it says he decreed a thing and it was so, 
48:12
you believe probably and I mean, 
48:14
do you, have you seen the father talk to the father 
48:17
about our responsibility to decree things on this earth? 
48:22
We send the host, but what about decree? 
48:24
I decree God's best and life for me and for my family. 
48:30
I decree that, you know, what about that? 
48:32
It's similar to sounding than what he's saying. 
48:35
Can we be clarifying? 
48:36
I think that what he's talking about 
48:38
is making things happen. 
48:40
Oh yes, some things actually will be formed. 
48:43
I mean, there'll be a point where we go and speak 
48:45
to the desert and command vegetation to come up. 
48:49
And it will. 
48:50
Okay, well. 
48:51
Now we don't want that thing. 
48:51
Yes, that is gonna happen. 
48:53
It will, we will speak to the land to see in the air 
48:55
and things will happen immediately 
48:58
because we have to manifest. 
49:00
One of the things God wants done is we have to manifest 
49:03
the presence and the power and the existence 
49:06
of Jesus Christ. 
49:08
And of course, the father and Holy spirit, 
49:10
that's going to happen and it is up to us. 
49:13
One of our assignments is to do that. 
49:16
In different times on the earth, 
49:17
there are always things given to man, 
49:19
especially those who believe in God, 
49:21
that things would happen, things would change, 
49:23
things would be built. 
49:25
We're in a transition right now, 
49:27
a very powerful transition of things like that, 
49:30
beginning to happen. 
49:31
But I have been seen and taken and shown that the mass 
49:36
that died, there'll be, I've already been shown, 
49:38
there'll be a mass death in a land, not here, 
49:42
it wasn't here, not knowing exactly what the land was 
49:47
that they were spoken to. 
49:48
All these bodies were laying there 
49:50
and they spoke life of God into them. 
49:52
And everyone in that whole bunch came to life. 
49:54
Oh, wow. 
49:55
Those kind of things are going to happen, Steve. 
49:57
They have to happen because manifest means to clearly 
50:01
and plainly make known who you believe in and who you serve. 
50:08
And that is why it's called a manifested son and daughter 
50:11
of God. 
50:12
It's not going to be everybody in the body that does it, 
50:15
but there'll be those who choose it, 
50:16
no matter what he wants or when he wants it, 
50:19
you're going to say yes to it and you continually obey. 
50:23
And if you keep obeying, you could do a point in your life 
50:26
where you learn the joy of obedience. 
50:29
And from that time, he doesn't no longer judge you 
50:33
on whether you did something or didn't do something 
50:35
because it's already in you and a part of you, 
50:37
then he will give things to you because of your love, 
50:42
is your love extravagant, are you helping others? 
50:44
It's, there's a whole process to being 
50:46
in the manifested son and daughter, 
50:48
but if the earth itself is crying out for it to happen, 
50:51
it's going to happen, it's going to happen. 
50:54
There'll be people do things like raise the dead 
50:56
that was cremated. 
50:57
That's the manifested son or daughter of God 
50:59
speaking to the earthquake in the middle of the earthquake 
51:02
and telling it has to go back and the dead will be raised. 
51:04
It's going to happen. 
51:06
So those things you're learning about, 
51:08
the clearing and decreeing, yes. 
51:10
It's powerful, it's not ruling. 
51:13
At the death of Christ, the earthquake and the graves 
51:16
were open and some saints were seen walking around. 
51:19
We don't know how many it doesn't say how many. 
51:21
Maybe there's a thousand, maybe there's 26. 
51:23
I don't know, maybe there's 20,000, 
51:26
but whatever that number was, 
51:29
will we see something like that on the earth 
51:32
before it's all finished, on a sinful earth? 
51:36
I'll just put it that way. 
51:37
We'll see that. 
51:39
Okay, go ahead. 
51:40
I don't know if that is what will be happening 
51:43
soon as the sons and daughters. 
51:46
I think when there's like, I don't know. 
51:48
I don't know how these people died. 
51:50
There were like thousands of them. 
51:51
Really? Wow. 
51:53
I don't know where it was. 
51:54
The young purpose probably didn't tell me where it was, 
51:56
but I was taken into the future before 2030. 
52:03
This will happen. 
52:04
This will happen before 2030. 
52:05
Before 2030, it will happen. 
52:07
And none of the bodies look like nobody was like blown up 
52:11
or none of that. 
52:11
I mean, I could clearly see the bodies. 
52:13
I was walking down this road. 
52:14
It was like a dirt road, 
52:17
like a sandy kind of a dirt road. 
52:19
And we rode in the Jeep. 
52:20
I actually was riding in the back of the Jeep. 
52:22
And I would probably assume I was there to raise the debt. 
52:25
Wow. 
52:27
And it just didn't look like it had been, 
52:30
just like it had been a recent death. 
52:32
Like it had just kind of happened. 
52:34
Okay. 
52:34
I haven't really explained this much to many people, 
52:36
but yes, this is like a whole town somewhere. 
52:39
Wow, okay. 
52:40
And the people were just all they had time to do. 
52:43
And they obviously knew that was gonna happen. 
52:45
Whoever was driving knew I was there for that. 
52:49
Oh, really? 
52:50
You will do this. 
52:50
He actually said, you will do this. 
52:53
But not just me. 
52:54
Other manifested sons and daughters will do. 
52:56
It's going to happen. 
52:57
See, it has to happen. 
52:59
If God said, can these dry bones live? 
53:02
And he said that as an example, 
53:05
you know, to the prophets that could these dry bones live? 
53:07
And finally he said, guys, he said, well, you know only, 
53:09
you know that, but they did come to life in front of him. 
53:12
And all that, I mean, everything that sent you, 
53:14
everything came back. 
53:15
And now those, those were really dead bones. 
53:17
Well, yeah. 
53:18
That's all we're not like that. 
53:20
You couldn't tell anything had happened. 
53:21
Like they weren't shot. 
53:22
They weren't bombed. 
53:23
Okay. 
53:24
Anything like that. 
53:25
But they only had time to wrap them. 
53:27
And they had just wrapped them on. 
53:29
They were just stacked. 
53:30
And I knew that that's what he had me there for. 
53:33
So I will say, I know that's going to happen. 
53:35
The only shows me reality. 
53:38
He doesn't show me symbolism. 
53:42
Yeah. 
53:43
Yes, literally. 
53:44
What will happen. 
53:44
And that really, actually, honestly, 
53:46
that's pretty close to the exact answer I was looking for. 
53:49
I don't think it had to be in my mind, 
53:52
people shaking earthquakes and the dead coming out. 
53:55
And more like, will there be groups of people 
53:58
is what I was asking that will suddenly be raised from it. 
54:01
I suppose there could have been, 
54:03
therefore on another time, 
54:05
a 9-11 type thing where 3,000 perished 
54:08
and someone manifested sense might be clear, 
54:11
something like that. 
54:13
Resurrections. 
54:14
And it's kind of like that that you're describing, honestly. 
54:16
I'm quite positive that that is why. 
54:20
One of the reasons why it is not the end. 
54:23
Because we are entering into a supernatural time 
54:26
where things will happen that nobody ever expects. 
54:29
The God would have already prepared the heart of these people. 
54:32
And they would have already been going towards 
54:35
total surrender of their life. 
54:37
I'm not talking about being born again. 
54:39
You're already, these people are going to be born again. 
54:42
But then getting to the place where, 
54:43
wherever you want to send me, wherever you want to take me, 
54:45
I'm giving you permission. 
54:47
You need to do it ahead of time, people. 
54:48
And then you stay in that place with him 
54:51
and build that relationship with him. 
54:52
He wants you to know him. 
54:54
I'm talking about Christ. 
54:55
He wants you to know him. 
54:56
But these things are clearly going to happen. 
54:59
The Bible talked about them happening. 
55:01
And that is why the earth is saying, 
55:03
okay, things are getting really bad. 
55:05
You need to stand up and start taking authority 
55:08
because Christ said himself, 
55:10
you will rule with me in this life. 
55:13
That's not just a statement. 
55:15
He wasn't just making a statement. 
55:16
He was talking about things that will happen. 
55:18
Ruling and reigning is dominion and authority 
55:22
at great levels. 
55:23
That's why he says, 
55:24
know you not that you are kings and priests unto your God. 
55:28
Those are spiritual levels of authority and dominion 
55:31
that some will walk in. 
55:33
They're going to walk in that. 
55:34
And they will speak and the waters will part 
55:37
and people will walk across. 
55:39
They will speak and literally speak to the ground 
55:43
and say, come forth life of vegetation 
55:45
and you'll see before your eyes come up. 
55:47
It's going to happen. 
55:50
Good, good, good, good. 
55:51
All right, Teresa is asking this question. 
55:54
What does the fear of God mean? 
55:56
Are we supposed to be afraid of God? 
55:58
No, that's not what that means. 
55:59
Okay. 
56:01
I do know what that means. 
56:03
That means you love him so much. 
56:05
You would never do anything to disappoint him, 
56:10
to hurt him or to make him look like not God. 
56:15
It's a reverential fear you have 
56:19
that you would never want to do something in your life 
56:21
to cause any distance between you and him, 
56:25
although that would probably be on your side, 
56:27
that you do something so wrong 
56:28
that you wouldn't have a relationship with him anymore. 
56:31
The fear of the Lord, 
56:32
there is something called the terror of God. 
56:35
Oh, man. 
56:37
That is for the wicked. 
56:38
Yeah. 
56:39
I think we'll be seeing some of that soon. 
56:42
And let me jump off on that for a moment. 
56:45
You've talked about, of course, we send the host, 
56:48
talk about or remind me what you said about, 
56:50
can we send the terror of God against God's enemies? 
56:55
It seems like you said, 
56:56
you don't speak against people or cursed people, 
57:00
but can you send the, 
57:01
it seems like you said, 
57:02
you can't send the terror of God against his enemies. 
57:05
Tell me what, 
57:07
if you remind me what that was. 
57:08
God had purposed us to, this is the thing. 
57:10
We were given this earth. 
57:12
I know it belongs to the Lord. 
57:14
So guess what? 
57:15
Satan doesn't get it. 
57:16
He don't give a mud that belongs to him. 
57:19
It isn't his. 
57:20
It clearly says the earth is the Lord's 
57:23
and the fullness of what it will produce, 
57:26
what we're going on. 
57:27
It's his. 
57:28
This is his earth and he made this earth 
57:32
and he made it for a purpose. 
57:33
So we could be born, sent from the Father 
57:36
at the time of conception and knit together. 
57:39
And it says in the Bible, 
57:40
God said, I knit you together in your mother's womb. 
57:43
He's talking about your little spirit man 
57:45
that lived inside the Father. 
57:47
That at the time of conception, 
57:49
it's knit together and attached to that daughter flesh 
57:52
and it grows within the mother's womb. 
57:53
So life begins at conception, not at birth. 
57:57
And so that's one thing I can just add for free. 
58:01
The Father is furious with those trying to kill the babies, 
58:06
take away their destiny. 
58:07
He had a purpose for everyone he sent. 
58:10
He's not gonna long tolerate that happening. 
58:13
There will come a time on the earth 
58:15
where it will be against the law, 
58:16
literally against the law in these years ahead, 
58:20
these generations ahead of demonstrating 
58:23
the power and authority of Jesus Christ, 
58:25
his dominion, what he wants, speaking his words 
58:27
and that happening right away, 
58:29
that's what we're going into now. 
58:31
Darkness will be crushed and pushed back 
58:33
and they won't even be allowed in some cities 
58:35
because of the power and the glory of God 
58:37
in some of those cities. 
58:38
But I can tell you right now, 
58:40
the terror of God usually is set from heaven 
58:44
and it does affect and impact physical wicked people. 
58:50
They can become so filled with terror, 
58:52
knowing the awe of God is affecting them. 
58:56
Some of them will probably run to get saved. 
58:58
Someone even wanna live because it's so powerful 
59:01
but God, it gets to a place. 
59:03
And you saw earlier in the, 
59:05
even the world when the world was made, 
59:07
there came a time when he would not tolerate things 
59:09
and he finally did something. 
59:10
He not finally, he did something about it at that time. 
59:13
But that is going about to happen in our lives. 
59:16
And you're living in a powerful time 
59:18
because no matter how much darkness is there, 
59:19
you're about to see that darkness severed 
59:22
and you're about to see a crushed pushback, 
59:24
judgment, serious judgment come to the wicked, 
59:27
the physical flesh wicked who've all come together 
59:31
to do this thing, to try to take our lives away, 
59:34
freedom away everywhere, they're not gonna get to do it. 
59:37
It's not the little drop of time Satan has 
59:40
and the tribulation is a very small part of time 
59:43
and it's not that time. 
59:44
There's too much that has to happen yet. 
59:46
So I'm gonna say the terror of God is usually set. 
59:50
It was sent at one time for Israel 
59:53
when Egypt had stuff going on, 
59:55
terror came upon people even back then. 
59:57
And it does happen, but usually the terror of God, 
01:00:02
I had a prophet walk up to me one time. 
01:00:04
I was one person in the church who always was on the floor. 
01:00:07
You know, I was so wiped out by God that I couldn't move. 
01:00:11
And I was sitting up in a prophet game, 
01:00:12
I'm playing it and he said, 
01:00:14
the terror of God is gonna be released on the surface 
01:00:16
and you'll be able to tell the people what to do about it. 
01:00:19
Oh wow. 
01:00:20
Which was a rare thing. 
01:00:21
Yeah. 
01:00:22
So I'm just telling people right now, don't be wicked. 
01:00:25
Don't be a part, don't participate, don't tolerate them, 
01:00:29
don't advertise, stop advertising 
01:00:31
about how wicked things are going on 
01:00:32
and start talking about the power and the life of God 
01:00:35
that is much greater than all the evil that's going on. 
01:00:38
And this evil is a temporary thing, 
01:00:40
so they can be judged. 
01:00:43
They're gonna be judged by God. 
01:00:45
I'm talking about the flesh people 
01:00:47
are gonna be judged by God 
01:00:48
and they will not escape that judgment, 
01:00:50
but the terror of God will probably come 
01:00:52
a little while before that. 
01:00:54
And people, what happens is you can't think straight. 
01:00:56
This is for the wicked. 
01:00:58
Your mind will be lost. 
01:01:00
You'll be so severely confused. 
01:01:02
You won't know how to even think normally 
01:01:05
because you'll be so terrified 
01:01:06
by God's presence moving across the earth 
01:01:09
and it is going to happen. 
01:01:11
It will not hurt us, it won't affect us 
01:01:14
in that way that belonged to him. 
01:01:15
But I'm telling you, there's about to be some demonstrations 
01:01:18
that no human hands will demonstrate at this time. 
01:01:22
It will be God himself. 
01:01:24
Good, good, good. 
01:01:26
All right, Frederick asks this, 
01:01:28
what will Michael and the host, 
01:01:31
which of course is the armies of heaven, 
01:01:33
what will Michael and the host do 
01:01:35
after the thousand year reign of Christ 
01:01:36
since all evil is God? 
01:01:38
So a lot of people have that question. 
01:01:40
What do you need an army for after it's all sin free? 
01:01:45
Well, they're not quite right. 
01:01:48
Okay. 
01:01:49
There will be a battle that will happen 
01:01:52
at the end of the thousand year reign. 
01:01:54
It clearly talks about it. 
01:01:55
It's the final battle. 
01:01:57
Okay. 
01:01:58
And Michael and the host and the father, 
01:02:02
the father will send fire and burn up all the wicked 
01:02:07
on the earth at that time 
01:02:08
who come up against his son 
01:02:11
after the thousand year reign, you have to remember, 
01:02:13
there is a thousand year reign, 
01:02:15
but there's a time period after that. 
01:02:17
At the end of the thousand years, 
01:02:19
it will be loose from the bottom of the steps 
01:02:21
that he can go around the world and tempt those 
01:02:24
who probably still don't want Christ. 
01:02:26
There'll be people alive. 
01:02:27
There will be seven, eight, 900 years old. 
01:02:29
It's just going to happen 
01:02:30
because of Christ's presence on the earth. 
01:02:33
So even after the thousand year reign, 
01:02:34
there's still another season of time. 
01:02:36
The Satan will go around, 
01:02:38
try to get people to come on his side 
01:02:40
and he's going to find them. 
01:02:41
And they'll want to do a big battle. 
01:02:43
It talks about the battle. 
01:02:44
They're going to have great armies come across 
01:02:46
a certain area on the earth to destroy Christ, 
01:02:49
to take the throne away from him 
01:02:50
because Satan is still stupid 
01:02:52
and he still hasn't learned that he's not going to win. 
01:02:54
And at this time, the father will himself defend his son. 
01:02:59
Christ will not have to lift a finger 
01:03:02
because in the battle prior to that, 
01:03:04
before the thousand year reign, 
01:03:06
at the end of the tribulation, 
01:03:08
Christ will be doing something 
01:03:10
about those coming to fight and war. 
01:03:12
And a lot of people that are wicked 
01:03:15
they will die at that time. 
01:03:17
But even during the millennial reign, 
01:03:18
there will be people on the earth 
01:03:20
who didn't choose Christ, 
01:03:22
who's still alive, natural man, 
01:03:24
and they will live for hundreds of years 
01:03:26
under Christ's rulership. 
01:03:28
But at the end of that thousand year reign, 
01:03:30
Satan will be lose to tempt those 
01:03:32
to see if he can get anybody to side with him, 
01:03:35
to build war, warring equipment 
01:03:38
and do these things to remove Christ from that throne. 
01:03:40
And I tell you in that battle, 
01:03:42
there will be no decision about anybody 
01:03:46
about who's going to win. 
01:03:47
The father will send fire from him, 
01:03:48
the clitoris says, and burn up all those armies. 
01:03:50
Wow. 
01:03:51
And then, Kat, okay, after that, 
01:03:53
after the final battle, 
01:03:55
then what happens to the armies of heaven? 
01:03:57
If you know, you may not even know. 
01:03:59
I'm quite sure that they will probably get to know 
01:04:01
a lot of people that they defended on the earth. 
01:04:04
They'll be speaking a lot of places on the new earth to them 
01:04:09
and I'm quite sure they'll probably be part of, 
01:04:11
I know that there will be people 
01:04:13
that will actually be taken to a planet 
01:04:15
to make things like vegetation and places, 
01:04:19
not people, that's never gonna happen again. 
01:04:21
They won't have to make people. 
01:04:22
But I'm sure that that army will be involved 
01:04:24
with going with them to make sure everything goes okay 
01:04:26
with them, not that it wouldn't. 
01:04:28
It wouldn't be to protect. 
01:04:29
Yeah. 
01:04:30
Because we won't need protection at that time. 
01:04:32
When all that's done evil will be judged. 
01:04:34
There will be no evil on the earth, 
01:04:36
no evil in the spirit realm. 
01:04:38
And all of that will be in the lake of fire. 
01:04:41
So I'm quite sure that they have plans 
01:04:43
of things that they would like to do 
01:04:45
and get to do things besides warring 
01:04:47
because that's all they do right now. 
01:04:49
Okay, awesome. 
01:04:50
Now, Shay is the name of this person, 
01:04:53
says I'm a Christian ventriloquist. 
01:04:55
Have you seen ventriloquists using their gift in heaven? 
01:04:59
I'm quite sure that people probably do that. 
01:05:02
I don't know, I don't think I've personally seen that happen. 
01:05:05
But I do know that gifts like natural gifts 
01:05:08
that people have and that is a gift. 
01:05:10
I've known a couple of people that did it. 
01:05:11
It was amazing. 
01:05:12
They do actually do it. 
01:05:13
It's not, none of my magic people, it's not magic. 
01:05:17
It's the skill they have and they've gotten very good at it. 
01:05:20
And so I'm quite sure that that would probably be in heaven. 
01:05:23
Okay. 
01:05:24
It's the skill it's a gift. 
01:05:25
Okay, now Margaret's asking this question. 
01:05:28
I get some of it, I'm not sure I fully understand. 
01:05:31
Margaret says in heaven, 
01:05:33
will we be able to trace our spiritual line of salvation 
01:05:37
back to Jesus' meaning similar to how family trees 
01:05:41
are traced backwards like so-and-so and so-and-so. 
01:05:45
So-and-so led so-and-so to Jesus. 
01:05:47
Then that person led another and then another. 
01:05:50
So they wanted to know like, 
01:05:51
if we could go back find out who was led to the Lord, 
01:05:55
I guess a thousand years ago that ended up with me 
01:05:59
or 2,000 years ago, if we're back to Christ. 
01:06:01
I'm quite certain that you will be able to do that 
01:06:03
because I know generations are God's deals 
01:06:06
and generations, he just does. 
01:06:08
That's why it's not gonna end. 
01:06:10
Now this generation is still coming on you 
01:06:12
is that things will have to happen through them 
01:06:14
or with them. 
01:06:15
And I'm quite sure there's a way you can trace that 
01:06:17
when you get to heaven. 
01:06:19
Okay. 
01:06:19
Now we're doing a good thing. 
01:06:20
And we're Margaret, we're doing a lot of questions today. 
01:06:22
Elizabeth asked, will we still be able to have our ears 
01:06:26
pierced in heaven? 
01:06:27
I really like mine and it's really the only jewelry I wear. 
01:06:30
Okay. 
01:06:32
I think that's gonna be between you and God. 
01:06:34
I do know that there are things, 
01:06:36
I know people will have marks put on them. 
01:06:39
I don't think I've ever seen that. 
01:06:41
That doesn't mean that's not gonna be allowed 
01:06:43
if it's done with the realm of God, you know? 
01:06:46
You probably wouldn't have to actually pierce it. 
01:06:48
You probably wouldn't have to have something pierce your ear 
01:06:51
to do that is what I'm saying. 
01:06:52
Just do it. 
01:06:54
You would have a way just to put things on yourself 
01:06:56
or anywhere, wherever, without it being pierced 
01:06:59
because you'd be supernatural. 
01:07:01
It's not like on the earth where food comes from. 
01:07:03
In other words, he's not subject. 
01:07:05
He doesn't have to have either piercings or clip-ons. 
01:07:08
He could say, put it there and tell it to stay, right? 
01:07:11
I mean. 
01:07:12
I'm quite sure he probably could 
01:07:13
because I've seen people's, 
01:07:16
everybody's mansion has a wardrobe room. 
01:07:20
There's probably thousands of square feet. 
01:07:22
I've seen it. 
01:07:23
I've been, I've walked through some of those like that 
01:07:25
and the apparel you get is unspeakable. 
01:07:28
It's just not even something I can describe. 
01:07:32
Even your clothes are like alive. 
01:07:35
There's only one size made in heaven 
01:07:37
and whoever puts it on it conforms to the size of your body. 
01:07:40
So you don't have to shop through racks of clothes for things. 
01:07:43
You just pick out what you like 
01:07:44
and it fits you when you put it on. 
01:07:46
I do know that much. 
01:07:47
Speaking of clothes, this was one of mine 
01:07:49
that I could keep meaning to ask you. 
01:07:52
Every picture of God and Jesus 
01:07:55
is always a big old long robe, white usually. 
01:07:58
Maybe there's other colors. 
01:08:00
Have you ever seen anything like the father 
01:08:03
or Jesus wearing jeans or jeans like? 
01:08:07
I'm just curious if you've seen something like that. 
01:08:09
I have seen Jesus. 
01:08:11
You have? 
01:08:12
I've seen, I've not seen the father where, 
01:08:14
I'm sure if he wanted to, he could wear whatever 
01:08:17
he wanted to wear, but normally I see him 
01:08:19
in the most glorious, their gowns. 
01:08:22
Not like a, of course a woman's gown. 
01:08:23
You know, it's just like a ship kind of thing. 
01:08:25
Glorious beyond description. 
01:08:27
And he has many different robes 
01:08:29
that he wears at different times. 
01:08:30
And then maybe that will change. 
01:08:32
He may wear other stuff. 
01:08:33
I don't know on the new earth, but. 
01:08:35
But did you say you've seen Jesus wear jeans? 
01:08:38
I have seen it. 
01:08:39
There's jeans in heaven. 
01:08:40
Awesome. I like that. 
01:08:42
There are heavens brand, trust me. 
01:08:44
They have heavens brand. 
01:08:45
They have them. 
01:08:47
You don't buy them. 
01:08:48
You just can go get them anywhere. 
01:08:49
I like that. 
01:08:50
That's very cool. 
01:08:51
Because you ride horses, Steve. 
01:08:52
You can't ride horses in a gown. 
01:08:53
That's right. 
01:08:54
Oh, I like that. 
01:08:55
I'm going to ride horses too. 
01:08:56
You're not riding the rush in the gown. 
01:08:57
You're not going to swim under the crystal sea in a gown. 
01:09:00
You actually have things to use to do that with. 
01:09:03
So, but I have seen Christ attending rodeos 
01:09:07
because he loves horses. 
01:09:08
I think he's always for the horse, though, not the ride. 
01:09:12
I think he's probably there to cheer the horse out. 
01:09:14
I'm real serious about that. 
01:09:15
Yeah. That's very good. 
01:09:16
All right. 
01:09:18
Why did David Joyce ask, 
01:09:19
why did David pick up five stones and only use one? 
01:09:23
What do the other four stones represent? 
01:09:25
Do they represent our authority and power for us 
01:09:28
to use against principalities, powers, rulers, 
01:09:30
or darkness and spiritual wickedness? 
01:09:32
I mean, they're guessing, I guess. 
01:09:34
What do you know, the four represents something else? 
01:09:37
I don't know that, but as you know, 
01:09:39
this David was very wise. 
01:09:41
Yeah. 
01:09:42
And David would get as many as he thought he might need. 
01:09:45
He's never going to just take a thing. 
01:09:47
He's going to take more than one. 
01:09:49
He should something else show up or something else happen. 
01:09:53
He might need it for that other thing. 
01:09:54
He didn't know. 
01:09:55
And so, but I'm sure there was a reason 
01:09:57
why he chose that money. 
01:09:58
So you'd have extra if he needed it. 
01:10:00
Someone said he had four brothers. 
01:10:02
Yes. 
01:10:03
Someone said he had four brothers. 
01:10:05
I don't know if I've never studied that, 
01:10:07
but if he really had four brothers, 
01:10:09
and that was just in case he needed to take out the brothers, 
01:10:11
but I have heard that he had four brothers. 
01:10:14
So I think it might be the, all right. 
01:10:17
Suzanne asks. 
01:10:18
I'm sure Goliath had others around him. 
01:10:20
I know he wasn't the only giant in the land. 
01:10:22
I think it was before if they showed up, 
01:10:24
I don't think it was about his brothers. 
01:10:26
I think if the other one showed up, the giants, 
01:10:29
if more guys could take them all out. 
01:10:31
That'd be awesome. 
01:10:32
All right, Suzanne asks. 
01:10:33
If Cap could take a picture of anything in heaven, 
01:10:37
it could be a person, place or thing 
01:10:39
and show it on the Elijah list. 
01:10:40
So that's a thought question. 
01:10:42
What would it be? 
01:10:43
What would you love to take a picture of 
01:10:45
and show it if you could? 
01:10:48
There's too many things. 
01:10:49
Come up photographer. 
01:10:51
You're asking a photographer. 
01:10:52
Yeah. 
01:10:53
There's so many good things. 
01:10:54
I want to, when I go to heaven one day, 
01:10:57
I will be photographing all of heaven 
01:10:59
just because I want to do that. 
01:11:00
But I think the most significant, moving, powerful, 
01:11:05
beautiful would be the throne, the throne room. 
01:11:09
Yeah. 
01:11:10
Oh, I love to see that. 
01:11:11
I can sketch the throne room 
01:11:12
and at one point I will paint myself the throne room. 
01:11:16
One of the promises God gave me was that I will, 
01:11:18
he will make me a fine artist. 
01:11:20
Oh, wow. 
01:11:21
I don't know how far down my journey 
01:11:23
I have no end to my journey. 
01:11:24
He's not told me any end while I'm on the earth. 
01:11:27
He will let me paint heaven 
01:11:30
and it will come alive when people look at it. 
01:11:32
And that's on this earth before things wrap up. 
01:11:36
See, now that's kind of one of the questions, 
01:11:38
type of questions I've tried to get an answer for is like, 
01:11:42
what if I want to be doing something? 
01:11:44
I often think of it as in heaven, 
01:11:46
but there are certain things that I've been asking him 
01:11:49
privately to do on this earth 
01:11:51
that I was talking with him about today. 
01:11:52
I'm not going to say it here, 
01:11:53
but I'm saying, Lauren, I'm not going to keep asking, 
01:11:55
I'm not going to quit asking you to do this on this earth. 
01:11:59
And so you kind of answered that, Kat, honestly. 
01:12:02
He told me because I was willing to do whatever he wanted 
01:12:05
whenever he wanted and I can tell you all, 
01:12:08
if you had stood before the throne of the living God, 
01:12:11
you would know how real he is. 
01:12:15
Just because you can't see him doesn't mean he's not real. 
01:12:18
He's very real. 
01:12:19
He has great plans. 
01:12:20
He plans well in advance. 
01:12:22
He knows what is in time and eternity, 
01:12:24
but he also sees his own plans coming to pass. 
01:12:27
That's why it's not over right now. 
01:12:29
Nothing is over, except how awesome we will be living 
01:12:33
with the body of Christ. 
01:12:34
If you can't, let me expand it. 
01:12:37
So outside the throne room with Jesus himself, 
01:12:40
if you could snap one picture of Jesus doing something 
01:12:45
outside of the throne room, 
01:12:46
what would you take a picture of him doing? 
01:12:49
Probably something he really loves to do. 
01:12:52
Probably maybe him in the gardens. 
01:12:54
He's got the most amazing gardens all over his own. 
01:12:57
He does have a mansion of his own. 
01:12:59
It's glorious. 
01:13:01
He uses it to have celebrations in. 
01:13:03
So when somebody comes home to heaven, 
01:13:04
he can throw a big celebration. 
01:13:06
Besides the throne room celebration, 
01:13:08
he'll take them there. 
01:13:09
I think also probably I've seen him with the children. 
01:13:13
I've seen him with the little babies. 
01:13:15
That would probably be something else. 
01:13:17
I would definitely want to take a picture of 
01:13:19
when he's with the little babies. 
01:13:20
Maybe they were aborted. 
01:13:21
Maybe they had become miscarried. 
01:13:24
How much he loves them. 
01:13:25
And he holds them in his hand and talks to me like that. 
01:13:29
I think probably something like that 
01:13:30
showing that he has a heart. 
01:13:33
He does. 
01:13:34
He's all powerful. 
01:13:35
He now is our king. 
01:13:36
And he says that to me all the time. 
01:13:37
When I come back, it'll be as a king. 
01:13:41
Because he already came as savior. 
01:13:42
When he comes back, it'll be as a king. 
01:13:45
Awesome, awesome. 
01:13:46
By the way, while I'm talking, 
01:13:48
put that, if the team could put up the website 
01:13:53
for people to ask more questions of Kat, 
01:13:55
we're going through them really fast right now on purpose. 
01:13:58
Questions for Kat, fill out the form and go to, 
01:14:00
they're going to put questions for kat.com, 
01:14:03
which I don't see up there right now, 
01:14:04
but I think it's going to be there in a second. 
01:14:06
All right, this is the middle of my time. 
01:14:09
We can ask a couple of quick questions here. 
01:14:12
Virginia asks, is there a place in heaven 
01:14:14
where we can watch a replay or a replays 
01:14:17
of our loved ones' reactions to their homecoming 
01:14:20
and see the joy that they experienced 
01:14:21
when they first reunited with the father 
01:14:24
and the ones who had gone on before them? 
01:14:25
That would be a cool thing. 
01:14:26
They say, what did it look like when my dad showed up? 
01:14:29
I would love, can you see anything like that? 
01:14:31
Yes, absolutely, I have seen that. 
01:14:33
And people love to do that. 
01:14:36
They have this, a place where they have many different, 
01:14:41
I call them mini theaters, 
01:14:43
and they probably maybe hold a hundred people. 
01:14:45
That's a small one, 
01:14:46
because I have been to the movie theaters, 
01:14:48
which of course is no profanity, 
01:14:50
just so you know, you can't start judging. 
01:14:52
They make movies in heaven people. 
01:14:53
Guy has always told stories. 
01:14:55
He loves to tell stories. 
01:14:57
The best movie theaters are in heaven. 
01:14:59
You're playing to be there. 
01:15:00
You better receive Jesus Christ. 
01:15:02
They capture what's being made in heaven. 
01:15:05
It's not like a film, you have to process it. 
01:15:07
But there's places you can go into. 
01:15:09
You can go into your parents' theater. 
01:15:11
They have one that shows their life really, 
01:15:15
minus any sin. 
01:15:17
No sin is shown at all, 
01:15:19
because they've already been forgiven. 
01:15:20
The great days in their life, 
01:15:22
fun times in their life, really funny times. 
01:15:25
But in that theater, 
01:15:27
towards the end of that show that you're watching, 
01:15:32
you will literally see how they were caught up to heaven. 
01:15:35
Were they taken in a chariot? 
01:15:37
Did they go in something else? 
01:15:39
What did they say? 
01:15:40
What did they see when they got out of the, 
01:15:42
there's a place you disembarked. 
01:15:43
Oh man. 
01:15:44
These things that bring you what the expression was, 
01:15:47
what they were feeling, what they were saying. 
01:15:50
And then you could go in the throne room 
01:15:51
and see their whole celebration party. 
01:15:53
Then you could see them go to their mansion that was given. 
01:15:56
God doesn't let you miss anything. 
01:15:58
You're not going to miss anything. 
01:16:00
That's good. 
01:16:01
That's really good. 
01:16:02
You know what? 
01:16:03
Then this before when we talked about the theaters down, 
01:16:05
I'm thinking, man, the popcorn's going to be so good. 
01:16:08
Oh, we do have food. 
01:16:10
Oh my goodness. 
01:16:11
Like, they wouldn't give you, they loved to eat in heaven. 
01:16:15
Oh yeah. 
01:16:16
Absolutely. 
01:16:18
I think in my first book, 
01:16:19
I described the movie theater I was taken to. 
01:16:21
Isn't that? 
01:16:22
Well, that was actually the first time I was taken. 
01:16:24
Yeah. 
01:16:25
In Christ that I was taken to somewhere fun. 
01:16:28
He said, I'm taking you somewhere fun. 
01:16:30
He said, you were so serious about everything in your life. 
01:16:33
You need to understand that we're fun. 
01:16:35
We do have fun. 
01:16:36
So I'm taking you to a fun place. 
01:16:37
And it was a movie theater in heaven. 
01:16:39
And that's when I saw John Wayne acting in a movie. 
01:16:43
And they do have popcorn and they do have snacks. 
01:16:46
And then they have another place outside within the theater 
01:16:49
where you could sit there and discuss what you saw, 
01:16:51
how excited you were. 
01:16:53
The actors who were in are right there to talk to you. 
01:16:55
Usually your family members get to start films too. 
01:16:58
Again, nothing defiling is in there. 
01:17:00
There's no profanity. 
01:17:02
And that's when God also told me, 
01:17:03
I'm going to give you what we think 
01:17:04
about the movie ratings. 
01:17:07
And he said, God said, you know how they rate movies? 
01:17:10
Yeah, yeah. 
01:17:11
You know, rubber, 17 and then R. 
01:17:17
He said, this is what we say those ratings mean. 
01:17:20
G means good, you know, depending on what the movie is about. 
01:17:25
We wouldn't say it was good if it was witchcraft. 
01:17:26
I can tell you that. 
01:17:27
But G means good in heaven. 
01:17:29
PG means partly good. 
01:17:32
Okay. 
01:17:33
PG 13 means it's got some not good stuff in it. 
01:17:38
R ratings down here. 
01:17:40
R means rotten. 
01:17:42
Don't watch it at all. 
01:17:43
And he said that to me. 
01:17:45
That's what he's saying. 
01:17:46
That's what we call those ratings. 
01:17:48
I see. 
01:17:49
Yeah, he's talking about the earthly ratings 
01:17:50
for the movie theaters. 
01:17:51
R means rotten. 
01:17:52
Don't go see it. 
01:17:53
Okay. 
01:17:54
Wow. 
01:17:55
Wow. 
01:17:57
Let me just, for the last question, let me ask this. 
01:18:00
Cause you just opened a interesting door about God took you up 
01:18:04
and a very first trip he gave you was to do something fun. 
01:18:08
Cause he said, you're very serious. 
01:18:09
Talk about what if you could, 
01:18:11
there's a bunch of people who they say, you know what? 
01:18:14
People are always telling me I'm so serious. 
01:18:17
And I know I don't want to necessarily be too serious, 
01:18:20
but what tell them the people who say, yeah, 
01:18:23
they're always accusing me of being too serious. 
01:18:25
What would you think God would want to tell them now? 
01:18:28
Right now, try to lighten up some. 
01:18:31
You know, it's okay to be serious about the Lord and, you know, 
01:18:34
and I'm not talking about change your relationship 
01:18:36
with him at all. 
01:18:37
I'm not saying that. 
01:18:38
I'm saying the way you respond to people who ask about Christ. 
01:18:42
Yes, he is a risen Lord. 
01:18:43
Yes, he died for sins, but he also enjoyed laughing. 
01:18:48
When he was on the earth, he loved to laugh. 
01:18:50
He loved to be at celebrations. 
01:18:52
He loved to attend the wedding. 
01:18:54
He loved to attend the wedding. 
01:18:55
He loved to attend the wedding. 
01:18:57
He loved to attend the wedding is essential. 
01:18:59
That's why he was invited. 
01:19:00
He was at that wedding where he changed the water 
01:19:03
into heaven's wine people, not earthly wine. 
01:19:06
He made it into heaven's wine. 
01:19:07
And he did love to celebrate. 
01:19:09
And he was quite a character. 
01:19:11
And he was really good friends with a lot of the, 
01:19:14
not just his disciples, 
01:19:15
but he had other people that were his friends. 
01:19:18
And so, you know, don't be so serious 
01:19:23
that you can't have time to smile every now and then. 
01:19:26
One of the things the Lord said, 
01:19:27
you're gonna start smiling a lot 
01:19:29
and laughing a lot more than you do, 
01:19:31
so that when you get to heaven, 
01:19:32
you'll be used to it, probably. 
01:19:35
So people can actually see that you are a happy person. 
01:19:37
Maybe you might want to know them. 
01:19:39
Maybe you'll be more a little bit approachable. 
01:19:41
I'm not telling you to go out drinking. 
01:19:43
I'm not saying to go out partying, 
01:19:45
just so you can be with people, don't do that. 
01:19:47
That messes up your testimony and your witness 
01:19:50
of how Christ lives in you. 
01:19:53
So I'm not ever gonna tell you to do that, 
01:19:55
but you need to be seen to have fun and like to have fun 
01:20:00
and to laugh at things because we have to show 
01:20:04
that we have a sense of humor sometimes. 
01:20:05
Yeah, and I think I can say without fear of being wrong. 
01:20:11
Well, because you talked about eating cake, 
01:20:13
I think I can say without fear of being wrong 
01:20:15
that you're saying God wants you to laugh and lighten up now 
01:20:19
amidst all of this COVID and geopolitical things 
01:20:23
that are going on and threats of war. 
01:20:25
He wants them to still have fun. 
01:20:27
Yeah, he's not saying to ignore the evil or wickedness, 
01:20:30
but you're supposed to rise above it 
01:20:32
and you need to let people know. 
01:20:33
I am not afraid of this. 
01:20:35
I'm not tolerating it. 
01:20:36
I'm speaking against the evil. 
01:20:38
I'm praying for people. 
01:20:39
I'm setting the army of heaven to hold on strongholds 
01:20:42
of evil in places, but I also can laugh. 
01:20:45
I need to take time to laugh. 
01:20:47
It's nice to have a balanced life. 
01:20:49
People know that they can come and see you 
01:20:50
and maybe discuss something that is fun 
01:20:52
or is exciting, even exciting. 
01:20:55
And so I would encourage people, 
01:20:56
and I know some people are having hard times, 
01:20:58
but why don't you ask? 
01:21:00
He actually had me people start asking, 
01:21:02
asking for him to let you have fun. 
01:21:05
That's good. 
01:21:06
And people don't even pay for it sometimes. 
01:21:09
So you have not because you asked not. 
01:21:12
And I know it's important to have bills paid 
01:21:14
and people healed. 
01:21:15
Those are always gonna be important 
01:21:17
and you haven't got to worry about that, 
01:21:19
but you also need to make sure that you leave room 
01:21:22
for fun in your life. 
01:21:23
And yes, it's okay to ask. 
01:21:25
Can I have fun? 
01:21:25
Can you send me some fun? 
01:21:27
Or you want me to have fun? 
01:21:31
That would probably be the best thing. 
01:21:32
Because he will surely do that for you. 
01:21:34
He will surely do that. 
01:21:36
Okay. 
01:21:37
Okay, Kat, tell people real quick about revealing heaven 
01:21:40
and catcur.com, those two, 
01:21:41
and then I'll maybe ask you to pray as we go out, 
01:21:44
but talk about those two sites real quick. 
01:21:48
Revealingheaven.com. 
01:21:50
I really didn't choose any of this stuff. 
01:21:52
I didn't choose the title of the book. 
01:21:55
I didn't choose the names of the websites. 
01:21:57
I don't choose almost nothing 
01:21:59
because I let him tell me what he needs and what he wants. 
01:22:02
So he actually named the book revealing heaven. 
01:22:05
And I had picked other names and he said, 
01:22:07
how about revealing heaven? 
01:22:08
Do you think that explains what it does? 
01:22:10
Reveals heaven? 
01:22:11
I went, yeah, I think it does. 
01:22:12
And so revealingheaven.com is our main website. 
01:22:15
It's where you can find events that are gonna be planned. 
01:22:19
It's where you can find products 
01:22:20
that he wants us to make on purpose. 
01:22:23
He wants us to reveal heaven and earth. 
01:22:25
Sometimes us to written form, spoken form, 
01:22:27
but sometimes it's through things that we make. 
01:22:30
Things you can hang on your wall, things that you can wear, 
01:22:33
things that you can drink out of, 
01:22:34
like this is our newest cup we just had made. 
01:22:37
It is a coffee cup or a hot chocolate. 
01:22:39
And so we probably will have it down at Robin's place, 
01:22:43
but it says, I don't do demons. 
01:22:45
And that is the number one quote the Holy Spirit gave me 
01:22:49
to make things out of because you're not supposed 
01:22:51
to really bash people. 
01:22:53
You're supposed to love people, but you can bash hell. 
01:22:57
And so that means I make a statement. 
01:22:59
I don't do demons, means I don't tolerate them. 
01:23:02
I don't participate with them. 
01:23:04
They were thrown out of heaven on the lightning bolt 
01:23:07
and therefore I will have nothing to do with them. 
01:23:09
I will help people get free of them, but that's about it. 
01:23:13
So that's why we make different things. 
01:23:15
So you'll find a store there that has a lot of things 
01:23:17
about heaven on there. 
01:23:18
And of course there's testimonies, I think. 
01:23:21
I think they just revamped the website. 
01:23:23
I barely got to look at it the other day 
01:23:25
and I'm like, wow, it's completely different, 
01:23:27
but it's easier to navigate through. 
01:23:29
And so there's new things on there. 
01:23:31
And then there's catcurve.com, 
01:23:33
which is a spiritual platform for the father to say 
01:23:36
whatever he wants to say and everyone wants to say it. 
01:23:39
And so there's a lot of quotes from Holy Spirit. 
01:23:41
There's a gallery that shows you what things look like 
01:23:44
in the spirit realm that we have created those things. 
01:23:47
There's also some photos there of the host and stuff there. 
01:23:50
And again, that is the only place you can give online. 
01:23:55
There is no other Facebook I've made 
01:23:58
than the catcurve Facebook or the catcurve YouTube. 
01:24:03
I don't have other places like that. 
01:24:05
I only have those two. 
01:24:07
And so that's why you go to the two different places. 
01:24:09
And if you want to give online, it's catcurve.com. 
01:24:12
And I think you click on the treasury or something like that 
01:24:15
and you can even become a member, a guardian zone member 
01:24:18
that helps to bring heaven to earth 
01:24:19
by supplying a funds for me, praying for me. 
01:24:23
And I really appreciate the guardians very much. 
01:24:26
We're gonna start some new things with them. 
01:24:27
Once we move and get our building, 
01:24:29
we're not just moving for a home. 
01:24:31
We're also looking for a building. 
01:24:32
We have an actual building that we can have our offices in. 
01:24:35
That's gonna be exciting for us. 
01:24:36
So thank you for praying for us and standing with us. 
01:24:40
And we stand with you in these times. 
01:24:43
We're not tolerating the enemy, Satan is your number one enemy 
01:24:47
and that he's just has a hold of a lot of people right now 
01:24:50
and God's exposing who is in the light, 
01:24:53
who is in the darkness, 
01:24:55
and he does have plans to do great things on this earth 
01:24:58
still. 
01:24:59
So good. 
01:25:00
So good, Kat. 
01:25:01
Kat, go ahead. 
01:25:02
If you feel like it, go ahead and pray for the people 
01:25:04
as we go out and that'd be good. 
01:25:06
That'd be awesome. 
01:25:07
Yeah, Father, I just pray right now on your behalf, God, 
01:25:11
before the throne of God, I declare and decree 
01:25:14
that this earth will be free, this country, America. 
01:25:18
America was born to be free, still is free. 
01:25:22
Yes, God's gonna do some amazing things, Father. 
01:25:24
I thank you for helping those who are in fear, 
01:25:26
who are in lack, who've had things stolen from them, 
01:25:29
taken from them, things that have been lost. 
01:25:32
I thank you for restoring them, restoring their properties, 
01:25:35
restoring their homes with even better things. 
01:25:38
God, I thank you for showing your hand of justice 
01:25:41
on their behalf and also extending the hand of life 
01:25:45
and love towards all these people out here 
01:25:47
who are praying to you, Father. 
01:25:48
I thank you for the suddenlies coming in their lives, 
01:25:51
the things they never expected to happen, 
01:25:54
will begin to happen in Jesus' name. 
01:25:56
And right now, every demon out of your home, 
01:26:00
I sever every spirit of witchcraft 
01:26:02
trying to operate against you right now, 
01:26:04
and I say to the devils, get out in Jesus' name. 
01:26:10
You have no power here. 
01:26:12
We give you no power. 
01:26:14
We give you no permission, but we rule with Jesus Christ, 
01:26:18
and you're about to see us rule and reign 
01:26:20
for many generations to come. 
01:26:23
I'm looking forward to tomorrow 
01:26:26
and the rest of my life on this earth, 
01:26:27
and I pray God that you get help wherever you are, 
01:26:32
whether it's spiritual, physical, mental, or emotional. 
01:26:35
I thank you, God, for bringing ways of healing 
01:26:40
to this nation and to this world in Jesus' name. 
01:26:44
Remember to forgive those who speak against you. 
01:26:47
It opens the door for a Holy Spirit to go pursue them. 
01:26:51
Very good, very good. 
01:26:53
Kat, thank you so much. 
01:26:54
We love you and your team. 
01:26:56
And a quick reminder that Roger Stone 
01:26:58
will be our second program today 
01:27:00
at three o'clock Pacific, six o'clock Eastern. 
01:27:03
Have a great day, everybody. 
01:27:04
Thank you again, Kat. 
01:27:05
We love you all. 
01:27:06
See y'all later, Kate. 
01:27:07
Bye-bye. 
01:27:08
Bye. 
01:27:09
Bye.

01:12
Hey, everyone. Welcome to Elijah Streams. Today is Wednesday, October 19, 2022. I'm 
01:41
your host, Kelsey O'Malley. I'm filling in for Steve Schultz today. We have an awesome Wednesday 
01:47
plan. Kat is here with us, and she's going to be sharing updates, but also answering questions 
01:52
that you guys have sent in. And there is a list of amazing questions. I can't wait to hear her 
01:59
answer because some of these questions, I myself am like, yes, yes. What does this mean? So I'm so 
02:05
excited to be here with all of you today. Thanks for tuning in. Thanks for being family with us 
02:12
and coming and watching us each and every day. Thanks for sharing the good news of Jesus to all 
02:17
your friends and family and just being so faithful to us. And you know, you guys, your giving has 
02:24
done incredible things for the people in Uganda. We want to share a video with you guys of what 
02:30
your giving has done for these people. I mean, fresh water is absolutely changing their lives. So 
02:36
take a look at this incredible video. 
02:48
The words that were already existing here in Uganda, we thought they were the safe ones to 
02:55
have, but actually they weren't safe at all. We would have to share this water with the animals. 
03:01
And you can imagine all the different contamination that can happen and go on in Uganda. Fetching 
03:10
water is done by the young children, the young boys and the girls. You had to move a long, 
03:15
long distance. And usually it is done in the morning and also sometimes very late in the evenings. 
03:35
We also have the elderly who we call the judges. These are the very old grandparents of different 
03:42
families who sometimes can't walk and also sometimes can't be able to carry the cans that 
03:49
we use to fetch the water. So they have to take days without even taking a shower or sometimes 
03:55
even not preparing a meal because they are saving water for the next day. 
04:00
I would like to say thanks to the opportunity that you guys came to this community and are 
04:14
changing so many lives. We appreciate you so much and may God bless you. 
04:33
And may God bless you, Lillian and all those sweet babies and all those people there. 
04:50
I just think of the scripture when Jesus says when we give a cup of cold water 
04:55
to one of these His disciples, our reward is great in heaven. And moving the heart of the 
05:01
Father looks like giving to the poor, looks like giving to those in need. And by partnering with 
05:07
us to do that, I mean you are really touching the heart of God and touching the heart of 
05:12
so many people who see His tangible love through our giving and through them building wells and 
05:19
it's changing lives. It's incredible that video is so touching. So thank you again so much from the 
05:24
bottom of our hearts for giving and partnering with us to show the love of Christ to the people all 
05:31
around Uganda. Thank you guys so much. If you have not yet followed American Warriors or heard 
05:38
of American Warriors yet, it is an amazing, incredible documentary series that Steve Schultz's 
05:46
Brother Warren does and it talks all about different soldiers and all these amazing stories from these 
05:56
men who've been through war and seen at first hand, lived at first hand. There's a brand new episode 
06:03
of American Warriors premiering today. You can find that on YouTube and also on Rumble. If you 
06:11
search American Warriors on Rumble or YouTube, you can find a brand new show going to air today. 
06:19
And today's show is about Les Davis. He's a 17, he was a 17 year old farm boy who joined the army 
06:28
to get away from home for what he expected would be an exciting adventure. He found himself in 
06:35
Korea within 600 men in his company caught in a brutal battle in which only he and one other 
06:43
survived. This is the story of his experience and how it changed his life. This here's the story of 
06:52
of an annoying massacre. The fighting just went on and on and on and finally I thought I better 
07:09
just get out of here. I started running. I think I must have run for two miles. I had no idea at 
07:25
the time but later on I'd found out that there was supposedly two survivors from that 
07:33
massacre. I didn't really think about myself as a survivor, just another soldier and I just did what 
07:45
I was told to do. Les, thank you so much for your service to America and for everyone that's 
07:59
intrigued in watching that. Please head over to American Warriors. Make sure you subscribe, 
08:06
click the subscribe button, the bell notification so that way you guys can be aware of when a brand 
08:12
new episode of American Warriors comes out. And we appreciate you guys heading over there because 
08:17
Warren works so hard you guys on these shows and he does an incredible job. Make sure you comment, 
08:24
like, share this with others, encourage these men, pray for Les Davis, pray for others, get involved 
08:32
in showing your love to these men who gave up so much of their life for our freedom. 
08:37
All right, without further ado, we have Kat Kerr coming on today and she's going to be sharing 
08:43
amazing stuff with us so let's bring her on and hear what she has to say. 
08:59
Love your intro, Kat. It's so cute. No fuzzy. It's nice to have you today. 
09:13
I'm happy to be here. I was just trying to tell Jen I'm a little bit fuzzy looking. 
09:20
You're clear to me. Okay, then it must just be my must be mine. Okay, I think I think you're 
09:27
clear to me. So I think you're good. But I know it says Wednesdays with Kat, but it's going to be 
09:33
Wednesdays with with Kelsey and Kat today. So yeah, I'm excited to be with you, Kat. I always love 
09:39
hearing all your revelation and your wisdom on heaven. But before we get into the questions, 
09:45
would you share with us any updates and amazing things that happened last weekend? 
09:50
Oh, yeah. It was awesome this past weekend. I was with Robin and I call her Lady Robin since 
09:58
Robin and Robin Bullock. And I actually got to stay in their vintage Victorian mansion 
10:06
that someone sold them so ridiculously wonderfully priced. And it's on the highest 
10:12
hill right there in Warrior, Alabama. Of course it is. And I got to speak in their new sanctuary 
10:18
that they had, he had bought like a shopping center in such a short amount of time. It is an 
10:23
amazing place. I think they went from seating like 250 to 1200 now. And it was awesome. But 
10:31
I got to speak twice. And then for Sunday morning, the Holy Spirit said, you need to impart the 
10:39
life of God to people. And that is the thing that is the thing that I carry. It's not just 
10:45
something. It's not just a word about something. It's not just a movement. It actually is the 
10:50
presence and it's the life of God. And when the Father anointed me to do this, I was not expecting 
10:58
what happened. It's sometimes for the very first time when I do that, people literally feel the 
11:04
presence, the manifest presence of God, because it's his life. It's just like standing before him 
11:10
almost. But it just comes out of my hands. It's like blue, it's like blue smoke or blue fire, 
11:18
sometimes with anointing, it's like blue fire, blue smoke kind of. And it makes a cloud that 
11:24
you can't always see. Some people see a little mist of it, but somebody captured a picture which 
11:30
really amazed me. And you literally see it coming out of my hands. I'm about to lay it on somebody's 
11:36
son and they took the picture. And you could see it come out of my hands, wrap around them, 
11:42
and then go into this cloud around the area I was standing in. And I always let people know you 
11:48
need to be prepared for being undone. Okay, it's not me, it's him. Totally undone. Sometimes you 
11:55
hear him say something. You sometimes you'll shake, sometimes you will jump, sometimes they jump. 
12:01
It's like getting hit with lightning sort of in some way, but the presence is so strong. People 
12:07
sometimes weak, sometimes they laugh, but they don't stand up for very long. And it even goes to 
12:13
the people, it passes through, it's a spiritual thing, which it can happen to people who normally 
12:20
lay hands on people in any kind of a ministry situation. It's the spiritual thing, the releasing 
12:25
so it can pass through that person's body to the people behind them, to the ushers. And the ushers 
12:31
always get really kind of wiped out, they'll stand up there, they're standing up there. It lasted 
12:37
five hours, five hours I stood and imparted to every single person there. And it got stronger 
12:42
and stronger. But I was not expecting to see it in that picture, but it totally captured it. I'm 
12:49
going to see if she can send it to me, maybe we can show it next time. But it was amazing. 
12:54
And people were so overwhelmed. Some people were healed, some people were set free. But the most 
13:00
precious thing was everybody in the line when they would come up to me, they would go, 
13:07
they wanted to hug and hold on to me, but we never got done. We would have never got done, 
13:12
but it was awesome. It was powerful. And God really does love you. He does. And they would walk up 
13:17
there and I would say, He loves you. And then I would lay my hand right here on them. I always 
13:21
tell them we're going to lay it. And because it comes right here from the center of my hand, 
13:26
and it flows right into their spirit. And so it was an exciting time to be there. And of course, 
13:33
I got, we got to sit a little bit with Robin and talk to him about things that are coming, 
13:38
things that are hearing, we do the same thing. So it's wonderful to develop a friendship with 
13:43
some of these prophets, you know, because we understand each other. We know it's not going 
13:50
to be normal in the household. It is never normal, not in mine, not in theirs, not in Hank, not in 
13:55
anybody's. But it's wonderful that in the past, you didn't always get to do that. You came and went, 
13:59
came and went, but I really want to have a relationship. So that's really developing. 
14:04
And I'm exciting about it. But we are all in agreement on one thing. Life is about to never 
14:10
be the same again. God is absolutely going to move on this earth. And a powerful, amazing things are 
14:17
about to happen. And I think next week, which will be number 100 episode, I think we should 
14:24
definitely have some cake during that event. Yes, everybody get your cake already for next week, 
14:32
next Wednesday. Yes. And I wanted to ask you something about when you release the life of God, 
14:39
when people walk up, is there a posture for people who've never experienced anything like that? 
14:45
Maybe they haven't been to a meeting where someone's laid hands on them. Can you posture yourself to 
14:51
receive? You stand like this, you know, you have your hands, you're receiving it. This is, this is, 
14:57
like I'm receiving it. That's what that means. It's coming from God. He just uses me to do that. 
15:03
But that's what I tell people. If you're uncomfortable, just hold your hands up. You're 
15:07
about to receive something because you are. You don't, you don't have to raise them up. You don't 
15:11
have to even touch me at all. And so I, but I always let the people know sometimes he'll tell 
15:16
me to impart it to their soul, which is by your stomach, the core of your very core of your spirit 
15:23
man, the very center of your spirit man is where your soul is. And your soul is not a little thing. 
15:29
It is not little. It looks like this beautiful, amazing, big column and God has written things to 
15:35
you on this column. It's your soul. He writes on it. So it's like this column and then off of that 
15:42
comes the layers of you, like a big fan. And it's you. There's many images of you and on your soul. 
15:49
Those are your emotions. And then your mind is a little bit at the top of this thing. So your mind, 
15:55
your will, which is that powerful column and God did write things to you on there when you were 
16:01
in heaven before you left to come to earth. So I understand how it operates. All those layers of 
16:07
you, if I could have a book to bring it out, I would do it in between all those layers. So it's 
16:14
not layers like I used to say, not like a fluffy biscuit. No, I used to say like an onion. And 
16:19
the Holy Spirit said, excuse me, we'd rather be a fluffy biscuit than another one. If you do not know 
16:25
Holy Spirit, she makes me laugh a lot, but he also tweaks me. He also shares things with me. 
16:34
That's why he's there. Guidance. He gives you instruction, but he also can be very funny. 
16:41
So after I start saying, you know, sort of like a fluffy biscuit, not an onion. 
16:46
I actually finally just drew and we're actually going to have the image made like, like a piece of 
16:51
art. It's amazing that you really understand how you are put together. And you know, those things, 
16:58
the soul and the spirit man, no man can make those. You know, the flesh part, yes. That's why 
17:05
they need heaven involved. Heaven is involved all the time in your lives, even at the very time of 
17:10
your conception. They take one of the little spirits of life that would be you or me or someone 
17:16
that's where we came from. And he would take us down to the mother's womb at the time of conception 
17:21
and knit and attach that little spirit man in the soul to that flesh. And that is when life begins. 
17:30
That's when your life begins, when you're attached together and the body, little body, the baby grows, 
17:35
your spirit man grows also. But it says in the Bible, God said, I knit you together in your mother's 
17:42
womb. And people think, well, he put her arms and legs on, that's not what he did. He literally 
17:47
put you, that was still you, your little spirit man and attached it to the mother's womb so it 
17:54
could grow. So that's how life begins. So really, when you have that moment where a husband and 
18:02
wife meet and that happens, life gets created, you really have a true visitation from the father. 
18:09
Every single woman who's ever been a mother had that visitation. And it's the only way life can 
18:19
be. It's the only way. If you remember in the Bible in Genesis, when they made Adam, when the Lord 
18:27
made Adam, and his body was perfect, and it says it was laying there, but there was no light then, 
18:32
it was just the body. And the father who was with him leans over and breathes Adam's spirit of life 
18:39
that it says in the Bible, that was his spirit, man and soul, breathes it into his nostrils. And 
18:44
he said, you have become a living soul. That's what he called him. So that's when Adam got his 
18:51
soul, then he was alive, and then he could think and make decisions. But really, in a way happened 
18:57
to all of us. So at the time of conception, your guardian angels are sent them. When Holy Spirit 
19:03
brings that little spirit of life with your soul in it, and let us attach, your guardian angels 
19:10
are brought with that. So you never even left heaven alone. And they will hang around the mother. 
19:16
I see them all the time with pregnant women, that baby's angels are outside the mother waiting, 
19:21
so they can never be with that baby from the time that you're born. 
19:26
And what do you think about when Jesus blew on the disciples and said, receive the Holy Spirit 
19:33
like it would, it always reminds me like it's, it's like, it's like that new birth, like God 
19:41
blew into Adam, Jesus blew into the disciples. So we actually, we receive from each of them, 
19:50
the Godhead, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, there's something we receive from each of them, 
19:54
at some time on this earth, you will have an encounter, even though you don't see it. The 
19:59
Father sends you down here, right? And it plants you in there. And then Jesus helps to bring Holy 
20:06
Spirit, and then he also was inside of you, right? And so, but you get something from all three of them. 
20:14
Because you've been forever with the Father, you lived in him, it says in the Bible, 
20:19
in him, we live, we move, we have our very being. That is the Father, because we didn't live 
20:27
in the time of Jesus. He had enough of us when we were born, and he had to come die for us. 
20:33
But you know, when you receive Christ, he does step inside of you. When you receive Holy Spirit 
20:38
as your guide, you know, as your guide and your counselor, and he's still part of the Godhead, 
20:42
he puts a layer of himself, which is a whole of himself. This is, this is revelation to 
20:47
some people. Okay. And then you receive him. So I'm telling you, you are so filled at that moment 
20:54
with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. That's what makes you powerful, but you need to 
20:59
know who you are. And so I love all this revelation that they have given me about how they put us 
21:04
together and know what begins to happen in our lives because of us having them. But Holy Spirit 
21:10
who indwells you, really, that's the best way to get him to have him speak to you. Now, when he first 
21:16
comes to you, he'll walk alongside you. So he's alongside you. So when you get born again, he 
21:23
comes alongside you. He comes alongside, he comes alongside. But you have to invite him. Inviting 
21:29
is part of heaven's protocol. You have to invite to partake. So you must invite Jesus Christ to 
21:37
be your Savior after you've repented. And then he literally will step inside of you. And then when 
21:41
you invite Holy Spirit, he will too. So if you had a spiritual picture of this, this thing about 
21:48
them dwelling and abiding in you, you would be so amazed. I can't sketch it. I haven't sketched it yet. 
21:54
It'll probably be in book three. But you can have them step in you and allow them to give you this 
22:00
information. When you get to have it, the Father will be sitting there and Jesus will step inside of 
22:05
him. Holy Spirit will step inside of him. And you will step inside of them. And we will be one. 
22:13
Wow. Jesus was talking to the Father and he said to the Father, you and me and me and you, 
22:20
that means they can have ability to step inside of each other. Father, I pray that they will be 
22:25
just like us. They will be one with us just like that. And so you do get to do that when you get 
22:30
to heaven. It is an amazing, you get overwhelmed so much by the love and the life flowing in you. 
22:39
And you feel so powerfully amazed at what has just occurred in your life. But most people don't 
22:45
get that told them. They don't understand. Most pastors don't understand that God did put you 
22:51
together literally, sent you from himself. And it says, you know, he is our Father. We are his 
22:57
offspring. Well, every mother knows that means you carry them and then you have them. And so he 
23:03
literally did carry us. And by the way, everybody, you've been from the beginning to the end. 
23:08
And the end of the beginning because we were still, we were in him before he made this earth. 
23:14
It wasn't like one day he made us. Not that way. We've always abided in him as a little spirit 
23:18
being. And he used to jump on the rainbow as it came from him. You'd ride it. You can see him in 
23:24
heaven. They'll come from in right on this rainbow that goes in and out, moves like the northern lights 
23:29
in and out of him in waves of vans of color. Do they look like, do the spirits look like little 
23:36
lights or little beings? Because he's called, the father's called the father of lights. 
23:42
Is that the little spirits? It is. We had a little, our little spirit you saw. It looked 
23:48
like a little child kind of, but not a baby. When he says, you know, every good and perfect gift, 
23:55
which be us, comes down from the father of lights. The reason they said that is your spirit man has 
24:01
made totally out of light. You can see them. They look like, you know, little individuals, 
24:07
but you're lit up. You literally have light in you from living in him. So the father of lights 
24:14
is not talking about the stars. It's talking about all of those, all of those, whoever lived. You 
24:20
lived in God first, even the ones who don't want him. That's where you came from. You are his offspring 
24:26
and he's going to get you. And does that tie in too with like, because a lot of people 
24:33
wonder about for knowledge and predestination. You hear a lot of people, well, if God knows 
24:40
everything already, then what can I, you know, even the Bible talks about, what can I do? You know, 
24:45
God knows everything. We were foreknown in predestined. Yes, we were foreknown. And that's 
24:52
because we've always been. That's right. Yes. Yeah, he already made plans for us while we were in him. 
25:00
And he literally chose what generation of time you would be born in. He, this is what the Holy 
25:07
Spirit says. He timed your birth on the earth. That's what the father does. He knows when he needs 
25:13
you here. He knows what your gift will be that he puts in you. He knows what will be happening. So 
25:18
he needs you for specific things on the earth. That's why he sends you in a certain time. Like, 
25:23
all of my family, he handpicked each one of us separately for us to be a family. So he knew we, 
25:29
while we lived in him, would be a family. He knew my, he knew who my husband was. 
25:34
Now the father even told me, okay, I wasn't necessarily looking to get married at the time. 
25:40
The father said, I chose him. I chose him for you before the earth was made. So you need to marry him. 
25:49
No, he doesn't say that to everybody. I've heard other people say that they knew that God picked 
25:53
him. But the father, because of what I'm doing, had to pick somebody as my husband who would not 
25:59
mind me spending a lot of time traveling and speaking, or even live living the very different 
26:05
kind of life. You know, some people wouldn't like it or wouldn't want me to do it. And so he picked 
26:10
somebody who wouldn't mind it all. And that's why he handpicked him. And so he chose, he chooses 
26:17
who's supposed to be in a family. Now he doesn't cause things to happen to you. There's a devil on 
26:21
this earth. And anytime the devil can kill, steal, and destroy, he's going to try to do it. He's 
26:26
afraid. Every time somebody's born, it threatens him. Because that one might be somebody powerful 
26:31
in the kingdom that would crush him, push it back, and expose stuff. So that's why he doesn't want 
26:37
us here. And Satan knows where we came from. He knows that we are God's children. He's not. 
26:44
He was made, like formed, like, you know, I was something. He was, he didn't exist inside of the 
26:50
father. Just us, just us who are humans. We did exist in him. And there's still more there. And 
26:56
they're still coming. They're still coming. So if you love God and you're serving God with all your 
27:02
heart, is it possible for you to ever miss your destiny and God or live out the books that have 
27:09
been written about you? I think it would, unless you totally decided you didn't want to. I think 
27:16
unless you said, if you ever said, I don't want to do it. And sometimes he might need you anyway. 
27:21
And he has this way of getting you to change your mind without forcing you. He just does. 
27:27
So sometimes you're very important. Everyone's important. He made me reword that everyone is 
27:33
important to God. And he loves us all the same. And we are his children. It's like, if you had 
27:40
children, you'd love them all. They would be different. And they might want to do different 
27:43
things, say different things. They may respond differently to a lot of different things. 
27:47
That doesn't mean you don't want them. And so even sometimes when children don't listen, 
27:52
and they pay consequences, doesn't mean you don't. Sometimes. It does not mean that you 
27:57
don't still love them. So the father's just like that. He really loves us very much. But that is 
28:04
where you came from. If you ever wonder, you didn't appear somewhere in time on some other planet 
28:09
and found your way here. No, people come up with all kinds of excuses. No, I was from another world 
28:15
that nobody knows about. No, there is nothing like that. There is heaven. There's God, 
28:21
Father, Son, the Holy Spirit. That's the divine. That's the Godhead. And there's heaven. And there's 
28:27
Satan and his minions. They live in hell. Well, they're supposed to live in hell. So there's always 
28:33
battle going on up for us, you know, to try to pull us into whatever, especially on the enemy side. 
28:40
The enemy never asks permission, by the way. The father always asks if you're going to do something 
28:45
for him. He will ask you, Satan never does that. We're going to get away with stealing, hurting, 
28:50
you know, that's Satan doing that. Okay, that's not the father. And so I wish everybody could 
28:56
know the father and Jesus introduced me personally to the father and he loved his father so much. 
29:03
He talked to them all the time when he was on this earth and how much he loved him. And even 
29:08
when he was here on the earth, he would go away to the mountain to spend time with him because 
29:11
this mountain that was in Israel. And so except the three days that he couldn't. That was when he 
29:19
was down in hell. And he had, Jesus had an assignment to, when he was, when he went to hell, he was 
29:25
actually released himself, his body, his spirit from his body on the cross. He descended into 
29:30
paradise, which was Abraham's bosom. That's what God put people who believed in him. They didn't 
29:36
let me know the Messiah. Jesus had not come yet. And so he counted them righteous because they 
29:41
believed in him as, you know, as God. And let me tell you, I will tell you this. I've been to that 
29:47
place. I've been to paradise. There's no one in it right now. It's been empty. They all were taken 
29:52
out by Jesus Christ, golden buildings, people. It has a river. And I'm talking about a spiritual 
30:00
abode in the middle of the earth. Below that and off to the side is where hell is, the great gulf 
30:07
between paradise. It calls it paradise in the Bible too. When Christ was on the cross, talking to 
30:13
the thief who accepted Christ. And he said, today you will be with me in paradise. He said that to 
30:20
the thief. And he was. So Christ died first. The thief was still on the cross. And Christ descended 
30:27
down into paradise. And he's got to see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, King, David, everybody who had, 
30:33
who had, you know, followed God for who he was. And I'm sure that even his father, the one who 
30:39
raised him, you know, he was there. And also several other people that had known Jesus. 
30:46
When, when he was walking on the earth and they died, they were taken there if they were 
30:50
found faithful to believe in God. And he actually preached the gospel to all of them. It was really 
30:55
an amazing. But the place he put them in, God counted these as his friends. They had feasts. 
31:02
They had tables set with feast. And people were eating. And they were laughing. And 
31:07
they were all talking, of course, this is when Christ descended down there. But it was a beautiful 
31:12
place. I didn't expect it to be that beautiful. They had an atmosphere. They had a sky. These are 
31:18
all spiritual places which shows you, yes, heaven is a real literal place, although it's a spiritual 
31:23
realm. And people eat in heaven. They enjoy all kinds of activities in heaven. So if you're in 
31:29
your spirit, man, and you're in that spiritual place is much like you being in this physical 
31:34
earth in your physical body. Did the Lord take Enoch and Elijah? Did he take them to paradise 
31:43
in their bodies? Or did he take them with him to heaven? He, they were in heaven. They were 
31:50
going to humans that were in heaven because the father caught up Enoch first. You know why? Because 
31:59
Enoch had such a great relationship. I mean, really relationship. I mean, he wanted to know them. 
32:06
He would talk to them all the time. Live the righteous life and love people. I mean, 
32:11
he only lived to be, I think, 300 and something. Back in those days, you could live to be almost 
32:15
a thousand years old. Back in the days when Enoch was on the earth. But they couldn't bear to be 
32:20
without him. They loved him so much. They just took him. They took him to heaven and he's been 
32:24
there ever since. And of course, Elijah also, all the powerful things he did. And you know, 
32:29
even when he had to deal with the prophets of Baal and all that stuff like that, he wanted to go. 
32:34
No, Elijah wanted to go to heaven. So God sent the chariot for Elijah. And Elijah got in this 
32:43
chariot and that he had told. I know when he is spoken to people and said, I'm going to be going. 
32:52
I'm going to heaven. You know, I want to go there. And but God actually sent this for him. 
32:57
So Elisha, who is his like, I guess he was mentored by Elijah. Elijah told him, if you see me go, 
33:04
if you're around when he's when I go up and you see me, I'll throw my mantle down to you. 
33:09
So Elisha just followed him everywhere. He was not going to miss that. Of course, that was God's 
33:16
plan for him to step into that place. And he did. He was there. So he, Elijah threw his mantle down 
33:23
and Elisha caught it and struck the ground with it and said he was served the God, the God of heaven 
33:28
and earth. I got Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and he now would be that prophet that he had to double. 
33:36
He did double miracles. He did double everything. And when he died, when Elisha died, and he just 
33:43
went up in the mountains and died. And then years later, they threw somebody who had died 
33:48
over this mountain. And when they fell on the bones of Elisha, that person came back to life. 
33:57
He carried the noting that you carry stays with the body. It doesn't need to go to heaven. 
34:04
It stays with the body. And so that's why it's very powerful for people who are anointed to lay 
34:10
hands on you. But even this is a wild thing. Even if they're cremated, whether you're buried or 
34:17
cremated, that anointing you carried stays with your body. And when I got to visit Israel the 
34:22
first time, we were allowed to go into where King David's is sepulchre where his big tomb was. 
34:29
And because they were the Jews and they had curtains dividing it like the men got to go 
34:36
to one half of this place and the women went together. Before I even reached the tomb where 
34:42
he was in, I felt the anointing leaving that thing. I could feel David's anointing leaving. 
34:49
And I heard songs he had sung. I don't think I've ever told anybody this. I heard songs he had sung. 
34:55
Whatever he was wearing, when they actually buried his body, but it was wearing and he's, 
35:01
if he had sung in those garments, the garments would carry those songs. So I heard him singing. 
35:07
He wasn't alive, but that was anointing he carried. But the anointing he operated on was coming from 
35:14
where his body was in the tomb, even though he was dead. Wow, that's incredible, Kat. I know I've 
35:20
heard your testimonies from when you go to Israel and you still see the angels standing 
35:28
beside the tomb. Is that right? That is absolutely right. The same two angels that it talks about 
35:34
in the Bible. Those two angels are there. They guard the tomb because it is a holy place. 
35:40
It's where Christ's body was laid. It's where he was resurrected from. And a lot of people go in 
35:45
there and they feel, this is wild, they feel a presence so strong. And those two angels carry 
35:53
anointing that was given to them by Christ. And then they were anointed to guard and protect 
35:59
not just Christ when his body was in that tomb, but the tomb itself. So I would encourage you to 
36:04
go to Israel. Don't miss going to the tomb and just know that those two angels are still there. 
36:10
When we talk about Enoch and we, okay, I want to ask you this question because I'm curious 
36:18
your take on it, but you know how there's two witnesses and revelation that come and then 
36:24
they get killed and they get raised three days later? Yes. Do you know who they are? 
36:30
Do I know? I don't know who they are. I know it's Helens who lived on the earth and they 
36:36
will live on the, I'm not saying they're here now, but they will literally be living on the earth 
36:43
when that whole thing happens, when the perilous times come and then the three short years that 
36:49
it will be in the perilous times and the tribulation three years long. Those are two people. I would 
36:55
think probably they might be prophets because they said things that's so annoyed and enraged the 
37:02
Antichrist. I mean, they enraged him by, they probably declared things about God, probably did 
37:07
talk about Christ sitting on the throne in Jerusalem while he's trying to take over. And so yeah, 
37:13
they, they, they were martyred and they left their bodies laying in the street. They didn't even bury 
37:19
them. They just left them so, so Antichrist could say, look, I killed them. I killed them and he was 
37:24
probably laughing until God raised him from the dead. That's going to be incredible. I don't think 
37:31
that'll be an amazing, people need to think about the amazing, supernatural events that will actually 
37:37
happen on this earth. And that is one of them. I know my brother wants to be one of them. 
37:44
I've heard a lot of talk. This could be one of the two living witnesses. Yeah, I've heard people say 
37:49
it's Moses. It's Elijah. It's Enoch. It's Elijah. Moses and Enoch. So I was just curious. I do not 
37:58
think it's any of them at all. I don't think so. Okay. Okay. Number one, people, they already are 
38:06
immortal. Abraham, Jacob, they're immortal because they have gone to heaven. They couldn't come back 
38:16
and die. Okay. They couldn't come back here and then die. That's not even possible. It's not even 
38:21
possible. So it isn't them. It'll be somebody who lives in that time when all that's happening and 
38:27
they will be known that they hear God, that they love God and they speak about him. So it can't be 
38:34
somebody who nobody knows. Okay. These two people probably have, they're probably really tough, tough, 
38:40
strong willed and everything because they had to be on the earth when it was really, really bad. 
38:45
This is not bad. I know it's not, you don't like it. I know it's, nobody wants it, but it's not 
38:51
anything like it will be in the pair of the sun, which is well, well, I'd probably say close to 
38:55
200 years or more away because there's still too many things we have to do. But yeah, those witnesses, 
39:01
they're car witnesses because everybody's hearing them. They're probably on television. I know they 
39:07
are annoyed and probably insulted the Antichrist because he couldn't wait to get rid of them. 
39:12
So when he killed them and they stayed dead, he should have learned from Jesus Christ. All right, 
39:17
evil? He thought he hadn't even gone to and he shows up at the gates of hell on the third day. 
39:23
This is not going, I'm going in a different time zone. So you understand, I'm not in the 
39:27
girl's time zone way back when, when Christ died was crucified in the cross and his spirit man 
39:32
went down into paradise. He preached the gospel. He ate with them. The things showed up because 
39:37
remember he Christ told him he'd be there and celebrated with them. And then when he knew the 
39:42
time came, you have to understand the way that God designed, um, paradise and then hell or Haiti 
39:49
sometimes is called. This was a place of delight and God's presence. Uh, uh, was paradise. And then 
39:57
hell was total opposite. It would be a boat of Satan that he ruled there and a lot of demons 
40:03
ruled there. And that's where torment was. Well, nobody could cross over from where there was a 
40:08
great golf. I'm in a great distance. You couldn't just decide, I'm going to go to hell. You wouldn't 
40:13
want to anyway, if you were in paradise and yet Christ did go there and he was the only one who 
40:18
ever went there like that and you went or showed up at the gates of hell, then that whole scenario 
40:22
happened where Satan's thinking, I got him now. I know he didn't. He got a lot. He got a lot of 
40:28
fire and light and that's what he got. And on the third day when Christ stood up and melted 
40:34
the faces of the principalities and powers that were called him from all over the earth, 
40:39
principalities and powers are evil, wicked spirits that sit on wicked thrones around the world. 
40:44
And Satan called them in. He wanted them, their leader, to wanted them to see him torture the 
40:52
Son of God. Well, it didn't turn out that way. He wiped up hell, put up part of it, melted the 
40:58
faces of the hierarchy of hell, stripped Satan of all his royal guard, all the gemstones he was 
41:02
wearing and took away the keys of hell and the grave, beating him up and left him in the dust 
41:07
of hell. Pretty much that's what he did. He wasted it. That's what he did. And in the Bible, 
41:13
it says that Christ, that Christ spoiled, this is why he's in hell, spoiled principalities and 
41:21
powers making a show of it openly. Yes. You know why it was openly because those in paradise hadn't 
41:29
left yet that he had gotten born again, but they were watching because you could see the 
41:33
down into the courtyard of hell, you could see from where they were up there yelling and cheering 
41:39
on Jesus Christ. Satan says tearing them up, people, he's tearing them up. And so what a 
41:47
wonderful experience. That is a powerful, powerful thing. And I know that paradise and hell aren't 
41:53
on the earth, but they were still part of earth. So that whole thing took place within the realms 
41:59
of the spirit realm in the earth. So that was an exciting day for everybody in heaven. I can tell 
42:04
you, they were cheering too. And then he comes, explodes out of that grave, picks his body up 
42:11
in the tomb, goes into the tomb. There's those two angels waiting right there, comes up, 
42:15
fill a bowl of light and glory because he had just reached hell and gets back right into his body. 
42:22
And of course, he's an amazing thing. The stone is easily blown away, rolled away, whatever you 
42:27
want to call it. And then he goes outside and steps into the garden. That's why it's called the 
42:32
garden tube, steps into the garden because he loves flowers. And that's where he was when Mary came 
42:39
and she thought he was the gardener. Nobody knows why she said that, but that's why, 
42:44
because I was taken back and I saw that whole thing happen. So she came in to bring anointings, 
42:52
you know, she was going to anoint the body again or herbs and put it on the cloth that was wrapped 
42:56
around him. And he wasn't there. Wow. He was not there. Okay. And so they, she left to come outside 
43:05
and there was the gardener, she thought. And the only reason she said that was because he was in 
43:10
the gardens, not on the sidewalk, looking not on the path, he was in the middle of all the flowers. 
43:16
And then when he turned around, she knew exactly who he was. 
43:19
Having revelation just makes the word come alive, but make sure you realize that is your king. 
43:27
That, that, that God, Jesus Christ, he's our king. And I'm telling you what, he still rules 
43:34
over everything. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof is his and this whole left 
43:42
group who think they can take it over. I would laugh. You don't get nothing because you don't own it. 
43:50
You didn't make it. You didn't make the people on it. And we belong to Jesus Christ. You're about 
43:55
to see, you see the power of his justice. That's what you're about to see. I'm talking about the 
44:00
left right now. I'm talking about all the wicked evil people who are killing, stealing and destroying 
44:04
thinking that you have one and nobody knows. I tell you somebody who knows Jesus Christ, 
44:11
the Son of the living God. Yes. And what about, can Jesus, or does Jesus still come? Like, 
44:18
you know, how he appeared on the road to Emmaus with the two disciples and they didn't recognize 
44:23
them. And even when he came to Peter, does, does the Lord still come in that way? Like, 
44:29
could he be in a, in our church service or could he be appearing as someone where we're not recognizing 
44:35
his form? Does he still do that? He does that because I've personally seen him. I'm seeing. 
44:42
I'm not sure. I've seen him too many times, you tell you. I've seen him a lot. He comes into my 
44:49
home and talks to me, no matter where I'm outside somewhere, he'll come and talk to me. Does he come, 
44:54
does he come as his, his, his form or done? Okay. No, when I see him, it's him. I've seen him in 
45:02
heaven. I've seen him on the earth. No, it's him and his physical body that he's been glorified. 
45:08
He is glorified, but you can see the, you can see the, the, this is where the, the nail scars are. 
45:16
They're not here. They're not in the palm of his hand because that weight of his body hanging on the 
45:21
cross, it would have, it would have ripped. It would have ripped right through this. So literally, 
45:27
it's right here. These two joints in your wrist, it was, he was nailed there and you can put your 
45:33
whole finger in it. I mean, you can see them and if the wind blows when he's here and it moves his 
45:40
hair, you can see all the holes in the, the wounds of where the holes were in his head. When they 
45:45
put that crown of thorns on him, you can see that. So in his feet, the same thing you can, 
45:51
he's still kind of wear sandals most of the time. I was going to ask, does he come barefoot? 
45:55
But now people need to understand before he came to the earth, he dressed differently. 
46:02
He looked differently. Yeah. When he was called the word, the word was with God and was God and 
46:10
there was nothing that was not made by him. It said he became flesh. He had flesh put on him. 
46:16
The word agreed to have flesh because he had to be born from the womb of a woman. So he had the 
46:21
right to choose whether sin or not sin. He actually had that right to choose that. He had to be down 
46:27
here to live just like us, but he never sinned even walking as he was still God, but he was walking 
46:33
and living in a human body. And so Satan didn't recognize him. He did not know he was the Son 
46:40
of God. He remembers what he looked like as the word because when Jesus got the body, the physical 
46:47
body, it changed. It changed his spirit and he still has that body. He's about six foot tall, 
46:55
something he's very muscular because he lifted trees down here. He's a master carpenter and he 
47:01
he worked all the time. So he was, I wouldn't say he wasn't up gloriously beautiful face like some 
47:07
handsome man, but he had a real strong features and everybody loves him. It doesn't really matter, 
47:14
but I just sometimes people want to know he had to walk this earth just like us. He experienced 
47:19
temptation in every way like we do, but he never sinned. Therefore, of course, living and walking 
47:28
as us, he already was righteous because he was the Son of God, but the fact that he chose not 
47:32
to sin in his human body, that really he really was righteous in hell. And he knew this when he 
47:40
descended into hell from Abraham's bosom. He himself knew the Father had already told him on 
47:46
the third day, I will raise you up. This is what's going to happen. I will not have contact with you 
47:51
during those three days. This was all on his own. He had to be there to make the choices and 
47:57
and he he did know that his father would raise him up again, but he didn't talk to him again 
48:04
from the time he was on the cross before he died and the father did not look upon him. 
48:12
He had to be there. This could be something where the father was empowering him with extra grace and 
48:17
mercy. He literally had to experience the suffering and torment and the crucifixion. He had to say 
48:24
yes, because what he took to the cross wasn't just his body. Right before that, when the 
48:29
soldiers came to get him, he was in the Garden Garden of Gethsemane, which I have been in. And I knew 
48:34
exactly where he had been, where he knelt, where he prayed, because there's so much glory in that 
48:39
very spot where he did that. And the angels came and tended to him the same two angels when they 
48:46
were sent from heaven to comfort him and minister to him. That was just, I don't know if it was a 
48:54
reward the father gave him for something or whatever, but why they were chosen, but they were there. 
48:58
They, when they came, brought the cup and everybody should know Jesus Christ had to drink a cup, 
49:06
not made, well the cup was made on the earth. That was a cup that was a gift he took to his 
49:13
father in the mountains one time. One of his first good projects, Jesus Christ actually made the 
49:18
coffee drink from. And the father put all that stuff in it because that stuff, every evil wicked 
49:24
thing, no matter every evil thing, every disease had to go in that cup because he bore that on 
49:30
the cross. That's why he has power over all of it. That's why he has a right. And the only one 
49:36
he can forgive sins because he carried all of that sin in him when he drank it in the garden. 
49:43
So he died in the garden when he said, Father, if it's possible, let this cup pass from me. 
49:48
Because he was righteous, right? But he had to drink this and carry it. It was the spiritual 
49:57
stuff in the cup, but it was a real literal physical cup he drank. And so those two angels 
50:03
brought that cup from heaven filled with that stuff. And they had to give it to him as a garden. 
50:09
I can imagine how hard that would have been. And then they had to witness, they were there as 
50:13
witnesses that he drank it. So then all of that was in him. It didn't make him evil. He was the 
50:21
carrier destroyed that stuff, the power of it. So that's why he went to the cross. It was crucified. 
50:30
All of that stuff was crucified and therefore gave him the right to forgive sin. And so that's why he 
50:37
is the only one who can forgive because he bore it. He chose to. And so can you imagine making a 
50:43
gift for your father? And then it comes back to you with all this. But that's what those angels did. 
50:48
So their reward was to remain here on the earth by the tomb. Get to see all the people just worshiping 
50:58
Jesus Christ, thanking him and everything. But that is their position right now. They are still 
51:02
there outside that tomb. And so that's that for what a reason he chose them to do that. 
51:08
That's what they did. I know there's a question on here if I can find it. It's okay. Lynn asked, 
51:16
have you been shown what actually happened on the day of Christ's crucifixion and how there was 
51:23
darkness for three hours? The time span is too long for a normal eclipse. Yeah. I have seen 
51:32
glimpses of the crucifixion as well as it sounds. I don't see a lot of violence. I'm not showing a 
51:39
lot of violence on purpose because I'm here. I carry hope and joy and celebration and revelation. 
51:47
And so he doesn't really want me to have to. It's not like I experienced it. I saw him on the cross. 
51:54
And I do know I heard him say the things to John that he said in the Bible. I actually did see 
51:59
that. So he's taken me. It's not that I'm better than anyone else, but I have a photographic memory 
52:04
and this is my assignment. And I've always been, I know that I've always was supposed to have this 
52:09
assignment. God told me. And so because if I'm going to reveal heaven, the fathers of the Holy 
52:15
Spirit, their operations and their actions and stuff that happened in the spirit realm, 
52:20
they would have to take me to these places to bring truth about them. And so I did see glimpses. I 
52:27
got to see Mary crying over him. I got to see him tell John, behold your mother and to her, 
52:34
behold your son, because Jesus Christ had to die not as the son of Mary, but the savior of Mary. 
52:42
He had to die on that cross. That's why he gave his mother and the care of his mother to John. 
52:47
And that's what he was doing at that moment at the cross. I did get to see that. I got to see, 
52:54
I saw him when he lost his spirit man from his body. He descended into Abrahamism. I saw that. 
53:00
I was taken to Abrahamism. So when I'm showing things, it's not a vision. It is in that time 
53:06
I've taken to that time and actually happened. I'm pretty certain at this point that we will 
53:13
write a revelation Bible and it will have all the revelations. He's given me wherever in those 
53:18
scriptures he's given me. It will be in the not in place of the scripture, but it will probably 
53:24
be down at the bottom and explain what happened in the spirit of things happen. But he had to do 
53:29
that in order for me to understand things and know. That wasn't a pleasant time to be there at the 
53:36
cross. People were really just heartbroken. Some of them had fear in them. And then of course, 
53:43
the powerful thing that began to happen. Darkness came on the earth. The veil was 
53:49
rent in the temple. In the Holy of Holies, it was rent. It was rent. But I think, I don't know 
53:56
if it was rent. I think it was rent. I don't know if it was from the top down or from the bottom up. 
54:00
I don't remember what it was, but it was rent saying. What that was saying was now man, righteous 
54:05
man now had the right to step into that place because we had to build streets to receive 
54:10
Christ as our savior. And that, that made us, that means we were just, okay, we were righteous. 
54:16
We were not unrighteous anymore if we received Christ. So there's reasons why all those things 
54:20
happened. The earthquake came over 500 dead were walking around alive in the city. That's the most, 
54:28
that's amazing to me. Yeah, because he had died. He, it was finished. Now that part when he said, 
54:35
it is finished when Christ said that he was talking about your salvation, the way of salvation. 
54:41
That was done. It was already handled. You just have to repent and receive him. So that was what 
54:47
he did the cross for, but he really wasn't done with being here on the earth. He didn't just go 
54:52
home to heaven when he died on the cross. He had something else to do. He had to take back 
54:57
our authority and dominion that, that Adam had given away to Satan because he chose Satan's 
55:03
words and chose to operate under Satan, the things he did and not God. What he was doing 
55:09
was giving away his rights to Satan to have dominion. Christ had to win that back. It had to 
55:16
be a just righteous man. They had to go into hell and take that back for us because hell cannot keep 
55:23
a righteous person and they had to know that. So when Jesus showed up and on the third day, 
55:29
he wasted them and he walked out of there having taken the things away from Satan that no longer 
55:36
he had the right to have. So then it was quite a powerful time. All of those encounters were 
55:42
very powerful times. So someone else asked on here, if I could, they asked about visions because 
55:50
you were just talking about how you were actually, how you were actually taken there, that it was 
55:58
not just a vision that you, so they were asking the difference between, if I could find it, 
56:03
the difference between how do you know if it's a vision or if you're really taken there? 
56:11
I think most people know that they're really taken there because everything in that place is 
56:17
alive. It's active. In a vision, it's like you're watching a movie. You know if you're in a place 
56:25
or if you're watching something on TV, you just know it. You know, there's a huge difference. 
56:29
You're smelling the air. You're tasting stuff. You're hearing things right there and you're 
56:35
standing there next to some of the people who are doing it. So it's not, a vision is different. 
56:40
A vision is different. You sometimes see things a little bit far off. Sometimes even if you see 
56:45
a vision and it's close, it's still not the same as standing next to the people where this encounter 
56:51
is happening with. So I know, I mean, I know what a vision is. I used to have visions. I don't have 
56:58
dreams either. I never dream. So don't ask me to interpret your dream. I wasn't there. So I can't 
57:03
help you with that. There are dream interpreters that do do that for God, but I'm a revelator. 
57:10
That means I reveal things. I reveal truth. I reveal things about places, about the Word, 
57:15
about heaven, about hell, about time. And so that's what my, that's what my assignment is. 
57:21
So you, you know that, you know, you, once you experience, through experience, you know, 
57:28
there's a complete difference between actually being taken and just maybe a movie screen opening 
57:33
up before your eyes and seeing a vision. Total difference. Total difference because a long time 
57:39
ago when I used to have a vision, I know that it's like I'd be sitting somewhere and then like 
57:44
everything would disappear and I would be watching, but I knew I was watching. I knew I wasn't in that. 
57:49
I wasn't in the scene. I wasn't with the people that were in that, in that thing. So an encounter 
57:55
is totally different than a dream or a vision. You'll, you are literally physically encountering 
58:00
something. And it's like, you know, you're there. Like I knew when I was taken back in time and I 
58:06
was taken to right at the time when Christ was resurrected. I was in the garden. I know which, 
58:12
which there's two different tombs. I say there is just the one that's inside this little pretty, 
58:16
like, I don't know what it is, like a temple or something like that. And they have beautiful tiles 
58:21
in the floor and everything. And they say that's the place where he died, but it wasn't. It's the one 
58:26
outside. It's Golgotha. It does look like a skull. The mountain thing that he's in is gardens are 
58:33
everywhere. So that is the right one. The one that's outside is the one that Christ actually was in, 
58:39
the tomb he was in. And so, uh, yeah, I knew I was, I knew I was there because I could touch the 
58:45
ground. I knew my feet were touching the ground. You know, if you're walking something or you're 
58:49
walking on the ground, there's a big difference. If you pick up stuff in the counter, if you hold 
58:54
things in that encounter, so there is a big difference. Yeah. That's, that explains it really 
58:59
good cat. Um, David, he's 10 years old. He asked what language did God speak when he created the 
59:07
world or the earth? Now, when I heard him speak, I heard him speaking in English. It may, it didn't 
59:15
have to be that, but in order for me to be able to share with people, since I don't speak Hebrew and 
59:21
I don't speak Greek and I don't speak, you know, other languages that were around on the earth at 
59:25
that time, I speak English. Now, if he wants to tell me what they said, sometimes he may do that, 
59:32
especially with angels talking. Angels have their own language. They can also speak any language on 
59:37
the earth. Angels can, but sometimes they have their own language also. I don't always understand 
59:43
what they're saying, but then they may, they may turn to me and say what, what it was just said. 
59:48
But I heard God say what he, what he was going to create and what they actually used to do 
59:55
when Christ's name was the word, it was the father, the word in Holy Spirit. That's what the Trinity 
01:00:01
was. And, but they still were, you know, they didn't, they didn't become somebody different, 
01:00:07
even though Christ had flesh put on him and his features changed, changed. That's why Satan was 
01:00:13
questioning him. By the way, let's go back to that scene. When he was tempted in the wilderness by 
01:00:18
Satan, he wanted to find out if he was a son of God, but he didn't know for sure he was. 
01:00:25
And Satan at that time didn't tell him who he was. He just used the word of God to make him 
01:00:30
leave. When he said, if you, you know, if you, he was asking Christ to do these different things 
01:00:36
to see if he was Jesus Christ and he didn't, he wouldn't do any of them. He gave him an answer 
01:00:41
of the scripture. He wasn't going to turn stones into food. He wasn't going to jump off the cliff. 
01:00:46
He wanted to jump off the cliff and prove that he was a son of God and Satan said, I'll give you 
01:00:50
all these, he was showing him all the kings and everything and wealth, which he always lies with 
01:00:55
and Christ wasn't fooled at all. So until Christ said he was the son of the living God. 
01:01:03
And then that was repeated by his disciples. He did not know that he was the son of God until 
01:01:09
that. So in the temptation part, he didn't find out because he didn't look the same. When, 
01:01:14
when Satan was Lucifer lived in heaven, Jesus didn't look like Jesus Christ. He was the word. 
01:01:20
He was a spiritual being, a spiritual body. He had all of his arms and legs and everything, 
01:01:24
but his very features changed when he had flesh put on him. They didn't take, 
01:01:30
they didn't take the appearance of the word. That's his name. They didn't take those features 
01:01:35
and put them on. He had to be born to the womb of a woman. And so that's when, then when he had 
01:01:41
that his body, then that body developed its own image, which he still has that body now. 
01:01:47
So that's one way that Satan didn't have a clue who he was because he knew what he looked like 
01:01:52
when he was in heaven. Wow. Can we, can we do a couple more questions? We're at an hour. The time 
01:01:59
goes by just so fast. Okay. Edmund is 13 and he wants to know, can you change your age in heaven 
01:02:06
or will I always look and behave a certain age of maturity? Nobody looks old in heaven. So let 
01:02:14
me just say that. If you die, go to heaven. You look like you're in your 20s. Your spiritual body 
01:02:18
looks like it's in its 20s. There is no age in heaven because there is no time in heaven. 
01:02:24
Nothing decays. I think it's old just so that you understand that. So no matter what age you were on 
01:02:30
the earth, normally when you die and go to heaven, unless you're young, because if you were young, 
01:02:36
when you passed away, you would still be that young in heaven. And you would actually stay that young 
01:02:42
until I think probably until the dead in Christ are raised. And when your mother passes away, when 
01:02:49
she's ready to Jesus to take her, she will finish raising you in heaven. So if you're young, when 
01:02:55
you die, you look young in heaven. But if you're older, when you die, you look young in heaven. 
01:03:00
Everybody's young. And so that, that I can, I can just tell you that. And I think, yes, I have seen 
01:03:07
people, a lot of people want to be like a child. And there is a place you go to. It's a fun place 
01:03:14
in heaven where you can be younger. Let's say you died and you were 90, but you want to be like, 
01:03:20
and you normally look like you're in your 20s, but what if you want to be five again? This place, 
01:03:25
when you go to, when you step into the boundaries of the place, she would, let's say, it's a woman 
01:03:29
she wanted to be five, you would be five while you were in there. But when you came back out of that 
01:03:34
place, because it's like sort of like an amusement park, you can be five, play like a five-year-old 
01:03:39
lap. You still know who you are. Sometimes friends go together and do that. And it's a lot of fun. 
01:03:44
I haven't done that. But when I go to heaven, I look eight, just so you know that. So. Oh, wow. 
01:03:50
Oh, almost every time I'm taken, when I get there and eight, they want me to understand this is why 
01:03:57
he's going to speak to me like what he would say, explain revelation to an eight-year-old. 
01:04:03
That's why all the revelations are simple. None of them are, none of them are so, you know, 
01:04:09
brainiac that you couldn't understand what I was saying. If some wise person who is studying 
01:04:15
university for 30 years explains something, you'd be wondering, well, what the stuff is so detailed, 
01:04:20
I can't understand it. He wanted people to understand like a child. So that's why he makes 
01:04:25
me eight. And I look eight when I'm there. I remember I was, I was interviewing Kim, 
01:04:31
Kim Robinson, and she said that she was, she would see the, the people hold hands like the 
01:04:37
father and the daughter. And the daughter would, she said, would, before they entered this, like 
01:04:42
circus tent would go down to like five or eight years old. And so it's like you're saying, there's 
01:04:48
places you can go or yes, it was probably a amusement park, probably. Yeah. She talked about 
01:04:54
the circus and how you can go with your parents and you can actually be like a little kid again. 
01:04:59
Yes. So that's really cool. Okay. That part is, that part, you can, you can do that. 
01:05:06
Yes. That's amazing. God is so wonderful in all his ways and so creative and beyond what we can 
01:05:14
think or imagine, right? Right. So Annette asks, what happens when people with special needs die? 
01:05:21
Is there anything special for them based on their disabilities? Yes, you don't have them anymore. 
01:05:27
Praise God. Amen. There are no blind people, crippled people, sick people, handicapped people. 
01:05:35
They don't, they're not there. You are made whole. If you're sick and you're in the hospital, 
01:05:40
you're not doing well. I don't know, maybe you lost a limb or something. The day you pass away 
01:05:47
and your spirit man stepped out of this physical body, no matter what infirmities or handicaps 
01:05:52
that had, you have none and there are none in heaven. So nobody has to have crutches or wheelchairs 
01:06:01
or none of that exists in heaven. Do you know what, Jen? I said no down syndrome, no autism. 
01:06:05
No down syndrome, no autism, no, none of it, none of it. Your brain is perfect. Your physical, 
01:06:12
mental, emotional is made perfect. Wow. That's awesome. That's, that's a great answer for you, 
01:06:21
Annette. Jesse asks, how does the sea of forgetfulness work? I just know that that's where the 
01:06:30
father puts all the sins that he forgives. You know, whenever you repent of sins, he takes those 
01:06:40
and they're put, it's not on, it's not in heaven. It's outside of heaven. And I haven't seen it 
01:06:47
itself, but I know that's what they do. It's sent there and the father, when he sends it, 
01:06:52
is never remembered because he's the judge. He also is a judge in heaven and judges things in 
01:06:59
heaven. And Christ also is involved in this whole thing when somebody repents to Christ 
01:07:06
for all their sins. Those sins are taken to the father, so he has evidence that they repented. 
01:07:12
That's why they do it. Then the father sends them to the sea of forgetfulness and he doesn't 
01:07:17
remember them. You can't even bring up these sins. He'd be thinking, why are you doing that? 
01:07:22
I don't even know that. I don't even know what that is. I don't remember that. And he did, 
01:07:25
he did it on purpose, so it wouldn't dwell in his soul. So if you have repented of your sins, 
01:07:32
don't talk about them anymore. Don't tell people, you know, if you have a, you're having a meeting 
01:07:39
in a church and you want to give you a personal testimony, that would be okay. But don't run 
01:07:43
around telling everybody else, you know, I used to do this. I used to take drugs, use the steal 
01:07:47
from people. I'm like, don't say that because then you're living in your past. You are a new creation, 
01:07:53
new meaning. None of that is a part of you anymore. Talk about the new creation you are. 
01:07:58
You know, I used to say, but no more sins, not a part of my life. I have living a holy because 
01:08:03
of Jesus Christ. What he did for me, I totally gave all that back to him and it's gone. It's gone. 
01:08:12
And someone asked on here too, if I could find it, because I read all these questions before, 
01:08:16
someone asked about your soul, if I could find this, because is it important to, you know, 
01:08:22
when you repent, you're, is that loosing it from your soul when you're repenting? Or should it, 
01:08:29
maybe if you're still dwelling on it, should you lose it from your soul? Well, you shouldn't be 
01:08:34
dwelling on it, but when you repent of your sins, okay, it is automatically the sin which abides in 
01:08:43
you by the way, until the day you repent of it, it's in you that sin is to lend you. And once 
01:08:50
you repent of it, it's taken away from you, it's taken out of you. So I would tell people, don't 
01:08:55
let the enemy try to bring it back. He will try to bring those images back to you, say, 
01:08:59
no, I've repented. That's not a part of me anymore. I would actually tell people to say that. 
01:09:05
But no, once you, once you at repentance, you wouldn't necessarily have to lose it from your 
01:09:10
soul. You just to have, if the devil tries to bring it back, say, no, it's gone. And just say 
01:09:15
that we hope it's gone. And then he'll just give up. So, but when you've repented of something, 
01:09:20
it's not something you can dwell on. But I promise you, if you have sin as a believer, 
01:09:25
you will think about it all the time until, this is after you've repented to Christ. And you're now 
01:09:31
a believer. You're someone set free from the sin. It's then removed from you. You're clean on the 
01:09:37
inside. Your soul, your spirit man has nothing in it. None of the sin is in there for you to think 
01:09:42
about or choose again. You're free. You're free. You've been made free by the blood of Jesus Christ. 
01:09:49
Don't let anything come back up to you. The enemy is the one trying to do that. So don't 
01:09:54
believe him. Just tell me he's a liar. You don't do that anymore. But once you've been set free at 
01:09:59
the time of repentance, usually people don't just lose from their soul. They've already just spoken. 
01:10:05
You're actually speaking to Christ. He reaches in and takes it out. But anytime after you've been 
01:10:11
born again and you sin, you do need to repent of it because if you don't, it'll stay in there. 
01:10:18
And you'll think about it all the time and over and over again, then the same will begin to beat 
01:10:21
you up. Look at you. You're supposed to be righteous. Now you've sinned. You've lost it. You might as 
01:10:25
well just throw your life into them. Just give it to me. That's what he'd like to say. So you can't 
01:10:32
let sin ruin your life. That's why it's important. And the Bible says, since grace abounds, should 
01:10:39
sin abound, should sin abound. And he says, God forbid, that's the answer when they're asking 
01:10:46
the disciples, you know, because grace is here and we're saved by grace. Can I go out and sin now 
01:10:53
because I've been forgiven? And they're asked what they're actually asking. And the answer to them 
01:10:57
in the Bible is God forbid. Yeah. That means God doesn't want you to do it. Can't you wonder? No, 
01:11:03
don't go sin. Because then you will be unrighteous. Yes. To the blood of Christ is unrighteous when 
01:11:10
you sin. And there are people who preach once forgiven, always forgiven. That does not say 
01:11:15
that in the Bible. Yes. It says, if you, if you have sin, right, so now you're unrighteous, 
01:11:23
well, Christ forgive you. And he says, yes, Christ will forgive you and cleanse you from 
01:11:27
all unrighteousness when you repent. That's what the word says. If they've left this in the Bible, 
01:11:32
that I can let you know for sure that's what the Bible says. No, don't sin. But if you have, 
01:11:37
go repent to Christ and then he will take it out of you and then you will be righteous. 
01:11:42
Yes. If you sin as a Christian, yes, you're unrighteous because you sin. If you don't want to be 
01:11:49
unrighteous, you repent and then the sin is removed. And that is probably one of the most 
01:11:54
important messages that should be preached in every single church. Yes, I agree. Because you know why 
01:12:01
if you sin and you don't repent, the devil will get you to do it again. And when he keeps doing 
01:12:07
this, you'll sin worse and worse and worse because you never repented for the first sin 
01:12:12
that you did. So the sin out of you is very easy. You just recount and you can get to a place 
01:12:20
where you actually live holy. I do not sin. I do not sin at all. I choose not to sin. It says, 
01:12:27
be holy as he is holy, be perfect. If it wasn't possible to live that way, he would have said so. 
01:12:34
So yes, you can. Don't point at the past. The Bible says all have sinned and come 
01:12:41
short of the glory of God. But did you ever realize what the scripture is actually saying? 
01:12:47
What sin was that coming short of the glory, meaning because you have sinned, you will not 
01:12:53
produce glory for God. You can't get the glory and then later impart the glory. The glory is a 
01:12:59
very extremely important thing. When you sin, it will be taken from you. You can't carry the glory 
01:13:06
because you have sin in your life. So that scripture that everybody uses to say, everybody's a sinner, 
01:13:13
that's not what it means. The sin departs in. That's past tense for all have sinned at one time 
01:13:20
in your life. You sin and you're in short of the glory of God at that point. But when you repent, 
01:13:26
it removes all of it. And then when you do God, you are creating glory for him because you are 
01:13:32
righteous. The glory builds in you. You can say to Christ, I give it to you, but he's going to make 
01:13:37
you wear it. You take it because the Bible says the knowledge and knowing and understanding of 
01:13:45
what the glory is, it will be demonstrated all over this earth, just like the waters come to see 
01:13:51
what this earth is to. There's water. Another was what they're saying is you will many times carry that 
01:13:56
glory to different places and you would release it from yourself. It causes a shockwave of glory 
01:14:02
penetrating buildings and cities and people and it begins to change their heart and what they think 
01:14:08
about Christ. So the glory, how do I know that you do that? Christ in you is the hope of glory. 
01:14:18
The hope that you will prove it, that you will carry it and that you will impart it to change places. 
01:14:23
That's what Christ, that's what that scripture is, it's revelation. So all this needs to be understood. 
01:14:30
It's the beginning. You can pursue a greater relationship with Christ. Amen. 
01:14:35
Every day of your life, not the sin. Amen. And even in John 17, Jesus says, 
01:14:42
he gives us the same glory that the Father has given him. So that he tells us, I've given them 
01:14:47
the same glory. That's right. It's amazing. Well, Kat, thank you so much for all, there's so many 
01:14:54
more questions that are, I mean, I could be on with you for, I could take three hours of your day, 
01:14:59
but I know you're busy. So thank you so much for being on with us today. And would you pray for 
01:15:05
everybody before we close? Yes. Father, I pray for all those watching God and those who will watch 
01:15:11
later that they know you, like your son knows you, that they understand your heart for them, 
01:15:18
that you do know what's going on in this world, but you have a plan to change it. 
01:15:25
I thank you, Father, for loving us to bring justice, really powerful justice, not just to 
01:15:31
America, but to every single country. There are believers all over this world crying out for you 
01:15:36
to help and to do something about the evil. He's so intense to do that. So Father, right now, 
01:15:42
I just impart the life of God, the presence of God, the power of God, authority over the enemy. 
01:15:52
He is your doormat. He is not your king. I release an impartation of the presence of the Lord, 
01:16:01
the joy of the Lord, His will, His way, that this day you will run after Him and know Him 
01:16:09
and know that He will come to get you. The day your day is up on this earth, He will come to get 
01:16:15
you. He will take you home to heaven and walk you up the steps of the throne and your celebration 
01:16:21
will begin then because in heaven you exist to live. Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Oh, Kat, thank you so 
01:16:32
much. Wow, it's like waves when you pray. I feel like waves of the glory. Would you share how 
01:16:40
everyone, I know we have revealingheaven.com on the screen now, but I know you also have another 
01:16:45
website where people can find your stuff. Yes, it is called Katcur.com. Is it the Katcur? 
01:16:56
There we have it on the screen. Oh, it's on there. Okay, that's good. Yeah. 
01:17:00
Facebook page is the Katcur. Okay, no, but this is on the other website. It's just Katcur.com. 
01:17:06
That is what I call a spiritual platform for the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to say what they 
01:17:12
want to, whenever they want to, and I post it there. There's videos you can watch of some of 
01:17:17
the interviews I've had with people. There's, I think there may be testimonies on there, 
01:17:21
but there's many videos you can watch that teaches you how to pray for your family over 
01:17:25
certain things, how to declare things for him, how to know more revelation. So it's a really 
01:17:31
awesome place. There is a gallery on there where I have created images of what it looks like in the 
01:17:36
spirit realm, places in heaven that you can enjoy and see. So that is what that's about. It is also 
01:17:44
the only place on the earth you can give to me online is at Katcur.com. And by the way, 
01:17:51
I need to let people know there is a new fake Facebook page and it's called Prophet Katcur. 
01:17:59
I don't ever put anything that is not my Facebook page. My Facebook page is the Katcur. 
01:18:08
And so if it doesn't say the Katcur, then that's not my page. Even though it's got my face on it, 
01:18:14
people just stole my image. And usually they'll say send money to this group for this and send 
01:18:19
money. They'll give you a link. And what they're trying to do is rip off your money. So we make 
01:18:24
a place for you to give online if you want to. As I said, it's called Katcur.com and you can click 
01:18:30
on the information about the guardian zone, which is what we call, I'm actually wearing a guardian 
01:18:36
zone, a pin right here today on purpose. This is what people receive when they give to me on a 
01:18:42
monthly basis or an annual basis, whatever you want to do. And we send out gifts. We already 
01:18:48
send out our first wave of gifts. We have some more we're going to be sending out. And I'm so 
01:18:51
grateful to all of you. And you have something for me to show Jen. Oh, one of the things we're 
01:18:57
doing right now is we are creating a lot of new images to put on, on our, on our, in our store, 
01:19:03
on Kat, on the rebel, okay. Revealing money.com. Because the last calendar we did was all about 
01:19:14
two, two events that will happen on this called the fire and the glory. And that calendar is all 
01:19:19
about baptism and fire, which will happen. And also the glory I just talked to you about beginning 
01:19:26
to impart the glory and places that you go to this calendar was done for that purpose. So the 
01:19:31
father has put images. We have an image of the father sitting on a throne, the commissioning 
01:19:37
throne room, not the main throne room. We have a picture of Christ with fire in his eyes. So we 
01:19:43
also created an image of the invisible being the third member of the family called the Holy Spirit. 
01:19:50
So I'm going to show you that image. And it looks like an invisible being coming through a fiery 
01:19:55
portal. One thing that is always around when Holy Spirit is, is the fire, the fire is like a fire. 
01:20:02
And he carries that fiery crease portals to go through to come to the earth and other places. 
01:20:07
So here is that image right here. It may be shiny. I gotta move it over there. 
01:20:17
So that is the invisible spirit of God. You know, he does have a body. He has a whole real body. 
01:20:23
It is invisible and having you see the outline of his body, you see the outline of him. And so 
01:20:29
there's a fiery portal he came through and it says right here, yeah, it says Holy Spirit, 
01:20:35
invisible and something with fire, filled with fire. But at the bottom of the top says live Holy, 
01:20:43
because when you live Holy, here's what it says, be dangerous against hell. There you go. Amen. 
01:20:53
We have these posters available now on our store. They're not, this is on phone court and you can 
01:20:59
take like Office Max or Office Depot and they can take that poster and put it on phone court. 
01:21:06
It's a really high quality poster and it is that big that we send it to you. So 
01:21:13
the father wanted it to be released. So that's what we have. That's new. We also have these cups 
01:21:18
that are new. Let's say the coffee cups, hot tea, coffee. I put, I get a hot chocolate or a coke in 
01:21:24
it and I don't drink a lot of coke people just so you know that. We have many new images. I think 
01:21:32
we also showed this before already. If I can get a hold of this one underneath here, I can show you. 
01:21:38
I think these all have, this one might not. Here we go. It does. This is shiny, but we 
01:21:44
thought people would love to see. I talked so much about the portal in heaven where all your family 
01:21:47
comes to see you and if I can get this, I'll use this one. Where they come to watch your life, 
01:21:55
declare over you, pray for you and this is it right here and that is actually in heaven. 
01:22:01
That's where they go. If they want to see what babies are born, when marriages happen, they don't 
01:22:06
miss it on, miss any of that stuff. They go on your birthday every year to this place in heaven 
01:22:11
and they lean over a balcony and they actually sing happy birthday to you. So that looks like 
01:22:17
a really big building cat. It's massive. It's massive. At the bottom of those columns, you see 
01:22:23
like screens, like the media screen, but the ones on the one side will show you when your family 
01:22:30
member is going to, it's got born again and on the other side of the room, those screens show 
01:22:35
you when they're about to come to heaven. That's how people know to meet you at the gate. So this 
01:22:41
is now, not in the scene or all the angels flying overhead in this place, beautiful angels in there 
01:22:47
and angels even go to with people and they regard an angel. Sometimes they will go to 
01:22:54
to stand next to your family members. They declare over you. So they haven't forgotten you. 
01:22:59
Your family love you probably more in heaven than they ever did on this earth. They're declaring 
01:23:04
over you. They're praying for you. The angels are heaven is cheering you on in your life in this 
01:23:09
race we run from Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you, Kat, so much for being with us today. Make sure 
01:23:17
you guys don't follow any fake accounts and just a general rule for Facebook and Instagram. Don't 
01:23:24
give money that way. Go to the minister's website or a secure place to give money. And Kat, we love 
01:23:33
you just, we love you so, so much. We love all your team. Hello to everybody behind the scenes 
01:23:38
there with you. I know there's a bunch of people there. We love you guys too so much. Make sure 
01:23:48
that everyone joins us tomorrow. Steve will be here with Mike Thompson. You don't want to miss it. 
01:23:55
Have an awesome day and we'll see you tomorrow. God bless. Bye. 
01:24:25
you

Good morning from the Pacific Northwest. I'm Steve Schultz, founder along with my wife of both the Elijah List, 
01:24
ElijahList.com and Elijah Streams that you're watching. You see flowers behind me. We are celebrating today the 100th episode of Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. 
01:36
So we're going to talk about that in just one second, talk about that a little bit more and then of course Kat's got some great message for today and some questions and answers. 
01:45
So if we have time, so it's going to be a great fun, fun filled day, but welcome to the broadcast a very quick announcement. 
01:54
Let's see. First of all, Cash Patel will be back with us tomorrow. So don't miss that as far as far as profits and Patriots, but we're going to do American Warriors real quick. 
02:04
So let me read this to you. Paul Lesher, Lesher, I hope I'm saying that right, was a young man enraged by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and quickly enlisted in the army. 
02:16
He found himself on the front lines of World War II in Europe, directly fighting some of the biggest battles of the war coming face to face with Germans behind enemy lines. 
02:28
He has some fascinating stories to tell and this is part of it. Go ahead. 
02:33
So we had to be frequently behind enemy lines or you might say ahead of our lines. 
02:48
There was hell and destruction everywhere with Grant, but we were here in the southern area and we were sent back up to the Battle of the Bulge and that's where it was so cold it was colder and it had been in a long, long time. 
03:16
But it's a good thing we were as young and healthy as we were or we wouldn't have made it. 
03:33
Wow, great story. You got to see today's episode of American Warriors and here are the places to look on Rumble where American Warriors 22 where you can just type American Warriors at Rumble on YouTube. 
03:47
It's American Warriors 22 or just type American Warriors on YouTube and you'll be right there. 
03:53
So my brother and I produce these together. It's a great, these are great stories. Many of them give glory to God. 
04:01
And you hear, you know, it's, it's, it's good to honor those who went before us and fought for our freedom. You know, we were attacked on December 7, December 7, 1941. 
04:15
And the world was never the same. So we are in crucial times even now. So this, this is good to remember those who went ahead of us and fought for us. 
04:25
We honor, we honor, I just put his name down, but we honor him. So, all right, well, it's time to bring in. 
04:35
It's time to bring in Kat for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. So here we go. 
04:57
Well, Kat, we're 100 today. 
05:00
That's amazing. Isn't it 100 weeks? 
05:03
We are 100. Yeah. 100 shows, 100 weeks. I see the blue, they added a balloon since I last saw you. Boy, your, your, your balloons there are, are multiplying. 
05:13
I have flowers that were sent, these flowers behind me were sent as a celebration and they pre gave me my cake. We're going to show your cake in a minute. 
05:22
Here's my chocolate cake. Look at this piece. This is one piece. 
05:26
One slice. Wow. 
05:29
I may take a bite, but this is the actual full cake. Happy 100. 
05:34
Yummy. 
05:35
They sent that to me. So they, they gave you a cake. Let's bring your cake in and show it to me while I take a bite. 
05:41
Oh man, this is so good. 
05:42
This is the cake right here. 
05:44
Oh, look at that. 
05:46
What does it say Jen? 
05:47
It says eat cake. 
05:49
And this chocolate also, there you go. One hundredth episode it says. 
05:59
That's so good. You know, they call, they call, there you go. You know, they call white cake, angel food cake, but I think chocolate cake is actually angel food cake. 
06:14
So really? 
06:16
I'm just gonna, I'm determined that. So, Hey, so you've seen Jesus love, love sweets. What kind of cake does he like? 
06:23
All cakes. 
06:26
He loves sweets. He really does love sweets. And I think one of the things, believe it or not, that really changed the way I thought of life in the throne room was the time they took me in there and there were sweets lined up about 50 steps up to the 
06:44
Wow. Are you serious? 
06:46
The summer sitting there, he was eating a piece of cake. 
06:51
People on earth probably would think, Oh no, that would never happen. Yes, it would. It's a family. We're a family up there. And God is our father. He has all these kids that would be coming home, his sons and daughters, and they do plan amazing events. 
07:05
Some of them are fun. 
07:07
That is so good. And in heaven, you don't gain weight. 
07:11
Right now, if I just look at this cake, I gain weight. 
07:15
So, oh my goodness. Well, you know, happy 100th episode, you know, little did we know two, two years ago, just right at, right at the two year anniversary where, or Johnny, some of you have heard me say Johnny and low text to me, he says you're supposed to do 10 days in a row with cat curve before the 
07:35
show. So I said, Oh, I did the forest gum thing where I go. Okay, you know, I didn't know. I didn't know if you would say yes, we weren't doing this that we weren't doing daily shows at the time. 
07:46
And so you said yes, and we jumped in and God just breathed on this thing and put his favor and this ministry has exploded. I assume yours has too. 
07:58
Yes, it has. It's just been an amazing ride. So what else tell us something else about 
08:04
this? I think I also mentioned at one time, the father actually have been talking to me since you told me about what Johnny and love said, that you probably need to do more than just the 10 so don't be surprised. 
08:16
Yes, just don't be surprised. Well, I was surprised and here we are 100 weeks later, while just thinks the how much the world and the body of Christ has received revelation about having itself, how they operate. 
08:32
What the Father, Son and Holy Spirit look like what their actions are activities, how they operate heaven, and things to come and revelation on things from the past has filled the heart and the soul of so many probably millions of people by now. 
08:47
All over the world have been changed because you listen to God and Johnny and low and so it was so fun. By the way, in case anyone wonders, I've no only known about this cake just it got delivered about 10 o'clock today. 
09:01
Or maybe 930 somewhere in there. And I thank my staff, Dennis, Julie, all those that were involved in the whole staff. 
09:10
I had talked about doing something on the 100th but I didn't know I was going to get cake and my favorite cake of all angel food cake, which is chocolate cake is my very favorite. 
09:22
Yeah, the whole world and I just found out about just now. Wow. Yeah, because when you found out I use. I said I think there's a cake for you and you go where's my cake. 
09:36
That was hilarious. I love it. So well, God is in a celebratory mood and you did say just before he went on the air, you said they're eating cake in the throne room and I said did you just see that. 
09:47
And you said yeah, they're eating cake everyone in their thousands and thousands and thousands of people can fit into the throne room of God, and they all have cake. 
10:00
Yeah, you know, there was a coming victory which to them you have to understand they've already been there. 
10:07
Yeah, I say the coming victory is the coming victory for us, but they have already been in the victory since they go to the beginning to the end and the end of the beginning. They've already seen it happen people. 
10:18
So yes, yeah, we'll be celebrating and eating cake soon. And when you do I'll be doing it with all of you. 
10:24
Awesome, awesome, awesome. Well, you know, there was a time if you go back seven, eight years ago about the time I met you. 
10:31
I thought I don't know if I wouldn't have known about this cake thing, but you talked about amusement parks and I'm going I don't know I'd like to believe that but I don't know well I have no, you know, in the ensuing days I have in years in this case I have no question whatsoever that 
10:50
God has fun that God eats cake that God has enjoyable times. You've talked about extreme sports and you've even talked about people that love cars will car collect and people have will have their. 
11:03
Can it be said that people have hobbies in heaven would that be a thing. 
11:09
Yeah, I think what they do the most in heaven is what their hobby was on the earth. We all carry a gift in us. When he sends us he already puts in his mind to photographer that's actually I am a photographer that's where I really am that's what he made me. 
11:25
That's where he sent me to earth as a photographer when I go ahead and have a I have my own studio and do supernatural things with photography. I will wait. I will wait. So that's what you do the thing. 
11:39
The most the passion that you have that way. His purpose always was he said your gifts are without repentance, which means he's and you're not he's not going to take him away because that's what you will do in heaven. 
11:51
Whether you sing, whether you teach dance, whether you have rodeos, you know, they have movies in heaven, they capture them, they don't have to produce them to actually capture them. 
12:02
And what you see is live action in heaven. Now you have to have heaven they don't even have to have what do you call the ratings. 
12:10
They're all G rated or fun rated. There's fun rated. There's excitement, intensity, beauty, wonder, splendor in all of the movies made in heaven and even music in them just by signing up in heaven for them. 
12:24
You see a lot of people that was their gift on the earth doing that in heaven. If they receive Jesus Christ as a savior, you will surely use your gift. 
12:32
I have been working in Christmas Town, my brother writing music and playing music in heaven. My dad is running over heaven probably helping God with things. 
12:41
Or it's the M.M. Parks that will be mobile mansion parks. I know what they're doing because that was their passion. 
12:47
You know, you and I are not that different as far as photography when I was part of the photography club in high school, the annual on the annual team. And then I did portrait photography for not a living for a second income. 
13:03
I did weddings and I did portraits, but you know, yours was nature, which I love, but dreams better at that than I am. But I was a portrait guy. I wanted to capture portraits in a way that that would be, you know, very, very complimentary and creative. 
13:21
So, you know, I don't know if I'll do that in heaven or not, but we'll see, I guess. 
13:25
I'm sure you will if you love it that much. 
13:28
Yeah. Yeah, I think, you know, there was sick. There's a family of eight, six kids. And I was the first one to get a camera. You know, back in those days, you had that little brownie or the little thing camera. 
13:39
You write about this big. Yeah, do anything with the lens, but take a picture the way that lens is made. Yeah, stationary. You couldn't do any enhancements on your photography. 
13:50
Yeah. And mostly in the beginning black and white film in the beginning. Yeah. 
13:55
Yeah. And then when color came out, it was so amazing and you'd have either people don't understand who come up today where they even take unlimited photos. 
14:03
You had 24 or 36 exposures. And I remember this, even the smell of that film and it just smells so good, fresh film, you know, and you'd put it in there and you'd take very careful, but you didn't get to see him sometimes for weeks later. 
14:19
I love the way it is now better. But I but you but it's missing the the smell of the film and I of course I'd work in the dark room and I would, you know, you do all the creative things with the with in the dark room that was 
14:32
you know, I still have a it's called s is that camera like the 35 millimeters were the first ones made that had a 35 millimeter lens, which means you got better pictures. If you want to enhance them, you bought different colored lenses and screw them on the front of the camera. 
14:48
Blue, yellow to cause different effects for your camera. That's called SLR cameras, single lens reflex, which means you really put a different until it came up, of course, with the with the camera. 
15:02
Well, they got it. Well, now they call him a DSLR. So it's a digital SLR. 
15:06
Now look at it right after you take it. Yeah, they combine it. When I was at summer camp, you know, I met Doreen the third year I was a summer camp. But the first two years I pioneered the photography program for the campers. 
15:21
So that's awesome. The photography, they would pay to take that class. And we would have them all take their pictures and then I would go in the dark room and develops color slide film. And then on Saturday night, we on Saturday night, we show. Yeah, on the Saturday night, we show the slides with music. 
15:38
It was all different. Oh, I did. I did. It was fun. You know, everyone looked forward to Saturday night where we see the slides for that for that week. It was very, very fun. 
15:49
You know, so. 
15:51
Well, even now, we have, we have so many different cameras and all kinds of attachments and stuff like that. 
16:00
We, when we do a cruise, when we speak on a cruise, we have workshops, one of those workshops is basic photography workshop. 
16:08
Everybody's encouraged to bring your camera user phones. We teach them how to take the best pictures of their crews and how to use light, how to stand people properly. And we love it, except actually using our gifts. 
16:21
So yeah, we still do that. 
16:23
I didn't know you did that on the cruise. Oh, wow. 
16:25
We do. We do. 
16:26
Wow, that's very, very good. Yeah, it was fun fun. I had a deal with Kodak where Kodak sent me their best teaching materials and it was professionally produced. 
16:36
It was fun. Photography was a lot of fun, you know, and so, yeah, it's hard to get that. Oh, I love the smell of photography developing. 
16:46
It was so good. 
16:48
Yeah, it's kind of a, well, you know, it's got, it's got, you know, the developer, the, you see, it's the developer, the fixer, and then there's, there's a third one. 
16:57
And now it's, it's, I'm rusty on it now. There's three chemicals and you put them through that. But you had, you had techniques back then, especially in black and white with dodging and burning. 
17:08
If something was underexposed, you, you'd cover everything else and expose it more during the. 
17:14
I love even just talking about photography, but I don't do as much. 
17:19
I only, the only thing to take pictures of now is teaching people how to do it or I do host, I take pictures of the host. 
17:27
And we also teach a workshop, host ID. And we teach you through the film and the pictures that I've taken, what a real cloud formation is or what activity in the spirit realm is. 
17:38
And then what the host looked like. 
17:40
Which is awesome. Then we go outside and we do it on the cruise ship too. And everybody, the hosts have gathered and they all take pictures. 
17:48
So now Kat is what I understand is people's hobbies and gifts. 
17:54
They are just as much as you and I are, are, are talking about the fun with photographer. They would photography. 
18:02
They would be talking about the same thing in heaven with cars. You said cars. 
18:07
Take into an antique car show, but the cars were not actually old. Nothing ages in the spirit realm. There's no aging. So that was the, they were really awesome looking cars. 
18:18
Some are new designs. Some are very old designs. You know, God can remake anything he wants to. 
18:23
And this person on the earth, that's what they did. That was their gift to create car shows, some old, some futuristic ones. 
18:31
And when they died and went to heaven, he already had a place made for them with his special places to put on shows and stuff with the cars. 
18:38
And I know you all are probably saying, well, what about, what about preaching the gospel? What about soul winning? 
18:43
Number one, there's no soul winning in heaven. 
18:45
Right. 
18:46
While you're there. 
18:47
It's done. 
18:48
You have to understand the five fold ministry is not used much. It was made for the earth. 
18:54
That was set in place so God could have some structure to the five fold ministry and they would understand what that was and what their part in that was. 
19:02
And that was specialized in a certain field. Like they would do revivals. They would do healing ministries. They would do teaching. 
19:09
They would share the word of God and teach it. All kinds of different things with the five fold ministry on the earth. 
19:14
But in heaven, you already have that and you haven't even already got all that. 
19:18
The one thing they do in heaven is you go to the royal university, which teaches you what ruling and reigning with Christ through all of eternity. 
19:26
What they will look like. It'll be caring for some things that they will take us and let us do. 
19:31
So that part is still there. That part of it will be there. But mostly there's no soul winning. 
19:36
Nobody has to get filled with the Holy Spirit. 
19:38
She's right there next to you talking. 
19:40
So you have to think what else is there then? 
19:43
And people have for centuries said, well, we're going to worship. 
19:46
And every church you ever went to would talk about, well, I'll get together. 
19:49
There are crowns in the street. We'll all bow down for all eternity. 
19:52
And I had people who actually thought heaven would be boring. 
19:55
And I went, no, with a God that created that made this search, it's got to be more than that. 
20:00
That was before they started taking me to heaven. 
20:02
And boy, is there a lot more than that. 
20:04
And the father said, I can't leave the fun side out. 
20:07
If I'm your father and you are coming home as sons and daughters, 
20:12
I would have to have places prepared for you to have fun. And he did. 
20:17
So what he did was whatever gift he gave you, whether it could be singing, creating music, 
20:23
it could be baking. That is an art in heaven, baking or food preparation. 
20:28
Restaurants are there because people owned them on the earth, wanted them, always wanted them. 
20:32
They create some different clothing and apparel. 
20:35
I was going to ask you about that. 
20:37
I was going to ask you about that a minute ago. 
20:41
So if someone says, I love to make clothes or I love to fashion clothes, you know, 
20:46
you said that I did, I did a show, which I did every week. 
20:50
So someone that makes clothes would do a fashion show in heaven. 
20:54
That's right. They would make things and then they'd have a show. 
20:58
And then they would give them away because nobody pays for anything in heaven. 
21:02
You use your gift for everybody in heaven, no matter what that is. 
21:06
There's campgrounds in heaven. 
21:08
There's the places to go and the mountain of spices or things to do, you know, 
21:12
in the valley of the falls, there's all kinds of things to do there. 
21:15
And the other places I was shown in heaven, most of them were for having family time 
21:21
because you still spend time with your family in heaven and do things together. 
21:25
You meet new people, have new friends. 
21:27
You're always, always a fellow shipping. 
21:30
Fellow shipping doesn't mean you just sit around a table and eat. 
21:32
It means you're going to different events that are going on in heaven all the time. 
21:36
And there's throne room activity where you get so undone when you worship, 
21:39
you're caught up into the air in the throne room and you get totally undone 
21:44
with the ways and the love of God consuming you. 
21:47
And you were so glad that Christ died on the cross for us. 
21:51
We had an opportunity. 
21:53
We came from heaven. We lived in the Father. 
21:56
He made a way back to him and that's what the Bible says. 
21:59
And that was by his son giving himself to carry all sin, evil and wickedness. 
22:03
Nail it to the cross so you could choose him to forgive your sins 
22:07
and then you would have a way back to heaven. 
22:09
And forever and ever and ever be together with all those you love 
22:13
and those who you only take to heaven people. 
22:15
You can't take things to heaven. 
22:17
You don't need them number one. 
22:19
He's got so much stuff up there for you, but you won't need. 
22:21
But souls you can take. 
22:23
Those you share the gospel with, when to Christ. 
22:26
You know your family members who know Christ. 
22:28
And you're together forever and ever. 
22:30
They may have left you, they have moved to heaven early and you're not there. 
22:34
And I know people really sorrow, but because of releasing Revelation on heaven itself 
22:39
it really has helped with the grief thing. 
22:42
People actually consider the family members doing things all over heaven 
22:45
preparing them for them to come one day and be with them. 
22:48
Even all the little babies, every single little baby that passed. 
22:52
They're all in heaven. 
22:54
And if they're yours, they will be waiting for you when you get there. 
22:57
So good. Now I know we're going to talk about things about Halloween, 
23:00
things in just a moment, but one last question. 
23:03
Is there photography and cars and sewing and shows in heaven 
23:10
because it was on earth first, or is it the other way around? 
23:14
It is the other way around. 
23:16
Everything is says in the Bible, 
23:18
every good and perfect gift comes down from the father of life. 
23:24
That would be God our Father. We were little lights living in him. 
23:28
He timed our birth on the earth. 
23:31
He knew the gift we would carry and would use even on this earth. 
23:35
So you use it because it is there. God did already have it in heaven. 
23:39
Of course, there's nothing defiling, nothing profane, 
23:42
nothing like that exists in heaven. 
23:44
None of the movies have any horror stuff or any of the wicked stuff. 
23:48
None of that's in heaven. 
23:49
But the gift he put in you with it was making the best spaghetti sauce on the earth. 
23:53
That's what you'll do in heaven. That is your gift. 
23:56
That's why there's surf parks. 
23:58
That's why there's all kinds of things to do together with your family. 
24:02
Places to go with the Lord, to be alone with the Lord and say things to him 
24:06
that you always wanted to say. 
24:07
Passionate paradise is about the love of God. 
24:10
It's a place he takes you to honor all the things you've done with your life. 
24:14
There are so many beautiful things to do up there. 
24:17
And places to go. There's adventure. There's excitement. 
24:21
And there's fun. It's part of heaven. 
24:24
It was always there. 
24:26
So good. So good. 
24:28
Paul didn't know what to say when he saw things. 
24:31
He didn't even know how to explain them because they didn't have them on the earth yet. 
24:34
Yeah, I mean, I can imagine him seeing an amusement park or old cars 
24:41
and saying, I've seen things that I'm not even allowed to tell you about. 
24:46
And I always thought, well, this must be something so holy that, 
24:50
but I'm now I'm beginning to wonder if it was just the simple things that there 
24:54
would be no good for such as photography, which didn't exist, you know, 
25:00
and fashion show. Say again. 
25:04
I was in the sky that you fly in the sky and heaven. 
25:08
That would really get him, I'm sure. 
25:11
Oh man, someday I'm going to ask him what all he saw. 
25:15
I want to know that answer. 
25:17
Well, we better jump into what you have for today. 
25:20
But this has been really fun going down. 
25:23
Some of this is memory lane, but I've got my cake here. 
25:26
I may take a bite, but anyway, 
25:31
jump in where you want to go and tell us what's on your heart for today. 
25:36
You know, God made this earth for a purpose. 
25:39
Number one, he wanted us to have a body when we lived in him. 
25:42
We had those spiritual bodies. 
25:44
He wanted to make it possible for us to have a physical body for all the time. 
25:48
So he made a physical. 
25:50
This whole, you know, this whole place out there in space is physical. 
25:55
What we can see, what we can send ships to, you know, 
25:59
space ships to and circle and take pictures. 
26:01
That is called the physical realm. 
26:03
Most of the most of the places are spiritual realm places, 
26:07
spiritual realm places. 
26:08
I stand with the Southern girl right now. 
26:10
Anyway, so he made this physical earth so you could have a physical body. 
26:16
So he came up with a whole plan for a man and a woman to get married, 
26:22
fall in love, get married and have a family. 
26:26
And at the time of conception from the man and the woman. 
26:31
Okay. 
26:32
And they knew each other's husband and wife. 
26:34
Then he would send a little spirit of life from himself. 
26:38
He says in the Bible, I knit you together in your mother's womb. 
26:42
He's not putting your arms and legs on. 
26:45
He's talking about knitting that little spiritual body to that dot of flesh. 
26:49
And your spirit man grows right along on the inside of your physical man. 
26:53
And then one day, whenever that day is, when you pass from this life, 
26:58
when you pass, when you die, that spirit man steps out of your physical body. 
27:03
It looks just like you. 
27:05
Okay. It has all of its thoughts and the memories of his family and all that stuff like that. 
27:10
And that spiritual body, that's what goes to heaven. 
27:13
Your flesh rests on the day the dead and Christ shall rise. 
27:17
That is your body. 
27:18
But it's not your spirit man and your soul that cannot die. 
27:22
It would never be sleeping anywhere. 
27:24
That's why they come to take you to heaven and heaven, which is a spiritual world. 
27:30
You have a spiritual mansion, all the stuff on your property is yours. 
27:33
Yes, you eat, you sit, you enjoy all the stuff God gave to you. 
27:37
Your family, your friends come, you go to other places and enjoy what God made for them. 
27:41
And it says those mansions are made not by human hands. 
27:45
I'm sure the Lord had a lot to do with the building and design of it. 
27:48
And they're great designers. 
27:50
Some is very supernatural. 
27:52
You know, that's what I would call it, very supernatural, even beyond what you call modern. 
27:56
But some is very beautiful and amazing. 
27:58
They know exactly what you want. 
28:00
So they had all that plan and it was going on fine till Satan got his face involved. 
28:07
Decided he was going to take over Earth since he was kicked out of heaven. 
28:10
I'll remind you all that Satan was kicked out on a lightning bolt. 
28:14
I've sure fried part of his brain, which is why some people who are evil can't think very well. 
28:20
You get around those evil people want to be a part of them. 
28:23
Something happens to your brain too. 
28:25
So have nothing to do with wicked evil people. 
28:27
I'm just like, you know, right now. 
28:29
He's going to take over heaven. 
28:30
He was kicked out the day in hell. 
28:32
He thought he would torture the son of God. 
28:35
That didn't go well either. 
28:37
You know, he failed again. 
28:38
He failed. 
28:39
Epic fail. 
28:40
Epic fail. 
28:41
Now people around this world because the wicked and the evil are going to fail miserably along with Satan. 
28:48
This is not the time for them to have their takeover. 
28:51
I'm not even sorry, but it's not time to take over. 
28:54
Although he's trying. 
28:55
He's going to fail miserably. 
28:57
Justice is coming. 
28:59
Holy Spirit is making me say that right now. 
29:02
Okay. 
29:03
So when Satan decided, I'm taking over, you know, remember some of the, the, the walker, the watcher angels were sent to the earth to help educate man. 
29:11
Some of them decided to follow Satan. 
29:13
They became worshiped as gods on the earth to introduce human sacrifice, all kinds of black arts and magic and stuff that came from Satan today in this world. 
29:24
The wicked evil stuff going on is from one being. 
29:28
His name is Satan. 
29:29
Okay. 
29:30
He is only the Lord of the flies who can't beat over the Lord of the host. 
29:34
So I might remind him of that because these days are glory days. 
29:38
And God had told me several years ago, the fire is coming to be baptized. 
29:43
Everybody baptized in the fire of God and also the days of glory, carrying the glory that you created for Christ, releasing it all over this world. 
29:51
The Bible says the knowledge and the knowing and understanding of the glory will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea and the waters cover two thirds of the, of this world. 
30:00
So that's a lot of glory being released. 
30:02
And it's entered like a shock wave. 
30:04
It'll pass through you to people in building people run up to get saved when that happens. 
30:08
So God's not willing in case you all wondered if he forgot about us, God has not changed his plans and he will not change his plans. 
30:20
The plans made by the evil one, the Lord of the flies, it's going to fail miserably and everybody who's a part of that will go down the hole with him. 
30:29
There will be like dust not remembered. 
30:31
They'll have no power, no property, no place, no say, nothing. 
30:35
So don't be concerned about what the evil is doing. 
30:38
Why not start talking about what God himself has got planned. 
30:41
Today's of greater glory, the fire of God coming, the money, the money, remember the money thing that's going to come from the wicked. 
30:50
It's going to be given to the just and the righteous, more money than the wicked has ever had. 
30:54
The body will have that you. 
30:56
If you've been faithful and just, and that's what it's laid up for, it is going to happen. 
31:02
It has not happened yet. 
31:03
They're not even doing the great, the world's on the greater work. 
31:06
So there's too many things that we still have to do in this world. 
31:09
He's not done. 
31:10
I've been taking well over 150 years into the future. 
31:13
Now it was a hundred and silver 150 and the tribulation had not come. 
31:17
Okay. 
31:18
Things were the greatest they'd ever been and creativity was so wonderful. 
31:22
People were amazed. 
31:23
Your life got easier and better. 
31:25
Okay. 
31:26
God also in these days coming will erase the great area that says there is no God. 
31:32
So you can, you can throw that in the trash. 
31:35
There is no God. 
31:36
He's about to show up and show up on behalf of all of us. 
31:39
He knows what his plan is. 
31:41
He knows exactly what's happening right now behind the closed doors of the Justin, 
31:45
the righteous. 
31:46
And then real soon what was planned behind those closed doors that they had. 
31:52
They don't believe in God. 
31:54
Anyway, they're about to suck his fire. 
31:56
That's what's going to happen. 
31:57
And then they'll be like dust on this earth because he does have a plan for you and I, 
32:02
and I can't wait to see it happen. 
32:05
I am celebrating what's having doing there celebrating these days coming on the earth. 
32:10
They're not set there scared and afraid of the wicked evil beings on this earth. 
32:14
Not the spiritual or the physical God holds the air they breathe and they better watch out. 
32:21
So good. 
32:22
So good. 
32:23
Now, Kat, I'm going to ask you a question. 
32:25
A lot of people and I think Christians as well. 
32:29
Not myself because I've never wanted to be scared. 
32:33
But a lot of Christians go, man, I just love scary movies. 
32:38
I don't believe in witches and warlocks and ghosts, 
32:42
but I just love in Halloween time going to scary movies and being so scared. 
32:47
It's so fun for me. 
32:48
Talk about that. 
32:50
I think that's a bad plan, people. 
32:53
It's enough to talk about what the wicked evil people the flesh are doing on the earth. 
32:58
But when you start glorifying and seeking out and craving horror movies, 
33:04
that is the enemy working on your soul. 
33:08
Okay. 
33:09
Normally as a believer in Christ who knows him, who's seen his miracles happen, 
33:15
have read his word over and over again, would not want anything to do with horror. 
33:20
Horror comes from hell. 
33:23
And that, that vacation, that's what Satan thinks it is. 
33:27
Halloween. 
33:28
You need to know what the first part of that word mean. 
33:31
Did you ever think about it? 
33:33
Okay. 
33:34
Hollowed ground is holy ground. 
33:38
Well, they can get property or buildings or movies or haunted houses or witches operating. 
33:46
That makes evil hollow. 
33:48
Wow. 
33:49
Halloween is a wicked day created by Satan to get your kids to look at these things. 
33:56
And think they're fun. 
33:57
But all he's doing is tagging them. 
34:00
And I'm telling you, don't take your kids to no haunted house or anything to do with that. 
34:04
They will tag them. 
34:06
What does that mean? 
34:07
Tag them. 
34:08
That means the enemy will put a mark on them that they willingly entered into something 
34:12
that was that wicked and evil is still horror. 
34:15
Horror is not in heaven. 
34:17
It is not in the heart of God. 
34:19
The horror comes from hell. 
34:21
So when you're interested in hell's plans or their ideas, you get a mark. 
34:27
You're going to movie theater to see something like that. 
34:29
You get a mark. 
34:30
They mark you. 
34:31
They sit on these platforms over top of the doors of all these R rated movies or wicked 
34:35
evil movies, satanic movies. 
34:37
And you get urinated on. 
34:39
I'm just going to be honest by the demons sitting over that door. 
34:42
Wait, wait, wait. 
34:44
You went by that really fast. 
34:46
Say that again. 
34:47
What you just said, you get your theater. 
34:50
There are platforms created by Satan. 
34:55
And he positions a demon over the door. 
34:58
You walk into the movie theater to see that movie. 
35:01
And when you go in, you get urinated on. 
35:04
That's their mark. 
35:06
And it leaves a visible mark in the spirit realm and no matter where you go after that, 
35:10
they will, they will, they will look for you. 
35:12
So they pull you into something else and get you deeper and deeper into darkness. 
35:16
They'll get you to go to sales. 
35:18
They get to have your palm read. 
35:20
Whatever, every time you do something like that, you get another mark on you. 
35:24
Satan has a mock graveyard. 
35:26
And if you do that enough times, he puts your name on those great songs. 
35:30
Heaven. 
35:32
What about it's not Halloween and somebody just says, man, 
35:37
I just think it's so fun to watch zombie movies where supposedly these dead people 
35:43
are walking around. 
35:44
It's not, it's not Halloween. 
35:46
I'm just watching zombie movies. 
35:47
What about that? 
35:48
I wouldn't want you anything to represent anything of evil. 
35:51
There is no dead walking around. 
35:54
That is not, that's what Satan would like to do. 
35:56
And if he could pull everybody out of the graveyard, make them wick and let them walk around doing horrible things. 
36:01
He would do that, but he can't. 
36:03
He is not over life itself. 
36:05
So he tries to go after people who are alive to use them. 
36:08
And I can tell you, if you watch enough violent movies, you will be violent as a man think it in his soul. 
36:15
So is he. 
36:16
Okay. 
36:17
That's what you will do. 
36:18
That's what you will follow after. 
36:19
That's what you will look for. 
36:20
So I encourage people don't say, you don't see any of it. 
36:24
Don't participate anywhere. 
36:25
Never go to any place that Satan is represented in any way. 
36:29
Witches are not good. 
36:31
They are all wicked. 
36:34
They're wicked. 
36:35
They even make movies called Satan named wicked. 
36:38
And the one thing that Satan will try to fool people with in the future. 
36:42
I'll just let you know right now is that witchcraft is good. 
36:45
You know, so which is performing miracles and things, but all Satan has to do is take the sickness off people. 
36:51
He put on there and it will appear that those witches healed them. 
36:54
I'm just gotta be honest people. 
36:56
You understand have nothing to do with October 31st except for this. 
37:00
Did you know that was reformation day? 
37:03
It was all saints. 
37:05
It was reformed. 
37:06
And when that when that one of those articles were nailed to the church door for people to have freedom in their life to have the word for themselves. 
37:13
October 31st is reformation day. 
37:16
Yeah. 
37:17
They also call it all saints day. 
37:18
I remember being when that happened and yet Satan stole that day. 
37:23
You know, I had an encounter. 
37:26
It was that profound. 
37:28
So I would call it an encounter. 
37:30
It's not that I saw something. 
37:31
I was in Europe by myself. 
37:33
I shouldn't have been there because I needed an assistant, but I was there and it was October 31. 
37:39
I think I was mildly aware that it was all saints day, which is one of the names they call it. 
37:45
And the bell started tolling and it wasn't very far away. 
37:48
There was a church because they got churches all over year. 
37:50
They started tolling on October 31 and cap the spirit fell all over me on October 31 all saints day. 
37:58
And I knew that I knew this was not Halloween doing this. 
38:01
This was all saints day. 
38:03
And what do you think about that? 
38:05
I was going to say also, you can either call it reformation day or all saints day. 
38:11
Those are both two holy things that represents what God wants us to have and to know about. 
38:17
So Satan, when he looked for this fake holiday he wanted, he decided he always will go after what God has. 
38:24
He always does it. 
38:26
He'll mock things that belong to God images and places and make them evil and say they always belong to him. 
38:32
No, nothing belong to him. 
38:33
Hell doesn't belong to him. 
38:34
That was made for his abode because he was kicked out of heaven. 
38:37
But yet you're right. 
38:39
You're right Steve. 
38:40
That is a day to be hollowed for God. 
38:43
It is not Halloween. 
38:45
I have no participation. 
38:47
I'm even going to have a sign made a really big one that says we don't do demons here. 
38:51
We celebrate all things day. 
38:53
We celebrate revelation. 
38:55
We celebrate the life of God at this place. 
38:57
If anybody comes to our door, they get a little thing that talks about Jesus Christ. 
39:01
Well, it makes me think of the fact that the enemy specifically and purposely perverted October 31 
39:09
simply because it was meant to be that way. 
39:14
I can even go back. 
39:16
Dren and I found out starting about 88 that God would visit us in a way, 
39:21
not that I'm seeing him in person, but on October 31 he would visit us. 
39:27
And of course we knew it has nothing to do with Halloween. 
39:30
God was giving us encounters and confirmations. 
39:34
It was like a day that he pecked. 
39:38
So anyway. 
39:40
It was his day. 
39:42
It's been his day for a very long time. 
39:45
No one in heaven celebrates Halloween. 
39:51
Nobody does. 
39:53
It's not mentioned. 
39:54
It's not practiced. 
39:55
It belongs to the devil. 
39:57
I would not take your children anywhere to have anything to do with that. 
40:01
They're innocent, but you as a parent are giving permission when you take them. 
40:05
And some people probably mad at me. 
40:07
Well, at least I told you the truth. 
40:09
If I love you, I will tell you the truth. 
40:11
I want to save you from all kinds of harm and things later on in your life. 
40:16
My dad was always right. 
40:18
We wanted to go trick-or-treating ourselves. 
40:20
This is way back in the 50s. 
40:21
Okay. 
40:22
In the 50s people, they didn't have the stuff going on. 
40:24
My dad said, I don't like this. 
40:26
I don't think this is God. 
40:28
Yeah. 
40:29
He let us go for a while because we started seeing some things happen on that day. 
40:33
And we said, no, we're not doing this anymore. 
40:35
We do not practice it. 
40:37
And yes, I do speak against it whenever I get a chance because you need to be aware. 
40:41
Anything that looks like horror, suffering, death, dying, manipulation, control, pure evil. 
40:49
You know, the images as well as the actions. 
40:53
I know people went to some haunted house somewhere last year and people had horrific testimonies 
41:00
on what they saw and what happened there. 
41:02
They left really terrified. 
41:04
Wow. 
41:05
Anything you've ever done that you need to lose those encounters and that stuff in your 
41:08
soul, lose from your soul every time you participated in that or any other day that represents something 
41:14
that Satan is over. 
41:16
Yeah. 
41:17
And let me, I want to come back just for a moment. 
41:18
You talked about, you used the word both tagged and marked. 
41:21
He tags and marks. 
41:23
If you go to a horror film, by that, are you meaning if you go in, first of all, you've 
41:30
given permission for him to tag you or mark you or urinate you. 
41:34
And from that moment on, unless you repent of it, he has permission to, to what? 
41:42
Well, he'll have, well, demons will follow you sometimes and get you pulled into something 
41:48
darker and deeper. 
41:50
Because that was your choice to go. 
41:52
And that's what they do. 
41:53
And God himself actually can't stop that because you have a choice. 
41:57
You have a will. 
41:59
You're old enough, you're old enough to understand this is bad and this is wicked. 
42:03
I still want it. 
42:04
You're, you're yourself are giving permission. 
42:06
You do. 
42:07
Yes. 
42:08
You do need to repent for any time you participated with anything that belonged to the enemy, whether 
42:12
it was things that was said, things that you watched and movies, things that you heard, 
42:16
things that you attended yourself. 
42:18
You need to break all that off of you, especially the witchcraft, break it off of you. 
42:23
And I have news for you. 
42:24
Some of the stuff being, being made and shown in movies for kids has witchcraft attached 
42:29
to it. 
42:30
You need to be careful what your kids are going to see. 
42:33
You're responsible. 
42:34
You are raising a soul. 
42:36
You're raising a human soul for God and for what he has planned for them. 
42:41
But you cannot, you cannot put harm in their way. 
42:44
If you're choosing to take him with something that you know is darkness. 
42:48
It was darkness and evil. 
42:50
That is not for your children. 
42:52
It isn't for anybody. 
42:53
It's the one way that Satan can get, get to you is by you give, you give permission when 
42:58
you go, you give permission when you go that. 
43:01
Yes, I chose that. 
43:02
Yes, I knew it was in it. 
43:03
And I went, if you get there by now, you didn't know, then leave, leave. 
43:07
Don't stay. 
43:08
Yeah. 
43:09
If your friends, your friends, if you, if you're afraid that your friends will be ashamed 
43:12
of you. 
43:13
You don't want to be ashamed of Jesus Christ and his blood. 
43:16
That's what's keeping you. 
43:17
So all these days, so you can tell them, I'm sorry, I don't participate with the devil. 
43:22
That's a nice line to give. 
43:23
That way you're not saying anything against them. 
43:25
You're speaking against the evil. 
43:27
And I'm going to encourage you to do that. 
43:29
The days coming on this earth, people are going to know absolutely what is the darkness 
43:34
and what is it of the light? 
43:36
There's no place to hide in the middle. 
43:37
Pretend like you don't know anything. 
43:39
Yeah. 
43:40
You will see acts, acts that have already happened during these last two years. 
43:42
There are so wicked beyond imagination and we are not putting up with it. 
43:48
No one. 
43:49
Okay. 
43:50
No one voted for the right person who actually won number 45. 
43:54
Yeah. 
43:55
Once any of this, this was not our choice. 
43:58
This government was not our choice. 
44:00
The way they're running it was not our choice. 
44:02
And they're not doing anything good for this country. 
44:04
You are about to see the hand of God move. 
44:09
And I mean move mightily in this, in this country and in this world. 
44:15
And there we no doubt in your heart who won and who didn't win. 
44:19
And we don't need any more evil because God's, this devil is pushing this right on the heels 
44:25
of the entry into these days of glory. 
44:28
And God will let it just go so far and it's ending. 
44:31
It will be an end. 
44:33
This is not our new norm. 
44:35
The fire and the glory and the love of God and creativity, that will be our new norm. 
44:41
So good. 
44:42
So good. 
44:43
Well, Kat, we have questions to ask you today. 
44:46
But I want to make sure you, if there's anything else you want to say or share before we get 
44:51
into questions, let me know. 
44:53
I just know that things are very, very close, especially what I have recently. 
44:58
I don't just so people know. 
45:00
I don't look up other people and listen to them. 
45:02
I don't number one have time. 
45:04
I don't watch videos sent to me by people. 
45:07
I don't listen to broadcast or whatever. 
45:09
I don't have time. 
45:10
I don't care. 
45:11
I pray for these people who are doing the work of God. 
45:14
But I, I'm not going to be accused of hearing something and saying it because someone else 
45:18
said it. 
45:19
If I say it, then God said it. 
45:21
And that's the way it is. 
45:22
He won't let me put certain things in my soul. 
45:24
I can't read books. 
45:25
People have written. 
45:26
I pray for those people. 
45:27
They wrote their book. 
45:28
If it's from God, then I pray that they do well with it. 
45:31
I am only filled with revelation from the father, from the word of God, from what the 
45:37
Holy Spirit takes me and shows me. 
45:39
What from Jesus plans for this earth? 
45:41
That's what I am filled with, which is why I know if something good enemy comes along 
45:47
trying to fool me. 
45:48
Last night, he was trying to tell me to stop breathing. 
45:51
I'm going to die anyway. 
45:52
He was telling you to stop. 
45:54
What? 
45:55
Out of my room and said, get out. 
45:56
You liar, friar. 
45:57
I'm not having nothing of your garbage. 
46:00
I will complete what God has given me. 
46:02
And I will do that 100 day, 100 week broadcast. 
46:05
I'm doing it. 
46:06
I'm going to yell loudly against you to get out double. 
46:12
Wow. 
46:13
Wow. 
46:14
And you said that really fast. 
46:16
He was telling you to stop. 
46:18
What? 
46:19
Breathing. 
46:20
I had had a minor injury to my, my chest bone. 
46:24
Okay. 
46:25
And because I was overactive, I was healing. 
46:28
Well, it was doing okay. 
46:29
Nothing broke or anything. 
46:30
Uh, but I was really overactive the other day. 
46:33
So it was hurting. 
46:34
And, uh, I just kept holding onto it and the devil comes up behind me. 
46:38
I want you sorry thing. 
46:39
Oh, you just need to just stop breathing and give up. 
46:42
You just not going to survive. 
46:43
Wow. 
46:44
And I turned around. 
46:45
I went, you are afraid of me. 
46:48
You're afraid of every believer who has God inside. 
46:52
It doesn't mind sharing it. 
46:53
You're not going to like what I say tomorrow, but I'm going to say it loud and clear. 
46:58
And then I told him, he wasn't going to affect me in any way to get out. 
47:02
He actually ran. 
47:03
He ran through the wall. 
47:04
Wow. 
47:05
Wow. 
47:06
You know, that was what you just said was very, very helpful. 
47:09
Cause there's a whole, uh, there are thousands of people that just said, 
47:12
that was so good to hear. 
47:14
Cause even cat can, can get attacked, but look how she handled it. 
47:18
So you really helped a lot of people with that. 
47:20
Yeah. 
47:21
That's, that's great. 
47:22
That's awesome. 
47:23
How you did that. 
47:24
So super good. 
47:25
So, um, okay. 
47:27
We got 45 coming back one day soon. 
47:30
Anything else? 
47:31
You just mentioned that anything else about 45 before I get any questions. 
47:35
I think, uh, besides him, 
47:37
there's going to be so much activity going on. 
47:40
Uh, you know, I November, if you remember, November the fourth, 2020, 
47:44
that was the first time God spoke that was after the day we said we would, 
47:48
we'd have a meeting. 
47:49
I mean, it shows up to land until that day came. 
47:52
Then we wouldn't have anymore. 
47:53
That was our original plan. 
47:54
And I remember telling you, Steve, God wants to fourth, 
47:57
he has something to say. 
47:58
And, and I called you on the Thursday, something to say. 
48:01
And so I'm not quite sure what it's going to say, 
48:03
but he said it very boldly that justice was going to come when the ground 
48:07
began to shake the, the, the, the amount of fraud exposure would be 
48:12
almost unbelievable. 
48:13
The people, 
48:14
the landslide of fraud exposure is actually what he said will not stop 
48:18
until everyone who's involved in the whole stealing of 2020. 
48:23
Of 2020 election. 
48:25
They will be brought to justice. 
48:27
They will lose their position. 
48:28
They will lose their property. 
48:30
They'll lose their money. 
48:31
They'll lose their voice. 
48:32
And that's what God, the father said the day after the November 3rd, 
48:36
2020 elections, he already told people they threw them in the river. 
48:40
Uh, they buried them. 
48:41
They burned them. 
48:42
They put fake things. 
48:43
This is, this is right after this probably still happening. 
48:46
Uh, but he said that the very next day on November the fourth, 
48:49
that was his report. 
48:50
He told me he has something to say. 
48:53
And that was what he said. 
48:54
And you go back and see that again or find it somewhere else, 
48:57
but I'm telling you God said that is exactly what I'm going to do. 
49:01
And no one can tell me no. 
49:03
Wow. 
49:04
So good. 
49:05
So good. 
49:06
So good. 
49:07
I'll take a few minutes. 
49:09
Right now there's being papers made out. 
49:13
I can't tell you who's making those papers, 
49:15
but there are people demanding people to, um, leave their positions. 
49:21
So resignation are being written even as I speak. 
49:26
I wouldn't have to tell you who they're for. 
49:28
Cause pretty soon you're going to be C. 
49:30
You're going to see who they're for. 
49:32
But like God said on the fourth of 2020, 
49:35
everyone and everything will be exposed. 
49:37
If you think you've been hiding it really well, 
49:39
you can't hide from God. 
49:41
And you better leave his people alone and not touch his anointed. 
49:45
You may not live very long. 
49:47
I don't mind saying that either. Cause he also said that. 
49:49
So I'm just letting you know, you're about to see the hand of God move. 
49:53
And there are the hearts of heroes in this country, 
49:57
getting together with other people in other countries. 
49:59
And guess what? 
50:00
You don't know who they are. 
50:01
I'm talking to the wicked left right now. 
50:02
You don't know who they are. 
50:04
Staying here everywhere all at the same time. 
50:06
You don't know what's happening. 
50:08
Why don't you check with your leader, the devil and see him cry. 
50:12
Because you're about to lose everything. 
50:14
And so is he. 
50:16
Can't have cake and celebrate right now. 
50:19
Absolutely. 
50:20
Justice is already on the earth waiting to get into action. 
50:25
So you mentioned a minute ago, but let me ask it again. 
50:28
So you, you know, we, we, the classic stories are Ann and IS and Sapphire. 
50:32
Of course they were believers who messed up and they lost their lives. 
50:37
And then there's the unsaved. 
50:39
And then there's probably those in the middle. 
50:41
Have you seen people just suddenly drop dead through this thing? 
50:45
I've never asked you this. 
50:46
So I don't know what you're going to say. 
50:48
Have you seen that? 
50:49
I have in the spirit. Okay. 
50:51
Yeah. 
50:52
Yes. 
50:53
Cause I've already been taken forward to the celebration. 
50:56
And right before that celebration. 
50:58
Well, I saw happening exactly what God said. 
51:00
They were telling on each other. 
51:02
This is the, this is all the, the line left though. 
51:07
So those, it doesn't just have to be the left. 
51:09
There's people even on the other side who are secretly being parts and getting 
51:13
paid off too. 
51:14
You're going to find out who they are too. 
51:16
Okay. 
51:17
Make sure you know who you voted for. 
51:19
Okay. 
51:20
Vote for what is right. 
51:21
What is life. 
51:22
What God would vote for. 
51:23
What would Jesus do people? 
51:24
You know all about that. 
51:25
Yeah. 
51:26
The difference between right and wrong. 
51:28
What's wrong is wrong. 
51:29
And you can't make that right. 
51:32
Yeah. 
51:33
Do it. 
51:34
So yes. 
51:35
I was showing people drop dead. 
51:37
On platforms while they were speaking places and they hauled their 
51:40
bodies off. 
51:41
Wow. 
51:42
Wow. 
51:43
Yeah, I wondered. 
51:44
I've never asked that. 
51:45
I don't think so. 
51:46
Yeah. 
51:47
Very sobering, sobering, sobering. 
51:49
Okay. 
51:50
Are you ready for a few questions? 
51:52
Yes, I'm ready. 
51:53
So illumination works for us. 
51:55
We, does it an amazing, fantastic job. 
51:58
She's asking this. 
51:59
She says, I've heard you talk about. 
52:02
Asking God not to write down the sins of those who have wronged you. 
52:06
Could I ask God not to write down someone's wrong against me that 
52:10
happened. 
52:11
Years ago. 
52:12
So I don't know. 
52:13
You know, there's that time thing. 
52:16
You understand the question. 
52:18
Yes. 
52:19
Yeah. 
52:20
So she happened years ago. 
52:22
Can she still right now choose as God not to. 
52:25
Yeah. 
52:26
Right. 
52:27
Yeah. 
52:28
Well, I promise you, he wrote it down back then. 
52:30
I mean, it's written down. 
52:32
I guess you could ask him if, if it works. 
52:35
When you have a prayer like that, illuminate you. 
52:38
You ask God, if it is possible. 
52:40
That's good. 
52:41
This is a pot as if this is possible. 
52:43
You can ask that. 
52:44
And that's how it presented to the father. 
52:46
If this is possible, would you please remove the, the harm. 
52:50
And the, and the, the torment that somebody has. 
52:53
This person has done to me although it was years ago. 
52:55
I want it taken off my record that I held it against them. 
52:59
That would probably work. 
53:00
But this is what God said. 
53:02
Even though I recently have asked God to not write down the harm. 
53:07
I didn't even call it a sin. 
53:08
I said, right now in the harm that someone did against me. 
53:11
It was unjust. 
53:12
God, you know that. 
53:13
But because I have a true forgiveness in my heart. 
53:17
I'm forgiving them for doing it right now. 
53:19
Right after it was done. 
53:20
I forgive them. 
53:21
I'm going to act like they never did it. 
53:23
And also would you please not write it down against them. 
53:26
He didn't write it down. 
53:27
But this is what he said to me. 
53:29
I will not write that down, but I will tell you this. 
53:32
There will be consequences to pay with everybody else against them. 
53:37
Cause they can't say that. 
53:39
I can ask God not to write it down, 
53:41
but everybody is watching that stuff and knows about it. 
53:44
They're angry. 
53:45
They're upset. 
53:46
They don't want relationships with them now. 
53:48
And I'm not even going to say their names because I forgave them, 
53:51
but this is the consequences. 
53:53
He's done in the natural. 
53:54
There are consequences that will happen. 
53:56
Number one, they're still doing it. 
53:59
And number two, that's their choice. 
54:02
They chose to do this. 
54:04
Although God's word says something different. 
54:06
So God himself did not write it down as a wrong. 
54:09
Yeah. 
54:10
Consequences they will face because of what they did. 
54:12
That's up to them. 
54:13
If they stop, if they say, you know, 
54:15
I'm sorry for doing all that stuff. 
54:17
You know, there's that, there's that scripture that says in wrath, 
54:21
remember mercy. 
54:22
Could you say Lord in wrath that this person deserves? 
54:26
I forgiven him. 
54:28
Remember mercy. 
54:30
Here's an example. 
54:33
I know of a person that, you know, 
54:35
not that they would be known out and about, 
54:37
but their son was accidentally killed in an altercation. 
54:42
There was a fight, 
54:43
but he felt the son fell over backwards and hurt himself. 
54:46
And he was in the story. 
54:48
And God said to him, 
54:51
because it was going to, going to go to trial. 
54:54
And God said to him, 
54:56
I won't say his name, but God says, what do you want? 
55:00
And meaning towards the, 
55:02
towards the one who pushed him and he died. 
55:05
Because it was a real fight. 
55:07
And his answer was Lord, I want mercy. 
55:11
Yeah. 
55:12
And so that was a okay prayer to pray then, right? 
55:15
God to show mercy. 
55:17
Well, I don't know what that, 
55:18
the mercy could be many different things Steve. 
55:21
Yeah. 
55:22
The mercy was that it wouldn't be written down in heaven. 
55:25
But on the earth, 
55:26
even the legal consequences of somebody proving that and knowing 
55:30
that they may, that mercy may be, they go lighter on him. 
55:34
But I don't think that that means in the natural, 
55:36
he won't have to pay some kind of a price. 
55:38
I don't know what that price would be. 
55:40
Yeah. 
55:41
But because you're asking that that way, 
55:43
when it happened, when it happened, 
55:45
that probably means that they would get a lighter sentence 
55:48
or maybe let go sooner, sooner. 
55:51
But that would be a big thing that God would have to influence 
55:53
the judges, the jury, all the people involved in the, 
55:56
in the trial and stuff like that. 
55:58
And sometimes he will for certain reasons, 
56:01
but and sometimes most of them, 
56:03
I think they pay some kind of a price for their action. 
56:06
Oh yeah. 
56:07
Okay. 
56:08
That's really helpful. 
56:09
That's going to help a lot of people too. 
56:11
All right. 
56:13
Julie, who does our producing and she helped me get these flowers 
56:17
behind me. 
56:18
Thank you, Julie. 
56:20
Excuse me. 
56:22
She's asking this question. 
56:24
She gave me permission to say her name. 
56:26
So she says, I'm leaving the country next week. 
56:29
I've noticed in the last week, 
56:31
I've seen bright golden orbs or circles in my house. 
56:36
I know these are angels. 
56:38
And what I've noticed is they've gotten bigger than what I've 
56:42
seen them before. 
56:43
Am I being assigned new or bigger angels or hosts? 
56:47
That's a question. 
56:48
I think there's an increase in the authority that she has and 
56:52
the dominion that God has given her because she's been willingly 
56:56
been what he asked of her and has operated really well in 
57:02
forgiving people and seeking up things from God himself. 
57:06
If they've changed in any way, if there's more there, 
57:09
yes, that means that your assignment is about to get 
57:12
something added to it. 
57:14
The fact that they're gold or brighter lights now, 
57:18
that's a whole more authority and dominion thing. 
57:21
That's what that means. 
57:22
Okay. 
57:23
More authority and dominion. 
57:24
Good. 
57:25
Good. 
57:26
Good. 
57:27
Good. 
57:28
All right. 
57:30
So I guess this must have to do with decrees because they're 
57:33
talking about speaking. 
57:34
A few viewers are asking the same question. 
57:37
Is there something or are there things either way we can pray or 
57:41
speak against Halloween displays in neighborhoods or public 
57:46
spaces? 
57:47
Should you speak or decree against those in some way? 
57:52
Yes. 
57:53
We do that ourselves every time we come into our development. 
57:55
There's people that have really horrible displays and yes, 
58:00
I do. 
58:01
I do. 
58:04
In the name of Jesus Christ, that stuff will become like dust. 
58:07
It will be in no one's memory. 
58:09
It will not affect one single person in their spirit or in the 
58:12
flesh at any time whatsoever. 
58:13
And I do nullify any effects and nullify any wicked, 
58:16
evil, sadistic, torture, death, dying, suffering, 
58:19
spirits that have been brought along with that stuff. 
58:22
I evict him from this neighborhood in Jesus name and you 
58:25
will not come back. 
58:27
Good. 
58:28
I do not want to go into the evil spirits attached to these 
58:31
things that people put in front of their houses because they're 
58:33
actually portraying part of health. 
58:35
I mean, it's gotten darker because of the dark people who are 
58:40
trying to run this country. 
58:42
They allow more darkness here because people are standing up 
58:45
and finally becoming filled with God and saying things. 
58:48
They're not having as much of an effect. 
58:50
But if you go by and say nothing, you actually are just allowing 
58:53
them to remain until something comes down. 
58:56
That reminds me of, you know, because I've gone, you know, 
58:59
we're very careful in the movies we go to, 
59:01
but we may be heading down the hall to see a nice family movie 
59:05
passing by some really evil movies. 
59:09
Could you do the same thing about that? 
59:11
Speak against those. 
59:13
I almost make a hobby out of that. 
59:15
If there's anything to see, I actually take authority before I 
59:18
get to the theater people. 
59:20
Before you get there, if you know, like right now, 
59:22
there's almost nothing with seeing. 
59:24
I go by and I wave my hands. 
59:26
I send the anointing that destroys every yoke of darkness, 
59:29
trying to attach people to the evil or the wickedness of the 
59:32
horror. 
59:33
I nullify the effect. 
59:35
I evict those spirits from that place and people will become 
59:38
bored of watching them and they'll have to replace the movie 
59:41
in Jesus name. 
59:43
And you can do that in hotel rooms. 
59:45
You stay in. 
59:47
I'm going to the hotel until I do it. 
59:49
Really? Really? 
59:51
I don't have authority over any darkness. 
59:54
I do. 
59:55
We're of the light. 
59:57
We are here representing God. 
59:59
In Jesus name, I give you power over all the power of the enemy. 
01:00:02
That really means you have that. 
01:00:04
So I'm not going into a hotel until I kick everything out into a 
01:00:07
dry place. 
01:00:09
I release a life of God to flood every room. 
01:00:11
I go through and touch the hallway walls and say, 
01:00:13
I've released an anointing to destroy every yoke of darkness in 
01:00:16
this place or any attack of the enemy. 
01:00:18
I just kick the devil out. 
01:00:21
I release God into that place. 
01:00:23
That's interesting. 
01:00:24
It reminds me of this has to be almost probably 15 years ago we 
01:00:27
were in France and they took us around. 
01:00:29
I think they were considering a property for the church. 
01:00:32
It was a some sort of compound almost. 
01:00:35
There were several buildings and they wanted to know what I was 
01:00:38
discerning and I was pretty new at that. 
01:00:41
But I walked around and I said, 
01:00:43
someone meaning a human being has gone around and peed to mark 
01:00:46
this territory for the devil. 
01:00:49
I didn't know now what I know you just said. 
01:00:53
I just gave him the information. 
01:00:55
I should have nullified it right there, right? 
01:00:58
Yes. 
01:01:00
Do human beings, I mean, 
01:01:02
any claim or stake that the enemies put out. 
01:01:04
Yeah. 
01:01:06
You know, we're here to occupy until Christ comes. 
01:01:09
Occupy means take authority. 
01:01:11
That's what that word. 
01:01:12
Occupy like an army. 
01:01:14
You occupy. 
01:01:16
You're over everything that goes on in your area where you live, 
01:01:19
especially you have a high authority and dominion over the area 
01:01:22
or the city you live in. 
01:01:24
You always do. 
01:01:26
So I will run other drug. 
01:01:28
It used to be the drug people, 
01:01:30
all the kind of stuff that will be exposed, 
01:01:32
brought to justice because this city is becoming a city of light 
01:01:35
and I will not tolerate darkness in the city of any form whatsoever. 
01:01:38
I rule with Jesus Christ here. 
01:01:40
As a king, I make a ruling. 
01:01:42
You will get out. 
01:01:44
And you need to do that in any place, 
01:01:46
you know, that is doing wicked evil things. 
01:01:48
Don't just walk by some place that's having, 
01:01:50
you know, nudity shown on stage. 
01:01:52
Just make sure you take authority over it. 
01:01:54
That'll become nothing. 
01:01:56
And guess what? I did that one time and that place is nothing now. 
01:01:58
Wow. 
01:02:00
Wow. 
01:02:02
You have a voice. Use your voice for God. 
01:02:04
You take authority. 
01:02:06
Christ says we rule and reign with him now in this earth now. 
01:02:09
And in the time is to come, we will rule with him. 
01:02:11
You have rulership. 
01:02:13
You speak against any of that darkness that has no right to be around you 
01:02:17
or anywhere that you will not tolerate it. 
01:02:19
If you're not, if you're not participating with the darkness, 
01:02:22
you have every right to speak against the darkness and not tolerate it. 
01:02:26
You know, and one more example, this reminds me of a story. 
01:02:29
It's a known prophet, not as well known as others, 
01:02:31
but it's a known prophetess. 
01:02:33
And she was driving by one of those palm raider tarot card reader places. 
01:02:39
And she started cursing the place in so many words. 
01:02:45
I don't know what words she used and God stopped her short. 
01:02:48
And he said, don't curse the place, curse the money that's keeping it in business. 
01:02:52
So she said, oh, okay. 
01:02:54
She was at a stoplight. 
01:02:56
And so she said, I curse the money that's keeping that in business. 
01:02:59
And a woman came running out of the place screaming, saying, no. 
01:03:04
So it had an immediate effect. 
01:03:07
What do you think about that? 
01:03:09
I think either it was the person who would be losing the money who ran the place. 
01:03:14
You know, Satan does give them some sense of what's going on. 
01:03:18
And sometimes they will hear demons speak to them. 
01:03:20
I mean, those places really are partnering with demons, 
01:03:23
even if they don't know what they are and they may start screaming. 
01:03:26
So if they're screaming other people in there, if they're participating, 
01:03:30
may not hear that scream, but the person running it will. 
01:03:33
So it could have been them hearing those spoken. 
01:03:35
And that's why they ran off with screaming. 
01:03:37
No, no, I don't want that to happen. 
01:03:39
But you can't stop a believer who knows what they're doing, taking a story with Jesus Christ, 
01:03:45
especially with his name. 
01:03:46
I've never forgotten that because she's sitting inside her car at a stoplight. 
01:03:51
And she just did that real quick. 
01:03:53
So that was amazing. 
01:03:55
All right. 
01:03:57
Let's see. 
01:03:58
So Diane asked, she says, I'm wearing an I don't do demon shirt for a Halloween party. 
01:04:04
And for the 31st, what simple reply would you suggest for those who might ask about the shirt? 
01:04:10
Now, I don't know if she means Halloween party or harvest party. 
01:04:14
She's, she's calling it a Halloween party. 
01:04:16
So I can't, I don't know which kind of secular slash. 
01:04:21
Some people actually think it's perfectly okay to participate with having candy, 
01:04:26
having some little refreshments. 
01:04:27
No, it's not unless God sent you there. 
01:04:31
If he sent you there to be a witness and share something that might rescue somebody, 
01:04:36
that's different. 
01:04:37
You're choosing yourself. 
01:04:38
I'm going to go to this place and enjoy all the stuff, but I won't participate that it belongs to Satan. 
01:04:42
You're not doing, you're not doing anything good unless he sent you there. 
01:04:46
If he did an assignment, but I tell people, if people, this is the thing, 
01:04:50
it's not a good witness. 
01:04:51
If people see you there, walk by, they're at this party and they've got images of, 
01:04:55
of the wicked in the hell and death and dying stuff all over the place. 
01:04:58
They know what it is and they know that they think you're having a good time. 
01:05:02
They don't realize you're getting marked by the enemy. 
01:05:04
So if you go as a believer because you have a good shirt on that says something, 
01:05:08
don't go there. 
01:05:09
And unless Jesus Christ tells you, go to the mall and where, go to the mall, 
01:05:13
where there's not no party going on. 
01:05:15
And then when people ask you, you can say, I don't participate with hell. 
01:05:18
I don't approve of anything hell does. 
01:05:20
I know if I, all of their images, I know if I, all of their actions and Jesus name, 
01:05:25
because they are not of the light. 
01:05:27
She should walk around the mall with that or someplace where there's people, 
01:05:30
but I would not go to something called a Halloween party. 
01:05:34
Right. 
01:05:35
And I might as well make a comment about this. 
01:05:37
A lot of churches, because they don't want kids going to do trick or treating. 
01:05:41
They will have a harvest or fall fest. 
01:05:44
I do want to say this. 
01:05:46
This is the time to celebrate the fall. 
01:05:48
It is a time to celebrate harvest. 
01:05:50
I've been to many harvest events and they were fun and people there prayed for everybody 
01:05:55
else while we were there. 
01:05:57
They got in hospital. 
01:05:58
We prayed together against the people who weren't participating in the darkness. 
01:06:02
Something like that would be perfectly okay. 
01:06:04
Just don't dress like something of the darkness. 
01:06:07
Don't go to a church harvest festival, which our church, I don't know if they're having one this year. 
01:06:12
I don't remember. 
01:06:13
I asked, I think they're going to do something different. 
01:06:15
But every year on this day, they would always have powerful big events. 
01:06:19
They'd have God's music playing amazing music. 
01:06:22
People would get fellowship. 
01:06:24
Some people would talk about knowing Christ more. 
01:06:27
But it was a fun family thing. 
01:06:29
It had nothing to do that it was part of Halloween. 
01:06:31
They never called it a Halloween anything. 
01:06:33
That's the leaders dressed like that. 
01:06:35
They spoke against that stuff. 
01:06:37
So that is different. 
01:06:38
That would be an option you could do in honoring All Saints Day or Reformation Day. 
01:06:44
I think it would be great if somebody had an All Saints Day event. 
01:06:47
And then you tell people, but when they did that, people from the neighborhood came, 
01:06:52
which they wanted to win the Christ. 
01:06:54
And now no one else would be wearing this, but they would come in dressed as people that look like the darkness. 
01:06:59
And they looked around and started wearing everything else. 
01:07:02
And they started asking them, well, what is this? 
01:07:04
And they would say, we're not celebrating Halloween. 
01:07:06
We don't participate with celebrating. 
01:07:08
It's Hell's Day. 
01:07:10
We bring people with the light and Jesus Christ. 
01:07:12
So do you want to know about it? 
01:07:14
And that helped to lead people to Christ. 
01:07:16
So you can't walk up to someone this year and say, get out of here. 
01:07:19
You look evil. 
01:07:21
You never want to come darken your door on your property. 
01:07:24
So we just want you to know that we love you and care about your family, 
01:07:29
but we don't dress like that during this time of the year because we don't partner with darkness. 
01:07:33
So people going to hay rides and corn mazes and all of that. 
01:07:40
That's just, even if it's on the same day, it's there. 
01:07:43
It's a substitute because it's a fall. 
01:07:45
It's not really a substitute. 
01:07:46
It's a fall. 
01:07:47
It's not a substitute for Halloween. 
01:07:49
There are places that have always like 100 years have had fall festivals during this time of the year 
01:07:57
because it is harvest time in many places. 
01:08:00
I would go up to Virginia all the time and our grandchildren, our daughter and our son-in-law, 
01:08:07
they always would do the corn maze fun things. 
01:08:10
And they would do it on, I don't know if it was church property. 
01:08:13
I think it was the school property, but everybody who went to the elementary school grown up. 
01:08:17
The biggest fall festival I've ever seen. 
01:08:19
There was never any mention of Satan. 
01:08:21
There was never any of the dressing like for the other thing, the other holiday. 
01:08:25
That was a fun family day. 
01:08:27
It was all about fall and harvest time because a lot of the farmers had harvested. 
01:08:31
And some of them hold them in their barns at the end of the fall season, 
01:08:36
which would be the end of October. 
01:08:38
So that's going on. 
01:08:40
That's a totally different thing. 
01:08:42
That's a delightful fun harvest thing to do. 
01:08:47
You know, pick out a pumpkin, you know, make your pumpkin pie. 
01:08:51
They have pie contest and cake baking contest and jar can stuff contest though. 
01:08:56
Yeah. 
01:08:57
It's a fun time for families. 
01:08:59
So good. 
01:09:00
Okay. Mary asked, what's the difference between the 90, now we're moving into other guests. 
01:09:04
What's the difference between the nine gifts of the spirit and the other gifts of the spirit such as charity, 
01:09:10
generosity, etc. Does every believer get one of the nine? 
01:09:14
That's a question. 
01:09:16
I'm sure that you would have one of the nine, but again, that is not your gift. 
01:09:22
That's totally different. 
01:09:24
The gifts of the spirit and gifts of how to live your life. 
01:09:28
That's the others show kindness, give charity and all that stuff. 
01:09:31
That is identifying you as someone who cares, who loves for God and helping people. 
01:09:37
I think a lot of people probably has one or two, have one or two of those gifts. 
01:09:41
But the thing about when you go to heaven, the gift you operate in is not a spiritual gift at all. 
01:09:48
It's your natural gift you have that you are really good at and people even say you're really good at doing that stuff. 
01:09:55
Some people go, well, I don't know what it is. 
01:09:57
You may have more than one. 
01:09:59
You could have more than one gift and so you probably would operate in both of those in heaven. 
01:10:04
But most people, you'll find out if you don't even think about it anymore, 
01:10:07
something you love to do when you were younger, maybe you don't have the opportunity. 
01:10:11
That doesn't mean what your hobbies are on the earth now would be the hobby or the gift God made you. 
01:10:17
Every good and perfect gift would be us coming down from the hobby. 
01:10:21
And on the gifts, there are people who do many, many things because they've got hobbies and many, many things. 
01:10:30
They're going to be like that in heaven, right? Many, many things that they would do, right? 
01:10:35
Oh, yeah. There's all kinds of things to participate in heaven and be a part of and joy going and have fun with and exciting things. 
01:10:43
Yes. There's places of excitement and fun everywhere in heaven. 
01:10:47
There's also places that are so amazing and so profound. 
01:10:51
I love that two of the things that are used to describe heaven are wonder and splendor. 
01:10:56
I would have to say splendor is absolutely things that happen in the throne room and a few other places around heaven that are so filled with splendor. 
01:11:04
Everybody goes there probably often just to see the demonstrations of the light of God, the fire of God. 
01:11:11
He makes things even in heaven for us in heaven and gives them out at different places in heaven. 
01:11:17
So wonder, you're always undone. You are so undone by the goodness and the love of God. 
01:11:23
What He has blessed you with, what He blesses with everybody in heaven and the fact that He wants to spend time with just you. 
01:11:30
That is also amazing. That's good. All right. I accidentally skipped this one. 
01:11:35
Carrie age nine asks this question. 
01:11:38
My goldfish died a week ago and I can't stop thinking about him. 
01:11:42
I had him three years and I feel like I failed him, this Carrie saying. 
01:11:47
My dad tried to help save him and we prayed for him all the time, but he died. 
01:11:51
I read your book about Chester. Do you think my goldfish will be in my mansion too? 
01:11:57
Will he forgive me that I failed at making him well and he died? 
01:12:02
I think Carrie that he doesn't even think about the fact that that he thinks that you didn't take good care of him. 
01:12:10
I think what he will say to you when you get this, he's so happy you loved him so much and that you missed him. 
01:12:16
I don't think like past don't even think about the things they went through before their life ended or anything like that. 
01:12:22
They will remember you. Of course he's going to be in your mansion just like Chester was in Brandon's mansion. 
01:12:28
Of course, and he will remember you when you get there. 
01:12:31
But all he'll say is thank you for loving me. 
01:12:34
Nice. And he will. He will talk. He'll say thank you. 
01:12:38
All pets talk in heaven. 
01:12:40
I love it. I love it. I love it. 
01:12:42
By the way, speaking of animals, Satan is Lord of the Flies. 
01:12:48
What's the deal with flies and why is Satan the Lord of them? 
01:12:53
Is that some creature that God didn't choose to make or why are flies going to be in heaven or what's going on with that? 
01:13:03
I have never seen a fly in heaven. I've seen a lot of other insects never seen a fly. 
01:13:08
I think because Satan uses them to persecute and he does, I'm quite sure flies are not a good thing for any reason. 
01:13:16
The only thing they do is they give food to the frogs, the lizards and the snakes. 
01:13:21
They're feeding people for the reptiles. That's what they are. 
01:13:25
So I don't know anything further than that is a title given to him that I guess maybe he didn't really have any authority except over that one thing. 
01:13:33
Yeah, that's an amazing time. 
01:13:35
He hasn't reached the top of the animal kingdom to try to control. 
01:13:40
I can almost see, you know, 
01:13:41
The menial things that don't even really have a soul flies. 
01:13:45
Yeah, I can almost see. 
01:13:46
I think he has a big fly swider in hell. 
01:13:48
It's like, you know, Satan said to Jesus, if you'll do this and this and this and bow down and worship, I'll give you all these things. 
01:13:56
It's almost as if the Lord said, you know what, you're not Lord of that. You're Lord of the Flies. 
01:14:00
That's all you're Lord of. 
01:14:02
So anyway, okay, Chrissy asked this. 
01:14:07
Is there a difference in your prayer language and in parentheses tongues and the gift of tongues? 
01:14:14
Are they the same thing? 
01:14:16
Or are they different? 
01:14:20
She's talking about the getting filled with the Holy Spirit tongues. 
01:14:24
People call it many different things. 
01:14:26
They'll they'll call it, you know, just lay hands. 
01:14:29
The evidence of receiving Holy Spirit is you speak in tongues. 
01:14:33
There's a very real reason why that happens. 
01:14:35
I know this too. 
01:14:36
When you pray in tongues or speaking tongues, Satan cannot understand you. 
01:14:40
He does not have the ability to understand tongues. 
01:14:44
It brings great confusion to him, frustration to him, aggravation to him, because we're praying in a language he has nothing to do with and does not understand. 
01:14:52
So I think one of the other purposes for having that, of course, you are praying the perfect prayer in the spirit. 
01:14:58
When you pray in tongues, regardless of what people call it, if you invited Holy Spirit into you, you pray for that gift of tongues. 
01:15:06
That's the tongues you're talking about has power in them and the enemy cannot understand them. 
01:15:11
I would advise people it's almost been kind of forgotten or maybe not even forgotten, but just not used in church. 
01:15:17
But it should be. 
01:15:18
It's something very powerful in the spirit to pray in the spirit. 
01:15:21
And you can even say, Father, I'm praying for this person in the spirit. 
01:15:25
You may not even know if you don't get an interpretation of those tongues. 
01:15:29
I tell you this, you are praying the perfect prayer for that person, for that situation, and the enemy can't try to do anything about it. 
01:15:36
He doesn't know what you're saying. 
01:15:37
So the thing is for tongues, whether it's one or the other, Satan cannot understand those tongues. 
01:15:43
So it sounds like Chrissie's trying to decide if the terminology, if your prayer language and tongues are the same thing. 
01:15:53
You're saying it's the same thing, right? 
01:15:56
In that way, if it is those tongues, but you can pray in the spirit that's not even about tongues. 
01:16:03
When you pray a prayer in the spirit that is anointed, that God has given you to pray or something you're passionate about praying for, 
01:16:11
it makes it powerful because it's coming from your heart. 
01:16:14
So that I also would, that would be another way praying in the spirit or into the influence of the spirit. 
01:16:20
That would be different than tongues. 
01:16:22
Okay, so I'm not quite clear. 
01:16:24
If you pray in the spirit, are you praying in a kind of a tongue? 
01:16:28
Are you just praying with your own words? 
01:16:30
But you're, but you're, but you're praying in the spirit. 
01:16:33
What are you saying? 
01:16:34
There are two different types. 
01:16:36
There's two different types. 
01:16:38
You may not even be filled with the Holy Spirit. 
01:16:41
You can pray a very powerful prayer and Holy Spirit may be guiding you into praying that. 
01:16:47
You may hear him say, well, don't forget about praying about this. 
01:16:49
Don't forget this person and you pray when you're in your prayer time, then that is a powerful prayer. 
01:16:55
That would still be praying in the spirit. 
01:16:58
Now praying in tongues that you know for sure that's exactly what that is. 
01:17:02
Praying in tongues that the Holy Spirit brought to the earth when he was sent to the earth and you speak in those tongues. 
01:17:09
Those tongues are a spiritual language. 
01:17:12
Okay, now I'm going to drill down one more time because even I can be dense at times. 
01:17:17
If I'm praying in the spirit, because God's told me something and I totally am tapping into him. 
01:17:24
Am I using my own language or am I using what sounds like tongues? 
01:17:28
You can use your own language. 
01:17:30
Okay. 
01:17:31
If he has told you to pray that way. 
01:17:32
Okay. 
01:17:33
If it's a special prayer or certain reason why he's asking you to pray, then that could be, it could be. 
01:17:38
But praying in tongues is that heavenly language that comes down in your tongue as you begin to utter those, 
01:17:44
its mainly sounds or syllables that you're praying. 
01:17:48
Yeah. 
01:17:49
Something that we may not understand. 
01:17:51
But I remember the day when somebody would say, let's pray and somebody would get a message in tongues. 
01:17:56
Someone else in that meeting would get an interpretation and they'd actually see what those tongues were because the Holy Spirit gave them that interpretation of that. 
01:18:04
And either that or just declaring and decreeing yourself. 
01:18:08
Sometimes when you declare and decree, people will do that in tongues. 
01:18:11
That doesn't mean it's for an interpretation. 
01:18:13
That means there's something that's serious, serious that they want to pray about. 
01:18:16
Okay. 
01:18:17
Now, John, it was said, John was in the spirit or he said, I was in the spirit on the Lord's day. 
01:18:24
What was that if you can put that into words? 
01:18:28
It is a, it's a way that you walk your life out. 
01:18:32
I'm in the spirit a lot. 
01:18:34
I walk in the spirit a lot. 
01:18:36
That means I'm not, I'm not being, I'm not receiving man stuff. 
01:18:42
I'm not taking man for any answers. 
01:18:44
I'm not, I'm not, I don't have everything come along and I don't gauge it or see it by the flesh. 
01:18:51
Because it says if you walk in the spirit, you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 
01:18:56
I mean, that means if you stay in that place of always hearing and listening, then you're going to know what to do and say at all times. 
01:19:03
You won't think, well, I better judge just by the flesh. 
01:19:06
This is what so and so did about the situation. 
01:19:08
Or I think this would be the best way to do this, you weren't, you weren't hearing that in the spirit and you have to stay tuned into the spirit. 
01:19:16
And then you will be letting God, everything that is presented to me, I judge it according to what the spirit of God would say or do about it. 
01:19:26
I do not judge it by my flesh. 
01:19:28
Okay. 
01:19:29
Well, that, okay, that leads me to one more because you know me and my rabbit trails. 
01:19:33
Okay. 
01:19:34
30 years ago ish 30, maybe 32, there was a gentleman and he was one of the elders in a church. 
01:19:41
This is in Texas and everybody want his first name is Glenn. 
01:19:45
Everybody wanted Glenn to speak over them because he would prophesy. 
01:19:49
He would use that we use the term read their mail. 
01:19:51
He would, he would know things and he would prophesy and everybody wanted it. 
01:19:56
He was a godly man. 
01:19:57
I sought counsel from him from time to time during the time that I knew him. 
01:20:03
He would speak these words over people. 
01:20:05
He'd call him out from the front. 
01:20:07
He had never yet spoken in tongues. 
01:20:10
Talk about how that was possible or what that means. 
01:20:15
Well, you know, people can prophesy. 
01:20:19
You can prophesy without speaking in tongues. 
01:20:22
That's a totally different thing. 
01:20:24
Everyone can be prophetic. 
01:20:26
It says so in the Bible. 
01:20:28
From a prophetic viewpoint, doesn't mean you had to be filled with the spirit. 
01:20:33
Doesn't mean you had to speak in tongues. 
01:20:35
And I know friends, I have people that do it a lot and that your personal choice to invite. 
01:20:43
You have to just like invite Christ to invite Christ to be your savior and then he moves inside of you to get the Holy Spirit. 
01:20:51
Now, when you get saved, the Holy Spirit comes along side of you and he will guide you from that place. 
01:20:56
When you invite the Holy Spirit to indwell you, he actually moves in and then you hear him from in here, not out here. 
01:21:03
But that doesn't mean you can't be prophetic. 
01:21:07
People can hear prophetic words. 
01:21:09
You hear God say things about people and then they say them. 
01:21:13
And then they're being prophetic. 
01:21:15
That has nothing to do with being filled with the spirit. 
01:21:17
Okay, I'm going to give you one more cat. 
01:21:19
You're on a roll and you're doing good. 
01:21:21
So Paul writes and he says, your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. 
01:21:32
Is it or is it not true that when you receive Christ at that moment, your body becomes the temple of the Holy Spirit? 
01:21:40
Are you saying he only comes beside you so far? 
01:21:44
Yeah, I would say he comes beside you. 
01:21:47
It is where Christ dwells in you. 
01:21:51
So when you invite Christ as your Savior, he does come inside of you and then he is in there. 
01:21:57
But he said I will send the Holy Spirit. 
01:21:59
When Christ went back to heaven, I'll send him to lead you and guide you and show you things to come. 
01:22:04
He does that. 
01:22:05
Holy Spirit is up here. 
01:22:06
Yeah, okay. 
01:22:08
Once you invite Holy Spirit in, then you become also a temple of the Holy Spirit. 
01:22:14
You're a carrier. That's what that means. 
01:22:17
The temple of the Holy Spirit doesn't mean you're a church. 
01:22:19
It means you're a physical carrier of Holy Spirit who has now come to indwell you and he will show you things to come. 
01:22:26
He'll give you a revelation on the word of God. 
01:22:29
He may give you things to say to people also that would be professional. 
01:22:32
Yeah. 
01:22:33
Okay, can I give you one more? 
01:22:34
Sure. 
01:22:35
These are experience here on the roll. 
01:22:37
We're in the spirit, walking in the spirit. 
01:22:39
Okay, when I first, I was baptized at the age of 10, I believe I was saved, although it was in that tradition that didn't know very much about it, but they accepted Christ. 
01:22:49
Okay, when I had this encounter with the Lord 1981, so 41 years ago, I had an encounter where the spirit, it was walked in the room in the Bible. 
01:23:03
It was almost as if the word came alive on top of the Bible. 
01:23:07
It was almost three dimensional. 
01:23:09
The woman went into slow motion. 
01:23:11
I knew nothing yet about being filled with the spirit. 
01:23:14
I never asked for the Holy Spirit because I didn't believe in it. 
01:23:17
From that moment on, the Bible flipping came alive to me and I couldn't put it down. 
01:23:25
I was reading and reading. 
01:23:27
So what was that? 
01:23:37
I would say he probably came over you. 
01:23:43
If you had never actually invited him in, I also know this. 
01:23:47
People who are in services where a lot of people are getting filled with spirit, he just comes in anyway. 
01:23:52
Okay. 
01:23:53
If you're attending, back in the day when people really began to get filled with the Holy Spirit, I remember those days. 
01:24:00
I was born in the 50s. 
01:24:02
I remember those days, but people began to sincerely seek the Holy Spirit. 
01:24:07
They would go to meetings where people get filled with the spirit and the Holy Spirit was over everybody in there and all of a sudden they would just get to them. 
01:24:16
They would start speaking in tongues and then after that, they just continued to speak in tongues. 
01:24:24
There are ways if the Holy Spirit knows your heart and knows that your soul cries, he'll just come in. 
01:24:27
If you don't mind, you can always say, I don't receive you. 
01:24:30
He's done that. 
01:24:32
I did that very profoundly in years later as I learned about it, but at this one event, that happened to me. 
01:24:41
I realize the scripture was about to come alive until a few days later, but in the same meeting and a group of us that knew nothing about that, inviting the Holy Spirit, our friend who heard the encounter that I was describing that I had just had, 
01:25:01
Nils down in prayer and she started speaking in tongues under the anointing of the Holy Spirit at the same meeting because of the same encounter I had. 
01:25:11
I didn't get that for a few years later. 
01:25:13
She had it instantly. 
01:25:15
So it was like, it sounds like what you're describing, like he just came in anyway, almost, although I did invite him years later. 
01:25:21
So fascinating thing. 
01:25:23
I think it's the spirit, the spirit does know everything everywhere. I mean, he just, Holy Spirit knows everything everywhere at all the same time. 
01:25:32
He knows it. He knows what, what, what, what your heart is. He knows what your hunger is. 
01:25:37
And if he knows that what you're crying out for, even if it's inside, he's just going to come move in. 
01:25:43
That's good. That's really, really good. 
01:25:46
Yeah. And I had to contend for tongues years, like I said, a few years, and I kept asking and asking and he kind of like took his good time for the times. 
01:25:55
But, but, you know, I, but the scripture was like so alive. I had never heard had anything like that in my life. 
01:26:02
I thought, where did this, where did these birds come from? 
01:26:06
You know, one, one example is we, I, we, we got invited our group. 
01:26:13
Okay, we, I was always a part of the father's company, dance company, Christian dance company, very powerful in the spirit. 
01:26:20
They did a lot of dance intercession and stuff like that. 
01:26:23
And they were invited to come to a Baptist church. 
01:26:29
Somebody wanted to know this, how do you use Christianity? How do you preach the gospel? 
01:26:35
And they invited, but what no one ever said to us was this church had been seeking more of God for six weeks. 
01:26:43
They were having nightly services seeking God. We want the more, they didn't even know what the more was. 
01:26:48
They didn't know Holy Spirit. They were seeking, seeking, seeking, seeking. 
01:26:52
And the day before we came, the whole church got baptized in the Holy Spirit by the Holy Spirit. 
01:27:00
Wow. 
01:27:01
And so while we were there, they knew we were spirit-filled people. They knew we were, they called us tongue helpers. 
01:27:06
They knew we were. So when they got into performing, they came up and said, can we please ask a question of somebody in here? 
01:27:13
And they started speaking in tongues. And then the whole church started speaking in tongues. 
01:27:17
They went, we, we need to know what is this? What is this? What is this? We can't stop doing it. What is this? 
01:27:22
Wow. 
01:27:23
The whole church of 200 some people, they were seeking more. That was the more they got invaded by Holy Spirit. 
01:27:32
And, and we, we didn't laugh at them, but we just kind of left at the situation. 
01:27:37
Yeah. 
01:27:38
And we said, you have been pursuing more of God, more of God is baptism in the Holy Spirit. 
01:27:44
Once you receive Christ baptism, the Holy Spirit is what you should ask for next. 
01:27:47
You were seeking more, more of him, more of Christ, you wanted more. He gave it to you. 
01:27:53
So what you have now is your prayer language that is from Holy Spirit. 
01:27:57
And if he's moving on you to pray in those tongues, just keep praying in those tongues. 
01:28:01
And probably one day I'll come along and somebody will get an interpretation in the church can stand up and tell you what was just said by that person. 
01:28:08
But you, you started on the journey that your denomination almost never does. 
01:28:13
Yeah. 
01:28:14
The whole church got it. They weren't telling anybody. 
01:28:17
They found out what it was. 
01:28:20
Well, you know, and I've told the parts of the story on and off, but I was at that meeting to set them straight. 
01:28:26
I knew they were deceived and off and wrong. 
01:28:30
And so God knew my heart because I wanted to do right and be right. 
01:28:35
Yeah. 
01:28:36
And the way I describe it is God walked in the room by the spirit. 
01:28:39
The scripture came alive and I, and I never looked back as far as the scripture. 
01:28:44
It just came alive. 
01:28:46
But then later I would. 
01:28:47
So God will do all kinds of funny, crazy things that don't, that don't match anyone else's experience. 
01:28:54
Well, how did that happen to you? 
01:28:56
I don't know. 
01:28:57
Well, all I know is once I was blind now, I see it's like that. 
01:29:02
You know, so well, Kat, thank you so much. 
01:29:05
This is really, really, really good. 
01:29:07
I know a lot of people got help. 
01:29:09
Would you go ahead and pray for the people and whatever God gives you. 
01:29:13
Yeah, Father, I just pray for all of your children, God. 
01:29:17
I pray for those even thinking they don't know you don't know your son yet, God, that their eyes be open. 
01:29:23
That especially this time of year, open their eyes to the truth about the darkness, but also about you and who you are. 
01:29:32
Your son gave us life for all of us. 
01:29:34
Let them live by that truth. 
01:29:36
I thank you, Father, that the darkness is about to be pushed back, crushed and pushed back in these coming days on the earth 
01:29:42
when the glory will be seen around the world, when man will be free of evil and darkness for a very long time 
01:29:50
and that new inventions and creations are coming. 
01:29:52
Bring hope. 
01:29:54
I impart hope to those people right now. 
01:29:57
Hope for life, hope for freedom, hope for joy, hope for celebration, hope for your family. 
01:30:04
Hope that comes from God alone. 
01:30:07
Let them feel your presence, begin to invade them, invade their home. 
01:30:12
Let them know you love, that you care for them very much, that your son would have done it all over again because he loved. 
01:30:20
I thank you, Father, for the darkness being fully exposed, justice coming and us getting on in acceleration with our lives 
01:30:28
for all the things you have planned, Father. 
01:30:31
I just release life and presence of God, his will, his way, the good days coming on this earth. 
01:30:39
In Jesus' name, receive it. Amen. 
01:30:43
Amen, amen. 
01:30:44
So good. It's always, always so good. 
01:30:46
Today felt even better. 
01:30:48
It always feels better, but God bless you. 
01:30:50
Can't talk about. 
01:30:52
Enjoy your cake. 
01:30:53
I have one too. 
01:30:54
I'm going to take a bite. 
01:30:55
You're going to take a bite. 
01:30:56
I'm going to take a bite. 
01:30:58
Oh, yeah. 
01:31:00
Oh, man, there's nothing like chocolate cake. 
01:31:04
I said, if there was ever money in heaven, it would be chocolate. 
01:31:09
Now don't run around knowing people. 
01:31:11
I said chocolate was money in heaven. 
01:31:13
I said, if they don't have money, you don't need money. 
01:31:16
All the chocolate cakes, which are actually the size of your dining room table. 
01:31:21
You can have all the cake you want. 
01:31:23
Awesome. 
01:31:24
Well, thank the Lord for Milton Hershey that God gave him. 
01:31:28
The American version. 
01:31:31
The European version of chocolate was not the same. 
01:31:34
And he made the American version. 
01:31:36
I even watched some of the specials. It's just amazing. 
01:31:39
What an annoying he got put on him. 
01:31:41
Well, talk about just for a moment. 
01:31:43
You're revealing heaven.com and catcurve.com. 
01:31:46
So people will know that. 
01:31:48
Revealing heaven.com is our, 
01:31:51
it's our number one website is where we share coming events. 
01:31:57
Where we have our store there, all the products that we have made for people to enjoy and help advertise heaven. 
01:32:03
Hell has enough things out there, right? 
01:32:06
I mean, look how long Satan's been pushing all of his garbage and his junk and his darkness. 
01:32:10
It's about time heaven flooded this earth with things you wear, you walk on, you hang on your wall, you drive on your car. 
01:32:17
We, we, we reveal heaven on earth, but we also have to create it. 
01:32:21
So that's where you would find it on revealing heaven.com. 
01:32:24
There's testimonies there. 
01:32:25
I think they're just about ready to be finished upgrading that website. 
01:32:30
Then we have catcurve.com. 
01:32:32
And the one thing about catcurve is God calls it his spiritual platform to say whatever he wants to whenever he wants to. 
01:32:39
That's the number one purpose for it. 
01:32:41
But it's also the only place online that you can give to me online. 
01:32:46
If you want, there's no other website. There's no other Facebook. 
01:32:50
There's no other place that I have ways for you to do this only catcurve.com. 
01:32:54
And I thank you all you guardians who are part of the guardian zone. 
01:32:58
If you sign up to be a regular member or giver, we love you so much. 
01:33:03
We couldn't do this without you. 
01:33:04
We bless you in the name of the Lord. 
01:33:06
We pray over all the monies that you send in to help reveal heaven to this world. 
01:33:11
And God will thank you also one day. 
01:33:15
Being a part of us and look forward to greatness in your life. 
01:33:19
Great days of glory coming. 
01:33:21
Your children being redeemed to this country being redeemed. 
01:33:25
The world being redeemed. 
01:33:27
It's not time to end everything yet. 
01:33:29
Only the father knows when that is and he's not ready to give it up people. 
01:33:34
That was handed over because he isn't going to have any longer. 
01:33:38
He thinks he does. 
01:33:39
But remember, yeah, remember, he's an epic failure. 
01:33:44
That's what he is. 
01:33:45
God is the glory. He's filled with glory, love, life, and he has power that he will use on your behalf in these coming days on the earth. 
01:33:54
And you will know that he has been with you all along. 
01:33:57
He loves you. 
01:33:58
He will never leave you. 
01:33:59
His son gave everything for you. 
01:34:02
So Father, thank you for blessing everybody. 
01:34:04
Bring us suddenly in their life. 
01:34:06
They never thought what happened. 
01:34:08
That's when these things begin. 
01:34:10
When you see suddenly is one after another happening in your life. 
01:34:13
Something is happening in the spirit that will never be reversed. 
01:34:17
It will only be accelerated for you in Jesus name. 
01:34:20
Amen. 
01:34:21
Amen. Amen. 
01:34:22
Kat, thank you so much. 
01:34:23
Give our love to your staff. 
01:34:24
We appreciate it. 
01:34:25
Everybody have a great day. 
01:34:27
We're going to a quick reminder. 
01:34:28

01:34:29
He happens to be a close friend and confident to President Trump. 
01:34:33
He will be on tomorrow in our profits and Patriots show. 
01:34:37
So you do not want to miss that at this stage. 
01:34:39

And good morning. It's 11am from the Pacific Northwest Coast of the United States of America. I'm Steve Schultz, founder along with my wife Doreen of both the Elijah lists right here.com and Elijah streams that you're watching right now the video portion that you're watching now. Welcome to the broadcast. 
01:34
It's going to be a great show with cat today as always. There are a few preliminaries to to not get out of the way but to most of this. You'll enjoy very much. I do want to make an announcement about a position that has opened up. It's not, it's not a replacement position, but it's an additional account that we need. 
01:53
Put that up while I talk then you see along the bottom it says Elijah streams.com slash careers. If you know someone in the area of Albany, Oregon, and that could be Lebanon, Oregon Corvallis, Oregon, Kaiser, or Salem. 
02:11
I'm probably missing some things, but anywhere in that area, someone could even be up in Wilsonville and drive down, but we need an in person account to join our other account account on location in Albany, Oregon to, you know, we're continuing to grow and our donations are very generous. 
02:31
We need to help getting getting the paperwork done and the envelopes opened and the things that need to be done legally and all that county wise. Anyway, we're very excited about that. If you know anyone that wants an in person job. 
02:45
And it is an account. We're not talking about a bookkeeper. We're not talking who's kind of learned to do this and that, but this is a full charge accountant. 
02:56
I think they've told us we're going to leave this open for about 10 days and see who is able to respond. We're, we're trying to advertise first within the family of our viewers. 
03:08
And then if for any reason we didn't find the right person then we would advertise locally here but we thought we would. 
03:14
There's a lot of people in the area. So it may be hit someone right between the eyes in a good way that, oh man, I just was looking for a new job based on my accounting job went away, whatever that would be. 
03:26
So, all right, we're going to play now another clip of American Warriors is premiering today right after the show. 
03:33
Let me just tell you about that Bob Sanders trained for the jungles of Vietnam and commanded a platoon in a provisional rifle company on the outskirts of Da Nang. 
03:44
So this is the Vietnam War era, Da Nang. The action he saw in his first week convinced him he was going to be different. 
03:52
You can still see the pain and the regret on his face as he tells the story. 
03:57
I don't think anybody going to any war in history really knows what it's going to be like until they get there. 
04:11
The reality was pretty different. 
04:17
When you're in combat, you're much more affected when you have people you're responsible for wounded, hurt, killed, much more. 
04:32
Staff Sergeant Henry Sparks was my platoon sergeant, first platoon sergeant when I got to Vietnam. 
04:40
He bonded pretty quick and he took good care of me. Sergeant Sparks was killed in Vietnam. 
04:57
So we're producing these American Warrior episodes so we can honor those people who have gone before us and fought for this country in various wars. 
05:11
We've been in World War II, Korean, we've had people that from Vietnam era, from Desert Storm, Desert Shield. 
05:18
Even I think someone from one of the battles of Fallujah, which is one of the great battlegrounds of the Laugh Desert war in Iraq and all of that. 
05:32
There was a city called Fallujah where it was hand-to-hand combat, house-to-house combat, so I think we've had one of those already. 
05:40
I hope you enjoy it and honor the people. Here's how you get to it. In the Rumble, you type American Warriors or American Warriors 22. 
05:49
In the YouTube, you type American Warriors or American Warriors 22. 
05:54
Both Rumble and YouTube are getting a lot of play and the viewers are growing each week. 
06:01
It'll be fun to watch this grow over the period of days, weeks, months, years, whatever. 
06:06
We're going to bring in Mike and Lori Sally and talk about the wells. We haven't had them on for a few weeks, so let's bring in Mike and Lori. 
06:13
My heroes in the faith. We love you guys. 
06:18
People wouldn't notice about it. We've known each other for more than, I think it has to be more than 20 years or very close to 20. 
06:25
My daughter babysat your children. 
06:29
Now, one of them is married and one of them is doing some of the videos that people have seen has been done by the other one, but my daughter babysat them as little girls. 
06:39
You even were with the Elijah list way back when for a short stint here in Albany, I think. 
06:46
It's been quite a while. 97? 
06:50
Yeah, time flies when you're having fun, right? But after we met you and after you started this, doing some work with Elijah List in the marketing area, 
07:05
then you guys started building the village we now know as Field of Dreams and Show Mercy, your organization that you did, but you're not only with Show Mercy full time. 
07:17
If we can state this way, you're also with Elijah Streams full time. You're doing both ministries and getting the wells dug for us. 
07:23
So tell me, I'm just going to throw this to you and bring everybody up and you call for the pictures you want in the video and all that. 
07:30
Okay, so go for it. 
07:32
Yeah, do you want to show the picture of where the wells are located first? 
07:35
Sure, yeah, we'll show that. It's a little hard because it's a distant, oh, there you go. That's Lake Victoria, right in Uganda. 
07:42
I think if you actually zoom out, there's even maybe some other ones that are shown. 
07:45
Is that it? Okay. Yeah, so this doesn't look like much, but actually it does look like a lot, but it's a map. 
07:52
But it represents 59 wells that Elijah Streams has dug in Uganda over the past just less than a year, almost a little bit more than a year. 
08:04
Seven of them were done last year and 50 were done this year and we're on a pace to do 77 this year with Elijah Streams. 
08:13
That group that's up there towards the left, there's a cluster there. Is that by your... 
08:21
That's by the Field of Dreams. 
08:24
How far would it be from the one on the left to the one on the right? How far of a distance is that spread of wells? 
08:32
I don't know the distance, but it's hours. 
08:34
Oh, it's hours? 
08:35
Right, and if you zoom out a little bit, the reason we wanted to show this map is if you see the whole plate of all of Uganda, 
08:44
we wanted people to know that Elijah Streams isn't just funding the drilling by Show Mercy, 
08:50
but reaching different parts of Uganda all the way up into the Northeast, and that's more of an area dry area. 
08:58
There's a lot of things, but that's the area I want to share a story about. 
09:03
Okay, wow. 
09:04
I'm not sure which one of those dots, but it's one of the four at the top. 
09:08
Both of those two wells recently were dug and the stories I got from the pastor we're partnering with up there were incredible. 
09:18
You don't really realize whenever you say you're funding clean water, you're helping... 
09:23
I think we kind of understand like the water's contaminated and we're helping them have clean drinking water, 
09:30
but it is so much more than that. Elijah Streams, by the generous donations of our partners, 
09:37
you are restoring people's lives. 
09:39
Wow. 
09:40
This one community, it's about 1,400 people, they have never had a water well. 
09:45
They've always had to go trek long distances to get water, and it's dirty water that they're getting. 
09:52
There wasn't even an opportunity for them to have unity, have social events, because their whole life, 
10:00
their whole day-to-day was trekking to get water in the morning and then again in the evening. 
10:05
Even the children, they were telling me, don't have time. 
10:08
The parents do not send them to school because water, you can't live without water. 
10:12
You can live without education, but you cannot live without water. 
10:16
I want to show the picture of them sitting under this mango tree. 
10:22
In Uganda, in many places in Africa, trees are a big deal, and that's where they normally socialize. 
10:28
They get under a tree, and so this is an old mango tree. 
10:31
They send me this picture, and you can't see the faces or the beautiful people, 
10:35
but it's a picture of a community able to rest now that they have a clean water well. 
10:42
The water well, you can't see it in this picture, it's right behind them, but now they can come together under this tree. 
10:48
It's one of their first times where their leaders were able to gather everyone and talk together as a community and to socialize. 
10:56
Time has been restored to these people. It's incredible. 
11:01
Rather than walking for hours or miles or however long it takes, 
11:05
they can go to the meeting place where they all get together and the water is right there. 
11:10
It's right there, and they're hanging out while they're waiting in line to get their water, 
11:14
and they're socializing and getting to know one another again. 
11:18
I also heard a story about a mom. She works all day. She has to walk to work. 
11:24
Very few people in the areas where we're serving have cars. 
11:28
They have to pay for transportation, and they don't really have money to pay for transportation, so they walk to work. 
11:33
She would walk a long distance to work, work all day, have to walk all the way home, 
11:39
and then when she gets home, her next task is just to walk for miles to go get water. 
11:45
Well, Elijah Streams has just donated a water well near her house. 
11:50
Now she can come home from a long day at work after walking so many miles to get that home, 
11:55
pick up her jerry cans, and walk not very far to get water, 
11:59
and they were telling me, if you could see the smile on her face, 
12:03
she actually can prepare dinner in time for when her kids get home before. 
12:08
She wouldn't have the energy to walk that far. She'd wait till they would get home. 
12:11
They'd walk for miles together. They were just tired all the time. 
12:15
So it's more than just clean water. It's just restoring souls to be able to live life. 
12:21
It's like giving, and I'd say, you know, I would have said, well, we gave them their life back, 
12:25
but it's like they never had their life in the first place because this is their existence. 
12:31
I don't even know how they congregate all over these, whatever they are, hillsides or whatever, 
12:37
when they don't have water, but I guess they do because they know somehow they were going to walk 
12:42
miles and find some watering hole that the animals also shared. 
12:46
Right. 
12:47
That's crazy. That's just crazy. That's just crazy. 
12:51
Now you had a video that we were going to show. Do you want to talk about that? 
12:55
Yeah, this is one of the wells by that mango tree, and the people were just celebrating. 
13:00
I just wanted to share it with all of the viewers watching because it's, I love it. 
13:05
Okay. Okay. Now there was something about people were, Emily, didn't you have one where people were singing or 
13:11
are we talking about the same one? Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and play that one then. 
13:37
So they sent me that video and I was like, what are they saying? 
13:49
They're like, they are praising the Lord for this miracle that's come to their village. 
13:54
So it was exciting to see that. 
13:56
Oh man. That's just, I mean, I have no words to see, you know, we're changing people's lives and I know we are 
14:02
and I tell people we are and then when you guys come on and then sometimes your daughter will make a new video 
14:07
and we see something that we hadn't seen before. 
14:10
And every, every miracle story, I just cannot, when, when I, when we decided to help with one well, 
14:17
you, you came to us a long time ago, year or two ago and said, how'd you like to sponsor? 
14:21
Well, and I just kind of go, okay. So I did the forest guy thing. Okay, we'll do that. 
14:26
And, and then after I had done that, I began to think, well, wait a minute. 
14:32
God told me in 1987 that I was going to have a well ministry and he also mentioned little orphan children. 
14:38
Now they're not all orphans here. There's probably some, but, but he mentioned the children and wells. 
14:44
And I, I waited, it was like, whatever that is, 87. Is that what that's almost 40 years or 30. 
14:50
I, I don't have my calculator, but anyway, yeah, it's, it's 37 years or 40, close to 40 years, whatever. 
14:57
But I waited until finally it became very clear what God had, that, that the wells God's used an expression with me. 
15:07
That's, that's a known expression, which is home is where the heart is or charity begins at home. 
15:12
And so it had become clear to me over the years that wherever God, whatever God put in your life, that's where you give. 
15:19
So we didn't go looking all over the world to see where we get. We look to see who was in our life that we could give to. 
15:26
So you guys, you guys have said, we were just talking off the air. 
15:31
How much have you, we've been giving to even other things that other than water. 
15:38
Can we just, let's just tell people what you estimated we've given to people this year from Elijah streams. 
15:43
Well, that's a lot of people. I don't think anybody really knows how, how much your donation to Elijah streams are impacting so many groups of people. 
15:53
And so, you know, one of the things we're tasked with doing is helping to find organizations to give to and good causes to give to. 
16:00
And over the past several months, just, just Lori and I, on behalf of Elijah streams has given probably between six and $700,000 to other organizations. 
16:11
And that's not including just the wall of projects. And so I want to encourage people just, you know, Steve is one of the most generous people. 
16:19
And I know you all know this, but he's one of the most generous people that I've ever met, if not the most generous people. 
16:25
It's true. It's true. But when you're sewing into Elijah streams, you don't even have a tip of the iceberg of the impact that you're making for the kingdom of God in thousands and tens of thousands and probably millions of people's lives. 
16:40
And so it really is making a big difference. And Steve's not going to, Steve's not going to brag on himself and on Elijah streams. 
16:48
But I want you to know that you're, you're giving is absolutely unbelievably making a huge impact around the world. 
16:55
Well, very good. Thank you for that. So there was a picture of a church. We didn't show that picture. Let's show you the church that that. 
17:04
Now, go ahead. It's not by where the mango tree was. It's in a different area. But the thing is, is we've shared before, you know, at first I was shocked. 
17:13
I started getting stories of hundreds of people giving their lives to Jesus. And then the next thing I know we are over a thousand. 
17:20
I don't have the exact number, but it's over well over a thousand. And my team sent this picture of a church that the community, they gathered funds and they all pitched in somebody donated this land. 
17:31
Because so many people gave their lives to Jesus after one of the Elijah streams wells was opened. And I think we understand if you have running water all the time, just the miracle that this is to these people. 
17:45
I mean, this week they're commissioning another well that's been drilled and when they do a big commissioning, they do a big party. 
17:52
One area is taking it upon themselves. The the local chairperson, which is like the mayor of the area. They are renting some tents there. They've gathered all of the pastors. 
18:03
They called all the churches to come together as one and they're doing a huge celebration. They're going to be preaching the gospel. 
18:10
I can't even imagine what what kind of reports we're going to hear from them. It's just it's so impactful. 
18:16
And Steve, whenever you say the Lord spoke to you orphans and wells, I'm confident that he knew that the fatherless. 
18:23
Yeah, into the house. 
18:25
That makes sense. 
18:27
Because he called them little orphan children, but look at, you know, yeah, you're right. That's really good, Laurie. Really, really good. 
18:36
Okay, now we today you sent me a report this morning. We're waiting for cats. So we're going to talk for a few minutes. 
18:43
And it reminded me that we had just approved a couple of other projects for your village. Talk about that and maybe the medical clinic a little bit as well. 
18:54
Yeah, so Elijah streams has donated to build a hospital at the show Mercy base and so that is in progress and I'm sure we'll be showing pictures of that soon. 
19:04
It takes a little bit of time to build things. But again, it's it's going to be a hospital where people can come and get treatment. It's right next to a birthing center that Elijah streams is also helped to fund part of it. 
19:16
And you've also donated Elijah streams and ambulance and emergency vehicle for this area that's rural and rural area and they don't have access. 
19:27
We have our clinic now, but we're not able to treat every every sickness like serious things. And so sometimes it'd be challenging to figure out how to get them to the city. 
19:37
And so we have an ambulance to again, this is going to help the people physically. But the thing is, is for every patient that comes in, we pray for them. 
19:47
We share the good news of Jesus with them. And we're located in the middle of a Muslim village. And we've had stories of the Muslims coming to our clinic, not having the funds to pay. 
19:59
We charge a small amount. We also give, you know, services for free to that we charge a small amount. And so some of these Muslim women were hearing that God was showing up at our clinic. 
20:09
And so they would come and say, we don't have money, but would you pray for us? And so our team would pray and of course he would show up and, you know, they would get healed. 
20:18
Anyway, so bring their friends, they bring their friends. And so it's just another way of bringing the fatherless into the house. 
20:25
And so he's doing it through a hospital. And so thank you Elijah streams for me. 
20:30
And then there was you that you would talk with us about the toilet. And I don't know that I don't know how fancy the toilets are, but but you talk about what we just approved and how where that's going to go. 
20:44
Well, so we've been doing these water wells partnering together with Elijah streams and the need is not just clean water, but after you drink the water, what happens? 
20:54
Sanitation and so, you know, as we're discovering things in the United States, it's some of those same things. And it got me thinking, I wonder if Steve would be open to helping the community with some community toilets. 
21:06
And so we haven't started that project yet. We're doing our research. You want to make sure that we do it well. 
21:12
It'll be a place where it can get cleaned and sanitized and and just help present prevent disease again. And it's just going to impact the people in another huge way. 
21:22
It's not something you would typically think of like providing a toilet to the community, but most people don't. They're not nobody in our area has has running water in their house. 
21:31
There's nobody has flush toilets like none. 
21:33
And I mean, when they can, can I just get down dirty to use the expression. So if there's no flush toilets, what are people doing? Do they do they just go out in the bushes somewhere? What do people do? 
21:46
If you don't have a pit latrine, you go in the bushes. And that's very unsanitary. And that's a lot of people do not have pit latrines. 
21:53
And so what this is going to be is a similar to a pit latrine, but bigger, nicer, tiled, you know, something that you could clean. 
22:00
And so it's going to be in an area where several families can use it. So just something simple like having a place to go to the bathroom is not is not common. 
22:09
No, no, yeah, some, some local schools to that don't have proper facilities so that the students can have a place to go. 
22:17
Well, you know, when I was an only, I've only been to Africa once and it was to Nigeria and I'm sure there's many differences, but it sounds like there's some similarities because we were talking about when it's really crowded, 
22:26
traffic wise, it's mainly motorcycles, people who ride motorcycles and then some taxis and things. And it's, it's a crazy thing. 
22:33
But when we were in Nigeria, it was 2000. So that's 22 years ago, we would go by and there were places where there was water, outdoor water, and by a building and it was painted. 
22:47
Someone just spray paint on the building do not pee here because they if you didn't tell them that they would do the same thing, which, which could then hurt the water source. 
22:57
Right. 
22:58
So that's very common. We see those signs all the time. 
23:01
Really? Okay, the same thing. 
23:03
Yeah, and they'll even put a fine on there. Sometimes they'll say, you know, 50,000 chilling fine. If you urinate on this building, you don't think like, wow. 
23:12
Yeah, it's a problem. I didn't realize that how big of a deal it was, but just providing a solid hole in the ground for somebody to use the restroom is a real blessing to them. 
23:24
That's crazy. Well, there's more things you had a term a few weeks back when we were talking about you had a term that had to do with use the word wash or something. 
23:33
What was that term? 
23:35
Yeah, wash, water, something sanitation hygiene. I'm not sure what the aid I think it's water sanitation hygiene. 
23:41
Okay. And then it was so it was kind of like an acronym. 
23:44
And so we had talked about moving from just water to water sanitation and hygiene, which are like, how do you live without that? We were so spoiled and something. 
23:55
Well, they're telling me the cat is here. So we'll go ahead. Thank you so much, Michael. I appreciate you very much. We love you. 
24:01
You're doing such a great job for both show mercy and Elijah streams and getting those wells done. So blessings, blessings, blessings. 
24:08
We'll see you all soon. But okay, so without further delay, let's bring in Wednesdays with cat and Steve. Here we go. 
24:15
I don't care. There she is. 
24:37
I can't tell if that's blue or teal. It kind of likes teal, but it might be. It's teal. Awesome. 
24:45
Yeah, sometimes we match and sometimes we just look good together. 
24:50
Like right now. So I can say, okay, I see you got your don't do demon thing right on the top, but I do. 
24:59
Okay, welcome to the broadcast that we're looking forward to today. So I have a whole list of questions, but you often have something you want to share. 
25:07
If there's anything in your heart before we get into those questions. 
25:10
Um, just staying excited. Mainly, I have to say finishing packing is priority for everything except loving God. 
25:20
Okay. And it's really hard because we're so busy all the time. Yeah, but I never don't take time with God. 
25:32
That's good. Last night I was doing that really late and I love hearing what he has to say about everything right now and he just wants everybody to just continue to trust him. 
25:42
And he said, don't be concerned and do not. This is the main thing he said. Tell everybody do not let fear interfere with what you're going to see over these next couple of weeks. 
25:53
It has nothing to do with what he's going to do whatsoever. That's all he'll tell me, but he was excited when he said that. 
25:59
So I think we're going to be seeing probably a soon ending of all of this. 
26:03
I can't really say any more than that about what he showed me, but I will just say this. 
26:08
The main thing is, even though you go through everyday issues in your life, even we do hear, I know this is a supernatural place. 
26:15
We talk about we live the supernatural. We live heaven culture. We command the host of heaven. 
26:20
You know, we speak to the weather and yet and all of that, just so you all know that we have everyday things that rise up against us also. 
26:29
We always do. We all become them because we go with what God has to say, no matter what it looks like or sounds like, we will always choose. 
26:37
By the spirit and not the flesh. I think that's probably the most important thing I can tell you is sometimes, some days, especially it looks like it's never going to end. 
26:46
Or that it's too hard for you, but I can tell you it's not too hard for Jesus Christ. 
26:50
Well, Kat, you know, I got to ask you this because people would think, even I would think Kat is so close to the Lord. 
26:56
She sees him face to face often. She sits down with the Holy Spirit, your best friend, the way you said it. 
27:01
You know each of the members of the Trinity. So it would be easy for me to say, well, Kat probably just never has a stressful day and nothing ever goes wrong. 
27:10
No, I think that's probably the main thing I have to tell people is you see and hear the power of God from me all the time. 
27:20
But I live on this earth too. And just to remind you, his own son, Jesus Christ, didn't have the easiest life while he was here. 
27:28
But he sure made it exciting for everybody else. And I guess that's kind of what my part is in all this. 
27:34
I still have things to face. I overcome them very quickly because if it's the devil, especially now, there's things that happen in the natural. 
27:42
Just in your everyday life. I'm not saying tragic things. 
27:45
There's things you face every day, how to make decisions about things or maybe something happened. 
27:49
You didn't expect it or you're still waiting for something to happen. 
27:52
We face every one of those. But what are you talking about yourself? 
27:57
I choose to talk about what God has said. I choose to tell about God's plan. 
28:02
It doesn't mean I'm ignorant of what's going on. 
28:07
It means I am innocent of all the wickedness. 
28:11
I'm innocent of fear. I'm innocent of struggles against God actually saying something to me. 
28:18
I'm totally innocent against any of that because I don't do that. 
28:21
I would rather give people the power and the life of God always, even from myself. 
28:27
And just leap over the things that are in my way. 
28:30
And you do that by saying what God says. You have to understand. 
28:34
A man is, as you think in your heart, a man is as he says. 
28:39
And people will see what you do and what you say more than anything else. 
28:43
Even in your everyday life. I'm not talking about a platform right now. 
28:46
In your everyday life, how are you responding to what's going on around the world? 
28:50
Do you have a powerful word? I'm not talking about a prophetic word. 
28:53
A powerful word, God does know what he's doing. 
28:56
He does have a plan and he's being covert right now. 
28:59
But right now he's going to have to bust through. 
29:01
And you're going to see everything change for you and your family. 
29:04
That's so much better than saying, did you hear what someone so did in the White House? 
29:07
Did you hear what the fake news said today? Did you hear this? 
29:11
Why are you saying that? 
29:13
Because what you're putting in now, the same thing you're carrying, 
29:17
what's in your soul will come out of your mouth. So change what's in your soul. 
29:21
Change what you think about, what you say, what you look at, what you say to other people. 
29:27
Your soul is active 24 hours a day, even when you're sleeping. 
29:32
You're putting that soul to good use. 
29:36
You're supposed to make it better for people, happier for people. 
29:40
You're supposed to give them something they can trust by hearing God and understanding God. 
29:44
But what kind of report are you giving? 
29:47
So I'd have to say the number one thing today to say to people is, I'm giving a God report. 
29:52
I have to tell people, I am excited about what he's going to do. 
29:56
I do trust him. This earth is his. It doesn't belong to the darkness, the evil, or anyone else. 
30:01
You're about to see his hand displayed like you never have before. 
30:05
And your lives will never, ever, ever be the same. 
30:09
You're living a powerful generation right now. 
30:12
Some of the greatest things are about to happen. 
30:14
Why do you think Satan is fighting so hard to keep people in that destiny? 
30:19
Kick his butt out, give God's words everywhere you go. 
30:23
Staying excited and guess what? 
30:25
People will want to hear what you have to say because we're here to bring hope in this world. 
30:31
So, so, so good. Now, can I ask you one more question along the line about what you see and all that? 
30:37
Because people would also assume that because you see more than most people see, 
30:42
you're not only a seer by calling from birth, you are a seer. 
30:47
But God is constantly with that gift or maybe even without that gift is taking you to heaven and showing you things. 
30:53
So they would assume that cat must know everything that's about to happen and when it's going to happen. 
31:00
And she's one of the lucky few that God just tells everything to. 
31:05
I will take two of those as a yes. 
31:08
Okay. 
31:09
Which two? 
31:10
One thing I don't know for sure is what time. 
31:12
Okay. 
31:13
I don't know that. 
31:14
I do know about everything that's about to happen. 
31:17
I don't know that. 
31:18
I'm not bragging. 
31:19
I'm just saying that's what he called me to do. 
31:21
I'm a revelator. 
31:22
We reveal truth from the heart of the Father, not from man. 
31:27
That's why what I always say to you will be something the Father would say. 
31:31
Yes, he does show me all the time, everywhere. 
31:35
And I've been taking 150 years into the future just so you know that right now. 
31:39
We're not going to talk about that 150 years. 
31:41
But I'm telling you, I've seen that far into the future. 
31:44
This is like we're at a big entrance to step into something that is so powerful. 
31:49
It's called acceleration. 
31:50
It's called habitation of heaven. 
31:52
It's called baptism in fire. 
31:53
It's called the glory being imparted everywhere. 
31:55
It's called the manifested sons of God are standing up and speaking to the land, the sea and the air and it obeys. 
32:00
That's the entrance we're going into. 
32:03
And the devil is trying everything he can in his little self to stop that from happening. 
32:09
But he is going to fail and fail miserably. 
32:13
And everyone who's a part of that is going to fail miserably. 
32:16
I got to ask you this now. 
32:18
I, I, I'm with you. 
32:20
I 100 percent believe you were, you know, you've even said, even gave me a word that I would live more than 50 years from now. 
32:26
And that takes me to at least 117 years old. 
32:29
So I, I plan to do that. 
32:31
But there are people who are saying, Steve, you guys are crazy or you're just not hearing right. 
32:38
Because everything that is, that is in scripture about the one world government, they're trying to take over. 
32:46
They're trying to kill us. 
32:47
They have this is all they are so close to succeeding. 
32:51
And as you're not in any fear about that at all, there is no chance they're succeeding. 
32:58
Steve, they keep trying to come up with new lies and plans every day to work it as long as they can. 
33:04
There's already some that know this foundation is crumbled. 
33:07
And the word says these certain things must happen before the end comes. 
33:13
God is sitting on his throne shaking his head. 
33:16
You all saying there's no way I'm giving up you doing the greater works when you haven't started the greater work. 
33:22
There's no way I'm giving up my son knowing and understanding that you rule and reign with him in this world. 
33:29
There's no way I'm giving up the manifested sons and daughters of God. 
33:33
The earth is shaking not because of the evil is shaking wanting us to stand up and begin to do things that will so blow the mind of not just the left, but all the wicked and evil out there. 
33:46
We are about to make major changes in the spirit realm, which will then fall into the physical realm. 
33:52
So if you read your Bible, I hope you do. 
33:55
You're leaving a whole lot out if you think it's going to wrap up right now. 
33:59
Stick your rapture rug in the closet, get your crown on honey, because you're about to rule and win with Christ. 
34:06
That is what is next. 
34:08
Next is not fail, crash and burn. 
34:10
That would be for hell. 
34:12
Fail, crash and burn. 
34:13
But not for those who believe and trust him and he's already got your name written in a book saying you'll do these things. 
34:19
Why would he pull the rug up from underneath you and go rapture you with it? 
34:23
Yeah, that's good. 
34:25
Can you talk any more about because we know you've talked a lot about justice that's coming. 
34:32
God, we are in a time of justice. 
34:35
Can you give any more detail about what justice you've seen? There are people that are so wicked that some of them were leaders of this nation and their cohorts. 
34:47
I mean, what to what kind of detail has God shown you how severe this justice is about to be towards those that have done wickedly? 
34:56
Some are going to die. 
34:58
That's not me killing him, by the way. 
35:00
Yeah, Supreme Court doing it. 
35:03
It's not the government doing it. 
35:05
I can tell you right now, you better look at the hand of God because there's times in the Bible when he personally intervened himself. 
35:12
There will be natural man to help this happen, but don't look to the Supreme Court to be your answer. 
35:17
Don't look for these elections to be your answer. 
35:20
I'm telling you right now, God is going to have his hand in this. 
35:23
Yes, like I said, natural man will be involved because they do govern here, but a lot of them are about to be removed. 
35:32
And a lot of the other side trying to take over will be removed. 
35:36
This is as simple as I can tell you. 
35:38
Many will live in prison for the rest of their life. 
35:40
How do you like that one? 
35:42
Some are just going to, they're really going to crash and burn literally, literally. 
35:46
God said, I will take them off the face of the earth. 
35:50
Some, I said some. 
35:53
God said some. 
35:54
He made me say it again. 
35:56
Some will not live until this is over. 
36:00
Wow. 
36:02
God is about to establish, not him down here on the earth personally, but what will be established after this will be a just government that will want this country and even the world to succeed. 
36:14
That's what you can look forward to. 
36:16
That is for sure. 
36:17
Write it down right now. 
36:18
That's what's going to happen. 
36:20
Justice is going to be served like never before at a degree never given before. 
36:26
He made me say it twice. 
36:30
You will see people haul up in handcuffs. 
36:32
You never thought they would do that to them. 
36:35
But I'm telling you, don't worry. 
36:37
It will be seen and it will be known. 
36:39
The next part people will not be hidden. 
36:44
Okay. 
36:45
That's good because there's been so much that's been hidden that we didn't get to see. 
36:49
There must be justice going on behind the scenes that we're not seeing. 
36:52
And I'm kind of anxious to see some of the results with my own eyes and be, you know, 
36:57
I'm not saying a court will not be used. 
37:00
Yeah. 
37:01
We'll just say this. 
37:02
We don't have to depend if you're always looking at man. 
37:06
Yeah. 
37:07
What man has said and what man is saying will happen. 
37:10
If it doesn't line up with what God has happened, then what they're going to say is not what there's won't happen. 
37:15
It goes between a man and God who carried you in him for eternity before he stopped to make time for a while. 
37:24
Yeah. 
37:25
You better know who who is. 
37:27
I don't care if people don't know God's not in charge. 
37:29
Oh, make me laugh. 
37:30
Go stand before he's done that. 
37:32
Yeah. 
37:33
Yeah. 
37:34
Well, we just laugh if you said that because let me tell you what, when he feels like it and when he has to, he will come in person. 
37:41
Yeah. 
37:42
And you said so a minute ago about, I don't remember exactly how you word it, but basically don't, don't look to the election to solve. 
37:49
What did you say about the election and what, how that was not. 
37:53
I do not think that these midterm elections are the thing that's going to solve everything. 
37:58
Because people are thinking, yay, it looks good for this party. 
38:01
That looks so good for that party. 
38:03
This person's getting in this person's not in. 
38:05
When God is done with all this mess, he's going to have it. 
38:08
They're who he wants in and I can tell you that's who you trust. 
38:12
You have to trust him. 
38:14
I'm not saying some good won't come out of it. 
38:16
I'm just saying it will not be the answer to everything. 
38:19
Why would we need God? 
38:22
Yeah. 
38:23
Good stuff. 
38:24
Kat, really, really good stuff. 
38:26
You know, I can tell, you know, that that was like, we didn't know that was coming, but it came with a, with the flash. 
38:31
That's good. 
38:32
I'm very encouraged. 
38:33
All right. 
38:34
You ready for this? 
38:35
Yes, that's good. I'm very encouraged. 
38:38
All right. 
38:39
You ready for a few questions? 
38:40
Yes, I am. 
38:41
These questions, you know, we technically, they're supposed to be about having, but people have all kinds of questions for you. 
38:46
So I'm going to just start at number one. 
38:48
Okay. 
38:50
Jack, Jack says, I know that there's theaters in heaven because you talked about that and lots of entertainment heaven, but are there. 
38:58
Are there any organizations with fun programs or a TV set in our mansions? That's an interesting question. 
39:05
I never, I never heard that one asked before. 
39:08
I never saw a TV in anyone's mansion. 
39:10
That doesn't mean that you can't do programs in different places. 
39:13
They just have different ways to do it. 
39:15
It would probably just be, I don't know. 
39:17
I'm not brilliant enough. 
39:20
I don't have a degree of great genius. 
39:23
I do have in heaven with revelation, but not stuff. 
39:27
I never saw a, most people I think, I know a lot of people go out to watch things, attend things and do things. 
39:33
I'm not saying they don't have a way that you can't see something. 
39:36
It's not like any of the televisions we have today. 
39:39
It isn't. 
39:40
Like if you want, I do know this, I can tell you this much, you know, to play music, you have, what is the name of that thing that you can play? 
39:48
Oh, the, I, well, it's on your phone board. 
39:51
It used to be the iPod, but now it's used to be iPod, but now your phones will play music. 
39:56
I mean, it's streaming. 
39:57
So yeah, I don't even know how it operates. 
40:01
There's a dot they give you. 
40:03
I can't even tell you what it is. 
40:05
Oh, I don't know that. 
40:06
And you put it on like here and played all the different music you always loved. 
40:11
I do know there'll be some stuff from the earth. 
40:14
If it's good and decent and exciting, those kind of things still remain, but, and I'm not talking about just heavily choir singing. 
40:21
I mean, powerful people who are highly anointed, who were caught up to heaven, they still play music up there. 
40:27
They still have concerts up there. 
40:29
And you can have that. 
40:30
I guess it's like streaming on this little tiny dot, but you hear all around you. 
40:34
That's interesting. 
40:35
It is very interesting, but this, there's some technology so high and me with my 12th grade education people not explain all of that. 
40:45
Okay. 
40:46
I can tell you what tastes good and what doesn't. 
40:48
I just have seen the way things are done. 
40:51
Like I've told people before you travel on air, on light, on bands of the rainbow. 
40:57
You tap into these places you step into really and beams are like shoot out and grab you and take you to the other side of heaven. 
41:05
Like almost instantly. 
41:06
There's all kinds of ways to travel. 
41:08
Travel. 
41:09
Thank you, Holy Spirit. 
41:10
He said you're talking about travel. 
41:12
It's completely different than any way you travel on this earth is so beyond your imagination. 
41:20
But I'm telling you where you're going to really enjoy it when you get there. 
41:23
So there's things like that. 
41:24
They still have transportation. 
41:26
They still have a fellow shipping. 
41:28
They have dinner parties. 
41:30
I can call it a party. 
41:31
There's nothing wrong with the party. 
41:32
I probably doesn't mean you're going to have liquor and get drunk. 
41:35
So forget that stuff. 
41:36
You need to change the way you think, but everything in heaven is exciting is sometimes it's filled with adventure. 
41:41
You go on the adventure thing. 
41:43
And boy, they're adventures. 
41:45
I won't say anything, but they have different ways to do it in heaven. 
41:49
It doesn't mean you don't get to do some things. 
41:51
It's just done differently. 
41:53
Well, you know, you talk about music. 
41:55
I think a lot of times about my friend, Kim Clement, who's now got with the Lord, he was a violent in the spirit. 
42:03
Worshiping keyboardist. 
42:05
I mean, he could do that. 
42:07
And if he watched his fingers, you wondered, how does a man do that? 
42:11
You know, he, even when he was older, you know, 50 some 60, he probably was close to 60. 
42:18
It must have been when he passed, but his fingers would move like I've never seen. 
42:25
So does Kim, is he likely in heaven performing some of that warfare type music? 
42:33
If you know what I mean. 
42:34
I've already seen him in heaven. 
42:37
Say again. 
42:38
I've already seen him in heaven. 
42:40
You have you talking to him playing a keyboard that was not flat. 
42:46
Oh, really? 
42:47
Not like this. 
42:49
It was round like this, but it moved. 
42:52
Really fingers. 
42:54
Yeah, it was. 
42:55
It was that's what it was. 
42:57
And he was playing. 
42:58
He had his eyes shut. 
42:59
Of course, he's playing this instrument, but it was a keyboard. 
43:02
That's what they told me. 
43:04
This is a keyboard in heaven. 
43:05
And he was playing it with sounds I never heard before, but it was so powerful. 
43:09
Wow. 
43:10
I think I even wrote and told his daughter about it and they about what I saw him doing. 
43:14
Is that is when he's doing it? 
43:16
Is it not just gorgeous and beautiful and worshipful, but is it is it performing prayer 
43:22
in heaven? 
43:23
Is it like the creaking things on the earth from heaven when he's doing that? 
43:28
I, some of it, I don't understand because some of it wasn't in a language that I spoke. 
43:34
Okay. 
43:35
The sound part, the song part that he was singing. 
43:39
I just know that it was extremely amazing and powerful. 
43:42
It was very powerful. 
43:44
Okay. 
43:45
So whatever he was playing about at that time when I saw him, it was powerful. 
43:49
Yeah. 
43:50
Very good. 
43:51
And I want to come back to the movie for a minute. 
43:53
You said this before and I thought, I need to ask her this because she said, John Wayne's 
43:58
in heaven. 
43:59
And she said, you know, you don't, it's not on film. 
44:01
It's like it's live. 
44:03
It's captured live and that type of thing. 
44:06
But you said there's no violence. 
44:08
There's no evil. 
44:09
But how, how could you have, for instance, a, an, on the edge of your seat Western with 
44:16
John Wayne, and if there wasn't a bad person that had to be fought, which Western's always 
44:22
had, what? 
44:23
I think you'll have a whole new way to do that too. 
44:25
I'm not going to give that one away. 
44:27
Oh, you're not going to give that away? 
44:29
It was exciting. 
44:30
I saw a part of one with him and then it was really, it was very powerful. 
44:34
The thing that's different is you get to be in it with him if you want to. 
44:38
Oh, okay. 
44:39
I've never, I don't usually press you on this when you say, I'm not going to give that 
44:43
boy, but why couldn't you give that away? 
44:45
Is it just, we wouldn't get it. 
44:46
We wouldn't understand. 
44:47
It's something that would ruin. 
44:50
Okay. 
44:51
You'll ruin the surprise. 
44:52
Take away the excitement and this quite big surprise of what you will see up there, but 
44:58
they do have adventures filled with even, even sitting on the edge of your seat kind of adventures 
45:03
and stuff like that. 
45:04
You, they do have them. 
45:06
Wow. 
45:07
Okay. 
45:08
Okay. 
45:09
Okay. 
45:10
Okay. 
45:11
I believe I just wanted that one. 
45:13
Okay. 
45:14
Let's see. 
45:15
Rose asks how she says, can you please explain how to seal a room? 
45:20
How to seal a room from enemy forces when you're away from home, home or away from home, 
45:26
when you, when you are home or away from home, I guess. 
45:30
So she's saying, I, I guess she must mean that the room she's in, she wants it sealed away 
45:38
so enemy forces can't get in. 
45:40
I assume that's what she's saying. 
45:43
Well, a room or a building. 
45:45
Yeah. 
45:46
Yeah. 
45:47
But her room, if it's just your room, you would have to post host outside those doors 
45:54
because that is what their, that's what their, that's what their job is. 
45:57
That's what they're there for there to protect you and keep you in all of your ways. 
46:00
They need to say that and say, I'm leaving you here as sentinels to guard and protect 
46:05
everything of all of my property, this place where I live and all of this and nothing by 
46:09
any means shall harm it. 
46:10
You would say something and the host would stand, they'd stand there like sentinels right 
46:14
there and nothing would be allowed to come. 
46:16
Nothing that would hurt your place, right? 
46:19
Yeah. 
46:20
Or in your place would be allowed to come through those doors or any other entrance in that 
46:25
place. 
46:26
Oh, okay. 
46:27
That would be the number one way to do it. 
46:29
Awesome. 
46:30
All right. 
46:31
Regina asks, she says, I don't totally understand what it means to be to quote, be in the spirit 
46:37
or to pray in the spirit. 
46:38
Can Kat explain what that is? 
46:40
Is that a special gift or can anyone learn to do that? 
46:44
Did anyone learn to be in the spirit? 
46:46
So she may be thinking about John, the revelator said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day, 
46:51
I suppose that would be one example. 
46:53
Well, that's because he actually was in a place. 
46:56
Okay. 
46:57
He was in a spiritual place. 
47:00
It's almost like, I don't want to say a level of prayer is not like that. 
47:05
It's your focus. 
47:10
You always want to hear what the father is saying or what the right thing to do with. 
47:15
And you can even in the beginning say, I would like to have an answer from the spirit, the 
47:20
spirit, like Holy Spirit. 
47:21
I don't want to think in the flesh what that is unless it's a decision you have to make 
47:25
in the flesh. 
47:26
So there's a, there's a line right there that you have to decide are these things that I 
47:30
can get received information from revelation from about what I need to do about something 
47:36
that's a little bit different. 
47:37
But what John, John had just had reached a place where he was in the spirit. 
47:43
That means all around him is almost like a cloud of the spirit of God, not Holy Spirit, 
47:50
but it's a place and area that your prayers are always received. 
47:54
Your conversations with God are always received. 
47:57
And you get to a place like every decision I personally make is not made with my flesh 
48:03
mind. 
48:04
It is made with a, with a renewed spirit that God gave me when I got born again that I decided 
48:12
to go and say what God would do, do what God would do. 
48:15
And you begin to actually develop that. 
48:17
So John, even John the beloved on the Isle of Patmos had to develop that relationship 
48:23
where he was always going to be hearing what God had to say if there was something he had 
48:27
to say or something John had to say to him and he was actually in that place right there. 
48:33
In the atmosphere of the spirit, when, when the door opened up in heaven and he heard 
48:39
the voice saying, come up. 
48:41
He did. 
48:42
Cause that's because his relationship was to that place and anybody can do it. 
48:46
No, anybody, God said he would rather have you walk in the spirit so you don't fulfill 
48:52
the lust of the flesh. 
48:53
It says it in the Bible. 
48:55
It does say that. 
48:56
It does say that. 
48:57
Are you saying that does that scripture mean cause Paul said that walk, therefore walk 
49:02
in the spirit so you won't gratify the less of the flesh. 
49:06
That's what you said that are you saying that anybody can get to that place has the possibility 
49:12
of getting to the place like John, where you're walking in that spirit where it's the spirit 
49:18
realms all around you. 
49:20
And therefore when you're in that, you simply don't gratify less of flesh. 
49:23
Is that, is that what you're saying? 
49:26
So giving itself over to God, you would not even consider sin is not even a kind of sin. 
49:32
Consideration is not in your vocabulary, it's not in your lifestyle. 
49:36
There's no thought. 
49:37
There's no desire for that because you have on purpose developed relationship with the 
49:42
father or the son or Holy spirit that you would rather have what they want, what you, 
49:48
how they need it. 
49:49
God's will, God's way. 
49:51
That's a good thing to start focusing on. 
49:53
I can do God's will, but do I want to do it my way or do it even mad? 
49:57
Does it matter to me that I find out what his way would be? 
49:59
And that's like a place in that space where you begin to walk in your life. 
50:05
The walk in the spirit doesn't mean you have to be in the spirit realm. 
50:08
It means it is wrapped itself around part of you, especially this upper part where you're 
50:12
always thinking and acknowledging who God is. 
50:16
And it actually does become a way of life. 
50:19
And that's what John had developed, that way of life. 
50:22
And that's why he got caught up to heaven and shown those things. 
50:25
He, God knew he wouldn't reject that. 
50:26
He wouldn't laugh at that. 
50:27
You have to watch out what your conversation is all the time concerning God. 
50:32
You really care what he thinks. 
50:34
You really care what you want to know him. 
50:36
I mean, not that everybody has 20 more years of their life, but for 20 years I personally 
50:40
pursued to know Jesus Christ in a greater way. 
50:44
And I would not purpose find time just to go sit in a room with him and just talk to 
50:49
him before he even started to appear to me. 
50:51
I could still see angels and stuff at that time that it came like, I really wanted it's 
50:56
not like I shut out eating, I shut out sleeping, I'm not saying something weird like that. 
51:01
It's a heart desire to know him. 
51:05
And you go from level to level on everything, on dominion, on authority, on even understanding 
51:10
of the word, declaring and decreeing, ruling and reigning. 
51:13
You reach different, you reach different levels of all of that, but you have to start somewhere 
51:18
and the number one thing is don't sin. 
51:21
That's good. 
51:22
Don't look at sin. 
51:23
Don't look at the darkness. 
51:24
Don't be tempted by the darkness. 
51:27
And when it comes to tempt you, you say, I will serve the living God and him alone will 
51:30
I serve. 
51:31
I don't do that stuff anymore. 
51:32
I've given myself to God. 
51:34
I will run after his things. 
51:36
That's so good. 
51:38
Now, Kat, you said and you said it many times on the program that the Holy Spirit is your 
51:44
best friend. 
51:45
I think Catherine Kuhlman used to say the same thing. 
51:50
But one time you were pursuing Jesus, were there times when you pursued the Holy Spirit 
51:56
and other times now you're pursuing Jesus and other times now you're pursuing the Father? 
52:01
How do you decide who to pursue on a given day? 
52:04
It was always Jesus first. 
52:06
Okay. 
52:07
It was always Jesus first. 
52:08
He's the one who came and died for us. 
52:10
You know, I think if you have to know one time or wherever, I don't know in your life, 
52:15
I would say you always focus on Jesus first. 
52:17
He should be your first love. 
52:19
I mean like the person that you love the most. 
52:21
I'm not saying like a romantic love, the person you love the most. 
52:26
The fear of the Lord, by the way, is not being afraid of him. 
52:30
That's not what that is. 
52:31
The fear of the Lord is you would not want to be concerned to do something that might 
52:36
hurt him or might think negatively of something that you said or did. 
52:42
So that's you saying that. 
52:44
I would never do anything to turn away from the light or from Christ or his plans or anything 
52:50
and you have to have that mindset and some people say it's impossible and though it's 
52:53
not, I was just a normal everyday person, well, except for seeing the Spirit, but I 
52:57
still had to make decisions on my own or who I would choose. 
53:00
My friends would choose, where would I go even? 
53:04
I think probably because of my relationship so young with Christ, maybe that was a little 
53:09
bit more believable for me that I actually saw him and I saw angels, but you know what? 
53:15
You can make that same decision without seeing him at all. 
53:18
You can say I'm choosing this day to follow. 
53:22
Okay, you can be saved by Jesus Christ, but are you following what he's saying in the 
53:26
Word of God? 
53:27
Do you believe the way he says to believe? 
53:30
And I said, once you start looking at that, assist and meditate on those things or think 
53:34
about those things. 
53:35
So what are you thinking about? 
53:36
What are you spending your time doing? 
53:39
It's very important how you set aside time, even if it's 10 minutes a night saying this 
53:44
is for you Jesus, I'm going to sit over here and just talk to you, find a place to be quiet 
53:48
and just talk to you, tell you not all your problems. 
53:52
Hello, you're making a friendship, say hi, I want to tell you Jesus how much I love you, 
53:57
what you've done for me. 
53:58
I'm so excited about what you said in your Word, the plans you have for us, your home 
54:03
called heaven. 
54:04
I'm so excited about that. 
54:05
I'd like to know you more, say those words to me. 
54:07
So you're going to say, yeah, okay, you said that really quick, so don't, by pursuing, 
54:13
you don't mean, well, I'm just going to tell him all that's bothering me. 
54:16
So then he'll know that all that's bothering me, you're saying, no, no, no, that's a different 
54:21
time. 
54:22
Okay. 
54:23
Okay. 
54:24
Let's just say you're going to find somebody, you found someone to marry is every time you 
54:27
met with him, are you talking about what's all the problems and issues you had with 
54:30
him, they'd be interested, but there's a time you can always go for us to take all of your 
54:37
things to him and prayer, it says that cast all your chair on him, he cares for you. 
54:42
He's the one who restores your soul by his stripes. 
54:44
We are healed. 
54:45
I mean, there's so many things he's already done for us, right? 
54:49
Yeah. 
54:50
Nice to just give him thanks for some of those things, but really you can have a conversation 
54:55
with him. 
54:56
I would say prayer is an extended form of conversation. 
55:01
You know, when Jesus comes in to present himself to Thomas, who said, I'm not going to believe 
55:05
unless I put my hand in his wound, you know, and the side in his hand. 
55:10
So Jesus says to him, you know, bless that you Thomas, because you believe when you see 
55:18
I'm paraphrasing. 
55:20
And then he said, more blessed are those who believe, believe having not seen that that's 
55:24
a paraphrase, but that's what he was saying. 
55:27
He even said more blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe. 
55:31
So can you have any revelation on that scripture? 
55:34
Because some people don't see nearly the things you get to see. 
55:39
And yet God would like them to believe the very things that you believe, but you believe 
55:43
because you're seeing it. 
55:44
Or at least it seems that way. 
55:45
I believed it before I really saw a lot. 
55:48
Okay. 
55:49
I believe what he said to me when I was age four. 
55:53
And I repent to my sins, ask him to come and live inside of me as my savior. 
55:59
And then he appeared and goes, I will. 
56:02
I knew when he said those words, I will, he meant that his word is true. 
56:07
The truth will make you free people, not things you might assume or you may think someone 
56:13
else is sad. 
56:14
Maybe that's important. 
56:15
What's important is what's in his word. 
56:18
And I know people who live, even though they're seers, they live strictly by the word of 
56:21
God and I know I'm a bus person, but there's a lot of accountability in my life. 
56:28
And I can just tell you this, to carry something like this, you would have to have a huge amount 
56:33
of accountability. 
56:34
I'm accountable to him, but I'm still accountable to my husband as my husband, but as my God, 
56:41
I'm fully accountable to him for my life and what he has asked me to do and how to 
56:46
do it, how to say it. 
56:48
He won't let me step beyond bounds, he has made for me to stay within this limits like 
56:52
he would tell me all the time, don't let somebody make you a Billy Graham, you're not, don't 
56:58
let somebody make you a revivalist, you're not, you are a prophet, will speak for me 
57:04
what I say when I say to say it and I'll share, let you share what heaven is, the future is 
57:10
because this is what I've assigned for you. 
57:12
And I said, yes. 
57:13
Now, if he asked you something, even something smaller than that. 
57:17
Make sure you do what he's asked you to do. 
57:20
Like this cup of milk to your neighbor, they're trying to make something and they need the 
57:25
milk. 
57:26
Now, are you going to be willing to step out and maybe embarrass yourself by going next 
57:29
door and say, I thought you might use this cup, might need to use this cup of milk. 
57:34
Wow. 
57:35
Small thing. 
57:36
I do small things like that all the time. 
57:37
And I did it every time. 
57:38
Every time he said it, I would do it, that build your trust in him. 
57:43
He already knows he can trust me, but I have to see, I have to see that I can. 
57:48
And so he started with small things with me too. 
57:50
And he would ask me, and I didn't know those things, you know, I didn't always know they 
57:54
needed the cup of milk. 
57:55
He would just say, go over here and take this to this person, go over here, fly here and 
57:58
take this to this note to this person in the airport, fly over here and I would do it. 
58:03
I didn't always know all the answers. 
58:05
It's called willingness, willingness to obey. 
58:08
I do remember you telling a story once about going and flying the airport and handing someone 
58:14
a note. 
58:15
Is that a story you can recount? 
58:17
Yes. 
58:18
It was one of those times for three years, he kind of trained me by, at the spur of the 
58:24
moment, sending me all these strange places with strange reasons to go to them. 
58:30
And now you have to understand when I first started doing all this, he had me go to my 
58:33
husband and explain to my husband, this is what God has me doing. 
58:36
He needs to know that you're okay with that. 
58:39
And he turned right around and said, oh God, you can do anything with her you want to do. 
58:43
That's fine. 
58:44
And so I didn't just bypass the fact that I had a husband. 
58:48
My husband gave me permission and I could have said, I don't need you. 
58:52
That would have been so wrong. 
58:53
God would not have been happy with me if I'd have done that. 
58:56
He didn't want to separate us. 
58:57
He wanted us to be together, so I had to be willing on both sides to get to do what he 
59:03
asked me to do. 
59:04
And so, oh yeah, there was this one time, he said, you're going to fly to Minneapolis. 
59:09
And he said, I'll tell you why when you get on the plane. 
59:14
And I need you to go to the airport and you're going to walk in the airport. 
59:17
And I'm going to try to remember what you call the place where you go and buy all the 
59:21
food in the airport. 
59:22
The food court. 
59:23
I need you to go to the food court and he said, I'll tell you who to say something to 
59:27
when you get there. 
59:29
And my trip, I took, the flight gave me 45 minutes in the airport before my return flight 
59:39
that he told me to plan. 
59:40
I just flew the Minneapolis airport and then I flew back here and I had 45 minutes in between 
59:45
the flight. 
59:46
And that time you fly, he was going to make sure I guess I did it. 
59:49
I don't know. 
59:50
But that's my time frame that I had to fly back. 
59:55
And the enemy will fly everywhere in something like that to stop you from doing it or delay 
01:00:01
you doing it. 
01:00:02
And I already said, I'll do it. 
01:00:04
I will do it. 
01:00:05
I will do it. 
01:00:06
So I went, got the tickets. 
01:00:07
My husband, we got the tickets and he came to me, took me to the airport and we took 
01:00:11
off. 
01:00:12
I took off. 
01:00:13
He didn't go with me. 
01:00:14
I took off. 
01:00:15
Arrived in Minneapolis airport. 
01:00:16
But right before I got there, God said, there's a man in the airport who's got a new invention 
01:00:22
that will help change a lot of the lives in this world. 
01:00:25
He's trying to find the right buyer to help him invest in it. 
01:00:29
And I'm giving him my answer because he's asked me and I told him to go to the Minneapolis 
01:00:33
airport. 
01:00:34
And I was giving him my answer. 
01:00:36
Now I don't know this man's name at all. 
01:00:40
He said, so you're going to write down in the scratch of paper. 
01:00:42
This is what you're going to say in the scratch of paper going to hand him. 
01:00:45
Yes. 
01:00:46
My answer is New York. 
01:00:47
That is where you will go to find your investor, God. 
01:00:50
And he said, that's it. 
01:00:53
That's the message. 
01:00:54
Yes. 
01:00:55
My answer is New York. 
01:00:56
Yeah. 
01:00:57
That's it. 
01:00:58
That's what God had me write on the scrap piece of paper. 
01:01:00
He said, now you go to the food court and this guy will be marrying like a mechanic's 
01:01:04
one piece outfit. 
01:01:07
And you can't approach until he sits down to buy his head for prayer 45 minutes. 
01:01:13
I knew I had 45 minutes and on the way to the airport on the way in the in the airport 
01:01:19
on the way to the food court, this is how the devil tries to do things. 
01:01:23
My daughter calls grandson is drinking a bottle of Elvira. 
01:01:27
Oh my goodness. 
01:01:29
Now this is where my faith is. 
01:01:33
I started praying out loud at the top of my lungs running through the airport to get to 
01:01:36
the food court. 
01:01:37
I'm going to knock on the food court people. 
01:01:40
I was praying all the way there that it would be the stuff would be, I would nullify all 
01:01:45
the effects of the stuff that he drank that they would be able to find a bottle that they 
01:01:49
would get him to the medical care place so they could check him out. 
01:01:54
And I mean, I'm yelling running through the airport to get there. 
01:01:57
So I finally get to the food court and I said, amen. 
01:02:01
I was praying this on the phone with my daughter and we get to the food court and I turn the 
01:02:06
phone off and I waited, it was probably about 10 minutes and here he comes, he had like 
01:02:11
dark hair, had like a blue kind of a mechanic's outfit but a nice one and he went over and 
01:02:18
he was taking his time. 
01:02:19
I'm going to go help him pick the food because he was taking it off. 
01:02:23
And so he finally gets down and he gets his train and I'm like, you know, I'm waiting, 
01:02:27
I'm just waiting to get out of there and get my other flight. 
01:02:30
And so he comes up and he sits down and he bows his head like this, now I'm not a very 
01:02:35
quiet person. 
01:02:36
I ran up and I went, wait a minute, God, he lifts his head up and looks at me and I go, 
01:02:43
here's a note from God and I didn't even look, I didn't even watch him read it. 
01:02:48
I knew what it said. 
01:02:49
I turn, I'm running out of the food court and I hear this, praise God forevermore. 
01:02:53
And this funny and it's the guy in the suit. 
01:02:59
He got God's answer. 
01:03:00
Wow. 
01:03:01
Now I did not sign that piece of paper. 
01:03:04
He did not know who I was or anything about me and God said he doesn't need to know. 
01:03:09
He'll just know I answered him. 
01:03:12
That's amazing. 
01:03:13
What a couple. 
01:03:14
I just caught the flight just in time to get on the flight and come back. 
01:03:17
I was just shaken from head to toe. 
01:03:19
I was so excited that the devil didn't get to keep me. 
01:03:23
My daughter called me back. 
01:03:24
She said they can't believe they got the bottle, like on the little bottle and their child's 
01:03:29
really smart. 
01:03:30
It was something he was taking for something. 
01:03:32
It wasn't the kind you put in a lighter float or something like that, but it was some kind 
01:03:36
of thing he had to have so often for about three days. 
01:03:39
And he was like, not very old, I think it was like three or four genius level. 
01:03:45
He got the, what do you call that thing on a lock? 
01:03:50
The combination thing? 
01:03:51
He had that combination lock on the thing that the doctor gave to him, put it in the 
01:03:56
refrigerator. 
01:03:57
He got it out and then lost it. 
01:03:58
Oh my goodness. 
01:03:59
Now the good news, she finished telling me, the good news was she said when he found the 
01:04:03
bottle, it was empty. 
01:04:05
And this is my daughter and her husband talking to their son. 
01:04:08
I said, did you drink that? 
01:04:10
Why didn't you drink it? 
01:04:12
We have to pray right now. 
01:04:13
What are you doing? 
01:04:14
You're such an extreme person. 
01:04:15
This is my oldest daughter. 
01:04:17
Now honey, did you open this bottle? 
01:04:20
You know you weren't supposed to do it without mommy and daddy. 
01:04:24
And I can hear them. 
01:04:26
I can hear that part before I hung up. 
01:04:28
And then here comes your husband. 
01:04:29
Now son. 
01:04:30
I don't know. 
01:04:31
And I'm like, dear Lord in heaven, I'd have been shaking that kid upside down. 
01:04:35
I'd have been praying for him at the same time, but the kids are very calm until they 
01:04:40
have fun and they go wild. 
01:04:44
And so they call me back and say, we have to let you know everything's all fine. 
01:04:48
They said they could not believe they found traces of it in him, but we found most of 
01:04:51
it on his clothing. 
01:04:53
Gee. 
01:04:54
Wow. 
01:04:55
What a story too. 
01:04:56
I mean, that could have been probably, I mean, the reality is he's probably got people 
01:05:02
all over the United States and the earth that he's giving such tests to, or if that 
01:05:07
for lack of a better word, I don't know if test is the word or assignments, but I don't 
01:05:12
know. 
01:05:13
Did you consider that kind of like a test was God testing it was training, training. 
01:05:18
Okay. 
01:05:19
Training me. 
01:05:20
Okay. 
01:05:21
And so I didn't let the enemy stop me. 
01:05:24
And yet my grandson was perfectly fine. 
01:05:27
And that man got what he needed that day because he was flying from that place to one of the 
01:05:32
places that wherever God said to go to, we had three places picked out. 
01:05:37
And he was going to go to one of them from his answer. 
01:05:39
He got in food court. 
01:05:40
Yeah. 
01:05:41
That is so amazing. 
01:05:42
Yeah. 
01:05:43
I love it. 
01:05:44
Awesome. 
01:05:45
Awesome. 
01:05:46
All right. 
01:05:47
That was my life nonstop for three years. 
01:05:48
Well, no wonder you guys can trust you now, Kat. 
01:05:51
So, all right. 
01:05:52
So here's a question. 
01:05:53
Kobe asks, can people, I think this is a heaven question. 
01:05:59
Can people in the past, like in heaven do something like we do for instance, Kat mentioned 
01:06:04
she saw King David writing in his chariot in heaven. 
01:06:08
My question is, can King David, can David write in a convertible in heaven if he wants 
01:06:13
to? 
01:06:14
I think David can write in anything he wants to. 
01:06:18
He loves the chariot because it doesn't ride on the ground. 
01:06:22
It's flies in the air with chariot flies. 
01:06:26
Yeah. 
01:06:27
So, okay. 
01:06:28
So yeah, that was good. 
01:06:29
That was easy. 
01:06:30
All right. 
01:06:31
But Linda asked, when Jesus died and went into hell and took the keys from Satan and 
01:06:36
death, death, hell and the grave, why, there's a question, why didn't things revert back to 
01:06:42
the way they were before he was deceived by the serpent? 
01:06:45
So it's a why question, which God probably never answers, but why didn't he at that time, 
01:06:50
why didn't that change everything back? 
01:06:52
That's what, that's what her question is. 
01:06:54
That's not how it happens, people. 
01:06:57
He's not going to go back and change every little thing that you went through or things 
01:07:02
that you, choices you made and stuff like that. 
01:07:05
Now, there'll come a time in your life where, let's say, I don't know, you're upset about 
01:07:10
what you did or the choice you made, Adam certainly didn't make the best choice in the 
01:07:14
world, but I will tell you this, they are both in heaven, Adam and Eve are both in heaven. 
01:07:18
At one point, they did repent for doing that, or especially Adam repented for doing that, 
01:07:23
but he did make it into heaven, which is what you really want to make sure you do. 
01:07:29
But God, Jesus Christ did fix part of it, people. 
01:07:35
Then Adam gave away his authority to Satan, which is what he did in that garden, Satan 
01:07:42
said over what God had said, and that's when he remember after that that he couldn't see 
01:07:46
God. 
01:07:47
And remember people, he had to leave the garden because of what he did. 
01:07:50
Well, Jesus Christ redeemed the fact that Adam gave our rights away to rule and reign 
01:07:57
to have authority and power and be creators, Jesus Christ took that back. 
01:08:02
Yeah, when he went into hell and he took back the keys of hell, death and the grave, beat 
01:08:06
the devil to pieces, left him in the dirt and fire of hell, stripped every gemstone 
01:08:11
off of him, and even messed up the faces of the principalities and powers while he did 
01:08:16
that. 
01:08:17
That was his second part of the cross. 
01:08:18
The first part, of course, was to pay for the sins. 
01:08:22
He had to do that first when he died for our sins. 
01:08:25
Remember, he nailed to the cross all the wicked evil stuff. 
01:08:28
It's the only reason why Jesus Christ can cleanse you from your sins. 
01:08:33
But this other part of that, it was finished on the cross for that. 
01:08:37
But if he was totally finished, he'd have just gone back to heaven when he died on the 
01:08:41
cross. 
01:08:42
He didn't do that. 
01:08:43
He descended so he could have a face off with Satan to show him, you have no right to 
01:08:46
keep a righteous man in hell. 
01:08:49
You have no right over them. 
01:08:51
And then he showed him he didn't have any power over him by beating them and taking 
01:08:55
back the keys to hell, death and the grave. 
01:08:57
That didn't change everything in back. 
01:08:59
It didn't actually literally take you up to where Adam and Eve were and change that time. 
01:09:04
It changed our right as a believer to have authority over the enemy, which Christ made 
01:09:09
that perfectly known when he said, I give you power over all the power of the enemy. 
01:09:14
And then the rest of the scripture, he could say that because he got that right to do that. 
01:09:20
That's good. 
01:09:21
All right. 
01:09:22
So Jody's asked this question. 
01:09:24
How do our guardian angels interact with each other when we fight? 
01:09:31
Like if two, two believers are fighting, they each have guardian angels and they're fighting 
01:09:37
with each other. 
01:09:38
The people are, she's saying, what, what are the guardian angels doing? 
01:09:42
If you know, you mean fighting physically or say that I'm arguing with somebody that's 
01:09:48
a believer and we're just fighting about something. 
01:09:51
We're not doing good. 
01:09:52
The question is behind you, we're shaking their head. 
01:09:55
That's what they're doing. 
01:09:56
They're shaking their head. 
01:09:58
They're not saying stop it, cut it out. 
01:10:02
Oh, they'd be doing a lot more than that. 
01:10:04
They had their foot raised. 
01:10:06
How so? 
01:10:07
Well, their foot. 
01:10:08
Kick you in the butt. 
01:10:10
Oh, really? 
01:10:11
Really? 
01:10:12
I'm not kidding at all. 
01:10:13
I had a friends, close friends who did ministry really young. 
01:10:17
They were, they ministered in the like the, well, I think the early 80s, they're still 
01:10:21
ministering right now, but this is kind of at the end of the hippie era. 
01:10:26
And they would go out and they, boy, the mission field was ripe with harvest back then. 
01:10:31
And I worked on that side. 
01:10:33
I went on the side of the celebrating and the gugs and all that garbage. 
01:10:36
I was on the rescuer side, but I wasn't quite as, I wasn't quite as verbal back then. 
01:10:42
I would like help sew the carpets together in the, in the, I think a congressman or somebody 
01:10:48
gave us a, an old church and we would have music playing Jesus and give food and coffee 
01:10:54
to the, to the drug people so we could help them find Jesus. 
01:10:59
And that's what we were doing. 
01:11:00
And then they would minister out in the streets later. 
01:11:03
I'd stay there and help keep hot coffee, hot and stuff like that. 
01:11:06
But anyway, she was a seer. 
01:11:09
His wife is a seer. 
01:11:10
And they'd always, she'd see the angels going with them and they were there ministering 
01:11:15
and there was these two guys were having an argument, not her husband. 
01:11:18
So he walks up to them wants to start ministering to them, but he's not really pushing the fact. 
01:11:23
He's just trying to be polite. 
01:11:25
And she said all of a sudden she saw his angel with his foot raised. 
01:11:29
She wanted him, he wanted him, the angel wanted him to hurry up and get to business about 
01:11:32
Jesus Christ. 
01:11:33
So they stopped fighting and I'll never forget that you never did kick him. 
01:11:37
Okay. 
01:11:38
Because he finally was the angel saying something to him like, you got to talk about Jesus, 
01:11:41
Jesus, Jesus. 
01:11:42
And so finally he put his leg down, but I never forget when my friend told me that story 
01:11:47
that he was getting a little humor, he wanted to rush him along in his mission stuff. 
01:11:53
Well, yeah, you know, that, that my story about being knocked by an angel a couple of 
01:11:57
times to sit in the chair. 
01:12:00
I wasn't fighting with anybody, but I was just kind of probably being a little bit lazy 
01:12:04
in an afternoon. 
01:12:05
And he just got knocked me on the arm. 
01:12:07
Yeah. 
01:12:08
I felt this nice big knock. 
01:12:09
And then it happened again. 
01:12:10
I thought, what's going on is someone coming to the door and there's a crisis that I'm 
01:12:15
supposed to have heard and it was nothing. 
01:12:17
It was like, wait, that was your angel doing that for sure. 
01:12:22
That was your angel as a few years ago. 
01:12:24
So, all right. 
01:12:26
So Dee's asking this question, we got time for a few more questions. 
01:12:29
Dee's asked, what does it mean to seek the face of God? 
01:12:32
Scripture says seek the Lord and his strength. 
01:12:34
Seek his face. 
01:12:35
1st Chronicles 16 20 and quote, when you said, seek my face, my heart said to you, your face 
01:12:41
thought I will see. 
01:12:42
So she's wondering now, what does that mean? 
01:12:46
Seek his face. 
01:12:48
That means that you're, you're, you are really focusing on really talking to him. 
01:12:54
Doesn't mean you have to see him face to face. 
01:12:56
You want to be near him. 
01:12:58
You want to know him in a greater depth is what you're saying to him. 
01:13:02
And when he said, yes, seek my face, that man, he was inviting them to pursue him, you 
01:13:07
know, in a greater way in the relationship. 
01:13:09
That's what that's about. 
01:13:10
That's what I was saying, just find him behind, just spend alone and just talk to him like 
01:13:16
he was right there next to you because I promise you, he probably is right next to you. 
01:13:20
Talk like he's there. 
01:13:21
And one day he'll probably just appear next to you and then you'll really get undone. 
01:13:27
Yeah. 
01:13:28
Yeah. 
01:13:29
Yeah. 
01:13:30
All right. 
01:13:31
Kara, let's see. 
01:13:32
I don't know. 
01:13:33
I haven't pre read this. 
01:13:34
I would like to know if we will be able to talk to the actual animals that were on Noah's 
01:13:39
Ark and hear their stories. 
01:13:40
Are those animals like the rock stars of the animal world, for example, to the other creature's 
01:13:46
point and say, look, that's Leo and Bernadette, the lions on the Ark with Noah. 
01:13:53
So let's go here. 
01:13:54
I wouldn't be surprised if they did. 
01:13:57
That's a very creative question. 
01:13:59
You know, I wouldn't have thought of that question, but wow. 
01:14:02
So they would be. 
01:14:03
I mean, they were the ones that were protected for all of animal, all of their animals. 
01:14:07
I'm quite sure that they have conversations with all the other creatures. 
01:14:11
I'm sure they do. 
01:14:12
Yeah. 
01:14:13
I'd love to know the whole thing. 
01:14:14
They probably want to hear the whole story from them, you know, give us your point of 
01:14:18
view. 
01:14:19
What happened? 
01:14:20
What did you think was going on? 
01:14:21
And actually a lot of people want to know that period, no matter who it is that was 
01:14:25
in the Bible, you know, if it was somebody for God or one of God's own creatures, everybody 
01:14:30
wants to talk to them when they get to heaven. 
01:14:32
Very cool. 
01:14:33
The funniest thing is they want to talk to you because you just arrived. 
01:14:37
What's been going on? 
01:14:38
You know, what's been going on? 
01:14:40
I'm talking about people who've been living there for 40, 50 years. 
01:14:43
Anything important going on? 
01:14:44
What can you say? 
01:14:45
Well, I was going to ask you that question one day, and I think it's set my mind. 
01:14:48
I wanted to know, do people want news from home when you arrive? 
01:14:53
They do. 
01:14:54
You sound like you're saying they do. 
01:14:55
Oh yeah. 
01:14:56
They love to hear. 
01:14:57
They know. 
01:14:58
They know something is going on, but they want to hear in their own, in their own person's 
01:15:00
life. 
01:15:01
What has been going on around you? 
01:15:02
What needs to be seen? 
01:15:03
What has God done? 
01:15:04
Wow. 
01:15:05
You can be pretty busy in heaven too, even just enjoying yourself, but there's other 
01:15:09
things to learn and do there, too, in heaven. 
01:15:12
But yeah, when somebody new arrives, they actually have big meetings, events set up, 
01:15:18
and it's not like you're going in a conference room. 
01:15:20
Don't go there. 
01:15:21
Most of it's outside, and you sit on all kinds of things to get relaxed and everything, and 
01:15:25
someone gets up there and tells their stories, and they're very animated, but something new 
01:15:29
has been added to their stories. 
01:15:31
It's what was going on in the spirit realm the whole entire time. 
01:15:34
They were doing things in the physical realm. 
01:15:38
So they have a new part of their story. 
01:15:40
Let's say they did miraculous things happen to them, or they got to do something miraculous 
01:15:45
for God, and people, all the attention was on that person. 
01:15:47
They haven't even got to tell the other side of the story, because you've already found 
01:15:51
that out on your way up to heaven. 
01:15:53
Okay. 
01:15:54
So by the time you got there, you now know the whole in the spirit side of things. 
01:15:59
Yeah, you know a lot of, especially important things, important or powerful things that 
01:16:03
happen. 
01:16:04
Yeah. 
01:16:05
You know, and you feel like, wow, I never saw this before, this is going to be awesome. 
01:16:08
So when people go, okay, tell us, tell us, you want to hear what's going on, they will 
01:16:12
tell that kind of a story is what God showed them. 
01:16:15
He was doing, when he couldn't see what they were doing, but what happened, it's really 
01:16:19
awesome. 
01:16:20
Do you have either, is there anything happening like when you're on your way to heaven or 
01:16:25
whatever, where your guardian angel is saying to you, what were you thinking when you did 
01:16:30
blah, blah, blah, is any of that going on? 
01:16:34
You know, I think they would be the only one. 
01:16:37
I think nobody else would say anything to them at all about it, but your guardian angel 
01:16:41
who was there all the time, I always tell people, they'd have questions. 
01:16:45
I always have said that, be careful how you treat and talk around your angel, they'll 
01:16:49
have questions for you. 
01:16:50
I'm not talking, we're not talking about sins, we're talking about maybe some decisions 
01:16:54
that weren't the smartest or the best thing they ever did, and their angel gets me with 
01:16:58
them. 
01:16:59
Okay, what was going on here? 
01:17:00
Yeah. 
01:17:01
Fascinating. 
01:17:02
Fascinating. 
01:17:03
Okay. 
01:17:04
Jamelia, Jamelia or Jamelia says, you have mentioned that summer, fall, winter, and spring 
01:17:11
are four of the Father's favorite seasons. 
01:17:13
Do you know what any other of the seasons are in heaven? 
01:17:17
Well, they're not seasons in heaven. 
01:17:21
What I actually said was God told me he took four of his favorite places in heaven. 
01:17:26
Okay, places. 
01:17:27
Yeah, there's too many new, I mean, I can't even, there's no way, thousands of places 
01:17:31
in heaven people, there's no way I can number that places. 
01:17:33
Yeah. 
01:17:34
But what he did when he made the earth, he decided to do something special that would 
01:17:38
be a little bit of heaven on the earth. 
01:17:40
And this is what he was telling me, and he said, when I went and I took four of my favorite 
01:17:45
places in heaven, I took a shadow of them and made them a season on the earth. 
01:17:52
Well, that's really good. 
01:17:53
That's really good. 
01:17:54
So there would be a place where there would be brightly colored fall leaves, I would think. 
01:18:01
The mountain of spices. 
01:18:03
Mountain of spices. 
01:18:04
Oh, really? 
01:18:05
Mountain of spices. 
01:18:06
And that became our fall. 
01:18:07
Is that what you're saying? 
01:18:08
Our fall. 
01:18:09
Yeah. 
01:18:10
Very cool. 
01:18:11
Okay. 
01:18:12
Christmas town would be our winter. 
01:18:17
I love that. 
01:18:18
I love that. 
01:18:19
The fall would be our spring. 
01:18:22
And the surf park would be our summer. 
01:18:25
The which part? 
01:18:26
The surf park. 
01:18:27
Okay. 
01:18:28
Oh, I love that. 
01:18:29
Those four places in heaven, which everyone loves to go to, and there's so many, there's 
01:18:34
so many other places. 
01:18:35
I know the names of a lot of them, but I probably have to include a lot of those in my third 
01:18:39
book. 
01:18:40
But I'm just saying, that's what he did, and I thought, what a wonderful, beautiful way 
01:18:45
it is. 
01:18:46
Give us a real piece of him. 
01:18:47
Now, people are going to say, but some of them are destructive. 
01:18:49
He didn't make them destructive people. 
01:18:51
Yeah. 
01:18:52
They're not destructive in heaven. 
01:18:53
Nobody burns to a cinder in the summertime. 
01:18:55
Nobody's going to get sunburn in the summertime. 
01:18:58
No one's going to freeze in the winter up there because, you know, and he even kind of proves 
01:19:04
it proves that there is a place where winter isn't heaven because the winter we have is 
01:19:10
only a shadow of that place in heaven that does exist. 
01:19:14
That's good. 
01:19:15
The mountain of spices where everybody loves to go for trail rides. 
01:19:19
The leaves are probably huge. 
01:19:20
The leaves are about this big. 
01:19:22
The leaves never fall off the trees. 
01:19:24
They're always those different colors, but there's some purples and other colors, you 
01:19:28
know, on the leaves and you ascend every level in the mountain of spices. 
01:19:33
You smell another aroma like it was Thanksgiving or like the things in pumpkin pie. 
01:19:38
Yeah, totally. 
01:19:39
Every level you go up, you go, oh, wow, this is amazing. 
01:19:43
You go to another level. 
01:19:44
The best part is when you get to the top of this mountain range, it's not the biggest 
01:19:48
mountain range in heaven, but it's one of the most beautiful. 
01:19:51
You look down into this valley that goes forever. 
01:19:53
It's called the Valley of the Falls. 
01:19:56
And in that valley, it is always like spring. 
01:19:59
Really? 
01:20:00
There's flowers so huge you dive off of the waterfalls. 
01:20:04
You dive up in heaven. 
01:20:06
You can do that. 
01:20:07
It's for fun and you dive inside of this massive flower that goes like eight people and you 
01:20:12
roll around this flower and then flop back out into the river and then you go back up 
01:20:17
and climb back up and jump again. 
01:20:19
Very cool. 
01:20:20
Flowers are everywhere in the Valley of the Falls. 
01:20:23
It's absolutely beautiful. 
01:20:24
On the spices smells like this. 
01:20:27
I'm one of those that loves that whole Thanksgiving cinnamon vanilla probably in there and what's 
01:20:36
the other one? 
01:20:37
There's another flavor. 
01:20:38
Cinnamon, vanilla. 
01:20:39
Yeah. 
01:20:40
Well, it's all run together and you smell it and you go, oh, it's that Thanksgiving 
01:20:47
in Rome. 
01:20:48
So is there any kind of like when you smell that in heaven, does it cause you in heaven 
01:20:52
to think of Thanksgiving because that's where you first smelled it? 
01:20:56
I'm just curious if you would have any reminiscent. 
01:21:00
I think probably my favorite thing out of the entire Thanksgiving would be the pumpkin 
01:21:04
pie. 
01:21:05
So when I think about pumpkin pie, that's Thanksgiving to me, of course, thanking God. 
01:21:10
Of course, that's number one. 
01:21:12
Right. 
01:21:13
Yes, but in heaven, you can have Thanksgiving all the time. 
01:21:16
No turkey is killed for it. 
01:21:18
Just so you know, no harm is called to any animal, human or spiritual, all the stuff 
01:21:23
is made. 
01:21:24
They just, it's just made. 
01:21:25
Okay. 
01:21:26
You'd say turkey and it'd be made, but nothing would die for you. 
01:21:29
Yeah. 
01:21:30
Yeah. 
01:21:31
You're not eating. 
01:21:32
They would not be very happy if you're trying to kill them. 
01:21:33
What do you think you're doing? 
01:21:34
I'm getting one feather from my body. 
01:21:36
Now, this is what a turkey would say to you in heaven, right? 
01:21:39
Just go on home to your home and, and, or, and just order it. 
01:21:41
Just order it. 
01:21:42
So my question back to the other one, let's say that the pumpkin pie, because pumpkin pie 
01:21:47
is one of my favorites too. 
01:21:48
It sounds like you and I are a lot of like, we're photographers, we like chocolate cake, 
01:21:51
we like pumpkin pie, we like the spices. 
01:21:54
If you're having pumpkin pie in heaven, would you feel reminiscent of the Thanksgiving on 
01:22:02
earth? 
01:22:03
Would it, would there be something in that that you would remember that? 
01:22:06
Yeah. 
01:22:07
The thing I would remember that would be my family gathered around the table, okay, praying 
01:22:11
and thanking God for our food. 
01:22:14
Okay. 
01:22:15
So you're eating that. 
01:22:16
Yeah. 
01:22:17
Okay. 
01:22:18
Cool. 
01:22:19
All right. 
01:22:20
I'm going to give the clock. 
01:22:21
We got time for one more. 
01:22:23
Well, I'll just, I'll just, Gary's asking this question. 
01:22:32
It's a general one. 
01:22:34
I don't know because you're always revelating, but he's saying, what is the latest thing 
01:22:39
the father's revealed to you about heaven that he wants to reveal to us? 
01:22:44
Is there anything that's been recent that you learned that? 
01:22:47
You may have to re-mention that because I was laughing at Jen, sorry people. 
01:22:51
Oh, well, Jen. 
01:22:52
Okay. 
01:22:53
Yeah. 
01:22:54
So Gary's asking, what's the latest thing the father has revealed to you about heaven 
01:22:58
that he wants to reveal now to us? 
01:23:01
Something new you mean? 
01:23:02
Yeah. 
01:23:03
Something new that you've seen. 
01:23:04
If there is something. 
01:23:05
There's so many. 
01:23:06
There's just so many. 
01:23:07
We'd have a list a long, mile long. 
01:23:10
Yeah. 
01:23:11
I'll just tell you probably one of the funnest things people get to do, and I know I mentioned 
01:23:17
it a little bit about it, but there's a place where you do learn to fly. 
01:23:20
Yeah. 
01:23:21
It is, it is like a fun thing to do, right? 
01:23:24
Yeah. 
01:23:25
I already told you all, well, this got me, some people saying, well, I don't like you 
01:23:28
anymore. 
01:23:29
It's okay if you don't like me. 
01:23:30
You don't have to let me. 
01:23:31
You don't have to let me. 
01:23:32
You don't really want to put like heaven. 
01:23:33
I will. 
01:23:34
I will. 
01:23:35
I'll be okay. 
01:23:36
I'm not sure why they got so I'll put like where they offended because they thought you 
01:23:39
should automatically know how to fly. 
01:23:41
Therefore it makes no sense. 
01:23:42
No one explained and teaches you how to do it. 
01:23:45
Steve. 
01:23:46
Oh, that's what it was. 
01:23:47
And they got it. 
01:23:48
And they made it happen. 
01:23:50
Yeah. 
01:23:51
Yeah. 
01:23:52
He doesn't not wear just so you know, let's get this clear. 
01:23:56
He does not wear his superman costume. 
01:23:58
He does not do that. 
01:23:59
It's just Christopher Reed. 
01:24:01
It's Christopher Reeves who teaches you how to fly. 
01:24:03
Of course, God thought that would be quite fun. 
01:24:05
Yeah. 
01:24:06
Our God does have a sense of humor and it is funny watching people how to learn and all 
01:24:12
your friends come to watch you when you start because sometimes you twirl around. 
01:24:15
You don't do so well. 
01:24:17
You need some practice like anything else even in heaven. 
01:24:20
And so that I think to me is one of the most fun things I have shown when I was up there. 
01:24:25
I was quite blessed that it was Christopher Reeves though. 
01:24:28
I even went to contact his son to tell him. 
01:24:31
Yeah. 
01:24:32
And but that's what he does. 
01:24:33
That's what he does. 
01:24:34
It's called fly by. 
01:24:35
That's the name of it because God names everything. 
01:24:39
Every place in heaven has its own name. 
01:24:42
That's very cool. 
01:24:43
I like that. 
01:24:44
And so by the way, you mentioned Adam and Eve in heaven. 
01:24:48
Yeah. 
01:24:49
Is there anything that you've seen them do or they do they hang around together because 
01:24:55
they were husband and wife and and now they're not but they're best friends. 
01:24:59
They hang around together and everybody wants to meet them because they're Adam and Eve. 
01:25:03
Right. 
01:25:04
People go well there's no stars there. 
01:25:06
We're all stars. 
01:25:07
God said so. 
01:25:08
Okay. 
01:25:09
We're all stars in his hand. 
01:25:10
That's what we are. 
01:25:11
We all have light and everybody has their own specific thing. 
01:25:14
They were chosen by God and they did a really good job with it. 
01:25:18
I mean, even though they fell, you know, from where they were supposed to be with him. 
01:25:22
They still talked to not just their sons, but they taught a lot of the other people 
01:25:26
there about God himself. 
01:25:28
They talked about it a lot about him and how much they loved him and then what happened 
01:25:31
with them in the garden and everything. 
01:25:33
So people want to meet him because they actually are Adam and Eve and don't be too quick to 
01:25:38
judge. 
01:25:39
Okay. 
01:25:40
We all had something we went through somewhere in our life and and made it better, but they're 
01:25:45
very happy. 
01:25:46
They're very happy there to know God and to be there with him. 
01:25:51
They love him very much. 
01:25:53
And so people do want to meet them and talk to them about what happened. 
01:25:57
I do think in back to the father thinking of the laughter and we're talking about all 
01:26:01
of this stuff. 
01:26:02
One of the greatest revelations to me in this last few years that I've known you is that 
01:26:07
God loves to have fun and likes to laugh as a real dad to his kids. 
01:26:14
I mean, he's a judge too, but he's a dad, you know, and he's got dad like qualities 
01:26:19
that sounds like and he, he likes to laugh and do fun things with his kids. 
01:26:24
He does. 
01:26:25
And you know, my father was the greatest example to me as the father and my dad also knew the 
01:26:31
father and the son and Holy Spirit. 
01:26:34
I learned a lot from him personally because he has such a humble spirit and he loved everybody. 
01:26:39
He literally did love his enemies and you talk about the father all the time, but he 
01:26:44
had talked to the father. 
01:26:45
This is what the father had said to him about things and not, not, not like seeing him like 
01:26:49
I see him that way, but hear him very clearly. 
01:26:52
And I can tell you that he is your heavenly father. 
01:26:56
He is your real true father. 
01:26:58
It says that he is our father and we are his offspring in the Bible. 
01:27:02
It says that he carried us inside of him and then he timed your birth on the earth so he 
01:27:07
could send you and how did he send you? 
01:27:09
He sent you through the spirit because you know what, man can't make a spirit. 
01:27:13
They can't make a spirit or soul at the time of conception, whether it's the Holy Spirit 
01:27:18
or Holy Spirit, of course, whoever brings you brought you down at one time at the time 
01:27:23
of conception, brought you down in their hand, your little spiritual being and knit that together 
01:27:29
in the mother's womb at the time of conception, this would be together yet to touch your spirit 
01:27:35
to that. 
01:27:36
So that actually would be a real living human being. 
01:27:38
And so that's how he did that and he loved you and had been with you all that time. 
01:27:43
And he would dance with you inside of himself because he's God and he can do it. 
01:27:48
He'd sing over you. 
01:27:49
The Bible says that he'd show you some things to come. 
01:27:53
He wrote something on the on the will of your will, on your will, on the wall of your will 
01:27:58
when he put it inside of you. 
01:28:00
And he loved very much this moment right now and all fathers can forgive. 
01:28:06
They can train you. 
01:28:07
They can advise you. 
01:28:09
They can love you. 
01:28:10
They can play with you. 
01:28:11
He does all of that. 
01:28:13
I love it. 
01:28:16
I love it. 
01:28:17
I love it. 
01:28:18
I love it. 
01:28:19
Karen, do you feel like just praying for the people real quick and as we close out just 
01:28:23
whatever you feel? 
01:28:24
Father, I thank you for this day today, God, that you have made and we will rejoice in it 
01:28:29
because we trust you. 
01:28:30
We know that you have your hand on all of this. 
01:28:34
You know everything that ever was is or will be and you know the perfect time to do something 
01:28:39
in this earth. 
01:28:40
You are not done yet with any of us. 
01:28:43
You still have great plans, great inventions, great revelations and great miraculous things 
01:28:49
to happen and I am excited. 
01:28:51
So thank you, Father, for drawing them all closer to you, open their hearing. 
01:28:56
Give them clarity that they can hear you. 
01:28:58
They can hear Jesus. 
01:28:59
They can hear Holy Spirit, Father, because you love us. 
01:29:02
You all love us. 
01:29:03
And I thank you for sending us here to this earth that we can be a light, you're a blinding 
01:29:08
light, but we're a light also in this darkness and I thank you for increasing that, increasing 
01:29:13
the sudden leaves, the help, the protection, the joy, the celebration right now that's 
01:29:20
in heaven is coming to this earth. 
01:29:22
Be a habitation of heaven to this earth is what we're looking for. 
01:29:26
The evil will be crushed down, pushed back for generations to come and we who are on 
01:29:32
the earth now that you have purpose will do these great things for you and with you and 
01:29:38
because of you. 
01:29:39
In Jesus name, amen. 
01:29:40
Amen. 
01:29:41
Amen. 
01:29:42
Amen. 
01:29:43
Now Kat, at revealingheaven.com below, I know that people can get their products there. 
01:29:47
I don't do demons. 
01:29:48
I, they give the cups and the different things. 
01:29:51
And then talk about Kat Kerr. 
01:29:53
What Kat Kerr.com, what can they get there? 
01:29:56
Oh, that is a spiritual platform that Father says whatever he wants to do. 
01:30:00
Right there. 
01:30:01
There's a gallery in it that shows you a lot of places in heaven, things in the spirit, 
01:30:05
what they look like. 
01:30:06
There's testimonies, I think, in there. 
01:30:08
There's interviews there. 
01:30:09
There's a lot of revelation that teaches you how to do things like pray for your family, 
01:30:13
loosens from your soul. 
01:30:15
It's a very powerful site. 
01:30:17
It's also the only site in the world that I have that you can give to me online if you 
01:30:23
want to. 
01:30:24
And I appreciate that very much and may God bless you totally, give you sudden leaves, 
01:30:30
hold you in his hand, that you feel his presence awake and while you sleep and may the host 
01:30:37
go with you. 
01:30:38
We can't, we love you, love your staff and everything and we'll, we will see you again 
01:30:44
very, very soon. 
01:30:45

01:31:00
Yep. 
01:31:01
He's like his third time back, he's either third or fourth time when he's won this thing. 
01:31:08
So interesting. 
01:31:09
He was going to come back, God said he was going to put him back. 
01:31:11
So I expected that to happen. 
01:31:13
Just like I do. 
01:31:14

01:14
hey well good morning it is Wednesday November 9 
01:19
day after the election we have a busy day planned for you in fact a busy week 
01:23
rest of the week so let me just kind of tell you what's being lined up so you know 
01:28
what to plan for so as you know in a few moments we will have cat Kerr here 
01:32
which by the way cat is knowing that we are going to talk about some things before the show 
01:37
before we bring her on where we give thoughts opinions 
01:41
little pieces of snippets of revelation she always 
01:45
chooses to go in the next room and shut off the sound or put music on or whatever 
01:50
which is very integrity based thing to do so she will not be 
01:54
she will not be listening while we're doing this 
01:58
briefing so when we bring her on and ask her what her thoughts are she's not going to say well about what you said or 
02:02
you know she's not going to because she's not going to know what we said right now so 
02:06
it's really good okay so cat will be on today in a few minutes 
02:10
this afternoon we're putting a special show together with Johnny Endo a new 
02:14
an extra Johnny Endo unfiltered he's got some good things in revelation 
02:18
and counsel and wisdom to give to us 
02:22
so that's two shows today one and two this one right now and the one at 2pm pacific 
02:26
2pm pacific right am I saying that right 
02:30
yeah which is 5pm eastern sorry about that then Thursday 
02:34
tomorrow is Hank Kuhneman we haven't had him on for a long time 
02:38
he's a high level prophet and I'm really looking forward to what he would have for us today 
02:42
especially as it relates to the election and then Friday Cash Patel if he could 
02:46
believe he's a close personal friend and confidant part of 
02:50
true social he's been some people call him 
02:54
he's like he would be similar to 
02:58
the chief of staff when he was at the White House only he's kind of 
03:02
like the chief of staff for President Trump now 
03:06
in these days and then Monday after that is 
03:10
Johnny Endo unfiltered again so we're putting some really good stuff together to 
03:14
you for you to keep you encouraged and built up and 
03:18
educated and both knowledge and in revelation so we hope 
03:22
you're going to really enjoy that I know we're going to enjoy bringing it to you 
03:26
very much we need him we need to call for prayers for him this is actually 
03:30
two day old information it might even be 
03:34
three days because I think it might have been on the sixth that he went into the hospital with 
03:38
COVID and now this is on his own 
03:42
Facebook website so you can go to the Canadian Hammer on Facebook and read more about 
03:46
Barry Wynch but he by his own public admission 
03:50
refused the remdesivir that he refused to take 
03:54
that or have that given to him at the hospital and they showed him the door and I'm glad they did 
03:58
because it has a very very unhealthy 
04:02
history and in my opinion any doctors this is 
04:06
my opinion and no one else's some doctors are going to be 
04:10
reliable because they know that it's killing patients that's my opinion 
04:14
I'm saying it for Canada or any nation any hospital if you're giving remdesivir 
04:18
it's going to be proven to be a killer drug I'm allowed to give my opinion 
04:22
there's no someone can say we're practicing medicine I'm not I'm giving you my opinion 
04:26
it's a killer because doctors are reporting those things and researchers are 
04:30
so there you have it you heard it here but please keep Barry in prayer 
04:34
he was starting to recover just a little bit on the seventh 
04:38
so I think he'll probably we know God's with him but he needs some prayer 
04:42
alright we're going to go ahead and run a couple of quick things 
04:46
we're going to run the freshwater well so you'll see reminder how 
04:50
badly we need that support keep those wells going in every three days now we're putting in a new 
04:54
freshwater well so here we go 
05:24
so 
05:54
so 
06:24

06:30

07:20
I think I reversed the order of this let's do American Wars let's do that because 
07:24
I'm going to mess up the order I need to kill Emily so let's 
07:28
let me let me read the comment I've got stacks of 
07:32
notes and I'm trying to get it all in the right order okay today's American 
07:36
Warriors Richard Harley shares his early career 
07:40
serving in Korea then in 1952 when the nuclear 
07:44
arms race was in full swing he and his crew witnessed the terrifying 
07:48
destructive power of new and powerful nuclear weapons 
07:52
as the nuclear threat seems to be reemerging today 
07:56
Richard gives his first-hand account of the devastating power he witnessed 
08:00
in less than a minute 
08:04
you will see the most powerful explosion ever 
08:08
witnessed by human eyes 
08:12
we were supposed to be 34 miles from ground zero 
08:16
well it turned out we were less than 25 
08:20
we were that close to this thing 
08:24
and there was a 12 second interval from the time 
08:28
of detonation before you could look away 
08:32
in seconds it went from ground zero to 20,000 feet 
08:36
the crater that was put in the 
08:40
ocean was three miles 
08:44
by the time detonation came 
08:48
everybody was saying well this might be it 
09:00
wow well I do hope you'll watch that 
09:02
that premieres today on both the rumble and here's the channels if you have that 
09:06
Emily you may not have it uh we don't yeah there you go 
09:10
and rumble it's American Warriors 22 and on the YouTube it's American Warriors 
09:14
22 the same thing but either of those places you can watch 
09:18
American Warriors hopefully you'll enjoy that we put a lot of work into putting these together to honor 
09:22
our servicemen and women so alright this morning I got up 
09:26
and was talking to the Lord about what was going on with the elections and all that 
09:30
and I just said what do you have to say what do you want to say and 
09:34
these words came flooding into me in a very very clear way 
09:38
not just give thanks to the Lord but the part that says oh give thanks to the Lord 
09:42
and so I looked that up in Psalms 136 and it says 
09:46
give thanks to the Lord for he is good and his mercy 
09:50
endures forever I'm going to have you Emily I had asked you to 
09:54
pull up a few scriptures where he talked it says by the way in this passage 
09:58
for his mercy endures forever 26 times in this 
10:02
section it says over and over and over his mercy endures forever 
10:06
26 times if I counted correctly and pull up the next 
10:10
scriptures it talks about where he takes kings down let's see what else you have for us Emily 
10:14
I don't know if you've got those ready for me or not 
10:18
oh there also yeah go back to that one 
10:22
sorry about that those are so seamless 
10:26
that I didn't see them probably to him who struck Egypt in their firstborn 
10:30
in their firstborn for his mercy endures forever what's next 
10:34
but over through Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea 
10:38
for his mercy endures forever 
10:42
to him who struck down great kings for his mercy endures forever 
10:46
this is what the Lord told me to read today and I don't remember which is 
10:50
and slew famous kings for his mercy endures forever 
10:54
and rescued us from our enemies for his mercy endures forever 
10:58
so thank you so much for that Emily I appreciate it 
11:02
one day I'm going to bring Emily on here and introduce you but we won't take the time today 
11:06
that was very very meaningful to me for to me today and for 
11:10
you because this is what God's saying at this hour 
11:14
some things some good news some not as good news 
11:18
and so some people are a little bit nervous about what's going on and we're going to talk about that 
11:22
today but let's pray and medic put something on his website 
11:26
and I asked him to pull that up for us so let's see if that's the next thing 
11:30
here's what he says if you're feeling angry it's understandable it's hard 
11:34
watching another election be stolen now I don't know that the whole election 
11:38
stolen but a lot of it is still stolen because things that we've seen but 
11:42
so he said consider this 
11:46
yesterday there was a red wave yesterday there 
11:50
was a red wave Patriots did their part and voted in 
11:54
historic numbers even some Democrats voted for conservatives 
11:58
we all knew there would be cheating but this time people were 
12:02
watching and recording it all so that's very very good news 
12:06
so now here's a word by a prophetic voice that I trust very 
12:10
Heidi and many of you would know I'm going to say it's a she but 
12:14
you know like we use the name male K for one of our guests 
12:18
we use praying medic often the way you just saw that and she's going by 
12:22
firehawk because firehawks 
12:26
literally spread fires so we're going to cover up her name for now 
12:30
in a few months I'll be able to tell you who she is and why we 
12:34
needed to keep her name out of it for now but I trust this word of the Lord 
12:38
so let me just read that from firehawk so he's calling it the great 
12:42
comeback this morning as I was in prayer bringing the elections before the 
12:46
Lord I heard the Lord say you never expected this I really didn't 
12:50
understand what the Lord meant until I started to read the word and my eyes landed on 
12:54
this verse then Jacob said to Joseph I never 
12:58
expected to see your face again and now God has allowed me to see 
13:02
your descendants as well Genesis 4811 
13:06
Jacob thought his son Joseph had died long ago and his days were over 
13:10
he did not expect to ever see him again but now through God's 
13:14
sovereign power Jacob was allowed to see Joseph and his children and be 
13:18
with them for all the years to come for years to come so I heard the Lord 
13:22
say many of my people are not expecting to see what's about to happen 
13:26
Jacob never expected to see Joseph again but he didn't only see Joseph 
13:30
he also saw his children many are 
13:34
not expecting to see the face of Trump again but God says get ready 
13:38
for you will not only see his face but also the face of his children 
13:42
and of those who are behind him do not fear or be shaken for I am 
13:46
working in the background to cover America with my blood 
13:50
so I heard the voice of evangelist Reinhard Bonke when he used 
13:54
to declare words concerning a blood washed Africa this time 
13:58
the voice of the Lord declared the coming blood washed America 
14:02
get ready for a great comeback many are to see 
14:06
but I am at work the reality is that I have ordered victory 
14:10
and that's brought to us by firehawk so that's awesome 
14:14
I want to show you this a word that had come in 2019 
14:18
that was the day of prophet Charlie Shemp 
14:22
I don't think we got the actual transcription but pull that report 
14:26
that's the report based on that word 
14:30
she didn't fail and she wasn't fired but she will be the next 
14:34
Arkansas governor and you see the date up there that's not 
14:38
yesterday or a couple of months ago that was three years ago in 2019 
14:42
three and a half years ago almost prophet Charlie Shemp said 
14:46
and let you be encouraged by that then we got one other clip 
14:50
by Greg Phillips who was on our show again the other day just got out of jail 
14:54
and here's what he's saying this was well it was 22 minutes ago 
14:58
a short time ago so I don't know exactly how old this is at the second but 
15:02
he says now that we have some clarity around the manning numbers in Arizona we are growing 
15:06
increasingly optimistic about the remaining races few scenarios 
15:10
exist where Kerry doesn't win by substantial margin 
15:14
by 5000 votes and that's Kerry Lake reported by 
15:18
Greg Phillips of course he's a he's a statistician with regarding 
15:22
votes so things are looking really good so alright I think we got 
15:26
all the pieces I think I did all my part and now Kat has 
15:30
been kept out of the room which is good and now they just told me that they brought her 
15:34
in so let's go to Steve and Kat on Wednesday here we go. 
15:54
Good morning Kat. Good morning. 
15:58
Good to see you. Smiles and all now I we've kept you out of the room 
16:02
or you've kept yourself out of the room so we're not going to talk about anything we have talked about 
16:06
this is like we're going to put a fence around this and this you and I are just going to talk about 
16:10
whatever you have to give so let me just start by asking did you get I would 
16:14
normally tell a person that's interested in this did you get my sleep last night but you don't 
16:18
sleep during the night right not really I sleep in the 
16:22
daytime yeah so overnight literally you're up 
16:26
all night right the entire night I am up I go to bed at 7am 
16:30
that answers your questions 7am before the sun comes up 
16:34
Wow that's me so 
16:38
now you and I have not talked about I have no idea what you're going to say or report 
16:42
I don't know what you know in the natural either so I'm going to turn it over to you Kat and see what you got 
16:46
well first of all I'd like to remind the people 
16:50
that God is God and there's no one above him 
16:54
and no matter what you see with your eyes or hear with your ears 
16:58
or are told to somebody's mouth what is actually happening 
17:02
or what is going to happen if it's bad that is not what God is saying 
17:06
you have to understand I know you I know he's mysterious 
17:10
I know he's powerful I know he holds the air I breathe 
17:14
in your air if you're a bullet well he holds everybody there just so you know that 
17:18
you came from him there was no other place for you to come from 
17:22
I'm not going to go into that any more detail than that you have to understand 
17:26
he had plans for you while you were in him 
17:30
and at one point in your life made that known to you 
17:34
well a lot of the wicked decided they didn't want nothing to do with him 
17:38
so they went into the darkness 
17:42
and those who are in the darkness now are still in the darkness you need to understand that 
17:46
you have to know the evil doesn't change 
17:50
but neither does God you can't just point to evil and say it's gotten 
17:54
darker it's gotten worse you know it's going to take all over us 
17:58
and yet you know what God has said already no justice is coming 
18:02
in the greatest detail and amount ever before 
18:06
on the earth now that is very significant more justice 
18:10
will be given than at any other time on the face of the search 
18:14
you're living on right now that's where justice will happen 
18:18
and the father is a very detailed person in every way 
18:22
he already got his list made he already knows who's done what people 
18:26
no one's hidden anything from him but he has his plans because 
18:30
these days you're breathing in right now 
18:34
are the forerunner to what is about to overwhelm this entire 
18:38
earth and what is about to overwhelm the earth does not 
18:42
include evil this is from him right now from this throne 
18:46
it does not include evil people so what does that mean it's going to happen 
18:50
this is from the throne what he's about to do on this 
18:54
earth for generations to come does not include the 
18:58
evil that means it will be removed it will be dealt with justice will be given 
19:02
many people will be gone from the earth completely they won't be here anymore 
19:06
let me take a drink please yeah well and when you say evil but 
19:10
let me just ask a question that to clarify as you go 
19:14
like I don't you talk we're talking about coming into the kingdom age and I'm thinking okay so there's 
19:18
a few bright spots on the earth and dark or is it mainly light on the 
19:22
earth with a few dark what do you mean it will be gone or 
19:26
all the present evil that is operating 
19:30
in hidden places trying to control the 
19:34
world I hope that clarifies it like that you like the globalist the elite 
19:38
all of those one world is that I'm just going to say it 
19:42
people whoever's been cheating stealing lying 
19:46
deceiving I'll just make a list for you 
19:50
those who wanted to bring fear want control 
19:54
it's the only thing they know hell only knows 
19:58
control the only language they speak is profanity 
20:02
the only plan they have is to kill steal and destroy that's their plan 
20:06
it has always been hell's plan so whatever you do don't 
20:10
yourself go into a hole with hell and hell's thinking 
20:14
serious you need to be rejoicing right now 
20:18
if you believe what God has said okay God doesn't go by numbers 
20:22
he doesn't go by man's plans he doesn't go by hell's operations 
20:26
he doesn't go by their activities he doesn't go by any of that 
20:30
he's on his throne knowing knowing knowing 
20:34
knowing what is about to happen and what you saw yesterday 
20:38
was not it see that last sentence again 
20:42
we saw yesterday which I talked to nobody about what you saw happen 
20:46
yesterday is not it's not 
20:50
it's not that it is not his final plan to fix 
20:54
everything and actually I've been telling you for two weeks 
20:58
don't look at elections to change everything 
21:02
yeah and I was serious when I said that that was God 
21:06
saying that don't look at the elections to change everything 
21:10
something is going to happen some way some things will happen 
21:14
there's always going to be spots of sunshine and joy in the mess 
21:18
in the midst of the mess that the Holy Spirit said 
21:22
a mess that they're about to get cleaned up that's what I have to say 
21:26
but I can tell you right now there is no one on this earth 
21:30
in this earth over this earth that can say 
21:34
against what God wants no one or nothing 
21:38
and stop him from what he is about to do with the glory 
21:42
being sent into the earth baptism in fire which is 
21:46
going to be happening us the manifested sons and daughters 
21:50
speaking to the land the sea and the air and it obeying 
21:54
because it has been in travail for us to stand up and start doing it 
21:58
you can't do any kind of a great 
22:02
campaign this is called a campaign not like a political campaign 
22:06
like a military campaign 
22:10
there's been out and about a lot of patrons use this 
22:14
repeated phrase over and over for a couple years now they'll say nothing can stop what's coming 
22:18
when you say nothing can stop what's coming 
22:22
that may have something to do with the election but you're saying it from the standpoint of God 
22:26
or I'm going to ask the question are you saying nothing 
22:30
can stop what God's going to do now 
22:34
stop God from doing what he is going to do next 
22:38
so you had that perfectly clear yes he uses 
22:42
mankind I know that he has put people in place 
22:46
some of them and the ones who are operating and where he put them 
22:50
to do what he asked them to do those of course are always a part of what 
22:54
he does but as far as the overall thing it's not going to stop 
22:58
what God wants these are God's days of glory 
23:02
they are not Satan's days of let's take over the earth 
23:06
I hope that clarifies that to you these are not 
23:10
from the throne these are not the perilous times 
23:14
these are not the tribulation these are not the end 
23:18
what he is going to end is what you 
23:22
have been living in for the last couple years 
23:26
and it will end completely 
23:30
I saw a word today Kat 
23:34
again it's not a prophet per se or anything but there was 
23:38
someone that wrote what he thought had gone wrong 
23:42
which I didn't say openly but there are a lot of people 
23:46
that say that we are yet to have both the house 
23:50
of representatives it looks like we still got it and maybe 50-50 on the 
23:54
Senate but what was I going to 
23:58
ask is why do I want to ask this 
24:02
I'll pull it back when it comes to me but maybe I wasn't 
24:06
supposed to ask it anyway but go ahead 
24:10
if I pull it back I'll ask you again 
24:14
I'm not saying that they won't help change some things 
24:18
because we have great people standing in positions right now 
24:22
that people have clearly shown and I didn't have to ask 
24:26
anybody clearly shown we don't want what they have been 
24:30
addition to us we don't want it 
24:34
true American people do not want what they are trying to shove on us 
24:38
and they are fed up with it and I will tell you this 
24:42
when I went to vote yesterday the line was out the door 
24:46
and stayed out the door the whole time I was there 
24:50
out the door and down the corner of the street 
24:54
and every one of those people were saying these words 
24:58
as I walked past them some knew me some did not know me and they said 
25:02
I'm here so my child can have a future and I'm here 
25:06
someone else said I'm here so my children and my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren will have a future 
25:10
these were even young people saying this and some of them had their babies 
25:14
with them they said I will not let my baby 
25:18
grow up in this world the way it is now so I'm here to vote to make it change 
25:22
that was very clearly what they were saying they were all voting 
25:26
for justice to be given 
25:30
I think what I was going to ask is in 2020 of course everybody in the prophetic the one question is how long 
25:34
even David cried out how long 
25:38
we have gone for two years fighting for the 2020 and now 2022 is just happening 
25:42
and I think some people are like nail biters are going are we going to 
25:46
have to fight for this for two more years do you have any sense 
25:50
that I know God may not give you timing on this but what 
25:54
thoughts do you have I do know this and people 
25:58
may not like me saying it but you all need to understand 
26:02
that number 45 does not have to run to get 
26:06
his seat back right that is correct 
26:10
well that is what God is saying okay 
26:14
he does not have to run to get his seat back 
26:18
it is a big answer for everyone listen very clearly because that is a very big 
26:22
answer right there it is a big answer 
26:26
nobody has to run to get what was theirs all along 
26:30
and there is no way they can keep that whole thing from 2020 from being revealed 
26:34
that is very clearly will be revealed 
26:38
and not just from the people of the right or whatever you want to call us 
26:42
whatever you want to call us the ones who want justice, liberty and freedom 
26:46
of America, patriots, Christians, patriots 
26:50
because I can tell you right now the other side is going to know it all they are going to know it 
26:54
they are going to know what they just did they are going to know it 
26:58
it will have to be announced from that side 
27:02
that is pretty good because that side 
27:06
which we call the left won't announce anything that will make them look better 
27:10
what you are saying is they are going to have no choice 
27:14
this is from the throne and I am not just saying it from me 
27:18
I am a mouthpiece and no one can stop that from being said 
27:22
or known either people are still saying it everywhere but it is not the point the matters is this 
27:26
it will have to be announced 
27:30
from those who have been hiding, lying and stealing all along 
27:34
they the new 
27:38
the new will have to publicly announce who won the 2020 elections 
27:42
and who really belongs in that seat 
27:46
the father who promised that will happen 
27:50
he has promised he has never stopped saying it to me 
27:54
since November 4th 2020 this is what they will do 
27:58
and they won't want to do it but they will have to do it 
28:02
I hope that gives you some joy today 
28:06
I want to make sure you give us anything else you have but I have questions 
28:10
I left it on the printer over there 
28:14
Emily can put you on full screen 
28:18
I will get that off the printer 
28:22
I want everyone to know out there 
28:26
I have faced everything you have 
28:30
even though I am heaven's revelator 
28:34
I do go there all the time 
28:38
I believe there is a God on that throne 
28:42
who carried you inside of himself, made plans, wrote it in a book 
28:46
all the things he had planned for you, everyone out there 
28:50
you made a choice somewhere in your life especially the wicked and that side over there 
28:54
they made a choice in their life to pretend there wasn't a God 
28:58
because deep inside every human being knows 
29:02
there is, he put it in them 
29:06
they are still saying they don't believe it 
29:10
trust me they are going to be believing it soon 
29:14
who are they facing when they die 
29:18
I would like to add that but my children 
29:22
are being taught to prepare for what God is preparing 
29:26
they are not ignorant to all this they are innocent of any of the garbage in the junk 
29:30
they don't hold anything in their soul that brings torment or sorrow or fear 
29:34
they don't keep any of that in their soul 
29:38
the devil gets that for free 
29:42
fear is one of the greatest things he operates in and most of the time it is unfounded 
29:46
I know this thing is going on and things you don't like and things have changed drastically 
29:50
in the last couple of years you know what changing them will be God's greatest pleasure 
29:54
but my kids and my grandkids who are still young 
29:58
are preparing for this great thing of God 
30:02
knowing all the other stuff around them but they know God 
30:06
they believe him they believe his word 
30:10
the most powerful thing you can say if you can't even say anything out 
30:14
say what his word says about him 
30:18
that terrifies demons it shakes hell itself 
30:22
it causes earthquakes in hell when you start talking about the most high God who you serve and you will not serve another 
30:26
that line right there is hated all over in hell 
30:30
this world by the wicked they don't want you saying those words 
30:34
it releases something in the atmosphere but my kids and my grandkids 
30:38
are doing that right now they are making plans for their 
30:42
futures with God on this earth 
30:46
they know what he is going to be doing they are excited about that they do not agree with the evil 
30:50
they will not partner with the evil they will not tolerate evil in them 
30:54
and even though you can't go take something physically away from somebody 
30:58
what you are saying in the spirit around matters very much 
31:02
even to your own soul 
31:06
so start preparing for what God is saying is coming 
31:10
this is an accelerated time so things are about to be accelerated I will just say that 
31:14
and Kat you talked about 
31:18
you don't live in fear at all but also what you are just saying 
31:22
one of the scriptures behind that is life and death is in the power of the tongue 
31:26
I mean you are saying no matter how disconcerting 
31:30
things might look to you at any day 
31:34
or even problems in your own family you are saying don't put voice 
31:38
to it kind of or how would you describe because some people say 
31:42
like some people will actually maybe even need to see a pastor or Christian counselor 
31:46
they do need to share their feelings how would you describe maybe that would be 
31:50
a good opening question for today is we get it that life and death is in the power 
31:54
of the tongue but how do you live a real life without having to sometimes 
31:58
spill your guts or something I mean I don't know I've never heard you 
32:02
spill your guts 
32:06
okay when the first time it comes 
32:10
whether something I say to my face or you know 
32:14
it's out there while you are out there somewhere I don't watch 
32:18
regular news at all I watch the other places if I want to watch something 
32:22
but only if God tells me to it's not like I'm telling you 
32:26
not to listen to nothing I'm not that ignorant okay you got to know some things 
32:30
that are going on in your area especially things like that but make sure if they 
32:34
say something against what God has said I don't want to say these words I know 
32:38
if I those words oh really you'll just say that to the person 
32:42
I know if I those words I say what God said I will say what God has said 
32:46
this is all going to change these are days of greater 
32:50
glory these are days of baptism in fire this is the time for us to manifest 
32:54
his power and presence all over the earth I say that 
32:58
it literally will wipe out anything that was in my soul 
33:02
that might bring fear your soul with your mind what you think 
33:06
your will what you choose and your emotions is what you display 
33:10
so if you're being afraid make sure you say I choose to kick out 
33:14
and lose from my soul all fear all fearful statements 
33:18
negative things all harmful things are crushing 
33:22
demeaning things I lose them from my soul all the things that are lies 
33:26
I will not take that in my soul I will take God's words in my soul 
33:30
your soul will think differently you will feel differently 
33:34
therefore I feel differently 
33:38
I'm not keeping any of the world's lies and stuff that they want to do or even their 
33:42
plans I don't keep it in me 
33:46
I mean think in his heart or soul so is he there's your answer 
33:50
so what are you thinking about thinking about what God has said 
33:54
what God's plans are are you thinking about all the lies that have been spilled out over there 
33:58
that's good you know we're on a good roll right now before I get to the next 
34:02
question someone wrote to me about this and I wrote to them 
34:06
what I felt was a correct answer 
34:10
and they said Steve I didn't know the person they said am I correct 
34:14
are you understanding that Kat says she doesn't sin 
34:18
and you know you know the question you know it's been thrown at you a different time 
34:22
paraphrasing what I said is I said I dear 
34:26
whatever his name is you are largely correct Kat does not choose to 
34:30
sin and then I went on to describe it 
34:34
but then there was another part where I said however 
34:38
Kat does say that there's a type of judgment in the future 
34:42
that will be accountable for all words that were 
34:46
what was that scripture where you were accountable for 
34:50
wasteful words and I said so Kat is saying that is not a sin 
34:54
even though you will have to account for it how does that not a sin 
34:58
because I've always thought man that's what's a wasteful word Kat 
35:02
wasteful word is something that's not needed anywhere 
35:06
like I heard your aunt went out and ran around with somebody 
35:10
okay so it's an accusation 
35:14
there was no proof that had nothing to do how did that empower anybody 
35:18
like I hear there's going to be a big takeover 
35:22
and they're waiting to come to bring the guns and take us all the way to Jerusalem 
35:26
that's definitely wasteful okay because all you have done 
35:30
what did you plant in the soul of that person you were speaking to 
35:34
whatever cannot be used which is either ridiculous stuff 
35:38
unfounded stuff that is wasteful to God 
35:42
because when we speak it says always be ready to have an answer 
35:46
for the answer you think he means but Kat if I 
35:50
did that and I said well you know I heard you running and that was 
35:54
wasteful if the spirit convicted me on it wouldn't I say 
35:58
Lord forgive me for that I would say that as if I had just sinned wouldn't I 
36:02
you can always ask for forgiveness even if you do something 
36:06
it's not the right or the best thing to do 
36:08
I'm sorry I said that 
36:10
I think I was raised with the thought that every single thing I did 
36:14
that was not of faith is sin where there is a scripture that says 
36:18
that I don't want to pick on any words but 
36:22
it's believing in faith for something 
36:26
and when you say just the opposite of what you were believing for that would be different 
36:30
just saying things that are like dumb crazy things that don't really mean anything to anybody 
36:34
those things are wasteful 
36:38
but wasteful and I'll tell you why 
36:42
you'll give an account for every wasteful word you're spoken in that's in heaven 
36:46
you wouldn't be in heaven if you had sin you don't go to heaven with sin people 
36:50
so you're not going to the judgment seat of Christ is not about sins 
36:54
you committed mean account for every wasteful word you spoke that is not 
36:58
that's not sins you wouldn't be in heaven okay so those are other 
37:02
things that you know you could probably do more for God or greater for God or 
37:06
be greater and you chose instead to be not 
37:10
wise 
37:14
so that might hurt somebody it might cause them to be afraid it might cause them to be sorrowful 
37:18
those would be wasteful things but sin is very 
37:22
direct sin is when you are unrighteous 
37:26
okay when you have stepped out of being righteous into unrighteous 
37:30
that is sin 
37:34
we need to live right to sleep because we represent him correct 
37:38
sin you go let's just say okay you just go sleep around 
37:42
you do things that are wrong you murder people 
37:46
profanity is not a good thing that's more than 
37:50
wasteful words profanity is what hell speaks 
37:54
you don't want to be speaking what hell saying so please let go of the profanity people 
37:58
you're not impressing anybody in heaven you're probably not impressing any of 
38:02
your friends around you maybe some demons you might impress them but 
38:06
profanity is literally what they speak in hell that's their language 
38:10
that didn't come from heaven at all it was not something 
38:14
God speaks against profanity and pro being profane 
38:18
living sin free should be very clear what sin is 
38:22
something that takes you out of the hand of God and you on purpose put yourself 
38:26
in the hand of Satan and if you if you said wasteful words 
38:30
to re hit that point again it probably is 
38:34
a good idea probably cathartic or whatever to say the Lord 
38:38
I think this is what cat talked about that those were wasteful words 
38:42
kind of I ask you to forgive me that's that's okay right 
38:46
even though he may not have he might not have always 
38:50
to say please forgive me I shouldn't have done that it's always good to do that 
38:54
right sometimes I'll say maybe I said something every now and then 
38:58
I'll say just say something yeah yeah every now and then 
39:02
if I get upset I'll say something though you know I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that father don't write it down 
39:06
good no I'm not clear about it 
39:10
I'm not clear about it you said don't even write it now it's not profanity or 
39:14
anything yeah something that wouldn't be in me to do or say 
39:18
I have a feeling that's why some people have had I don't get a 
39:22
bunch of letters about this but this guy did it's not real common to be challenged 
39:26
on this with you but that's probably why some people say 
39:30
well of course everybody makes mistakes 
39:34
a wasteful word is a mistake at least and so 
39:38
they're thinking that you're saying I've never made a mistake or I don't make mistakes 
39:42
that's not what you're saying well no I don't make most mistakes that other people make 
39:46
my whole life I walk in the spirit 
39:50
the reason I walk in the spirit is because I will not 
39:54
fulfill the desires of your flesh and your flesh is the one that wants to 
39:58
strike out and say I don't strike out on purpose to hurt people 
40:02
it would be even something you wouldn't even think there was 
40:06
nothing wrong with it 
40:10
as a public testimony not that you asked for this but I've known you for it 
40:14
I think it's right at ten years inclusive of the 
40:18
you can ask my mama people she lives with me I've never heard you say 
40:22
one word against anybody in these ten years so 
40:26
as a public testimony not that you just asked for this I've never heard you say 
40:30
one word against anybody you will talk about 
40:34
for instance one time when we were first getting to know each other you said there was a bible that they made 
40:38
and I asked for the name of it that they made and they had taken all the 
40:42
hard verses out and you were speaking against that bible well that's 
40:46
a teaching that's a wise word that wasn't speaking against 
40:50
a person I think anybody that has read the word of God and you notice 
40:54
there's whole chapters being taken up that are in a regular 
40:58
bible I would not keep that bible I have to be honest with you I'm not talking about 
41:02
Old Testament New Testament I'm talking about if you have the Holy Bible 
41:06
that has Old Testament New Testament you go looking and they've taken scriptures 
41:10
out completely possibly the millennial 
41:14
Christ might be one of them they have taken out wow they don't think that's going to 
41:18
happen I'm serious about this so make sure you read your bible well 
41:22
okay because you don't want anything left out that is against 
41:26
God well and if you someone has that I said I had a relative and I named 
41:30
the type of relative and I just said she told me never years ago 
41:34
we don't believe in hell anymore and I'm thinking so you've got a bible that teaches you 
41:38
what to believe and it teaches that but you don't believe in that 
41:42
it doesn't make any sense to me why would you not believe something that's there 
41:46
that's crazy I don't understand why people 
41:50
I know some people's excuses literally people some of the 
41:54
people have written some of the newer versions well people just didn't understand it so 
41:58
this was their answer I thought I would just change it and I would be 
42:02
very careful about what you do you want to by any chance name 
42:06
that I don't know if you remember the name of the bible you told me that I have a little 
42:10
list somewhere yeah yeah I mean I'd actually 
42:14
I have to tell you which ones I read yeah yeah okay 
42:18
there was one and yes people I do still have the king 
42:22
games don't go there yeah the king games bible is one 
42:26
of the few bibles that are not afraid to take up the words unicorn 
42:30
when they really do mention nine 
42:34
times in the bible but there's some bibles you buy now 
42:38
they're called a rhino I don't think the father's happy with that 
42:42
he has a unicorn why not it's him he makes them 
42:46
does have them in heaven and people other people have seen them in heaven 
42:50
but the bible the normal bible mentions at nine 
42:54
times about the father's about the unicorn 
42:58
the strength of his horn the strength of his body it talks about it in the bible 
43:02
and some people that well I don't like that I don't think that's real well let me ask 
43:06
you can we talk about and change it to an ox or a rhino 
43:10
yeah let me ask this as you brought up the unicorn and now I understand about the unicorn 
43:14
but here's where we got tripped up years ago and our oldest daughter's now been married 10 years 
43:18
but when she was she was the oldest of two at the time 
43:22
and she was like five or six and we would have 
43:26
our watch these things I think was called rainbow bright and they had these unicorns 
43:30
but it was all this magic and stuff and she was getting scared 
43:34
and frightened and we if we came around the corner she was 
43:38
cream of blood curving scream because and we realized that we had to tell 
43:42
her to we would not allow her to watch this rainbow bright anymore in the unicorn 
43:46
it wasn't that unicorns don't exist in heaven because they do 
43:50
but they had taken that and made it magic and sorcery 
43:54
and stuff like that what are your thoughts about that 
43:58
this is for the people 
44:02
I have nothing to do with magic people 
44:06
yeah that is look it up it's the dark arts 
44:10
the black arts you know how they were introduced into the earth 
44:14
they were introduced in the earth by the watch angels 
44:18
that fell and created offspring those guys 
44:22
those guys literally introduced 
44:26
because sometimes my natural 
44:30
doesn't work as well as the spirit to one 
44:34
human sacrifice oh human sacrifice okay 
44:38
was all introduced in the service by the by those ones the ones that fell 
44:42
right and they wanted to be worshiped at the end by being worshiped as gods on the earth 
44:46
that's what happened they introduced human sacrifice they introduced the dark 
44:50
arts which is magic 
44:54
and they try to they try to pretty it up and they try to make it look special 
44:58
I don't like that word a true mystic by the way 
45:02
has also been distorted in the ancient 
45:06
passages of the word a true mystic was one who had a face to face 
45:10
encounter with a living god so there's mystical 
45:14
beautiful things in heaven that are shown to you and you get 
45:18
to see and enjoy in heaven there is no magic 
45:22
in heaven none no sorcerer 
45:26
I'm just going to say no witch no sorcerer okay 
45:30
what are the other ones well you know or you're not going to have a magic 
45:34
unicorn you're not going to have a magic unicorn that does 
45:38
I don't know what they did because I'm speaking out of school but I mean I don't know if you did spell 
45:42
they did take a lot of cartoons and they were absolutely defiled 
45:46
yeah yeah 
45:50
do not let pokemon in your home do not 
45:54
the earth behind pokemon is warring warring go and see 
45:58
what those things do that they're called pocket monsters I know what they're called 
46:02
and they they show them each other to war so what they do is bring 
46:06
violent spirits in your home and I had a good eye 
46:10
opener about that I was on a plane somewhere one time and I was traveling and 
46:14
I got put in the back wasn't a big plane and across from me were 
46:18
two children coloring books that were pokemon the father was sitting 
46:22
almost on top of a third child because they were screaming 
46:26
about how much they hated them and how violent they were going to be 
46:30
and the mom was in the back seat doing nothing and I'm 
46:34
like can I lay my hand on that how can I lay my hand on the kids 
46:38
head and cast that devil out of there and God said this is what happens 
46:42
when you allow that spirit in your home and they 
46:46
actually were coloring and coloring books the other kids they were probably like seven eight 
46:50
yellow one was maybe four who was screaming how much he hated 
46:54
his parents that was violent people that God said this spirit of violence is what you're letting in 
46:58
not to do it what about the older crowd 
47:02
that plays an older game densions and dragons same 
47:06
thing we knew people who did that actually I won't tell you what they ended up by doing 
47:10
to their mom to their mom 
47:14
yeah so there's so in other words this is a no no 
47:18
game that is a no game I think the the biggest 
47:22
no game would be a Ouija board okay yeah you do actually 
47:26
not that I want to empower people to want to go and do it and I'm not telling you to go and do it 
47:30
you will actually open portals to hell if you use that form 
47:34
you know my mother who was straight lays all the way about after I was growing and married 
47:38
she admitted to me one day that when she was a little girl she played with Ouija board and I thought 
47:42
are you kidding I think she only did it once but I broke 
47:46
that off of my family line and all that some of you may 
47:50
not that long ago I told like I was like 30 years ago I'm in a toys I was looking for 
47:54
stuff for my kids those little boy 10 years old excuse me sir I'm just walking 
47:58
through the store can you this Ouija board can you tell me is this bad 
48:02
you know and I said yes it's very bad don't get that he's okay thank 
48:06
you sir you know so that was I just got used me to rescue him 
48:10
from you know rescue him yeah so who knows maybe I'll 
48:14
meet him in heaven yeah I'm not saying any of these things because I think I want 
48:18
somebody to fail or something I'm saying I have to speak the truth 
48:22
people yeah and the truth is there is darkness and there is light 
48:26
there's evil and there's God there's only two things there is no 
48:30
third thing out there to choose you cannot become ignorant 
48:34
and say I'm just not going to do any of it because then the enemy will try to target you 
48:38
if you're not you need to be strong in God you need to receive Jesus Christ 
48:42
as your savior number one number one always always 
48:46
receive him as your savior repent of your sins and the Bible says 
48:50
even the Bible says that 
48:54
you know that if you repent of your sins this is Christ 
48:58
he is faithful and just to forgive you of that sin 
49:02
and cleanse you from what all unrighteousness 
49:06
right so if you want to know what sin is it's unrighteous what you do 
49:10
you're righteous you want to be righteous that means you're right with God 
49:14
when you sin you're unrighteous there's no there's no way around 
49:18
that and I know there's churches at Chichi you can sin all you want to because the 
49:22
blood covered it you know it covered it at your time of salvation 
49:26
if you sin after that you have to repent because God's not 
49:30
allowing people to come up there filled with sin 
49:34
your soul goes with you to heaven people your soul does not sleep in your 
49:38
flesh body your body dies it sleeps because 
49:42
he's going to resurrect it one day but your soul and your spirit they're together 
49:46
will go live in heaven if you're righteous and one day 
49:50
the dead in Christ shall rise that's your dead body it'll rise up 
49:54
your spirit and soul will be put back in that thing and you'll be 
49:58
glorified forever you will live in the glory forever 
50:02
that's what that means you'll never sin after that 
50:06
you'll never sin again or nothing but righteous is being 
50:10
right with God when you sin you go to 
50:14
terrible shows that do Satan stuff you go to terrible movies that do 
50:18
Satan stuff those are sins you can't fill yourself with evil 
50:22
and think that's not sin because what it does is it takes away from 
50:26
the God in you the goodness in you and what happens is 
50:30
you're white as wool that means on the inside the blood when it washes you 
50:34
you're white when you go on the sin you get a little bit of darkness in you 
50:38
and there's gray that's exactly what happens 
50:42
the more darkness you get the more it pushes the light out so 
50:46
that's why it's important to not fill yourself with things that 
50:50
are evil or wicked and I have to say Kat that I you know again 
50:54
these 10 years that I've known you and I've pondered this whole thing where you're saying I don't want I don't 
50:58
go around sinning or I don't sin if I look back to my life and all the different 
51:02
seasons especially there were darker seasons where I was being sloppy 
51:06
if I really look at my life pretty much 
51:10
every sin I chose to do 
51:14
I mean every time I really I did something wrong I knew it was wrong right 
51:18
so it's not like we have problems knowing if something is wrong 
51:22
what do you do with the scripture that says 
51:26
little children I pray that you sin now but if you do sin 
51:30
you have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ how does that apply 
51:34
because he says but if we do is that in other words because we 
51:38
are who we are no Kat I think you would admit that 
51:42
most people walking the earth have not reached kind of where you're walking 
51:46
where you don't sin isn't that probably true they haven't gotten to that 
51:50
I think there's people more than people know that are here in the 
51:54
earth because he literally says in the Bible it literally 
51:58
says be holy as unholy it says that 
52:02
and I'm going to show you another place in the word where it is possible to get to a sin free 
52:06
life I mean Jesus didn't do this so he could all the time 
52:10
just be forgiving forgive him he does he does do that 
52:14
but he wants you to get beyond that how do you ever 
52:18
expect to rule and reign which is your right as a believer 
52:22
you should have a crown on your head right now to rule and spirit realm 
52:26
but you can't sin and do that because you can't mix holy 
52:30
and the devil and think the devil if you take authority over the devil 
52:34
do you think it's going to listen to you if you've been playing with them if you've been in this camp playing 
52:38
and over here you're saying well I'm a strong believer and I live by the word 
52:42
and I've received Jesus Christ as my Savior my sins have been washed away 
52:46
that terrifies hell that does it terrifies it 
52:50
but if you start playing in their stuff then they know 
52:54
they can hook you because they have the right to come after you 
52:58
yes to their stuff there's a reason why he says to live righteously 
53:02
but if the word says be holy and see it's holy that means you 
53:06
can get to that place guess what it's a desire of your soul 
53:10
well you're just saying God would never instruct you to do something that you could 
53:14
never do he wouldn't say be holy 
53:18
if it was impossible to be holy why he wouldn't waste his words 
53:22
and I need to show you another scripture why it's important to make 
53:26
sure you've received Christ okay when the rapture does 
53:30
happen it says he's coming for a church 
53:34
that's the body of Christ without spots that is sin 
53:38
without wrinkles that's your flesh trying to take over 
53:42
okay there you go there's somebody who is living 
53:46
holy you're living holy you have no sin your flesh isn't 
53:50
you're just rolling over everything that God has said to you 
53:54
so you can get there or he would not have put that in there 
53:58
that were coming back for those who have no sin 
54:02
and they're walking in the spirit you're not fulfilling 
54:06
every desire your flesh has usually your flesh wants 
54:10
what God does it usually your flesh does 
54:14
so it shows you right there you can get to that place 
54:18
yeah and I mean you would be 
54:22
transparent to say that it's a journey right in other words 
54:26
I first heard about this on his cruise and you're talking on the cruise 
54:30
you didn't expect people to walk off the ship and from that point on I never sinned again 
54:34
you knew they would be on a journey to get to this place 
54:38
is that fair to say yes it is fair to say because when you hear the truth 
54:42
and you're so really your spirit man as a believer 
54:46
your spirit man craves revelation 
54:50
craves revelation that revelation is pure it's holy it comes from the 
54:54
father himself and when he is revealing himself to you 
54:58
if you love Christ you're going to love what he has said 
55:02
and but I can tell you I know for sure that 
55:06
that there are people in the earth on purpose 
55:10
not sinning and this is a thing 
55:14
that I'm passionate about the father being known Jesus being known 
55:18
Holy Spirit being known if I am all the time being taken to that holy 
55:22
amazing beautiful place called heaven why 
55:26
would I want to settle for the role of hell 
55:30
why would I want to do anything for them I don't market them 
55:34
I don't participate and I definitely don't tolerate 
55:38
hell in my life I don't tolerate sin sin 
55:42
why would I want that 
55:46
if I choose this I'm choosing what the devil wants 
55:50
all right Kat are you ready for the first question 
55:54
the first question we've been having fun with this 
55:58
okay Tanya can you tell me more about 
56:02
the song of songs and what it tells us about Yeshua being our bridegroom 
56:06
of course a lot of people don't understand because you said even Jesus would 
56:10
I think you said once dance with people even in the spirit or take you 
56:14
to heaven and dance with you but how can that be 
56:18
when the romance of any kind is not 
56:22
that kind of love is not in heaven romance isn't in heaven right so 
56:26
I think you're looking at a different version of romance people 
56:30
so there's a different romance there's a totally different 
56:34
the spiritual romance is totally different spiritual romance 
56:38
it's not craved the coming together of flesh people 
56:42
that's not the ultimate goal for that 
56:46
that's you being one in the spirit literally 
56:50
literally just so you know that act that husband and wife do 
56:54
that's the only symbolic of Christ in the church why 
56:58
because in heaven you actually as spirits can go inside each other 
57:02
that's not a different kind of an act 
57:06
that's in the Lord or us in our fellow friends in heaven 
57:10
now we're talking about us in the Lord 
57:14
when Jesus said to his father you and me 
57:18
and me and you that's what he's talking about 
57:22
you cannot be any more closer together 
57:26
people than spiritually being together 
57:30
it's not like that act 
57:34
it's not performing that physical act that desire that your 
57:38
flesh has your spirit man desires things entirely 
57:42
different than the flesh does and when you get your flesh back one day 
57:46
it's going to be glorified it won't desire that stuff and I know you think it will 
57:50
for us so we're not going to ever think that 
57:54
because we will be one together we'll be one together we'll be able to step 
57:58
into the Father Jesus step into the Father Holy Spirit step into the Father and we'll be one 
58:02
just like the Trinity we aren't the Trinity I got to make everything clear to people 
58:06
because the crazy ones take it everywhere okay I'm literally 
58:10
talking about a spiritual existence 
58:14
in heaven Christ will step inside of you turn around look out through 
58:18
your eyes and you will you will love everybody 
58:22
I was going to ask you about the loving everybody 
58:26
I've never asked this before but isn't it true I'm assuming that when I get to heaven 
58:30
no matter what someone was like or looked like or had 
58:34
handicapped don't we see all the children as beautiful all the women as beautiful 
58:38
all the men as handsome wouldn't that be a thing that everybody 
58:42
was attractive but not lustfully or sexually or 
58:46
anything like that there's none of that but wouldn't we see 
58:50
all of the above as handsome or beautiful wouldn't that be 
58:54
always true or do you think everybody looks good and you tell people man you 
58:58
look so good okay you would but by the way 
59:02
there are no handicapped people in heaven well I know I'm saying those that had been 
59:06
yeah yeah oh you congratulate them you look great 
59:10
you look amazing look at you you you you're all you you're so 
59:14
everything you say inspires people and it makes them happy but there's 
59:18
no darkness right it's like the movies they have in heaven 
59:22
there's no evil in it they don't have to have our ratings 
59:26
or X ratings in heaven none of that stuff is shown anywhere it's not produced 
59:30
it's not made it's not wanted it's not desired there's none of it there 
59:34
okay you're in heaven this is a holy atmosphere an amazing 
59:38
exciting adventurous powerful atmosphere to live in 
59:42
but everybody wants the best for everybody even if it was somebody 
59:46
that at one time with your enemy under you will still care about them 
59:50
in heaven so there's a oneness that happens where Jesus 
59:54
is inside of you which you described many times and you're inside of the father 
59:58
inside of the G there's a oneness that is a wonderful wonderful wonderful 
01:00:02
wonderful it is the highest level of being one in existence 
01:00:06
wow it's a spiritual joining 
01:00:10
it's a spirit it's not your flesh body very good 
01:00:14
very good all right Esther's asking this cat how do guardian angels 
01:00:18
process the evil they see here on earth and I'm guessing our 
01:00:22
guardian angels that say I'm looking at my younger life and I'm in the middle of 
01:00:26
doing stuff that I know is a sin what's my guardian 
01:00:30
angel doing I'm just adding to her question what are they doing 
01:00:34
shaking his head and say what are you doing stop this 
01:00:38
shaking his head he may be saying something to you and you think it's 
01:00:42
yourself saying it he might be saying get out of here now right 
01:00:46
what you would hear is I need to get out of here right now I need to stop this 
01:00:50
I need to just go that would be your angel saying that okay good 
01:00:54
they have the right to do that they have the right to do that 
01:00:58
they're not physically dragging you away although I think of some of them could they would want to 
01:01:02
yeah yeah okay good that's pretty clear Jim is asking this 
01:01:06
when we send our host to take down strongholds over a person 
01:01:10
what do the host actually do and what kind of freedom does the person experience 
01:01:14
is it temporary for a day and then we pray each day for the same thing 
01:01:18
okay that's his question I would say that the greatest prayer you can 
01:01:22
pray is that they know the truth and then that they're free always 
01:01:26
that's first but if you want to do something to begin to start them on the 
01:01:30
path where they can even hear God some of them are so messed up that 
01:01:34
can't even hear him and I would definitely pray for clarity for freedom 
01:01:38
from that thing you may send the host to put a stronghold is something like 
01:01:42
demonic forces coming against a person to either pull them out 
01:01:46
of the light or pull them into what's wrong or maybe even 
01:01:50
pull them into something else other than that that would hurt or harm them 
01:01:54
you totally can send the host to pull down those strongholds especially if it's a family member 
01:01:58
or someone who's known a long time or friend or somebody like that 
01:02:02
they even have groups of people who get together just to do that to send the host to do these 
01:02:06
they have strategic warfare 
01:02:10
and they actually have lists made and they meet together and their host come 
01:02:14
and they send them together on these assignments so you can be that 
01:02:18
you can totally send them to universities where your teenagers are going to pull down 
01:02:22
the strongholds of lies to open the eyes of them who are attending there 
01:02:26
or you can actually pray that the professor be shown the truth 
01:02:30
face to face with the truth and make a decision to stop deceiving 
01:02:34
there's all kinds of things you we just need to have one meeting where we do nothing but 
01:02:38
strategic give people strategic plans 
01:02:42
I was going to ask that because Kat you're up all night 
01:02:46
I assume you send hosts every single night but when you 
01:02:50
when you do that I know at least sometimes you're outside maybe all the time but do you have a 
01:02:54
list with you or do you just go by the spirit and see what God's going to tell you 
01:02:58
to send I have my list in here 
01:03:02
so you're in and it says do you 
01:03:06
does it ever occur to you sometime during the day you know when I send the host tonight I'm going to do 
01:03:10
this and this to these people do you kind of pre-plan any of that in your head 
01:03:14
or is it all in the moment 
01:03:18
no I think about a lot of the things that have to be done or things that people will tell me about 
01:03:22
or ask for 
01:03:26
if they send me a card anybody who sends me 
01:03:30
I guess those who on a continual basis probably contact me 
01:03:34
connect with me I will lay hands on the cards and some say father whatever 
01:03:38
they need if this is you will give it to them 
01:03:42
or I'll say father you know those who bless me I do pray for your finances 
01:03:46
I best not to get you to give me any money I'm just saying I do pray over those 
01:03:50
those who pray for me those who care those who want to see things change 
01:03:54
those who know of something going on somewhere I'm not saying tell me everybody send 
01:03:58
I'm talking about in a government in another country have people send me things 
01:04:02
this is going on in this government can you please make a declaration can you send the host 
01:04:06
and usually what I'll do is say you need to send the host 
01:04:10
if you're a believer you can send the host you can command the host because the greater 
01:04:14
you have a greater not chance because you have a greater opportunity 
01:04:18
if you're there present where this is going on and then you can command them to pull down those strong holds 
01:04:22
they will do it you can even post them somewhere for 30 days to keep 
01:04:26
this for 30 days so this situation 
01:04:30
can change and I had one have a woman who was so determined 
01:04:34
and one of the countries that we've been seeing some radical change 
01:04:38
and she came all the way to see me in Florida and brought me the 
01:04:42
her country's flag and it was under they were 
01:04:46
under severe attack and everything we all prayed for them in that meeting because we had the flag there 
01:04:50
we prayed over the flag anointed the flag and declared and sent the host 
01:04:54
things began to immediately change they started to get help 
01:04:58
leaving their country the prayer agreement is one of the most powerful things 
01:05:02
and if it's sending those together it's very powerful to do that 
01:05:06
if you find people to be in agreement with you make sure it's not like 
01:05:10
two single guys and girls or a married couple not I'm just saying 
01:05:14
yeah just don't let anything take what you're doing for good and try to use it 
01:05:18
and when you know wherever to the other thing wherever two or more 
01:05:22
are there I'm in the midst of you there's that one and wherever two or more agree 
01:05:26
is touching anything so I mean if you were had a way to try and 
01:05:30
describe the quantifier so I pray something I'm sending 
01:05:34
my host or Doreen and my wife and I we agree 
01:05:38
to send host can you quantify how much 
01:05:42
more power the two of us sending it is than just probably ten times more 
01:05:46
the power okay if you're sending a million you do it together it's going to be 
01:05:50
ten million okay really if it's a hundred you're going to send them together 
01:05:54
it's going to be a thousand that's the way it multiplies 
01:05:58
it's not just addition to the host it's multiplication 
01:06:02
I didn't know that one I hadn't heard that one that's really really good thank you Kat that's good 
01:06:06
okay we got a couple time for a couple more here and I got a second show today so we won't stop 
01:06:10
in a few Brandy's asking when the Bible says Jesus was beyond 
01:06:14
recognition on the cross I'm not sure which scripture she's referring to I think I do 
01:06:18
know was it because of the sin that he was bearing or because of his 
01:06:22
physical beating or both what what do you know it was the physical being 
01:06:26
had nothing to do because he didn't sin right so 
01:06:30
he was saying his appearance that they said he had to drink the 
01:06:34
cup yeah and he became spiritual cup okay 
01:06:38
I wanted to see let me explain okay it was a 
01:06:42
physical cup that the angels brought from heaven to him they brought it to him 
01:06:46
in the garden and that's when he said if possible let this cup 
01:06:50
pass from me that was a physical cup of what was in it was spiritual 
01:06:54
every spiritual every wicked evil sin you could commit 
01:06:58
ever every wicked evil deed that you could do 
01:07:02
every disease that there ever was that was a spiritual thing 
01:07:06
that when he drank it he made his decision at that 
01:07:10
moment to give his life it wasn't at the cost it really was there 
01:07:14
he knew he was going to go he knew he would do it and that is why he's the only one 
01:07:18
that has the right to forgive sins people he's the only one who ever bore them 
01:07:22
they were nailed to the cross that's why he has the right to 
01:07:26
forgive sins in case you ever wondered I do 
01:07:30
want to ask this question about that though in that about he's the only one 
01:07:34
because in the Lord's prayer you pray the Father forgive us our 
01:07:38
sins so you don't you mean the Father and Jesus can forgive sins is 
01:07:42
that as opposed to only I think the Father can forgive any kind 
01:07:46
of a sin whatsoever I think for salvation Christ is probably 
01:07:50
the only one to do that can do that because the Father knows 
01:07:54
he bearded that to the cross you know he paid the price to forgive for salvation 
01:07:58
the Father can forgive whatever he wants to forgive as the Father 
01:08:02
yeah I always I always get confused about 
01:08:06
confused may not be the right word but I mean 
01:08:10
Jesus said you know I'm not asking you to pray 
01:08:14
only in my name I don't have this memorized cap but 
01:08:18
you can go to the Father and he will give you in other words he was trying to communicate 
01:08:22
that the Father can give us what we ask without 
01:08:26
do you know what scripture I am I don't know if you know that 
01:08:30
don't ask in my name anymore but you can ask them you can ask 
01:08:34
that because we were always taught always pray in the name of Jesus so 
01:08:38
explain that if you can I think that is because they are one 
01:08:42
the Father and the Son are one I think the Father can bring 
01:08:46
he can bring help to you he can give blessings to you 
01:08:50
he can bring sudden leads to you yeah he says don't ask in my name 
01:08:54
you don't have to no longer ask only in my name he said he's literally 
01:08:58
saying you can ask the Father also like Father I don't 
01:09:02
have enough money to do this so Father thank you for blessing me with that money 
01:09:06
sending that money I need that money he's saying something like that 
01:09:10
yeah so in other words like the teaching that I was under that says 
01:09:14
if you don't say in the name of Jesus it doesn't have any power that's 
01:09:18
if you're asking the Father you don't have to say his name I was so 
01:09:22
ingrained in me that I don't even want to send send the host many times 
01:09:26
without saying in the name of Jesus I take power over that but I think you said 
01:09:30
one time that's not required to send the host 
01:09:34
didn't you say that you once you realize who you are in 
01:09:38
Christ then you just say I take power over the power of the enemy right what or 
01:09:42
I always edit myself because it's such a thing I do 
01:09:46
I say I wake up when I wake up I say I take power over all the power of the enemy 
01:09:50
this day okay and I always say thank you Jesus 
01:09:54
so I still see okay okay so you don't mention him 
01:09:58
but in other words because I have been given the right to command 
01:10:02
the host because Christ commanded we get to 
01:10:06
command them because Christ stopped the storm we get to stop the storm 
01:10:10
I always thank the Lord no matter what but it isn't like 
01:10:14
if I don't have his permission his direct permission to do that I can't do that 
01:10:18
I can still do it because he gave me authority to do it 
01:10:22
but I do thank him for it. Here's a good one 
01:10:26
we'll close on this one but I've wondered about this many a times because 
01:10:30
we know there's a difference between after I suppose after 
01:10:34
Jesus was glorified and died and all that but here's the question 
01:10:38
Debbie's asking did Jesus have face-to-face visits with God 
01:10:42
and or hear his audible voice like the prophets 
01:10:46
did or do and I'm especially wondering if supernatural things that happened 
01:10:50
to him when he was growing up how did he figure out who he really was so first 
01:10:54
part of that is we know people like Kat Kerr who are caught up to be 
01:10:58
with the father many many many times wouldn't it stand to reason that Jesus would 
01:11:02
have had that or more while he was on the earth he would have been caught up to his father many 
01:11:06
times. Does that follow? Well it says in the Bible 
01:11:10
he went to the mountains to meet with him. Yeah but then I used to think that just 
01:11:14
meant you know meeting in prayer but you mean meet me. He actually went 
01:11:18
to the mountains. Okay to meet with him 
01:11:22
there with the father yeah okay yeah I mean no I read the same 
01:11:26
thing again I was taught that just meant in prayer that's 
01:11:30
okay and so there came a time in 
01:11:34
his life he knew who he was 
01:11:38
when he said to Mary and Joseph I must be about the father's business when they 
01:11:42
corrected him for leaving the caravan remember that? Yeah 
01:11:46
he was in the temple speaking to the high priest 
01:11:50
and they were so undone by what he knew the revelation he knew and everything 
01:11:54
he knew at that moment in his life he knew he was the son of the loving God he knew from that moment 
01:11:58
he already knew he was he was either 12 or 13 he knew he would die 
01:12:02
on the cross he knew it all probably. He knew who he was he knew 
01:12:06
that was his father was in heaven and he did go to the mountains 
01:12:10
to meet with him to talk with him about stuff. Of course 
01:12:14
he would be able to do that. Okay good. 
01:12:18
So that was the way the disciples I think. 
01:12:22
Well and then this one again this is Debbie still asking said I'm especially 
01:12:26
wondering supernatural things that happened what happened 
01:12:30
when he was growing up how did he figure out who he really was I remember there was some 
01:12:34
supposed lost book of the Bible that claimed he had healed some birds or different things 
01:12:38
but I'm not trying to get anybody to go to other verse books but did he 
01:12:42
work miracles did he heal family members did he 
01:12:46
He did actually Steve what he practiced at 
01:12:50
home to them was not a miracle. Oh 
01:12:54
Mary knew he could turn the water into heaven's wine and I keep 
01:12:58
saying that he turned the water into heaven's wine not earthly wine. 
01:13:02
There was no process taking place anymore he simply turned the water 
01:13:06
into heaven's wine which I've had very sweet and it doesn't 
01:13:10
doesn't make you look in your flesh but the even at the wedding they 
01:13:14
said you have saved the very best we've never had any like this you saved 
01:13:18
it to the last and that's because he ran out obviously. Yeah 
01:13:22
Mary knew how did Mary know unless he had done it 
01:13:26
Mary knew he could do that that's what she said you know go ahead and do whatever he says to do 
01:13:30
and he's saying what are you making me step out before my time that's what he said to his mom 
01:13:34
that's true you're going to have me do a miracle at home it was never a miracle 
01:13:38
when his mother his mother and 
01:13:42
his brothers and trying to get him wherever he was either Nazareth or 
01:13:46
Copernum one of those places because they thought he was they seem to think 
01:13:50
he was going too far and and he said they said your mother and brothers 
01:13:54
are out there and he basically says I'll tell you who my mother and brothers are 
01:13:58
they're the ones doing the will of the father which was a super big ouch for mom and brothers 
01:14:02
but why why would that happen if assuming 
01:14:06
they already had seen his miracles what were they what were they trying to do because they liked them for 
01:14:10
themselves oh yeah yeah I'm sure they didn't 
01:14:14
run out telling all their friends my brother just turned the water into wine are you kidding 
01:14:18
they probably didn't say that they're thinking they'll all come and get it because remember they're not Jesus 
01:14:22
but he multiplied the food okay 
01:14:26
Mary knew he could do these things and she pondered them in 
01:14:30
her heart when he did them but she also did know one day 
01:14:34
he would die on the cross that was told to her I guess she was maybe 
01:14:38
hoping maybe she was thinking that could be avoided but it could be avoided 
01:14:42
and I think that one of when he said no these are the ones who got us 
01:14:46
sent me to you know not his family I think Mary knew at that time 
01:14:50
that things were changing and that probably was going to 
01:14:54
happen with him but it was not a miracle and this is what 
01:14:58
the Holy Spirit said what Jesus did at home was normal for them 
01:15:02
they couldn't do it they knew he could and so but when Mary finally made 
01:15:06
him step out mama pushed him out of the box and said no you 
01:15:10
need to do this and he did that that was his first 
01:15:14
miracle but it wasn't the first time he had done it 
01:15:18
that's very interesting I never thought of it that way because early on we've seen 
01:15:22
one it's time here's do whatever they tell you Jesus make this 
01:15:26
wine later on scene two or three he's there they're going what 
01:15:30
are you doing you what abandon this you're doing all these things 
01:15:34
I don't know it is I would love to sit down with Mary and Jesus 
01:15:38
in heaven and process what they were a lot of people do that 
01:15:42
well cat do tell people how to get 
01:15:46
out your two websites if you will because we're going to get going here 
01:15:50
in a second but talk about revealing heaven dot com for a second revealing heaven dot 
01:15:54
com is my main website that's where you can go to you'll find the 
01:15:58
book you'll find a lot of other stuff there they've actually been working on it I need 
01:16:02
to take a look at it and see what they've done to it they've made some changes to 
01:16:06
it probably for the better I think they made it better to navigate through it 
01:16:10
number one and also our store has greatly increased 
01:16:14
I've asked me to not just share heaven by word 
01:16:18
but to create items to put in the marketplace that represented heaven 
01:16:22
that is part of revealing heaven in the marketplace people things can they can 
01:16:26
have they can wear they can they can say things like I always like to use this 
01:16:30
cup to show people like this is not a normal cup it says I don't do demons 
01:16:34
right there so God didn't give me things to create 
01:16:38
that would bash people Holy Spirit give me ideas how to bash 
01:16:42
people and so a lot of our stuff like this speaks 
01:16:46
against the darkness like that and so we have all kinds of things we'd use in your 
01:16:50
home having your home which is what his original plan 
01:16:54
was to write the books to go and speak and then begin to create 
01:16:58
items that we could put in the marketplace and his word was this 
01:17:02
hell's been doing it long enough it's about time we put something in the marketplace 
01:17:06
good good and then cat car dot com what's there did you say 
01:17:10
that's a spiritual platform you can learn all kinds of things by going there 
01:17:14
it doesn't cost you to go there all it is however the only place 
01:17:18
on planet earth if you want to give to me online it's on cat car 
01:17:22

01:17:26

01:17:30

00:58
Greetings and happy Wednesday, feels like a Friday for some reason. 
01:20
Wednesday, November 16, 2022, welcome to the broadcast, I am Steve Schultz, your host and 
01:25
a founder along with my wife of ElijahList.com right there, ElijahStreams, who are in year 
01:30
25 and bring you the voice of the prophets and loving every minute, but I remain very 
01:35
encouraged about the present and the near future, things are really happening. 
01:39
We're going to bring Kat Kerr on in just a few moments to talk about anything God's 
01:43
giving her, and then we'll have questions for her, so be sure and text your friends 
01:47
and let them know that Kat is on, and we're going to run an episode, a premier new episode 
01:54
of American Warrior, so let me just read that, Lieutenant Colonel Mark Novak spent 27 years 
02:01
serving in the United States Air Force and Air National Guard, piloting the B-1 Lancer 
02:09
and KC-135 Stratotanker, refueling fighters in the air, but when he retired he didn't 
02:15
stop flying, today with over 8,600 flying hours, he's still racking up flying hours, 
02:22
and this nearly 80 year old, with this nearly 80 year old B-29, call it a dog, DOC, dog, 
02:30
one of only two B-29s in the world still flying, here's part of that story. 
02:38
General Doolittle stole my title to my book, it's called, I Could Never Be So Lucky Again. 
02:44
There's eight of us that are left seat qualified, and I have the most flying time of the year. 
02:54
I've decided that I want to be the guy that's more an expert in one airplane than the guy 
02:59
that goes out and flies five different airplanes a day, I'd rather be quote unquote the expert 
03:03
of B-29s. 
03:09
I'll ask why, why do you do this, and people don't realize what those 18-20 year old kids 
03:20
did, they went off to war, went on to them. 
03:29
We are keeping history alive, we are educating the next generation about the greatest generation. 
03:46
So interesting, each of these episodes is produced by my brother, Warren Shultz and 
03:51
myself, and we're happy to bring these to you to honor those who have gone before us 
03:55
and many of them, obviously these are the ones that are still with us, several of those 
04:00
who we've already premiered have already passed away. 
04:02
So many are dying, there's not very many left from World War II, and they're going 
04:07
very quickly. 
04:08
So I hope you'll watch that, here's how you can get on that, American Warriors on the 
04:12
Rumble channel, on Rumble you go to American Warriors 22 or just type in American Warriors, 
04:18
and YouTube the same thing, just type in American Warriors 22 or American Warriors. 
04:23
So I hope you'll enjoy that right after this program, you can go right there and watch 
04:27
that episode, sounds so so interesting. 
04:30
Alright, we want to thank you very very very very much for your support and donations into 
04:38
the ministry, those 24 of us, and to be 26 of us that keep this ministry going, and as 
04:46
you can see we so heavily into charity causes that advance the kingdom of God, well over 
04:54
a thousand people have come to the Lord in Uganda because of these freshwater wells, we're 
04:59
doing many things in the States too, we've done a lot in Jackson, Mississippi with the 
05:05
water projects there where there's been poison in the water. 
05:07
So let me just quickly remind you with a quick spot on what we're doing in Uganda, what you're 
05:14
doing in Uganda, so here we go. 
06:44
It's amazing, as you know Jesus said whoever gives so much as a cup of cold water to one 
06:56
of these, he will certainly not lose your reward, so and that is I've come to understand 
07:02
that you're not losing your reward in heaven, but you're also not losing your reward on 
07:07
earth, God loves to reward in the here and now just as much as he wants to reward you 
07:11
in the here after. 
07:14
So we love it what we're doing, but what I say that wrong when I say what we're doing, 
07:20
we love it what you are doing for these people, it's very, very real, you're changing literal 
07:25
lives, literal everyday needing water lives and God is crediting that to your account, 
07:31
so thank you very, very, very much. 
07:33
All right, time to bring on Cat Curso without further delay, let's bring in Wednesdays with 
07:39
Cat and Steve, there she is, I surprised you, I thought they were going to play that clip, 
07:45
but that's okay, we didn't play that little clip, how are you Cat, how are you? 
07:50
I am so excited to be here today, I've got my celebration, you know, whatever you want 
07:55
to call it, cover on, my prophet's robe, this is my prophet's celebration robe. 
08:00
Really, I love that, I said did you just make that or? 
08:04
Are you kidding? 
08:05
I don't know, I'm not sure that I've seen it before, I've made a D in home economics 
08:11
and not the food department, but in sewing, you've got a D in sewing? 
08:17
I think it was mercy, okay, I had to put this dress that had 10 million little ditzy flowers 
08:24
on it, and they couldn't give you a simple, because you know, you have to cut it out of 
08:28
the pattern, that was probably part of the problem, as long as it leaves with cuffs, 
08:31
it had a zipper on the side, it had buttons up the front, it had a fancy other thing on, 
08:38
and it was the biggest mess you ever saw, I had to wear it to school, one day it barely 
08:42
hit me, and the teacher just shook her head, not here, this is not your calling, but will 
08:49
we make you a chocolate pie next week, I'm going I'll make an A. 
08:55
You know, I think a lot of guys in high school took home act, but I didn't take it, but I 
08:59
think it would have enjoyed the cooking part of home act, but the cooking part was good 
09:03
if it was something I liked, and if it was, I was in all the way, yeah, a lot of people 
09:09
got some good training in that, I didn't even take, I got pretty good auto mechanics, as 
09:14
far as the guys to have their cat, just we lost her. 
09:17
This is an interesting day, we lost cat right in the middle of my sentence, do we know what 
09:21
happened there, Emily, Emily, Emily, do we know what happened to cat? 
09:27
We're checking, let me see here. 
09:30
She suddenly disappeared, either someone pushed the wrong button, but anyway, well what was 
09:36
I saying before that, anyway, I hope you guys are appreciating both the water well videos 
09:42
that we're making and the American Warriors, we work really hard at that, we spend a lot 
09:46
of money on the American Warriors, right now that's virtually all out of pocket, so when 
09:52
you also donate into American Warriors, some of that goes into honor the American servicemen, 
09:57
but mostly it's out of pocket, you know, because it's such an important thing to tell those 
10:01
stories on the water wells, there she is, we don't know what happened, do you know what 
10:07
happened? 
10:08
No, but I sent the cyber host in there to take care of it. 
10:11
Oh good, we have cyber, okay, that's now I know what, okay, yeah, so I don't remember 
10:18
what you were saying, but you were in the middle of saying it, so pick it up wherever 
10:22
you remember. 
10:24
I just know that I didn't make a really good grade on the dress, and this is the funniest 
10:29
part of the whole story, right, I told you 10 million little tiny flowers, which I never 
10:34
would have, I don't know who picked the fabric, but I never would have picked that, and my 
10:39
husband, I think it was our 10th anniversary, I wanted to really surprise him, so he goes 
10:45
and never would, for any birthday anniversary, no matter what it was, he got me fishing equipment. 
10:56
Obviously, I had so many poles, tackle boxes with tackle, I didn't even know how to use. 
11:01
But you don't like fish, right? 
11:02
No, I don't, I hate it, but it's his thing, he loved it, and he said, I'll surprise her, 
11:08
and I went, and he, and for years, nine years, he kept buying me this stuff, I went, if you 
11:13
buy me one more piece of fishing equipment, you're getting a dress. 
11:18
See, my husband is a man's man, let me tell you, but he's a man's man, and he goes, well, 
11:25
I won't make that mistake. 
11:26
He went up by himself and picked out this dress. 
11:31
It looked exactly like the one I made, I'm not kidding, Holy Spirit is so funny, he brought 
11:36
this, just look at this dress, and I, you know, I even made sure the measurements were 
11:41
correct, and he said, I spent hours, and somebody helped me find it, and I opened it up, and 
11:48
I went, wow. 
11:49
And he had everything, the longest time, and it was everything, with a dinty little flower 
11:54
and everything, and I said, well, I certainly say this for a special occasion, he goes, 
11:59
well, our anniversary's tonight, how about tonight? 
12:03
I wore it one time, and it's been in the closet ever since. 
12:09
I just liked it, just like that first dress, and it does sound like, I mean, the Holy Spirit, 
12:14
it was made okay, but still. 
12:16
I think you're going to say yes on this, but did the Holy Spirit have fun with that? 
12:22
Did he do that on purpose? 
12:23
Is that what you said? 
12:24
You know he did that on purpose, he absolutely knew that for him it would be the best joke 
12:29
ever, because I told my husband not to give me fishing equipment, or he'd get a dress, 
12:33
so he thought, well, I'll get the dress, and I'm sure Holy Spirit said, you know, let's 
12:37
take a look, and he goes, well, this one looks good, because he'll talk to you like that. 
12:42
I think I like this one, I think that's a good one, and so he picked it, and I'm like, 
12:47
I have it somewhere, but I only wore it that one time to make him happy, and I'm like, 
12:52
you can't hide in something like that, okay? 
12:55
Yeah, well, just for a second, hang there for a second. 
13:00
So this is the first time I think I've ever heard this about the Holy Spirit, that he 
13:05
would pull a prank on you, that he would laugh about, and he's a prankster himself from time 
13:11
to time? 
13:12
He is the drama king, they actually call him drama king in heaven, he loves drama, whether 
13:18
it's funny, he loves comedy, he's involved in the arts, he's involved in all the arts, 
13:25
he loves the arts, Jesus loves flowers and dancing, and of course talking about all the 
13:31
miracles he did, but the Holy Spirit's favorite thing is to be part of a drama, no matter 
13:36
what, they have dramas, they have plays, they have movies, they have all kinds of performances 
13:43
all over heaven, and they do really call him the drama king, king of king and drama king, 
13:48
and he absolutely will do things to pull jokes on you. 
13:53
That's amazing. 
13:54
Well, that's actually kind of encouraging, because that means I could relate to him as 
13:58
the person of the Holy Spirit, with an actual personality and a temperament, and a sense 
14:05
of humor, because we wouldn't have a sense of humor unless it was given to us by God. 
14:10
You're right. 
14:12
And I've learned so much of that with Kat. 
14:14
Well, Kat, let's talk about, so President Trump talked last night, I think they had 
14:17
a graphic of what that looked like last night, if they're, if they're, he was going to throw 
14:21
up a picture of Trump. 
14:23
So that was last night, he gave this announcement, and so many of us, we wanted him to make some 
14:28
sort of a going ahead announcement. 
14:29
We weren't sure that just I'm running in 2024 was all we wanted to hear. 
14:34
So talk about your response and what God's showing you or anything you want to say to 
14:39
encourage other people. 
14:40
Well, I knew he was going to do it. 
14:42
I knew he would say that. 
14:43
I knew he would do that. 
14:45
Yeah. 
14:46
It'll keep somebody really busy watching him campaign. 
14:51
Yeah, well, you can't take the hidden thing and that. 
14:57
I can't say anything more than that. 
14:59
Well, they can't refuse, even the media can't refuse to cover it like they've been refusing 
15:04
for the last two weeks. 
15:05
They just won't cover him. 
15:06
Now that he's running, they kind of sort of have to cover it. 
15:09
Yeah, they do have to. 
15:10
And that number one, that is going to really, that's really going to really hit them hard 
15:16
on the left because they didn't think he would do that. 
15:21
But I can, I know why he did it. 
15:23
And I can't say why. 
15:26
I will never change what I have been saying. 
15:29
And God has been saying is, just so you know everybody, he doesn't have to run again to 
15:33
get his seat back. 
15:34
Yeah, you have said that. 
15:35
I will say that, but, but being busy and keeping the news on certain things going on and the 
15:44
left trying to figure out how in the world they can stop him from doing what he is doing, 
15:49
I can say there can be a lot of other things happening. 
15:52
Fascinating stuff. 
15:54
So you have not lost your encouragement at all and what, what's going on? 
15:58
None at all. 
15:59
Are you kidding? 
16:00
Why should I? 
16:01
Yeah. 
16:02
I think it's going to be a good thing to see him a lot, people to see him a lot. 
16:06
Number one, that's going to really make people feel good, feel good that he does still care. 
16:11
He never stopped caring people. 
16:14
That's good. 
16:15
And he has never stopped saying he won. 
16:19
Yeah, that's good. 
16:21
That's good. 
16:22
You know, we were watching you. 
16:23
A couple of weeks ago I was talking to my wife and I saw him and I just said, and I mentioned 
16:29
this the other day on the air, but I said to Doreen, I love that guy. 
16:34
And then like a week or two going by and then last night we're watching him talk and do 
16:39
what he's saying. 
16:40
And Doreen just, and this was almost uncharacteristic of Doreen to be demonstrative like that. 
16:47
She just turned me. 
16:48
She says, I love him so much. 
16:50
I know. 
16:51
See, it's good. 
16:52
He's not. 
16:53
Well, I knew at one point, at one point he would come out and begin saying a lot and 
16:57
doing a lot because he can't stand obviously if you heard what's going on. 
17:05
He knows what it looked like. 
17:07
He knows what has happened. 
17:09
And I think it's good that there's someone not afraid to say anything that's happened. 
17:12
He certainly has voiced all of the truth of what he said. 
17:16
And even that encourages people knowing somebody after he does know the truth. 
17:20
They know what's going on. 
17:21
They know how bad it is. 
17:22
They know it. 
17:23
If anybody knew it, people, it would be number 45. 
17:27
Yeah. 
17:28
So good. 
17:29
So keep your eyes on what's being shown out there. 
17:32
Maybe you'll hear what else is going on. 
17:35
That's good. 
17:36
Well, thank you, Kat. 
17:37
Awesome. 
17:38
Awesome. 
17:39
Yeah. 
17:40
It's going to be fun to watch the news. 
17:41
Even the fake news to us a little bit. 
17:42
Not that we tend to watch lots of it. 
17:44
Some of it. 
17:45
I was quite surprised at seeing them even put it on. 
17:47
Yeah. 
17:48
Yeah. 
17:49
And I think that's kind of like they're kind of have to now. 
17:51
They're at a point where they now have to cover him, even, even if it's to make fun 
17:55
of them, they have to cover him because he's running. 
17:57
Yeah. 
17:58
You're right. 
17:59
They have to. 
18:00
Or they, I mean, they're obviously not doing any job whatsoever. 
18:04
So they do have to cover it. 
18:06
And that's going to take up a lot of time of special groups who would be doing other things 
18:11
will be assigned to watching him. 
18:13
Yeah. 
18:14
Very, very, very good. 
18:16
And, you know, because their ratings have collapsed in the last two years, I mean, completely 
18:22
collapsed, is in their financial best interest to start covering. 
18:26
Because the ratings go up. 
18:28
Even if they're making fun of him and trying to destroy him, oh, we lost Kat again. 
18:32
Do we think that's happened again? 
18:34
Well, this is an interesting day. 
18:35
We need to call more. 
18:37
We'll see if we can get her back on here. 
18:40
Okay. 
18:41
Yeah. 
18:42
So sorry about that, folks. 
18:43
But what was I saying before we lost her? 
18:47
It was fascinating to watch him. 
18:49
You know, I believe, Johnny Endlow and I talk about this on the air a lot, that President 
18:54
Trump, and I call him President Trump. 
18:57
I don't call him former or ex-president or anything. 
19:00
He is President Trump. 
19:01
I do believe Johnny does believe in a whole lot of us patriots absolutely hold these truths 
19:07
to be self-evident, if you will, that President Trump remains the commander in chief of the 
19:12
U.S. military. 
19:13
It is an almost indisputable fact. 
19:17
If you listen to, I don't know, was his rank. 
19:20
Derek Johnson. 
19:21
Oh, yay! 
19:22
Hey, we got you back again. 
19:23
So I was just saying to the people, I hold it as truth that President Trump remains to 
19:27
this day as the president, as the commander in chief. 
19:30
I don't know if I've ever asked you about that, but Johnny and I talk about that all 
19:33
the time. 
19:34
That he is our commander in chief to this day. 
19:36
And you know what I really love is when the left, and we know the news, what we normally 
19:43
call them, I don't want us to get cut off, so what our nickname is for the news, have 
19:51
to officially say President Trump. 
19:55
I can't just say the name. 
19:57
They have to give his title, just like they would do it for, you know, they would say 
20:01
President Obama, they would say President Clinton. 
20:04
I mean, they always still say it because they are, that will always be their title. 
20:07
Yes. 
20:08
For their whole life. 
20:09
That's who they are, no matter what goes on or how long we spend. 
20:12
So that's, that's a legitimate thing they have to say. 
20:16
They can't not say it. 
20:17
Yeah. 
20:18
And really when they say it, I know there's demons gnashing their teeth somewhere. 
20:23
Which makes us very, very happy. 
20:25
It makes me very happy. 
20:26
I've read a bash hell with anything else people. 
20:28
So you may think out there that you may be my enemy, nah, you're not, hell and the devil 
20:35
is everyone's enemy on the face of the earth, in case you wonder, okay. 
20:41
That's who your real enemy is no matter who you are. 
20:43
You have a real enemy. 
20:45
His name is Satan with a little s. 
20:49
That's good. 
20:50
That's good. 
20:51
That's good. 
20:52
Good. 
20:53
Good. 
20:54
Now, Kat, are you ready for some questions about heaven today? 
20:57
Now, let me just make an observation. 
21:00
Our numbers are growing so rapidly from week to week, because people are getting fed on 
21:05
this channel and they keep telling their friends and foe, whatever. 
21:10
And so the numbers are growing. 
21:11
So I know there's a lot of probably tens of thousands by the indication that I've never 
21:16
heard you before today watching this. 
21:19
So give a recap of what it means when we say Kat is going to talk about heaven and how 
21:24
many times you've been to heaven and what does that even mean? 
21:26
Because as if you're saying it for the first time, what would you say? 
21:29
That I have officially been appointed by Jesus Christ in person. 
21:37
Of all of you who have a problem with that, go look at your Bible, see how many people 
21:42
he has visited. 
21:43
Yeah. 
21:44
No, this is not something strange or unabnormable. 
21:48
And even people being caught up to heaven without dying, that actually happened in the 
21:53
Bible. 
21:54
I don't know how many people had that happen. 
21:56
Paul, who could barely talk about it, right? 
21:59
And in the Old Testament, how many were taken then? 
22:02
It's just crazy how many. 
22:03
I mean, there was Isaiah, there was Elijah. 
22:06
I could go on and on. 
22:08
There were so many that actually had encounters and actually saw heaven. 
22:13
And you know, what about Ezekiel? 
22:15
People go read the book of Ezekiel and see what he saw about the living creatures, the 
22:20
throne being moved by them. 
22:21
I mean, it's just wild, the things that happened back in the Old Testament. 
22:25
So this is not nothing new. 
22:27
God chooses who he reveals himself to. 
22:30
I'm talking about the Father chooses. 
22:34
And his son, Jesus Christ, his name was the Word, there was a Trinity. 
22:39
There was the Father, there was the Word, there was Holy Spirit. 
22:42
The Word became willing to give his life on the cross, to make a way for us here on the 
22:48
earth to get rid of all of our sins and gave us the way back to heaven where actually we 
22:54
all came from. 
22:56
So I had a divine encounter back in the 80s, a face-to-face encounter where the Lord said, 
23:02
the Father and He were going to start taking me on tours of heaven. 
23:06
That was not abnormal for me, people, because I'm a seer, which means I see in the spirit 
23:12
realm. 
23:13
I am a prophet. 
23:14
I'm a revelator because I reveal, John the revelator in the book of revelations revealed 
23:20
the throne of God, the Father, in Revelation 4, go read, you have Ezekiel 28, that's an 
23:27
assignment. 
23:28
Revelation 4, that's an assignment. 
23:30
And then you should read the book of Hebrews. 
23:32
Good. 
23:33
Yeah. 
23:34
Oh, wait, real quick. 
23:35
Why do you say read the book of Hebrews? 
23:36
Why did you just say that? 
23:38
It does describe heaven in there. 
23:39
There's different things to talk about heaven in there in Hebrews. 
23:42
It's a really good book that talks about it. 
23:46
There's other books. 
23:47
Of course, the book of John talks about the Word who was with God and was God and made 
23:52
everything that was ever made. 
23:53
So you can go there and read part of the book of John throughout the Bible. 
23:58
There's so many times heaven itself is mentioned. 
24:03
Heaven is the Father's house. 
24:05
It is not a building, it is a world. 
24:10
This house is a whole world bigger than our entire galaxy. 
24:14
And that's where he lives on the throne, that's where Christ sits at his right side. 
24:19
And Holy Spirit can be in every place at the same time, wherever he wants to. 
24:23
So he's there, he's down here. 
24:25
But that's how they set that thing up. 
24:27
When they designed all the stuff, they decided that man would be put on the earth so we could 
24:33
have a flesh body. 
24:34
We lived his little spirits inside the Father, it says this in the Word of God. 
24:40
In him we live, we move, we have a very big existence. 
24:46
That's what the word says. 
24:47
Okay, we lived in the Father this while he is our Father. 
24:50
He says in the Bible, we are his offspring. 
24:54
Just so I want you to clearly understand what I'm talking about. 
24:58
So the Father and Jesus Christ, they had a discussion. 
25:03
I'm Ben Pip from a seven generations of believers who actually believed there was a God. 
25:09
We had several seers in that line. 
25:11
We had some prophets, we had missionaries, we had pastors, we had lay ministers, so many 
25:17
people who loved for God on the earth and obeyed his word. 
25:22
And I walked on the same foundation. 
25:24
I never expected to do this, right? 
25:26
I was the loner person out of 14 of my siblings. 
25:30
I liked to be alone, but I always knew things where things were lost. 
25:33
I knew where they were and God would still speak to me. 
25:37
But I was a seer for the time I was little. 
25:38
I remember seeing angels in our room. 
25:40
I see people's angels no matter where I go. 
25:42
I've seen demons a lot. 
25:44
So I know how hell operates. 
25:45
So all of this has been my life of this reality of the divine. 
25:50
And so when Jesus came to me in person and said to me, the Father and I have decided 
25:55
to take you to heaven on trips so that you can reveal heaven to earth. 
26:00
And they'll know the truth about who we are, how heaven operates. 
26:03
It will dispel grief, it will give joy and celebration to the hearts of the people, that 
26:08
they will know more about us, that be Father, Son, Holy Spirit. 
26:12
And that was my assignment. 
26:13
And ever since that time in the 80s, they have never stopped taking me. 
26:19
I do not take myself. 
26:21
I am not asleep when they take me. 
26:24
Even my natural life is I'm awake 20 hours. 
26:26
I sleep four hours sometimes, that'd be like from 7 a.m. to like 11. 
26:31
I'm awake all the rest of the time. 
26:33
And even a long time ago, God would give me assignments, like go to this place and help 
26:37
this person, take this to this person, I'm going to fly you over here. 
26:40
And when you get there to the food court, tell this person this word, it's too late 
26:44
to tell me it's not real. 
26:46
And I'm glad they have me do it, but I'm a photographer. 
26:50
And my gift is I was sent as a photographer to the earth, okay? 
26:55
That's what I am normally. 
26:57
But I am a revelator, that's what they call me in heaven. 
26:59
And they take me on nonstop, after a thousand times, I stopped counting. 
27:02
I didn't roam around telling people, it didn't matter to me if people knew or not. 
27:06
I just did what God wanted me to do and I obeyed what he asked me to do or where I was 
27:11
going to go. 
27:12
And so I've been to heaven so many times. 
27:15
And so after doing that for years, the Lord comes back to me and says, the Father and 
27:20
I want you to write books about all your experiences in heaven. 
27:24
And what he would do is he would catch me up, let's say somebody passed away, does that 
27:28
mean he's going to do this for your relative? 
27:30
But I did actually host, I was, what was it, what was it called? 
27:36
I helped to make all the food for the people in our church, hospitality. 
27:40
And some people would come and have funerals at our church because we could hold 5,000 
27:44
people. 
27:45
I didn't know most of these people who brought their families here to have a funeral service. 
27:49
But I was put in charge of making the food for those funeral services and what the Lord 
27:53
would do was catching me up a couple days before that funeral service happened, show 
27:58
me their family member in heaven. 
28:02
I was told their name, these people in heaven didn't see me, I saw what their mansion looked 
28:06
like, I heard them talking about their families on the earth, I knew pets they had, places 
28:11
they had gone, I knew some of their family members' names, I knew what their favorite 
28:15
colors were, I knew what the Lord had made their mansion to look like. 
28:20
And then he would send me back to the earth and I would buy all the food. 
28:25
They were the favorite of this person who passed away. 
28:28
I would design the whole reception, the funeral reception and wear even some of the type of 
28:33
clothing like one person was in the military and I was taken out on this, what are the 
28:39
great big ships called? 
28:40
Yeah, like a carrier, right? 
28:41
Yeah, a couple days before the funeral service, it was going to be at our church, they didn't 
28:48
even go to that church and I saw this person standing in the military uniform, this was 
28:53
the person who passed away, he was standing on the deck of this big aircraft carrier and 
28:57
he says, I'm going off into the sunset. 
29:02
And so the Lord told me, when you do the service, I want you to wear a military uniform. 
29:08
I want you to pick his favorite aroma of a candle called ocean and you're going to put 
29:13
it on every table in the service. 
29:16
I want you to make all this person's favorite foods and gave me a list of them. 
29:19
And when they walked into this service, I never saw them before, they almost fainted 
29:26
and I was wearing the military uniform and they walked in and they went, did you know 
29:31
him? 
29:32
And I said, no, I did not know, I didn't know, somebody's the father, I said, no, I did 
29:37
not know your father, but I've seen him. 
29:40
And so they didn't hear about you, they wanted to hear, so I shared with them what had happened 
29:45
that I had seen, I mean, nothing about his actual service they did. 
29:50
And they said, then you don't know that his ashes were thrown off the aircraft carrier 
29:56
out the sea. 
29:58
Really? 
29:59
God always gave me evidence, I have evidence in my books, there was evidence that I knew 
30:06
the truth because I never knew this person, they didn't know me and yet what I said to 
30:10
them, I'm standing on the aircraft carrier, I'm going up into the sunset, they said, you 
30:15
didn't even know, I was in the middle, I said, I knew nothing about him. 
30:18
But this, they said, but all these things, the colors, the navy blue and the gold and 
30:22
your uniform and these scents of the candles, I mean, they were like shaking, they were 
30:27
so undone, this is his favorite food. 
30:29
And so that's how he did it, he did that for years with me and some of these were just 
30:35
amazing things that had happened and some of those stories are in the book. 
30:40
And so after doing all this for years and the Lord came back, we want you to write a 
30:43
book, you go back to those people who you shared with about the family members, the 
30:48
encounter you had seeing them, we want you to give their personal permission with a written 
30:53
message. 
30:55
And that will be one of the stories in your book, you'll have what you saw, what you did 
30:59
with it and what they said when they saw all this happened so that you'll have an evidence 
31:03
that you really did see that. 
31:06
And so that's what's in the books and so I didn't know after going and seeing all these 
31:11
people who had passed away and I never talked to any of them. 
31:15
And so some were like military people, some were even young people. 
31:20
And one of my favorite stories was about a young person who passed away, but I'm not 
31:23
going to go into that. 
31:25
So I have been taken for years, I've seen so many parts of heaven and I'm taking my 
31:30
spirit in your spirit, you feel young, you're excited, you're really breathing the air of 
31:37
heaven. 
31:38
If you're taking in your flesh, your body is not used to the glory, it will begin to 
31:42
get weak because you're there in the flesh that happened to Jesse the plan is go get 
31:46
his book and read it. 
31:47
And so when that happens, if you're taking in your flesh, they'll bring this copper 
31:51
colored fruit in heaven and give it to you and he did that. 
31:56
And then that gives you strength in your body for whatever reason, I never was given the 
32:00
copper fruit. 
32:01
So for whatever reason, God, sometimes for maybe you know and don't know, but he takes 
32:08
some, you know, because he could take in the spirit almost all the other time. 
32:11
One time he may say, okay, come and you go, your body's gone, they wouldn't be able to 
32:16
find you on the earth at that point. 
32:17
Is that what you're indicating? 
32:18
Oh yeah, Jesse the plan is was taken in his flesh, his body wasn't in the room. 
32:25
He went to lay down in the hotel room and God took him in his flesh to heaven. 
32:31
And he has that story in his own book about heaven and he talks about what he saw there 
32:35
and all the things that were going on and I didn't, you know, I just know that he wrote 
32:41
that book. 
32:42
Yeah. 
32:43
All my stuff I saw and happened, those were all my own encounters. 
32:46
Why do you think, because you I was actually had written this question down for today. 
32:51
So this is a good time to ask that question. 
32:55
Why does God seem to always take you as an eight year old girl? 
33:00
What's the point of that? 
33:01
And do you, when you go and you show up and you're this eight year old girl, do you realize 
33:06
that back in the flesh on earth, you're still this person that I'm looking at right now, 
33:13
your cat Kerr with pink hair and you're the older person that I'm looking at. 
33:17
Do you know both of those at the same time or what? 
33:19
No, I have nothing. 
33:21
I know that I'm back on earth, but I don't even care. 
33:23
Think about it. 
33:24
I'm an eight year old. 
33:25
I'm in my spiritual body and there is a reason why he took me as an eight year old Steve 
33:29
because they don't argue with people. 
33:33
I don't argue about what God shows me. 
33:35
I don't second guess him. 
33:36
I don't try to figure out how they do. 
33:38
I don't do any of that. 
33:39
I'm eight. 
33:41
I'm so excited. 
33:42
I can't wait to get back and share what I saw and the things I got to do and it was 
33:47
amazing. 
33:48
I mean, I also have, God gave me a photographic memory even when I was little. 
33:53
I can remember things. 
33:55
I remember back when I was like, I don't know. 
33:57
I remember being a baby. 
34:00
I remember being a baby. 
34:01
Really? 
34:02
The first year I was alive, they couldn't even put water on me. 
34:06
My mother had to bathe me in oil for the whole first year of my life. 
34:11
God said that was my, he was anointing me. 
34:13
Oh, wow. 
34:14
And you just had something physical going on so they couldn't put you in water? 
34:18
Yeah, water. 
34:19
They just couldn't put me in water. 
34:20
So they said to use the baby oil and that's what she did. 
34:23
She gave me with oil for the whole first year of my life. 
34:27
But I remember seeing in my crib. 
34:30
I remember being in my crib and seeing angels in my room. 
34:34
I remember it. 
34:35
And I remember every single encounter I ever had in heaven. 
34:39
I remember encounters I had growing up, even being very young with the rest of my family 
34:44
they all thought it was strange, but especially my mom thought it was really strange. 
34:49
So I would never go to sleep. 
34:50
I wasn't tired and I never wanted to eat. 
34:53
I eat once a day, still eat once a day. 
34:56
And she wanted me to be normal so I could eat and sleep, but she finally realized, hey, 
35:01
she's doing fine. 
35:02
You know, she's doing just fine. 
35:04
So she finally just let me be me. 
35:08
But I do remember so many things growing up, the wonderful things my dad did to help people, 
35:13
the people I knew that, you know, just gave their whole life to help guys and bless people 
35:18
with their lives. 
35:20
And I liked my dad. 
35:21
He was like my best friend, my natural dad. 
35:24
Wow. 
35:25
He was a good example of the father himself and loving people and forgiving people. 
35:30
That's how he, that's how we live. 
35:32
But the heaven thing, I never really thought I knew that I knew I could see heaven and 
35:37
hell, you know, examples of them that never bothered me. 
35:41
And I thought that was just normal to be able to do that. 
35:44
But when Jesus showed up, I know I say that like it's just nothing. 
35:49
Oh no. 
35:51
I loved, dearly loved Jesus at age four. 
35:54
I received Jesus as my savior because I am a seer, a seer. 
36:00
I did it in Sunday school. 
36:01
I saw Jesus come and step inside of me when I said I saw him step inside of me. 
36:08
No one from that point in my life could ever tell me that that was not real, that I knew 
36:13
that when you got saved, it says that he lives in you, he says that he lives in you. 
36:18
And I knew that was true. 
36:19
So there were so many things that I experienced being a seer that I knew these things were 
36:25
true. 
36:26
And so that was my whole life. 
36:28
You prepared me for doing this. 
36:30
And when he came in person, he never actually asked me to do anything he told me because 
36:35
I had told him somewhere in my life, I will do whatever you want and you don't even have 
36:39
to ask. 
36:40
I give you permission right now. 
36:41
If you want to send me somewhere, I want me to say something, whatever you want, I want 
36:46
what you want. 
36:47
And I get, I encourage people to say that to him. 
36:51
And so all this training happened for years and years and years. 
36:54
And then finally when he came in, he said, we're going to start, you're going to be 
36:56
start taking that after I went for years, he came back and said, we want you to write 
37:00
books about your experiences in heaven. 
37:02
They will dispel grief all over the world. 
37:06
Yeah, it's helped me. 
37:07
It's already helped Doreen and me. 
37:08
We've known you for 10 years. 
37:10
All kinds of grief has been dispelled even from losing our pets that we now understand 
37:14
they go to be with the Lord before we do, you know, that's right, they're waiting on 
37:18
you. 
37:19
And so I, I love what they have asked me to do, but I also told them the day that you 
37:26
are done, I'm perfectly fine. 
37:29
But until then, I'm going to enjoy very much being able to share who you are, who the father 
37:36
is, Holy Spirit, how heaven operates, they showed me how heaven operates, they took me 
37:41
to so many places in heaven, I can name them, I could sketch them and one day I will paint 
37:46
more of them. 
37:47
I'll be painting myself one day, but that's my assignment. 
37:50
I'm a revelator and from the beginning they called me a revelator. 
37:54
And they said your name, your nickname cat curves what you will go by and, and then you're 
38:00
going to write these books, three books on heaven. 
38:03
And we're assigning to you to scribe angels who will remain with you until you are done 
38:08
with your third book. 
38:10
I'm working on my third book now and he said, because you've seen so much of heaven, we 
38:15
don't want you to struggle with where do I write the angels will give you the chapter 
38:19
titles in all of your books. 
38:22
And then you will know what you're going to write about because you've already seen that 
38:25
stuff. 
38:26
Well, that's fascinating. 
38:27
I mean, God could have said the Holy Spirit is going to give it to you, but he, he decided 
38:30
to assign it to the angels to give to you, huh? 
38:32
You can describe angels. 
38:33
One is very funny. 
38:34
The other one is very fierce and fiery and he's all about being holy and the other one's 
38:39
a comedian and they rub each other like, you know, it would be like you go with someone 
38:46
who's the opposite of you somewhere. 
38:48
And, uh, and so they did, he did send them and they're actually still right here with 
38:53
me. 
38:54
I know their names. 
38:55
I don't talk to them very much. 
38:56
And what I want to say something where they have to say something to them. 
38:59
And they've already given me half of the chapter titles for book three because I have started 
39:04
working on book three and it's going to be phenomenal. 
39:07
It's going to be amazing. 
39:08
But for all these people saying none of this is possible, you need to be reading your Bible 
39:13
people because yes, there were people in the Bible sat in eight with angels. 
39:18
And a fellowship with angels on earth, on the earth and Abraham, even Abraham met them 
39:25
and saw them. 
39:26
And I could just, there's so many people in the Bible because I was a Bible scholar 
39:29
people not in college. 
39:31
But just at home, my dad taught us how to read the word, enjoy the word and he'd share 
39:35
all the time. 
39:36
So it's real. 
39:38
And you know what? 
39:39
You can use the word against the enemy. 
39:41
You can use it to bless people. 
39:42
You can use to speak things into existence, but only if you have it in you. 
39:48
Make sure you're reading the living word of God. 
39:51
Okay. 
39:52
So good. 
39:53
What do you say to people? 
39:54
Now I can hear people, even new people watching today and they're going, well, wait a minute. 
39:58
Paul spoke against the worship of angels and being puffed up with the, with the worship 
40:03
of angels. 
40:04
worship people worshiping is bowing down to somebody and bringing them treasures. 
40:09
Okay. 
40:10
That is not what I do. 
40:13
Communicating Abraham, communicating with angels. 
40:15
I'm just done this long list, we bought many people, communicating with angels. 
40:19
Communication is not worship. 
40:21
Okay. 
40:22
Receiving directives. 
40:23
How many angels brought words to people, brought supplies to people, brought encouragement 
40:29
to people on the earth. 
40:30
I mean, it's, you know, it's, do you even have heaven in your life? 
40:35
Heaven shouldn't have it your life. 
40:38
Heaven culture should be what you live on this earth. 
40:40
You better be preparing because that's where you're going. 
40:43
If you're a believer, but I never worship anything except Jesus Christ, the father and 
40:47
Holy spirit. 
40:48
That's it. 
40:49
That's the only one they worship. 
40:50
I will only worship the one true God had and I will not worship another. 
40:57
And I certainly do not worship the things of hell. 
41:00
Their images, their products, their apparel, I'm not advertising hell at all. 
41:06
I would rather bash them, crush their plans, push them back using the host of heaven to 
41:11
hold on strongholds and spread platforms. 
41:13
Good. 
41:14
Good. 
41:15
Good. 
41:16
Good. 
41:17
Good. 
41:18
All right. 
41:19
Now another thing that I had pre written down, so I'm going to just go there because it's 
41:21
interesting how this is feeds into it. 
41:22
You said the story you told us about a man who was cremated and then thrown over the side 
41:29
of the carrier. 
41:30
So he's buried at sea, throwing his ashes over. 
41:34
You had told the story and this is in heaven, but it's concerning heaven. 
41:40
You've told a future story that the time will come when someone will be resurrected or maybe 
41:46
many people at a funeral, during a funeral, even though their ashes are sitting right 
41:52
there. 
41:53
And if I'm saying, am I saying that right? 
41:55
Is that for the many? 
41:58
Is that going to happen many times? 
41:59
Is that a one off thing in the future? 
42:01
What? 
42:02
I don't think that went off anything. 
42:03
It's the greater works. 
42:05
Okay. 
42:06
Christ said you will do the works. 
42:08
I did and greater works you will do a, a work, one of the works is raising the dead. 
42:15
I mean, that's happening in many places, but it happened quite often actually. 
42:20
What will be happening a lot is mass raising of the dead mass raising likes, let's say 
42:27
there's a whole lot of people that die in one area and God sends you there and says, 
42:31
raise the dead and they will be raised up and they won't be dead anymore, whether dead 
42:35
bodies are still there and everything that is, that is going to happen. 
42:39
That's a greater work. 
42:40
Yeah. 
42:41
The greater work is taking the lid off the jar at the funeral and commanding the, commanding 
42:45
that person to come back into their body. 
42:48
The ashes are their body. 
42:49
It's the right there. 
42:51
He knows God knows how to put every ash back together people and he can put them all back 
42:56
together and that is going to happen. 
42:59
I don't know how often, but it's going to happen because yeah, I got to ask you this 
43:03
because I mean, I told you this that we tried for actually almost three weeks to raise a 
43:09
dead body. 
43:10
We had to get permission to the funeral home to do it there for a while, then they shifted 
43:13
the church began to intercede and basically it didn't succeed. 
43:17
It didn't succeed, but there was discernment that he didn't want to come back. 
43:22
So what's the deal? 
43:23
So someone else, two people could try and raise the dead from the ashes. 
43:28
One would want to come back and one wouldn't. 
43:30
Is that what you would say? 
43:32
I would say God many times gives them a choice. 
43:36
And if she gave them a choice, 99 percent of the time, they would stay in heaven. 
43:43
I would. 
43:44
Not because they don't love you, but they love the father. 
43:48
They love the son more than anything. 
43:51
And the only way you really can truly experience that is to have been with them. 
43:56
I've heard stories of people taking over the throne and he said, you have to go back and 
43:59
they cried. 
44:00
Oh, wow. 
44:01
They cried. 
44:02
Really? 
44:03
Yeah. 
44:04
He said, you, I have to have you, you have to go back and I have to send you back and 
44:07
they cried. 
44:08
They didn't want to come back because when you're with him, when you're with him, the 
44:12
Lord, when you're with the Lord, when you're with the father, it's the most powerful love 
44:17
you'll ever experience. 
44:20
It's not that they're going to forget about you, but if you went there, you would understand. 
44:24
You would understand. 
44:26
He actually put something in and he reached and put something in me. 
44:29
Oh, really? 
44:30
The Lord did. 
44:31
And he said, I'm putting this in you so you will not want to remain in heaven, but we'll 
44:36
be so excited. 
44:37
Oh, really? 
44:38
Yeah. 
44:39
He actually did. 
44:40
Yeah. 
44:41
So it wouldn't be hard for me because I'd be going back, he'd be taking me back and forth 
44:45
a lot and he wanted me to want to come. 
44:47
I can't wait to come back and share. 
44:50
That's how I feel. 
44:51
I suppose he could do that to someone who has already graduated to heaven and they're 
44:55
happy there and he could say, I know you're happy here, but I'm going to put a spirit 
44:58
in you that makes you want to go back because I've got something to do for you. 
45:03
Could he do that? 
45:04
Might he do that? 
45:05
I don't know if he would do that, but because he didn't give me a different spirit, he literally 
45:09
put something from himself that gave me such a hunger to share. 
45:16
Truth about what really goes on there. 
45:19
Is that? 
45:20
Oh, sorry. 
45:21
You talked about that he went to, he spoiled hell and he took back the keys of death hell 
45:30
in the grave and these were moments in time, at least moments, but death is death. 
45:35
Hell is you're on your way maybe and or the grave is when they buried you or I suppose 
45:40
cremated you. 
45:42
That's the grave. 
45:44
So when those times are past, what I'm intrigued because once those moments of time are gone, 
45:51
and it's still not too late if God decides to resurrect them because I don't know what 
45:56
your thoughts. 
45:58
I would have to say that's all totally up to the father. 
46:01
I know what the keys, those keys that that Christ took away from the devil gave him the 
46:09
right himself to go in those little windows of time and present himself because people 
46:15
are praying, someone has to be praying. 
46:18
A believer normally has to be praying for that person that they would not go to hell, 
46:23
that they would know Jesus Christ, that they would have a chance to receive him. 
46:27
And so it says a man is appointed once man is appointed unto man is appointed to die 
46:35
unto under man's point of wants to die. 
46:38
Yeah. 
46:39
And then. 
46:40
Now I have news for people when you die and you're dead, the judge when he's talking 
46:47
about is not the judgment seat of Christ, which is a long ways away for you, even in 
46:51
heaven. 
46:52
And it's not the great white stone judgment, which is the last judgment seat anyone will 
46:57
face before everything's wrapped up and all things will be new. 
47:01
So you're not talking about either one of those judgments, there is a judgment seat 
47:05
of Christ. 
47:06
Okay, that's not about sins, right? 
47:09
And the the great white stone judgment is for all the wicked dad that are taking out 
47:13
the hell at one point and go before the father and he shows them, this is why I cannot let 
47:18
you in. 
47:19
This is why you're going to live fire. 
47:21
Those are two judgments. 
47:22
But when it says that the planter and the man wants to die, thank you, Holy Spirit. 
47:26
Yay. 
47:27
Yeah. 
47:28
Judgment is at the moment you die, there is a judgment. 
47:31
Do I have the right to use the keys? 
47:33
That's for Christ. 
47:34
Yeah. 
47:35
Okay. 
47:36
That's what that scripture means. 
47:37
So there is actually a scripture that talks about it. 
47:40
The planter and the man wants to die and then the judgment has everything to do with Christ 
47:46
using those keys. 
47:47
So you better be helping if you're not a believer that you have someone praying for you, David. 
47:55
I may have brought this. 
47:56
I think I brought this up before and I can't quite remember your, I think one more, one 
48:00
more, one more. 
48:01
Oh, go ahead. 
48:02
Now that doesn't give you the right because he got those keys and he goes to you at that 
48:05
moment. 
48:06
And you have to say, yes, I repent of my sins, I regret I ever did that. 
48:11
Please forgive me. 
48:12
I want you as my savior. 
48:14
If you looked at Christ who came through at that moment, you said, I'm not interested. 
48:18
Guess where you go. 
48:19
You go right to hell. 
48:20
So the people don't mean you're going to go in, it's your answer, your response to him 
48:23
at that moment. 
48:24
At that moment that judgment comes, if that happens to you, I sure hope that you repent 
48:30
to Jesus Christ. 
48:31
Now you can go ahead and watch this. 
48:32
Well, yeah. 
48:33
I might have brought this up and I think what I'm about to say, you may say that's impossible 
48:38
Steve, but I can't remember what you said. 
48:40
So along this line, 20 years ago, a contemporary of Catherine Kuhlman, he was in, he ministered 
48:46
with her and he said, he gave me the name of a person who, if I mentioned her name, 
48:53
she died young and people would know who she is. 
48:55
And he said, she's going to still be resurrected, Steve, and again, this is about 20 years ago. 
49:01
And I said, well, I don't know if I've heard of anything like that, but why would God resurrect 
49:05
her after she's gone 30 years? 
49:09
And he said, because her work here wasn't done. 
49:12
So is that impossible? 
49:14
Was he wrong that that was even possible for some? 
49:17
I am not God and I cannot be God. 
49:20
And since that was not me involved in that situation, I can't really give a response 
49:26
about that. 
49:27
But God is God, he is sovereign, and the only thing I'd ever heard anything like that was 
49:34
people who had passed away and were in heaven. 
49:39
This is part of the reward. 
49:40
They will come back to the millennial reign of Christ, but that'll be him bringing them 
49:44
back. 
49:45
And it wasn't any other time. 
49:46
It wasn't necessarily like, you know, they've been gone 20, 30 years, we'll let them come 
49:50
back to have another life here. 
49:52
That's not it. 
49:53
That is not it at all, because I know that that part does not happen. 
49:57
But I do know in the millennial reign of Christ, which is another whole era. 
50:01
Yeah. 
50:02
That's an era. 
50:03
That's not this era that we're in right now. 
50:05
It's not. 
50:06
We're still in the kingdom age, which means Christ hasn't come back to tribulation, hasn't 
50:12
happened. 
50:13
There's so many things we haven't manifested as sons and daughters of God. 
50:16
We haven't spoken to the land to see in the air, well, maybe to see a little bit and watch 
50:20
it obey us because that's what God, the earth is crying out for that to happen. 
50:24
And we're going to be, we rule with Christ, we're kings and priests and to our God. 
50:30
That ruling is just starting right now in the spirit realm. 
50:33
The great wealth transfer that certainly has not happened yet, all the new inventions 
50:38
and creations that will happen on the earth, the things that will happen over the next 
50:41
many generations that has to happen before that part comes. 
50:47
But once Christ comes and fights and Satan is kicking to hell, well, not hell. 
50:54
He falls for a thousand years in a bottomless pit. 
50:58
Christ will sit on the throne and this Jerusalem is there now. 
51:03
He will rule as king of this world for a thousand years and then Satan is loosed for 
51:09
a season. 
51:10
So those people who were born in that time can be tested. 
51:14
If you're not Bible scholars, you probably know what I'm talking about. 
51:17
So that's why this is not over. 
51:19
It's not over. 
51:20
Okay. 
51:21
So, so that's a whole different era. 
51:23
So the Christ comes after that would be after the church age. 
51:28
Okay. 
51:29
That's after the church age. 
51:30
Then there is the millennial age. 
51:32
If you don't like that, we're millennial people who don't want to put it in your little 
51:35
Bible. 
51:36
As you wrote, you want to put thousand year reign of Christ. 
51:39
I have news for you. 
51:40
It means the same thing. 
51:42
So for a thousand years, Christ will sit on that throne. 
51:45
It was given to him as his father. 
51:48
He doesn't want to miss that part. 
51:49
The father doesn't want him to miss that part. 
51:51
They have reason why they have to have all of these things in there that they had pre 
51:55
decided and not pre decided if you would go or not. 
51:59
That's entirely up to you. 
52:01
So, so these things still have to happen. 
52:04
The end and is not here. 
52:07
It's not here. 
52:08
Okay, people. 
52:09
And we're quite a ways away from the perilous times of the tribulation, although you think 
52:13
you're experiencing it right now. 
52:15
You aren't. 
52:16
I've been taken into some of those times and this is nothing like what that will be. 
52:21
But God right now is exposing all the evil so he can deal with it. 
52:25
So these greater days of glory are coming on the earth. 
52:29
That's what your new normal will be. 
52:31
The greater glory, baptism in fire, manifest in sons and daughters, ruling and reigning 
52:35
with Christ. 
52:36
That's what is coming. 
52:39
That's what's coming people. 
52:41
That's good. 
52:42
You wonder. 
52:43
Good. 
52:44
Hey, you know, you know, I, this is a day I'm just going on the rabbit trail. 
52:47
You introduce something else and say, okay, let's talk about that now. 
52:50
Okay. 
52:51
I've never asked you anything about the millennial reign of Christ. 
52:56
Maybe the millennials today will are all going to be there, but, but let's say the millennial 
53:02
reign of Christ hundreds of years from now, whenever that is, you said it just said it's 
53:07
in this Jerusalem, the Jerusalem that we were going to be there in April or May, you know, 
53:12
that Jerusalem, he's going to rule from there. 
53:14
Is a temple going to be there when he's there or no temple? 
53:17
I'm quite sure there will be some kind of a temple there because he will be sitting on 
53:22
a throne in the temple. 
53:24
Okay. 
53:25
Okay. 
53:26
On that temple mount, right? 
53:28
Theoretically, I would say if it's Jerusalem, yeah, and ruling from a throne, it would 
53:36
have to be in that place. 
53:38
It would have to, it will definitely be that place. 
53:41
Actually, a lot of the Bible's written about that area over here in the United States and 
53:46
other places. 
53:47
We weren't even around when all that was even discussed or talked about. 
53:50
Of course, God knew that we would be here. 
53:52
He knew that we would be friends with Jerusalem. 
53:54
He knew all that would happen, but mainly these things happening, even the battle taking 
54:00
place aren't going to be here. 
54:03
The battle, you know, during the Paris times, when the devil tries to take over in his great 
54:07
big battle move and he loses again, that's going to happen over there. 
54:12
That doesn't mean it won't affect people living here. 
54:15
On this side of the world, but most of those places in the Old Testament, that's where 
54:20
they happened. 
54:21
They happened in the area. 
54:22
In the New Testament, that's where they happened in the area. 
54:25
Even in the future, when they talked about the revelations, those were things that happened 
54:29
in that area. 
54:30
That is the very area where Christ will rule as king of this world, and there'll be natural 
54:35
people in the world that don't want him there, but they can't stop him from being him. 
54:41
Yeah. 
54:42
Okay. 
54:43
What's more about then the millennial reign, he's on a throne, it's in a temple or a temple-like 
54:47
structure. 
54:48
All weapons will be destroyed. 
54:49
Okay. 
54:50
All weapons destroyed. 
54:51
No nuclear war, no wars. 
54:54
He's ruling with a rod of iron, which is, I've never, that's during the millennial reign 
54:59
with a rod of iron. 
55:00
That's over the people who don't want him there. 
55:02
Okay. 
55:03
There will be believers that become believers there. 
55:05
He won't have to rule them with a rod of iron, but this is, there'll even be some wicked 
55:09
people in the earth while he's ruling. 
55:13
There's going to be people. 
55:14
That's crazy. 
55:15
Really? 
55:16
It says they won't want to come before his throne to show off what they have. 
55:20
You know what? 
55:21
Their land is getting them. 
55:22
And he says this in the Bible, that Christ will say, come and bring your goods before 
55:25
me so that I can bless him, and they won't want to come, they won't want him there. 
55:29
And he will say to those people, then you won't get rain on your land. 
55:33
These are wicked people and wicked leaders. 
55:36
They can't rule. 
55:37
They have no power to rule. 
55:38
There's no armies at that time on the earth. 
55:41
And then after a thousand years of Christ's ruling, it says, Satan will be a lustful season 
55:46
to tempt those who are born. 
55:49
People will live to be eight, 900 years old during that thousand years and won't die. 
55:55
So that was a long time. 
55:57
Is this the same scriptures that talk about if you don't come up before, did you just 
56:02
want to celebrate tabernacles that, that it won't go well with you? 
56:06
Is that the same area? 
56:08
It says it will not be, God said, he will say to them, I will not send rain on your 
56:13
land if you don't come. 
56:17
Talk about, okay, we're rabbit trailing today. 
56:19
So talk about people that do the feast and they don't want to miss Passover or tabernacles. 
56:27
To what degree does God like it when people keep that today? 
56:31
Do you keep tabernacles, for instance? 
56:34
I don't. 
56:35
I don't. 
56:36
I'm not, I'm not really, I'm not a Jew, it's okay if I don't. 
56:41
I do sometimes attend different things that they do. 
56:44
I do sometimes attend those things and I enjoy them, but he does not demand that I do any 
56:51
of those things. 
56:52
Okay. 
56:53
I am a believer in Jesus Christ. 
56:55
I don't have to follow Jewish tradition or Jewish rules or laws myself. 
57:03
I, you know, Christ came and replaced all of that himself. 
57:08
Christ replaced that and that's why we follow him, honor him, we serve him. 
57:12
I'm not against any of the Orthodox Jews at all and what they decide to do, that's how 
57:17
they decide to live. 
57:18
They honor God for God. 
57:21
They will at one point have to make a decision about Christ. 
57:24
Yeah. 
57:25
You know, and I, and in this 20 years I've gone to two or three Passover Saders and that 
57:31
was actually the meaning of Christ and we even went to, we were in Jerusalem four or 
57:37
five years ago just on a visit. 
57:39
Terina and I, we did, when it wasn't the tour and we had friends that are not Jewish. 
57:45
I don't think they have Jewish, but they were in Jerusalem. 
57:47
They loved all the feast and so on. 
57:48
We happened to be there on Tabernacle. 
57:51
So we went to a restaurant where they had the booths built, even inside the restaurant, 
57:56
you know, and so it was fun, but it wasn't something that I felt an obligation to do, 
58:00
but it was fun to do. 
58:01
Our church every now and then will actually celebrate the Tabernacle booth. 
58:07
They'll do that. 
58:08
They'll do that. 
58:09
They'll do the Saders. 
58:10
They'll do things like that. 
58:11
We had some Messianic Jews in our church. 
58:14
I think they're probably still there. 
58:16
And I, there you go, it's head of hospitality and I cooked for a lot of the people in the 
58:23
church. 
58:24
Like I did home meals for the church sometimes, people, that was a lot of cooking. 
58:28
And I was invited to the, uh, I think it was, was it the Passover Saders that we call it? 
58:34
Yeah. 
58:35
Yeah. 
58:36
Where they bring unleavened bread. 
58:37
Yeah. 
58:38
Yeah. 
58:39
Yeah. 
58:40
Yeah. 
58:41
So I told somebody who was getting all the food ready, don't worry, I'll bring the bread. 
58:43
Oh no. 
58:44
What did you do? 
58:45
I didn't bring a little loaf of leavened bread people because I was clueless about the unleavened 
58:51
and the leavened bread. 
58:52
I just needed to have a piece and I was going to help. 
58:54
I had a basket when I made big dinners. 
58:58
It was this big, it was this big green, green, beautiful bread basket with a handle and I 
59:04
decorated it and put about eight loaves of Italian bread and French bread. 
59:11
All the leaven, this is going to be a feast and I was at the door and my friend, Bud Washi, 
59:20
who would give bread away at the senior citizens home, all he could do is laugh. 
59:24
He saw me. 
59:25
He was talking. 
59:26
I'm walking up to the main food table with this big, huge thing and my friend, Meisberg, 
59:33
descends upon me, scoops the bread from my arm and runs up to the next door. 
59:39
Unleavened cat. 
59:40
Excellent. 
59:41
He wasn't up south of me and I went, what happened? 
59:45
And Bud goes, unleavened a bread, you should have walked it up. 
59:50
I think they laughed for years about that. 
59:55
I remember in the 70s, they started doing, this is the Jesus movement years, 60s, 70s. 
01:00:03
And then they started doing, they would call them agape feast or love feast and there's 
01:00:08
another word for it. 
01:00:09
It almost seems like maybe agape, but anyway, then they would, but they didn't do that 
01:00:13
unleavened. 
01:00:14
Their whole point was break the bread and drink. 
01:00:17
So they had big glasses of wine, not this little, not wine, but grape juice. 
01:00:22
Yeah, we always had grape juice, big glasses of wine and then big old loaves of leavened, 
01:00:29
nice rice. 
01:00:30
And then you would tear off a big old piece of nice leavened bread and pass it down. 
01:00:35
That was fun too. 
01:00:36
But that was a good, those were good times because they were trying to get into the real 
01:00:39
spirit of it. 
01:00:40
Yes. 
01:00:41
Well, they were quite shocked at my, my offering for their dinner. 
01:00:46
I love it. 
01:00:47
We got to laugh. 
01:00:48
The Holy spirit, he probably sets you up. 
01:00:52
He couldn't stop me. 
01:00:54
He couldn't stop you because he stops you at other things. 
01:00:57
I'll get the pita bread. 
01:00:58
Okay. 
01:00:59
That is hilarious. 
01:01:00
That is it. 
01:01:01
All right. 
01:01:02
Let's see. 
01:01:03
Where should we go here? 
01:01:05
Okay. 
01:01:06
So let me just jump to a couple of questions here. 
01:01:09
So we've got a few more minutes. 
01:01:11
Let's ask some more questions. 
01:01:12
So he's asking, Psalm 91 verse 11 says, he will command his angels in regard to protect 
01:01:17
you and defend you and guard you in all your ways. 
01:01:21
And then it says in this verse, we, is this verse referring to our guardian angels that 
01:01:26
have been assigned to us or is the host of the commands on our behalf to protect us or 
01:01:31
that we command on our behalf? 
01:01:33
So what's, which angels is he talking? 
01:01:35
What is that talking about? 
01:01:36
Or do you want to guard and protect us in all of our ways? 
01:01:39
Yeah. 
01:01:40
That's what you said. 
01:01:41
Yeah. 
01:01:42
Did he say, does it say he assigned our angels to do that or did he say, well, it says where 
01:01:48
he will command his angels in regard to you to protect and defend and guard you. 
01:01:53
That is probably the host, because otherwise he would have said ours if it was our guardian 
01:01:57
angels. 
01:01:58
Okay. 
01:01:59
He would, they know automatically your angels are waiting for you when the mother's carrying 
01:02:04
you in the womb. 
01:02:06
Your angels are sent from heaven when you are conceived. 
01:02:09
So your angels are waiting on you to be with you your whole life. 
01:02:12
They are the very ones who will take you home to heaven, no matter when that is. 
01:02:16
So they have an assignment, yes, to protect you, to encourage you, to even maybe mention 
01:02:22
things to you. 
01:02:23
And you think it's you like to guide you. 
01:02:26
They kind of guide you a little bit, especially when you're younger. 
01:02:29
Like if you may be going to do something that might be dangerous, your angel may say to 
01:02:32
you, Oh, I wouldn't do that. 
01:02:34
And they think, you know, I shouldn't do that. 
01:02:36
I, I wouldn't, I shouldn't do that. 
01:02:39
And then you'll think, Oh, I'm saying that to myself, I better not do that. 
01:02:42
So they have, uh, they already know what their, where their boundaries are and what they're 
01:02:47
really called to do by God, but if he says his angels, that is the army of heaven. 
01:02:52
Wow. 
01:02:53
Okay. 
01:02:54
Very, very good. 
01:02:55
Uh, okay. 
01:02:56
You've said before that the Lord will walk through the wall. 
01:02:59
I don't know if it's the father or Holy spirit or Jesus. 
01:03:02
You can answer that in a second, but it says, and you're all of them. 
01:03:06
All of them. 
01:03:07
And then it says, when God writes on your wall, is it the same kind of writing that 
01:03:11
he used to, to, uh, to write the 10 commandments or to write or for Daniel? 
01:03:16
I think when they're talking about Daniel, there was a hand that appeared and wrote 
01:03:19
on the wall. 
01:03:20
Is this kind of the same thing? 
01:03:22
Is it different in whatever, that's what they're asking father literally walked into 
01:03:27
the room. 
01:03:28
I believe it was in a hotel room where I was, because you know, I travel and speak a lot 
01:03:33
and every now and then they give me my own room, which I loved having my own room because 
01:03:37
then I have a lot of communication or encounters with him. 
01:03:40
He walked in the room and started speaking to me, I'm going to write the next 50 years 
01:03:44
of your life on the wall. 
01:03:46
Make sure you write it down because it won't remain. 
01:03:50
And so he did write, he said, you're going to, you're going to operate from these platforms 
01:03:54
and only these platforms and he was already started writing on the wall. 
01:03:57
So did you like a one in the line and wrote on there what it was and then two, three. 
01:04:02
So, uh, at that time when he wrote on the wall, because all this time I've been operating 
01:04:06
as revelator, reveal heaven to earth, let people know about heaven, about time, about 
01:04:11
things that happen, things that will happen. 
01:04:14
And then he said, now for these next 50 years, number one will be doing business as CEO of 
01:04:20
heavens. 
01:04:21
He says, heaven's headquarters on earth. 
01:04:23
I'm not making it up people only because we will produce things that represent heaven 
01:04:27
and put it in the marketplace because God's tired of hell stuffing on all the shelves. 
01:04:31
This is what he said. 
01:04:32
And so he's writing all this. 
01:04:34
So number one was business, number two was revelator. 
01:04:37
Number three was arts and entertainment because I will help to produce movies and all kinds 
01:04:43
of different things and the arts that represent heaven on this earth. 
01:04:47
And number four was, of course, number four was, I'm trying to remember four, there were 
01:04:53
five different ones. 
01:04:54
So number four was, uh, I'm trying to think of how I said now, because my mind goes so 
01:04:59
fast that the slow it down with just a second catch up to my spirit. 
01:05:03
Okay. 
01:05:04
It will be about, uh, appointing things for God and, uh, opening up governments. 
01:05:12
And the last one will be news and, um, kind of news and media to number five is news and 
01:05:17
media. 
01:05:18
In other words, we'll have network. 
01:05:19
We'll have a full-on studio. 
01:05:21
We'll, we'll do all kinds of stuff in the studio, but we will have TV channels, network, 
01:05:26
networks that will have TV channels about heaven. 
01:05:29
Some things will be funny. 
01:05:30
Some things will be the weather. 
01:05:31
We'll actually have the weather as part of our, uh, of the, of the news and network thing, 
01:05:36
news and media. 
01:05:39
Number four is, uh, yeah, changing, touching government leaders so that he can shape that 
01:05:46
nation. 
01:05:47
That's the, that's the fourth one. 
01:05:49
So we were doing things, major things with presidents of countries and stuff like that, 
01:05:53
that we will influence them so God can win that country and shape that nation. 
01:05:56
That's number four. 
01:05:57
Number five is the news and media. 
01:05:59
We won't stop doing the weather. 
01:06:02
We'll just do green screen and you can see what's happening as you're speaking to the 
01:06:06
weather to change. 
01:06:07
Oh, wow. 
01:06:08
Oh, that's great. 
01:06:09
I love that. 
01:06:10
When you wrote on that wall and you turned around and said, that is all I'm allowing 
01:06:15
you to operate in. 
01:06:17
Do not let anyone else try to make you or a robber for Billy Graham or anyone else that's 
01:06:22
not who you are. 
01:06:23
You are my revelator and I need you to do these five things. 
01:06:28
This is your platform for the next 50 years 
01:06:31
and after that, I'll show you what's next. 
01:06:34
You know, if you had prayed anywhere in your past 
01:06:39
and you said, Lord, make me the Billy Graham of the 20s, 
01:06:43
2020s and God didn't intend that for you. 
01:06:46
Could you just keep praying and praying 
01:06:48
and praying and praying and he was never gonna do it, right? 
01:06:50
Cause that was never your call. 
01:06:52
Yeah, what you need to say is what do you want me to do? 
01:06:54
Which is what I did say to him and he has said to me before, 
01:06:58
you are not Billy Graham, 
01:06:59
that millions will be won because of the revelations 
01:07:02
I let you give and he also said, you're not oral Roberts, 
01:07:05
but you will raise the dead and millions will be made whole, 
01:07:10
not just healed because of what you're doing for me 
01:07:12
with heaven, it will be automatically happening. 
01:07:16
So isn't that I won't be there and people won't get healed. 
01:07:19
It's the way he wants me to do it. 
01:07:21
However he says to do that, it will happen. 
01:07:24
Yeah, so for instance, I remember, 
01:07:26
especially in the 60s and 70s, 
01:07:28
we would watch Billy, oral Roberts. 
01:07:30
And back in those days, my parents were making fun of him, 
01:07:33
but he was real, he grabbed their hand and he'd shake it, 
01:07:36
and he'd name it Jesus. 
01:07:38
That's not likely that God's gonna tell you 
01:07:40
to grab someone's hand and shake it and yell at it, right? 
01:07:42
Cause that's not who he, how he made you. 
01:07:44
Probably not. 
01:07:45
Cause that's he gets to do what he wants with you. 
01:07:48
You talked about entertainment 
01:07:51
and now there's new people watching it 
01:07:53
that maybe haven't heard your spiel 
01:07:56
about entertainment and heaven and on earth, 
01:07:57
but I grew up thinking, a lot of the times 
01:08:01
that I was probably in trouble if I wanted to do entertainment 
01:08:04
cause that wasn't holy. 
01:08:05
Maybe I would have even thought, I don't really remember, 
01:08:08
but I would have even thought of walking through Disneyland. 
01:08:11
If I was enjoying the music I was walking by 
01:08:13
and I was enjoying it, that if the Lord came, 
01:08:15
maybe he'd be sad because that was the way I grew up. 
01:08:19
Okay, not not that way now, 
01:08:20
but talk about what's okay about entertainment 
01:08:25
as a word, as a principle, 
01:08:26
and obviously there's good and bad. 
01:08:28
So it's okay to have entertainment on the earth. 
01:08:31
It is okay. 
01:08:32
Just don't have any of hell. 
01:08:35
He basically, that's mainly it. 
01:08:38
Cause hell has got so much evil and wickedness, 
01:08:41
extreme violence, profanity, sexuality. 
01:08:44
That is not what God would call entertainment. 
01:08:47
He would call that garbage. 
01:08:49
That is garbage, just polluting your soul 
01:08:51
that is not ever set, will never be seen in heaven 
01:08:54
or done in heaven. 
01:08:56
The movies they have there are exciting, intense, fun, 
01:09:00
wonderful, and a lot of families 
01:09:02
like to do things together in heaven, but it's okay. 
01:09:04
It depends on what is behind it. 
01:09:06
You don't want your life to be filled with witchcraft. 
01:09:08
Witchcraft is not in heaven. 
01:09:10
The Bible says have nothing to do with a necromancer. 
01:09:13
That word means witchcraft. 
01:09:15
So we have nothing to do with witchcraft. 
01:09:18
It's not from God. 
01:09:19
That comes from hell people. 
01:09:21
And so what you mean by your own entertainment, 
01:09:25
would you allow Jesus to sit beside you 
01:09:27
and watch what you watch? 
01:09:29
Or where you go? 
01:09:30
It's very important, especially for this next generation 
01:09:34
to show them, yes, you can have fun. 
01:09:35
You can do exciting things, do stuff together 
01:09:37
and watch things to enjoy, but you cannot go 
01:09:41
or take them into the darkness 
01:09:43
and you should not go into the darkness yourself 
01:09:45
because they'll have a trap for you. 
01:09:48
Yeah. 
01:09:49
Okay, Jen is asking this, 
01:09:52
why does Ephesians say we are adopted 
01:09:56
because we were inside God as His offspring? 
01:09:58
So they're saying, if we are God's offspring, 
01:10:01
why does it say we were adopted? 
01:10:04
And then it mentions Ephesians one fight, 
01:10:05
having predestined us to adoption as sins by Jesus Christ. 
01:10:09
So I guess that's the question she's asking. 
01:10:12
Why do you have to adopt us if we were already His? 
01:10:15
That is you, you have to choose Him people. 
01:10:18
You have to choose Christ on your own. 
01:10:20
It says so in the word. 
01:10:22
Everyone who's born doesn't automatically go there. 
01:10:25
So when you choose to be your own to them, 
01:10:28
that is like you're being adopted into His family, 
01:10:31
Christ's family. 
01:10:32
Okay. 
01:10:33
All right. 
01:10:35
Wendy's asking, why should we fast? 
01:10:37
And what happens, I get this question a lot. 
01:10:40
The second part of it, this is asked a lot. 
01:10:42
What happens when I do this? 
01:10:44
What happens when I speak and tell you? 
01:10:45
What happens when I fast? 
01:10:46
What happens when I pray? 
01:10:47
So Wendy's saying, why should we fast? 
01:10:49
And what happens in the spirit realm when we fast? 
01:10:52
If you can answer that. 
01:10:53
It's a very powerful thing to fast. 
01:10:55
I would not tell you to stop doing that completely ever 
01:10:59
because there are times when God will appoint you to a fast. 
01:11:02
And that fast will be something very specific, 
01:11:04
either something you yourself are seeking from Him. 
01:11:08
I'm not saying you have to fast for 40 days and 49th. 
01:11:11
If God told you to do that, then do that. 
01:11:13
I would say that you can fast maybe like, 
01:11:16
if I do fast, it's like, I don't eat. 
01:11:19
So there's really not food that I fast. 
01:11:21
If I fast, it's things that I enjoy doing 
01:11:24
or things I enjoy wearing. 
01:11:25
Do you feel like sharing those specifics 
01:11:27
or is it too personal? 
01:11:28
You've told me, but what God allows you to eat 
01:11:32
or not eat as a fast? 
01:11:35
Well, yeah, like I've been on a fast now for some time. 
01:11:38
My favorite food groups for a long time was like pizza, 
01:11:41
Dr. Pepper and chocolate ice cream. 
01:11:44
That was my food group people. 
01:11:45
Not just to go out and eat that all the time, 
01:11:47
but that's what I was, I loved it. 
01:11:50
So father came to me and he said, 
01:11:52
until you move into your own home, 
01:11:56
you will fast chocolate ice cream pizza and Dr. Pepper. 
01:12:00
Wow, how many years is that? 
01:12:03
Years. 
01:12:04
Oh man. 
01:12:06
Years, probably nine or 10 by this time. 
01:12:09
But I will tell you what, when we are moving, 
01:12:11
we're going to, I'll have the biggest chocolate ice cream 
01:12:14
pizza and Dr. Pepper party you've ever seen in your life. 
01:12:16
That's what I'll have. 
01:12:19
I still love them, but I will not. 
01:12:22
I will not unless he says, every time I'd speak on a cruise, 
01:12:26
he'd say, you can have an ice cream cone. 
01:12:27
One ice cream cone. 
01:12:29
And normally people come talk to me 
01:12:30
about having it with milk. 
01:12:33
I, you want, you want to eat that ice cream cone 
01:12:38
as soon as I got it. 
01:12:39
Very first cruise I went on a cruise where you were speaking 
01:12:42
and that's the one where we got to know each other 
01:12:44
and you walked by and we were eating ice cream. 
01:12:47
We left a little bit early. 
01:12:48
I remember that and then you said, 
01:12:50
you said God's going to let me have a little bit of ice cream. 
01:12:52
I don't know if you'd got it that night or not 
01:12:54
if you would even remember. 
01:12:55
I think I usually would wait late. 
01:12:58
It would, but I can go past midnight. 
01:13:01
You can't? 
01:13:03
God, when God trained me in anything, 
01:13:06
he was very specific because if he said something to me 
01:13:10
later at one time, it could mean life or death. 
01:13:14
If I did what he asked or not do what he asked. 
01:13:17
Now he knew I was going to, but it doesn't matter. 
01:13:19
He knew already that I would, 
01:13:21
but I had to see myself that I could do that. 
01:13:24
And I live a fasted life, not just with food. 
01:13:28
I still don't walk on the grass in my front yard. 
01:13:31
You can ask anybody here. 
01:13:32
He told me one day, you will not walk on the grass anymore. 
01:13:37
And I don't, on one side of my yard, 
01:13:39
I never walk on that grass. 
01:13:40
Is he just giving you something arbitrary 
01:13:42
to train you to obey and that's kind of it or what? 
01:13:45
I don't think that's for me to see. 
01:13:48
I think that's for others to see that I won't do it. 
01:13:54
It's for others to see you obey even if it sounds odd. 
01:13:57
That's right, crazy. 
01:13:58
Yeah. 
01:13:59
Okay. 
01:14:01
I mean, that's helping a lot of people watch you right now 
01:14:02
because they'll go, oh, that's weird 
01:14:04
because God told me never to wear yellow or something. 
01:14:07
No, he does do that with some people, okay? 
01:14:09
And sometimes it isn't so you know you can do it. 
01:14:12
Others will watch you and let me tell you, 
01:14:14
there's a lot of people here watching me 
01:14:16
and they know everyone will tell you, 
01:14:17
do I walk on the grass outside y'all? 
01:14:19
No. 
01:14:21
No, I do not. 
01:14:22
I will walk on the other side of the driveway, 
01:14:24
but I will not walk, oh, there goes my drink. 
01:14:27
Well, it's okay. 
01:14:28
I drink most of it. 
01:14:29
Anyway, I don't. 
01:14:31
I've literally seen you climb across the seat of the car. 
01:14:36
Because the car was parked too close to the grass. 
01:14:38
Oh, wow. 
01:14:41
I will get in the passenger side 
01:14:43
and crawl across that seat to start that car and go. 
01:14:46
Even if it's the dead of winter, I will still do it. 
01:14:48
And that's what you mean by a fasted life, 
01:14:51
whatever God tells you to fast. 
01:14:53
Yeah. 
01:14:54
You're right. 
01:14:55
Amazing, amazing cat. 
01:14:56
All right, let's see. 
01:14:58
If I post Diane's asking, see we've got a few more minutes 
01:15:01
here, if Diane's asking, if I post some of my hosts 
01:15:05
at my property lines, okay. 
01:15:07
This is funny, but it's actually a good question. 
01:15:09
Will they get, she says, will they get bored? 
01:15:12
Will they get bored? 
01:15:13
I get concerned that they just have to stand there 
01:15:15
all the time. 
01:15:16
I just want to treat my hosts well. 
01:15:18
Well, then you have an assignment to give them 
01:15:21
while they're standing there. 
01:15:22
You'll just say, I post you four. 
01:15:24
Four of you will be sentin' olds on two 
01:15:26
on each side of the driveway. 
01:15:29
You will have to say something like, 
01:15:30
and you will mash, bash, and trash 
01:15:32
every demon that comes by. 
01:15:34
Any demon who's with another piece, a person, 
01:15:38
zip their mouth shut, take away their authority 
01:15:41
that's been given to them, 
01:15:43
pull down every stronghold, shred platform 
01:15:46
you see around you. 
01:15:47
This is your assignments to your hosts. 
01:15:50
Do not allow anything that would be dangerous 
01:15:52
to come into my home. 
01:15:53
Nothing will enter into my home. 
01:15:55
If I cast it out on my home, you will attack, 
01:15:57
I'm talking about spiritual being. 
01:15:59
Yeah. 
01:16:00
I'm talking about people. 
01:16:01
You have to tell them, you know, 
01:16:02
you're standing there, you don't wanna stand there 
01:16:04
and just be bored, okay? 
01:16:06
Wherever it comes in the area of your neighborhood, 
01:16:08
they can go attack it. 
01:16:09
If it's the wicked, evil, spiritual things, 
01:16:12
they can, like I said, you can shred platforms, 
01:16:14
people driving by with demons following them, 
01:16:16
trying to persecute those people. 
01:16:18
They can actually shred those demons, 
01:16:20
come here, not shred them or kill them, 
01:16:21
but they can pull them off of those things, 
01:16:23
of vehicles that come by. 
01:16:25
When I do traffic control, I do traffic control. 
01:16:27
I send those hosts to traffic control for me every day. 
01:16:31
And I say, I take power over all the power of the enemy 
01:16:34
and I command you, host of heaven. 
01:16:36
You will go everywhere I go this day, 
01:16:39
or my family members, or my staff, 
01:16:42
and you will do traffic control for them 
01:16:44
that we know, hold ups, delays, 
01:16:46
breakdowns, actions, or acts of any kind, 
01:16:50
at any time, go host, make toast. 
01:16:54
And while you're out there, 
01:16:55
you will go into every car and speak to those people 
01:16:58
and say, I need to know Jesus. 
01:16:59
You will rip off any of the evil wicked ones, 
01:17:03
trying to work around them, 
01:17:05
shut the mouths of the demons who are with them, 
01:17:06
that they can't talk to them in that car. 
01:17:08
You'll pull down strongholds off of any buildings, 
01:17:11
shred platforms, you can't go in those cars. 
01:17:14
You can do that. 
01:17:15
I didn't know you had them. 
01:17:17
So that really is a good question. 
01:17:19
So you can give them a great deal more to do 
01:17:21
while they're out and about for you. 
01:17:23
Yes, absolutely. 
01:17:24
I send them into every place before I go in the door, 
01:17:28
whether it's a store, a restaurant, or a building. 
01:17:31
I send the host in there first to pull down every stronghold, 
01:17:33
shut the mouth of every demon, 
01:17:35
mash, fashion, trash, demons who are in there 
01:17:38
to cause trouble for me or for people, 
01:17:41
throw them in a dry place. 
01:17:43
And then I will go in there and say, 
01:17:44
I released the presence of God in this building. 
01:17:49
And then if it's a restaurant, I'll do all that. 
01:17:52
And I'll say, now I'll have a great atmosphere, 
01:17:54
great service, and great food in Jesus' name, amen. 
01:17:58
Really, really good. 
01:17:59
Really good. 
01:18:00
It's not one place I eat or walk into or shop in 
01:18:03
that I do not do that. 
01:18:05
And if you're walking in a place, 
01:18:07
someone suddenly decides to, 
01:18:09
whether you're out and about with a conference or something 
01:18:12
and they take you to, 
01:18:13
and you decide to go in and eat with them, 
01:18:15
but you don't eat then. 
01:18:16
I know you eat at night, right? 
01:18:18
But you go out. 
01:18:19
I go out to work with them. 
01:18:21
As you're walking, yeah, as you're walking in 
01:18:24
and you didn't know you were going to be this restaurant 
01:18:26
until a second before they stop here. 
01:18:29
Do you, is that when you under your breath, 
01:18:31
say these things or you took care of her? 
01:18:32
I don't say it under my breath, Steve. 
01:18:35
Okay, oh, you don't, okay. 
01:18:37
When you rule, you don't whisper things. 
01:18:40
I hear you. 
01:18:43
So if you're not new about people, 
01:18:44
you aren't ruling because you have every right to do that. 
01:18:47
You don't have to put up with a devil where you are. 
01:18:49
You don't have to check into a hotel. 
01:18:51
They shred it by the clerks because they hate Jesus. 
01:18:54
You can stop that. 
01:18:55
Sometimes it'll start a conversation with people too 
01:18:58
because they're like, what are you saying? 
01:18:59
Yeah, I'll start conversations. 
01:19:00
And if I'm ever in a group, in a restaurant, 
01:19:03
and they say, would you bless the food? 
01:19:06
Oh, well. 
01:19:07
I will bless my plate. 
01:19:08
And I'll say, Father, look at this food. 
01:19:11
Doesn't it look good? 
01:19:12
I'm going to enjoy every single bite. 
01:19:14
Bless this food for our bodies. 
01:19:16
And may bless this food for our bodies in Jesus' name. 
01:19:21
May the Isis have a never-ending crisis. 
01:19:23
May hell have the worst day they've ever had. 
01:19:26
And may the hosts make toast of anything around here. 
01:19:30
Amen. 
01:19:33
I don't care who's sitting in that group. 
01:19:35
I'm not embarrassed about Jesus Christ. 
01:19:38
I'm not embarrassed about who I am. 
01:19:40
You know what? 
01:19:41
Every devil will run out of that place. 
01:19:42
That's what happens. 
01:19:43
They don't want to be anywhere near you 
01:19:45
because you are ruling in that moment 
01:19:47
using the name of Jesus, the authority Jesus gave you. 
01:19:50
I give you power over all the power of the enemy, people. 
01:19:54
Are you using it? 
01:19:57
So good, yeah. 
01:19:58
When you get to get on the school bus, 
01:20:00
go host down that school bus. 
01:20:02
I sent two of them with my child. 
01:20:03
They will shred bash and trash every demon on that bus. 
01:20:06
No matter who they're with, 
01:20:07
they'll throw them in a dry place. 
01:20:08
Every platform they pass by, they will shred it. 
01:20:11
They'll give my child favor with the bus driver, 
01:20:13
favor with all the people on that bus 
01:20:16
and protect them all the way there. 
01:20:17
Whether they're in school, 
01:20:18
they'll kick out every demon around there. 
01:20:19
They'll stop every attack against them in Jesus name. 
01:20:22
Go host, make toast. 
01:20:23
That's how you send your kid to school. 
01:20:26
Wow. 
01:20:27
Wow, Kat. 
01:20:28
You helped a lot of people today in all of this. 
01:20:30
Thank you so, so, so much. 
01:20:32
Kat, I'm talking- 
01:20:32
If you have a right, you have a right to do that. 
01:20:36
Totally. 
01:20:37
Well, you know, Darian and I will have said many, many times 
01:20:40
we were changed people for the 10 years 
01:20:42
we've gotten to know you 
01:20:43
because we're always asking you more of this 
01:20:45
and we're always learning and we're always trained. 
01:20:47
You know, obviously you're not the only one 
01:20:49
we learn from all of the speakers we bring in, 
01:20:51
but I think we have said, 
01:20:54
if I had to pick the one that we've learned the most from 
01:20:56
it's really Kat Kerr because, you know, 
01:20:58
you talk about living a holy life, 
01:21:00
you talk about sending the host, 
01:21:01
you talk about living a holy life, 
01:21:03
you talk about entertainment, 
01:21:05
you talk about living a holy life, 
01:21:06
you know, and that holy life thing is very important. 
01:21:09
Does it not say in the word, 
01:21:12
our father who is in heaven, 
01:21:15
holy is your name. 
01:21:17
Yeah. 
01:21:18
Your kingdom come, 
01:21:21
you will be done on this earth just like it is in heaven. 
01:21:26
It's called heaven culture. 
01:21:28
And that's what I just explained to you. 
01:21:29
That is living heaven culture. 
01:21:32
What I just showed you, 
01:21:34
that's heaven culture in my life. 
01:21:36
And then I walk in the spirit very easily 
01:21:40
because I'm not allowing the enemy anywhere near me. 
01:21:43
He has not got control of my life, 
01:21:45
my future, my destiny. 
01:21:47
And I am not tolerating him, 
01:21:49
nor am I participating with him. 
01:21:51
And I'm certainly not advertising him. 
01:21:56
So good. 
01:21:56
So good, Kat. 
01:21:58
Kat, well, tell the people real quickly, 
01:22:00
because you talked about your book at the beginning, 
01:22:01
talk about your book where to get those, 
01:22:03
and you got two websites. 
01:22:04
If you'll go ahead and tell us those. 
01:22:06
Yeah, there is revealingheaven.com, 
01:22:08
which is the name of my book. 
01:22:11
And I always enjoy, 
01:22:13
you know, if I stay in a hotel, 
01:22:14
I usually give one to the person 
01:22:16
who's gonna clean my room with money in it, of course. 
01:22:19
I get to talk a lot in the hotels. 
01:22:21
People wanna know why my hair is pink, 
01:22:22
and I just start sharing, 
01:22:24
and I say, well, you know what? 
01:22:25
If you Google the word heaven, 
01:22:27
you'll see over 400 hours of me on YouTube 
01:22:30
talking about it. 
01:22:31
Cause that, when they'll go back there, 
01:22:33
and then the next time they'll say to me, 
01:22:34
they went, oh my gosh, this stuff is amazing. 
01:22:37
So revealingheaven.com is my main website. 
01:22:39
That was the first one we had, 
01:22:41
and it does have our products on there 
01:22:44
about heaven that reveal heaven to the earth. 
01:22:47
It has, I think it has some interviews on there, 
01:22:50
a few interviews, it has some testimonies, 
01:22:52
but it's where you go mainly to buy our products 
01:22:54
to find out our events. 
01:22:56
And then there's catcur.com, 
01:22:59
and it is the only place online in the world 
01:23:04
that you can give to me online if you want to. 
01:23:06
It's catcur.com is a spiritual platform. 
01:23:09
The father had me create. 
01:23:10
So whatever he felt like saying, 
01:23:13
he would be allowed to say it. 
01:23:15
And I'm quite sure one day we'll be streaming from that. 
01:23:18
Probably be one thing we'll be setting up this next year 
01:23:21
that we can stream stuff from there. 
01:23:23
But catcur.com is where you can give on that site. 
01:23:27
You can get, there's a photo gallery 
01:23:29
that shows you things in the spirit, 
01:23:31
show you things in the supernatural. 
01:23:33
And some of those, I think you can even download 
01:23:35
some of those images. 
01:23:36
There is definitely testimony down there. 
01:23:38
There's all kinds of videos with people, 
01:23:40
well-known people who interviewed me, 
01:23:42
but we are now about to start probably this next year. 
01:23:46
We'll redo that website. 
01:23:47
I think we've been working on revealing heaven 
01:23:50
to make it more navigable, I guess. 
01:23:53
Navigate around it better than it has, 
01:23:55
but our studio is gonna be, 
01:23:57
we'll have a studio built that'll be state-of-the-art studio 
01:24:00
and also all kinds of other things we'll be doing. 
01:24:03
But I really, truly love people. 
01:24:07
It's just in me, since I've got to know the father 
01:24:10
and his love and his son's love, 
01:24:13
but Christ made sure that when they called me to do this, 
01:24:16
that I would know how to teach people 
01:24:18
how to war against hell and win. 
01:24:22
I'm so good. 
01:24:23
Kate, would you pray for the people? 
01:24:25
Bless them as we go out. 
01:24:26
I appreciate that. 
01:24:27
Father, I just right now, 
01:24:28
I bless the people watching, Father. 
01:24:31
I impart your life, your love, your presence, 
01:24:35
your will, your way, your goodness, your joy, 
01:24:41
your celebration, your expectation of what's coming. 
01:24:45
Victory is coming because it is ours. 
01:24:48
Justice is coming because it's God's plans. 
01:24:51
I thank you, Father, for blessing everybody watching. 
01:24:53
I send your healing. 
01:24:54
Power, Jesus Christ, to crush the plans of the enemy, 
01:24:59
whether it's spiritual, physical, mental or emotional, 
01:25:04
Christ is the watcher of your soul in Jesus' name. 
01:25:08
Lose anything wicked or evil, 
01:25:10
but bind the love and the joy of the Lord 
01:25:13
in his presence and his plans for your life to your soul. 
01:25:18
That's the keys to the kingdom. 
01:25:20
And may you go with the host 
01:25:23
and crush the plans of hell and bless heaven in Jesus' name. 
01:25:28
Amen. 
01:25:29
Amen, amen. 
01:25:31
Cat, we love you. 
01:25:32
You have our love to your staff. 
01:25:33
They're all around you there. 
01:25:34
I appreciate it. 
01:25:35
Hey, quick reminder, Chris Reed will be with us tomorrow. 
01:25:38
Same time. 
01:25:39
Yeah, it's Chris Reed tomorrow. 
01:25:40
And then I always get to do this, the others, 
01:25:43
but I forgot to get to that. 
01:25:45
So God bless you all. 
01:25:46
Have an amazing day, Cat. 
01:25:47
Love to you and yours. 
01:25:48
Bye. 
01:25:49
See you all later. 
01:25:50
See you tomorrow. 
01:25:51
Bye. 
01:25:52
Bye-bye. 
01:25:53
Thank you. 
01:25:54
Bye-bye. 
01:25:55
And now cheese and your love to your King. 
01:25:58
We know that your King is like heaven. 
01:26:16
Alright. 
01:26:17
Let's go. 
01:26:18
Let's go, bro, appreciate it.

01:00
Well, welcome to Elijah's Streams. It is Wednesday, February 1, but we are recording this the
01:20
day before, so I'm recording this in the clock behind us. We'll say Tuesday, January 31,
01:24
but you will see this in the morrow on Wednesday, so we're very excited to bring you Kat again today.
01:30
She has a shorter schedule because they're in the middle of a move, so we're going to do 35
01:34
minutes and fast and furious and we'll have a good time. I had to hook myself up today and
01:39
all the things are dragging in. Anyway, hope the dog doesn't bark because I didn't take care of
01:44
that ahead of time, so we'll see how this goes. So pretty short show, but we'll enjoy every minute
01:50
of it, so we're not going to run any spots or any other announcements. Tomorrow, by the way,
01:53
is Robin Bullock, so don't miss that. So you're hearing this on Wednesday, so Thursday will be
01:58
Robin Bullock. So all right, without further delay, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go.
02:04
Hi, Kat. So you're in the middle of a move this week, huh?
02:24
Yes, and we are so excited. I'm really excited.
02:29
Awesome. Well, it's good to see you. We've got questions. We were going to jump right into
02:33
questions today. Anything you wanted to say before we do that?
02:37
I just want to say how much I love everybody and thank you for all the prayers you've given us over
02:43
the years and even for this move, which sometimes seems almost impossible. Here we are moving tonight
02:52
and tomorrow night. So we seriously are moving and we are all very excited. You know, it's a
02:59
beautiful place. We know people there. We're going to meet a lot more people. I know God's
03:03
going to be there too, of course. And so, yeah, we're trying to use our time as wisely as we can
03:11
and our staff is actually going to come tomorrow to help. They have been bugging us forever.
03:16
Please, let us help. Let us help. Yeah, we've got to take that, man. It's more talking than moving,
03:21
but we're all very excited about how God has blessed us. So, yeah. And I feel that you're
03:28
paying on the moving too. You know, you can have fun with friends and everything, but man,
03:35
every time I've ever moved, we moved about something like 17 times in our married life.
03:40
It's crazy. Wow. One time a year for the first half of the year. And then this place we've been
03:45
at for 23 years now. Yeah. Yeah, so amazing. Well, listen, Kat, so you're pretty excited
03:53
about the future still. Are you optimistic about how things are going? I am optimistic about
03:59
everything God has said or told me and still intend to do. So, absolutely, yes, we all are.
04:05
We're all very optimistic. By the way, once again, not intentionally, but we wore them. You got your
04:10
teal on your hat and I got my teal on my tie and you're... Yeah. And that is heaven's color,
04:16
you said, or heaven's favorite color. So, if I'm saying that right. Okay, so Kat, let me just jump
04:22
in and ask you one question that I may have asked you a variant of this from time to time, but
04:27
when people go to heaven, they've died and now they've graduated to heaven and you've said
04:34
people, when they get to heaven, don't start comparing, don't say, how did you die? No,
04:37
how did you die? They don't do that. But do... Would someone show up? Let's say they meet their parents
04:44
and their parents are young like they are. They're everybody's in their 20s and 30s, I guess, looking
04:48
at them. Does that... When they sit down and have coffee or whatever it is you do in heaven,
04:54
do the parents say, well, tell me what happened last time we were there, you didn't even know the
04:59
Lord, what happened? Do they tell that kind of story? And some say... Sometimes they do,
05:04
if something's really on their heart, sure. And nobody minds at all if they ask some questions
05:10
like that. I would have thought, you know, in my P-brain, I would have thought that that would
05:16
be almost a sure thing that everybody would want to hear that story. But you... It sounds a little
05:21
bit like it's more of an exception to the rule. Well, they actually hold meetings already when
05:26
they come. Every time somebody comes new from earth, they always have huge events and everybody
05:32
wants to come so they can hear what's been going on. Oh, okay. It's not gonna be any really good news,
05:37
anything that's changed or maybe major things have happened that they would want to know about.
05:42
That's an automatic, that part is automatic. So everybody will attend me somewhere. And then
05:49
that person will be invited over and over and over again to visit people, speak places.
05:54
And so, yeah, it's very exciting. Okay, very cool. So let's see, I wanted to go with this one.
06:02
This one was... I've had this... Somehow I came across my desk I've had since December.
06:06
It says, okay, I love Kat. I purchased and read her wonderful books. I find them very encouraging.
06:14
I would like to ask her this question. The Bible says, when you try to approach the throne of God
06:19
or God himself, you become very, very fearful. I have not heard Kat talking about the reverential
06:26
fear of the, fear the Bible speaks of when it went in the presence of the great and almighty God.
06:33
So I guess they're asking once you go to be with the Lord or once you visit heaven. I'm not quite
06:40
sure where the reverential fear is that she's wanting to address. What would you say about that?
06:48
I think it would probably depend on what was going on in its own home at the time. Of course,
06:54
I've always, always had such holy reverence and love for the Father, for the Son, for the Holy Spirit
07:02
that never changes. You never, ever get familiar with all that and not any of it. It's just
07:09
overwhelming sometimes, the peace and the love that you experience when you're there.
07:14
And of course, when I go many times, I'm like eight. Yeah, that's what you said.
07:19
Not all viewpoint would be entirely different than most people who are already adults.
07:26
So I think about what kind of fun will I have? Where will we take me? What will we do?
07:30
I love him so much. I'm so excited to be here. So that would be the way that I would look
07:36
at things and he wants me to. He wants me to see him that way. And there's other people who feel
07:42
that way also. Well, yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. But you talked about how
07:50
you've gone as an eight year old and that you usually go as an eight year old. So God sees you
07:56
and you interact, I guess, as an eight year old. And you have said many times that heaven is like
08:02
50 percent worship, serious worshiping the Lord and 50 percent fun. Am I quoting you right? Is that about right?
08:09
I would have to say yes. And he even says sometimes it's 50 percent fun. I'd have to make it fun. You come
08:16
like a child. It makes sense. And so if you tell a story about this, I saw this or I saw that. And
08:27
it makes the children or you at eight years old, when you go, giggle and laugh to see something
08:34
funny, that's something that's in the heart of God to provide. Giggles and laughter and even goofiness
08:42
when you're having fun, right? Yeah, you know, most everyone who comes says you must come like a
08:48
child, right? And he wants us to feel that, you know, you're really all that innocent and excited
08:57
and you know, you're going to have a good time. I mean, he is our father. That's who he is. That
09:01
doesn't take anything away from his sovereignty, you know, his holiness, his power, the life he
09:07
gives people. It doesn't change that. It's just that from my perspective and the way he's always
09:13
taught me, he taught me as his daughter, he taught me as a child. So I see from their perspective.
09:19
Okay, okay, cool. All right, Isaac is age 15. And he's asking this, are the world's wonders in heaven?
09:27
For example, the hanging guards of Babylon, the Colosseum and so on, because we think of the seven
09:32
wonders of the world, he's like, no, are those wonders in heaven? There are wonders, it says
09:40
of course, those wonders in heaven. But I think it is the famous ones that we know, like, no, not
09:47
those. Okay, not those. It would be like, you know, like the Valley of the Valley of the Falls
09:54
would be definitely one the throne room, of course, absolutely the streets of gold, his rainbow. I
10:01
mean, there's so many different things you would want to see the crystal sea, where you can swim
10:06
under the water and breathe and talk and meet all the creatures there. So of course, they do actually
10:11
have their list on quite sure of amazing places. Oh, yeah, the city is there. So there's so many
10:20
things to do, see and learn about people have their favorites once they've been there for a while.
10:24
So I would say, yes, it is sort of like, maybe more than eight. Yeah, well, you know, all right. And
10:31
so if someone said, well, I will always hope that I never could go to see the Grand Canyon, I hope
10:36
that I could see it in heaven. It's not like God needs to give you the Grand Canyon, he's got the
10:41
grand everything. He absolutely has the grand, the grand of everything, you're right. So it's not
10:49
like you missed that anymore. Won't you see what he's got there? Yeah, so good. Okay. Pam is asking
10:55
this, can't you taught us that our level of spiritual authority grows as we mature in Christ?
11:01
Can you tell us what a brand new Christians authority looks like? I don't, I guess,
11:07
I have to interpret what she means. What does it look like? What, what would you say
11:11
a brand new Christians authority like? I think maybe she's asking the moment you're saved and
11:16
you're brand new. Do you walk out and possess certain authority that you didn't have? Or
11:21
what does it look like if you're brand new? I think that no one can really maybe even think
11:28
about that ahead of time. I think you are so undone by the glory that, you know, the glory we create
11:35
for him, the splendors and the wonders that are there. You're so overwhelmed by his goodness
11:42
that he gives us. But I'm brand new believer especially. They're overwhelmed really at what
11:50
has been given to what Christ actually did give you, what you can operate in, how to do that,
11:55
and what difference it would make here in the earth if everybody did. So yeah, there's a lot of
12:00
things that there's so many things that we could talk about and discuss, but always those feelings
12:06
of a new believer realize what has been paid for for them and what it's like to operate.
12:14
There's like nothing is, you know, I don't think as much as I've been excited in all the years
12:20
afterwards, I think the cream of the crop was the first week days and weeks after I encountered God
12:26
and everything. It's hard to find that level of first love very many times. Don't get me wrong.
12:32
I seek it and I do discover major encounters, but you're overwhelmed by that love. Absolutely yes.
12:40
Yeah. I mean the Old Testament when I had the encounter with God 81,
12:45
even the Old Testament screamed grace, grace, grace. I read it and I said,
12:48
there's grace all over this thing and I had only seen bad news and that's them.
12:53
All right. So Jan is asking this, when people first get to meet Jesus in heaven, what is the
12:59
first most common response? Is it a joyful celebration kind of moment or a holy worship
13:05
kind of moment? So what is that? I mean, yeah, so like, go ahead. Yeah, I think most of the time
13:11
it's probably more of a holy thing. You are so undone knowing you're meeting actually the risen
13:19
Savior, the one who gave everything for you. So I have seen most of the people probably would have
13:25
that holy reverential thing that we talked about. Yeah. Unless you're a kid, then you're going to be
13:30
like, yeah, besides yourself excited. Yeah. Well, you know, I, when I picture it for myself, I think,
13:39
I think I'd fall on my knees or I would be, I would feel like falling and I feel like tears
13:45
would come, but they would be tears of absolute unbelievable joy that we made it and he did
13:51
this for me. And are there tears of joy? You know, there are tears of joy. I don't people think you
13:57
never cry again in heaven. At the end of the Bible, it says every tear will be wiped away. You know,
14:03
the former things, you know, more. That's the end of everything when it says, you don't cry,
14:08
but crying for joy, excitement, gratefulness. Yeah, that's, it's a wonderful feeling anyway.
14:16
And you absolutely love it. So yes, people still do that. Cool. Very cool. All right. Reggie's
14:23
asking this, will teams of people work together or collaborate together to create things in heaven
14:29
or on the new earth, like in these say, it's like groups work together on earth now to create or
14:36
will, but we only create individually using our individual gifts and talents. So I guess he's
14:40
likes doing things together as a group. And will we collaborate and do things together? That's
14:45
the answer. We do collaborate and do things together. Of course we do. And you do learn how
14:51
to create, not people, but there's creation lab where you think that's for in heaven. Okay.
14:56
All kinds of things, places that we can make for each other, not talking about like our
15:02
mansions or anything like that, but there we all have a creative ability because of who they are
15:08
and so absolutely people get excited. Yes. And actually people say, well, what do people do?
15:15
There's nothing to do there. You don't have a job or you create stuff. You hold events everywhere
15:22
and everybody wants to be a part of your event. So yes, those things do happen a lot.
15:28
That's good. Good. Okay. I have so many rabbit trails that I want to go to, but I'm going to jump
15:35
to the next question. Elizabeth asks, how do I know if my child goes to heaven? If my child goes
15:41
to heaven in her sleep, I asked this because she has a dear friend and recently that recently moved
15:48
to heaven twice this week. She said she had a dream about them playing together and running.
15:54
I'm not sure if I understand the question. How do I know if my child goes to heaven in her sleep?
16:00
I asked this because she has a dear friend. Oh, she's saying when my child is sleeping,
16:05
did she go to heaven and visit? That's what she's asking. That is a great possibility. Sure. Yeah,
16:10
he takes people while they're sleeping. Okay. So they may, they say, Mom, I had this dream and I
16:16
was playing. Yeah, my green kids have actually had that happen to them quite often. Okay. And
16:22
those five places in heaven, like when they were four years old and they went, they didn't even
16:28
know those places were there. But I mean, they have been that they ride, they rode, I think I
16:32
mentioned before, you would ride lava out of a volcano. Yeah. My grandfather, my dad. Yeah,
16:38
there are some of those giggles, by the way. I love the giggles. Giggles of God. Someone needs to
16:42
write that book because we serve a happy, joyful, funny. By the way, of all the three, Father,
16:52
Son and Holy Spirit. Who's funniest if you could, if you, who's clever with their wit if you, if you
16:59
had. I would have to say there's either Holy Spirit, probably or Jesus. I think Jesus definitely has
17:04
the wit. I think they call Holy, well, I know they call Holy Spirit the drama king. Yeah.
17:10
Right there. He loves a good joke. He really does. He loves like all kinds of drama and exciting
17:19
things going on up there. So I would have to say probably more of those. The father is definitely
17:24
for love. Yeah. Just dad, father, you know, I think Kim Robinson has had multiple trips together.
17:30
She calls him daddy, God. You've had, I'm not asking you to say the names, your private names
17:35
for God, but God has given you different names that you call him. Is that right? Yes, he had.
17:40
That's a real interesting thing. And I've known several others that were like that. They say I've
17:44
called them such and such and it would be something I'd never heard. But God gave, I don't know,
17:49
maybe he gives different people the same ones, but that's pretty special. All right.
17:55
He's just asking, how do you pray when asking God to relocate? How do you pinpoint where God
18:03
wants you? I guess that means to move. I do not want to move to a place out of his will. So he's
18:07
saying, she's saying, how do you pray when you're asking God to relocate you? I mean, I guess you,
18:14
you want to tell him, I guess you want to ask, okay, I don't even know how to interpret that
18:19
more than the question. So yeah. So what's your thoughts on that?
18:26
So I think she wants to move, but she doesn't want to move to the wrong place because God
18:31
didn't tell her to do or something like that. She's, she's going, you know, how do I pray?
18:36
I would say, you know, you want his will done more than anything else and asked him to please
18:41
give him permission to let you know. It's a good way to do that. You get, you get him permission
18:46
to let you know if it's not the place he wants or maybe something different like that. I think
18:51
most of the time, if it's, if it's about him and you've heard him maybe say things like that in
18:58
his will towards you, I think people are so centered on pleasing him and making sure they
19:04
don't step out of what he wants. So they don't mess up their life. I don't think he'd let them mess
19:08
their life up if maybe they did choose something differently, but, but telling him that certainly
19:14
is going to help you stay focused. And for the people that, that are not seers and they don't
19:20
see all the things in the spirit like you do. I mean, can they say, Lord, I think you're telling
19:25
me to go here, but if I'm wrong, would you close the door before I absolutely ask you to do that.
19:32
You absolutely could do that. It's a good idea. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. All right. Shonda,
19:37
Shonda, I must be Shonda. How do you release the anointing when you're on a telephone call?
19:42
How would you do it if they, if they call you and you want to release the anointing? I'm sure
19:47
she's meeting on the other person on the other end. So yeah, I would just hold my phone and I
19:52
would just say it, or I would do it before I call them or he knew that I was going to call their
19:57
number. I would say I released this, the anointing into this phone call when they pick it up, it'll
20:02
go right into them. Okay. Okay. All right. Jill, let's see. This is partially cut off. Let me make
20:09
sure I can read the whole thing. Okay. Jill says, as a seer, when I'm in church, I often see huge
20:16
angels that stand between the first front, front seats and rows in front of the podium where the
20:25
pastor preaches. It is always in the same position no matter what church. The angel is so big that
20:30
his head is outside the roof. I didn't, I didn't notice an angel where we were going to church
20:35
now until the last couple of weeks. Can you speak of what you know about those angels? I guess she's
20:42
wanted to know if, if that's identifiable or something you've seen? I've seen angels 2,000 feet
20:48
high, probably even higher than that in heaven. So just to what every side imagine is there.
20:54
And I don't know that typically it's certain, you know, a tribe of angels or something like that.
21:01
I just know that they do have many different sizes of angels. Do you, this is never a question
21:08
that has never been popped to my head, but if you've seen 2,000 foot angels and you've seen
21:12
angels that are probably roughly your size. Yes. So are massively tall angels by definition
21:20
massively more powerful? Is that what the big means or what would you say? Possibly, but
21:26
maybe possibly not. It's just that God loved making different types of angels or the hosts
21:32
and he practiced well at doing that. Okay. Cool. All right. Cheryl is asking this question.
21:42
She goes, I've heard you speak about how our loved ones in heaven can go to a portal on special
21:46
days for us and sing happy birthday. For example, is the reverse true? My husband went to heaven
21:52
less than two years ago. Can I sing happy birthday to him on his special day and have him hear me
21:58
singing it? I'm sure that you could. I know that I have sung different things like to my father,
22:07
like on Father's Day or something like that. I know that sounds odd, but I do really love my
22:12
dad and a great relationship with him. And yes, and I know for a fact that Father has said you
22:17
can sing what you'd like to them and he'll make sure they hear it. Yeah. Now I've said,
22:23
this is maybe years past, but I've, you know, before I heard that you maybe can speak directly
22:28
in there. They hear it in the spirit realm or something. However, but I've said, Lord, would
22:34
you give my dad this message to tell him like, and I've said, like one time I said, tell my dad,
22:39
I forgive him for those things. I don't even know that if that's appropriate thing because he's in
22:44
bliss. Why would he need to hear that? But that's, that would be my question. What kind of things
22:51
can you send as a messenger or ask God to set an angel and tell your dad, you know, can you say
22:56
something like that? Tell him I forgive him. You mean on earth or in heaven? No, I'm saying,
23:03
you know, he's in heaven now and you know that when he left, he left a mess like that was the case
23:09
with my dad. And if I would have said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I mean,
23:15
that was years past, but what do you think about that? You just say, no, no, don't go there because
23:20
he's already happy. He doesn't need that. I think that I don't think I would mind you saying that
23:27
and all of somebody. I think it would be all right to say that. Even though they wouldn't still have to hear it. Yeah,
23:34
because they already, yeah, I hear you. It's not like his soul needs to be unburdened for what he
23:42
did. So it's just words of love, I think. Yeah. Okay. Dolores is asking this, do regular common
23:50
people from different generations mingle with one another? For example, would an auto executive that
23:56
went to heaven in 2022 mingle with the poor widow from Elijah's days, would they have things of
24:02
interest to talk to? I think anyone who you would meet there would have, there's almost everybody's
24:11
going to have something that they would love to talk to about you to you or with you. And you would
24:17
find it very fascinating. So people still love to have conversations. They like to reason together,
24:22
talk together. They love to share things. I mean, that never stops happening. Not here on earth or
24:27
in heaven. Well, and then is there the sense that throughout eternity or as long as you're on heaven,
24:34
one day, it's everyone's going to be on new earth. But as long as you're in heaven,
24:39
are people making new friends all the time? Or do they kind of establish their friendship
24:44
thing and their friends hang? Oh, they make new friendships all the time, no matter where they
24:50
go. They do. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, Tracy. Oh, this, this does occur to me to ask this question
25:00
because you've talked because we said a minute ago about the portals in heaven. And you know,
25:04
your loved ones can look down on special occasions. Can't with that being possible,
25:10
could someone, this is probably a dorky question, but because someone say, hey,
25:15
they should do her girlfriend from earth and now they're all both in heaven together. And he says,
25:19
come on to the portal. I want to, it's my daughter's birthday. I want to say, I want to see them and
25:24
come and see where my daughter, what my daughter's up to. Could they do something like that? Or is
25:29
it only for personal family? You know what I mean? I think a lot is for family, but I think you could,
25:37
there's people who would push doing anything or talking about anything to anybody if they could
25:42
there. So yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of these questions are questions that you don't, it's not
25:48
like you walk around knowing the answers to all these deep questions, but yeah. Yeah. Okay.
25:57
Tracy's asking this, I'm a worship dancer. Can you elaborate a little more on what
26:02
happens when we minister and dance? And this seems like it's a common question. People want to know
26:07
when I do this on earth, what's it, what's happening? What is it accomplishing is, I think, is what
26:16
she's saying. What happens when I dance? I mean, that could go a bunch of directions. What is the
26:21
Lord doing? What's happening in the spirit realm? I mean, is, would you have any thoughts? Because
26:26
you're a seer. Do you see people dance and then see things happening because of it?
26:30
I see a lot of mostly music. Of course, I do see some dance. And sometimes you dance, you're not
26:38
even on the floor, like in the throne room, they have a lot of dance and pageantry and stuff in
26:43
there going on. It's absolutely beautiful. And of course, there's ways that you collect things
26:50
as you dance. And then it's represented in some other way in heaven, like you create artwork or
26:56
paintings by your dance. Even though it is with dance, not with your paintings, it's just something
27:02
that's created as something to remember that about. Okay. And back for those that are dancing on earth,
27:11
when you've seen people with the pageantry that God loves on the earth and they're waving their
27:15
flags and they're dancing, does it affect the angels around them when they do that? Is something
27:23
being triggered in a good way when they dance? And I think that's what she's trying to get at.
27:29
Do angels respond? Does our blessings drop down that we don't see? What is the dance
27:36
accomplished? Or is it just dance? I know dance is considered a high praise. It even says that it's
27:43
in the Bible. And so yes, even some of the hosts are absolutely amazed and really love the warfare
27:53
that takes place as a dancer. When you dance, like in the spirit about things, so that is definitely
28:00
something that takes place. And all three of my daughters are dancers. They would have to be
28:04
wore in dance in the spirit for people to be healed, for messages to be sent to be received.
28:10
And so I would definitely know whether it's dance, whether it's music. A lot of things are created
28:16
in the spirit. Okay, awesome. Sarah is asking this, are there, you've seen gemstones in heaven,
28:25
and I think I've heard you talk about the crystal sea and stuff. She says, is there gemstone art
28:31
in heaven that resembles stained glass? Have you seen? Absolutely, yes. A lot of people have
28:37
those in their home there. Really? Especially if people were artisans in that. My grandfather
28:45
made stained glass wonders. Okay. He's got some he's made in heaven. Wow, very cool. And I mean,
28:53
you know, it makes me wonder, because you said that guy will put favorite pictures of yours
28:59
that are on earth, or you'll show up at your mansion and there it's hanging. And I'm curious if
29:03
God would do the same thing. Not that you would know the answer to this, but that if you if someone
29:08
made stained glass on earth, they show up and God said, this is one that you made. I really,
29:12
especially loved, I kept it. And here's it. That was that sound like something he might do just
29:17
because that's who he is. I think he probably would. If people gave him any high gifts, he's
29:24
going to love him anyway. Yeah. And even he has some favorite things that he likes, anything
29:29
he may with life with colors, things like that. Whether you're young or not young, he loves people
29:35
when they give him gifts. Cool. All right. Let me see. We're five minutes out here. We got time
29:42
for a few more questions here. George is asking, when some people are dying, they reach out or
29:47
call for their family members who have died before them. They act as though their family members are
29:52
right there in the room with them. Do you know, do they really see their loved ones and do they
29:58
come? I guess they're asking, do their loved ones come to help with their transition to heaven?
30:03
Can you share about that? I mean, I have no idea. I think sometimes they do. I do know for a fact
30:08
that some people have seen their family members, like maybe within a week of passing or something.
30:14
I think it's something that God just does to encourage people. And so I just know that it does
30:19
happen. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Rachel's saying, when we are reunited with our loved ones that are
30:28
already in heaven, to them, will it feel like it's been a long time since they've seen this? Or will
30:33
it only feel like seconds or days since they've seen us? I think it's just seconds. Really? Oh,
30:44
yeah. They don't miss someone being gone 30 years or something like that. All they can think about
30:48
is can't wait to see them again when they see them. And so for them, you've only been gone for a short
30:53
time. Okay. Wow. Okay. And Andrew's asking, when and why were the host, Michael's army created,
31:06
was it after Satan's treason, specifically to deal with him or was it actually before
31:11
Satan's treason? In other words, you've made it very clear that the only reason there's an army
31:16
is not to protect heaven. God doesn't need an army to protect heaven. So when do you know when
31:23
the army was created? Was it after the fall of Satan? I think the army was been around a very
31:31
long time. They even wondered why they were created one time. Really? To fight. Yeah,
31:37
they were there for the enemy, for who became an enemy. So maybe they only understood what
31:44
they were being trained up for when that fall happened. Yeah. They were taught war and they
31:49
had to run maneuvers and do all kinds of stuff like that. Really? And that one was how loose
31:55
for a fallen heaven. They knew who their enemy was. Interesting. All right. Here's another question
32:02
about the Michael, the captain of the warrior angels. Is it Martha's asking, I believe the
32:06
angel Michael is the captain of the warrior angels and Gabriel is the messenger angels.
32:12
Are there other types of angels with specific purposes? I'm guessing there'd be lots of them
32:17
with specific purposes. There are so many, I cannot number them. There's many, many, many, many.
32:25
There's ones who are couriers, of course, the scribes, the Bible talks about them, helper angels
32:31
that help all over heaven doing things like that. Of course, there are the hosts of heaven.
32:35
There's ones who serve in different places and who keep the treasures
32:42
shined up and all kinds of things like that. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It makes sense that he might
32:48
even have thousands of different kinds of angels, right? For categories that we've never even thought
32:53
about. So, yeah. Man, just that's right. Me, A, N, G, S. Does God really cast out your sins into
33:01
the sea of forgetfulness? If you brought up your past, would he not know of it? I think most of the
33:07
time he wouldn't because he does cast it there and he's not going to think about it. I tell people,
33:13
stop reminding him of your sins. He won't know what you're talking about if you've repented.
33:18
Yeah, boy. I could have used that understanding years ago when I kept repending over and over
33:25
and over and over to make sure I got it right. He's probably saying, would you stop repending?
33:32
Okay. Jamelia, lots of interesting names today. Jamelia, have you seen inside of the courtrooms
33:39
in heaven? What's happening in there? What do they look like? Do they look like a courtroom on earth?
33:44
The judge sits on the bench up there high and then there's a defense in both sides?
33:50
I have absolutely been to the courtroom in heaven. Actually, there's more than one.
33:57
I guess outside, not outside of heaven, but in the atmosphere of heaven, it's invisible.
34:05
I know this sounds crazy. You can actually see to it. You can see that it's there.
34:09
Then of course, it's a courtroom that's actually in heaven. Yes, I've seen both. Like anything
34:15
else, God sits as judge. Jesus is our lawyer and Satan gets hauled up there about different
34:23
things sometimes. Other things get harder, but justice does take place in those courtrooms.
34:30
So it does look like a courtroom as we would know it. Well, they have one that looks very
34:34
supernatural. They do have one that looks like what you would call a courtroom, maybe not exactly
34:40
like that. So they're both different than I've seen. Okay. All right. Here's the last question here.
34:47
Natalie is asking, what is your favorite thing about Jesus that you would like to describe?
34:53
What's your favorite thing about? Of course, you'd have thousands of things, but what stands
34:57
out to you? I think his eyes. I think his eyes are so amazing. I never get tired of whenever
35:05
I'm around him. I always want to look at his eyes. They're beautiful, very beautiful. But he also does
35:11
have a, I almost want to say a cynic sense of humor. I mean, he was very bold about the things he
35:18
said on the earth to those who were not doing right. Like one of my favorite ones is, are you
35:25
you're a white and sepulchral school of dead men's bones? Yeah. You thought of the religious hierarchy.
35:30
I think both of those probably, those two things are probably my very favorite thing about it.
35:35
And he holds both of those at the same time. He, you know, he's got that serious side and then the
35:42
clever fun side. Yeah. So good. So good. Well, Kat, that's our time. We need to let you get to
35:49
your moving and rest in between and all of that. So I appreciate it very much. We'll spend more
35:54
time the next time talking about revealing heaven.com, but we're going to revealing the
35:58
heaven.com to see her, to get her books and all that. And there it is. Katcur.com is where you
36:03
can support her. The only place you can support her is online because she doesn't ask for money
36:09
in any other way. A lot of people keep trying to pretend to be her. So all right. Thanks so much,
36:14
Kat. Tomorrow, everybody is Robin Bullock. We're looking very much forward to that. When you see
36:19
Robin Bullock, he almost, I think he always has that pin that you created. It says, I don't do
36:25
demons. He wears that on his coat and everywhere he goes. So it's a, so that that'll be him right
36:31
there after people see this. Yeah. Thank you very much. We love you. Bless you. Have a good time
36:36
with your staffs. We'll see you again soon. Okay. See you later then. Bye.

01:00
Happy, I started to say Tuesday because we're recording this on Tuesday. 
01:17
Happy Wednesday for those of you watching this live for you. 
01:21
It is Wednesday, February 8. 
01:23
We're recording this at 3.20 in the afternoon on February 7 to get the sense we're recording 
01:28
Cat. 
01:30
Sometimes her schedule works better for us to record in the afternoon before. 
01:34
Most of the time these days that helps it work out better for everyone. 
01:38
So all right, well, welcome to the broadcast and a quick reminder that we tomorrow's for 
01:42
you tomorrow Thursday is Mel Kay. 
01:45
We haven't had her on for a while and she's going to give us an update on what's going 
01:48
on out there. 
01:49
So I love her very much. 
01:51
She's a great patriot in the patriot movement. 
01:55
She's that all the reawakened American thing. 
01:58
She's an absolute God of fear and she loves us and we love her. 
02:01
So that is Thursday tomorrow for you. 
02:06
We'll ask you some of the latest updates. 
02:08
So we're going to bring in Cat here in just a moment, but before we do that, here's a 
02:12
quick reminder about the wells we're digging. 
02:38
Thank you. 
03:08
I love that music, I like the beat to it too, and plus the whole Irish feeling of it, it's 
03:16
a great, here's a big word juxtaposition with the music and you're seeing the, I don't know 
03:23
whether it's called the bush or whatever you call it in the villages of Uganda, very 
03:29
primitive, poverty-stricken by any standard that we have, and they may not consider themselves 
03:34
poverty-stricken at all, I don't know how that is, and I'll have to learn more about 
03:39
that one day, but they sure need the water, they surely need the water, so we thank you 
03:44
for your help on that. 
03:45
Alright, time to watch for Kat and Steve on Wednesday, so here we go with Kat. 
04:06
Well good afternoon, I guess it is afternoon, it's actually like, we're taping this, so it's 
04:11
like 6.20 in the evening, your time isn't it? 
04:14
I think so. 
04:15
Yeah, you'll have to ask Jen that, I never know what time it is. 
04:18
You went to bed, you went to bed at, usually you go to bed at 6, right, because you're 
04:25
up all night, are you still up all night? 
04:27
I haven't been up since 4am. 
04:29
Oh, you've been up since 4, that's really unlike you, you don't get up that early. 
04:34
Not really, I'm really involved in doing something, you know, than I am. 
04:40
Well good to see you, well we've got some questions, oh I forgot to check with you before 
04:43
the program, if there's anything you had to share before we got into questions. 
04:49
I think Robin shared so much the other day, probably not except that we are still busy 
04:58
moving and we're very excited about it, but I really wanted to give the time since I 
05:03
didn't have a whole hour today to let people ask questions. 
05:06
Okay, alright, the first one is going to come from me, in fact we were talking about that. 
05:11
I won't bless the people though, let me go ahead and blow it up. 
05:17
Okay, are we on? 
05:18
Okay, yeah, so this is from me and so our staff was talking about prayer in one of them, 
05:24
so why don't you ask Kat what it's like for you. 
05:26
I think we asked you one time, in this big recollection we said, what's prayer like 
05:32
for you and I think you said, in the recesses of my memory here, something about yours was 
05:38
more about decrees, but don't let me put words in it, what is prayer like for you? 
05:43
Yeah, well there's many different types of things you can call prayer or that is called 
05:47
prayer even in heaven. 
05:50
Ruling is something, ruling is what's in the spirit realm, it's you taking authority 
05:54
and dominion and by the things that you either say that God is doing because He's told you 
06:02
or things that you have wanted yourself to release into the spirit realm to make a difference 
06:07
in people's lives. 
06:09
The other thing is called declaring and decreeing which a lot of people I've heard, you know 
06:13
what you dare to declare and decree shall be established unto you, that is my number 
06:18
one way I pray because I'm trying to establish usually something very specific, something 
06:25
God had asked me to take authority over, something He's asked me to make decrees about and so 
06:32
that is my favorite way to pray. 
06:33
And I still, another thing is talking to God, just having a language with Him is also 
06:41
partly prayer and I know God had said, you know, you pray all the time because you talk 
06:47
to me all the time, that's what He says to me, that's what the Bible says to me. 
06:50
Oh really? 
06:51
Yeah. 
06:52
He said, you pray all the time because you talk to me all the time, that's really instructive 
06:55
right there. 
06:56
Yes, it is and we should all have that much time and attention to give to Him but absolutely 
07:03
declaring and decreeing is the number one way I pray. 
07:08
Taking authority, taking great authority, having spent time with the Father or the Son, 
07:15
discussing things that they have going on on the earth right now, what is about to happen 
07:20
on the earth, things like that and then He'll say go make decrees over that and so that's 
07:24
what they do, I do a lot of that. 
07:26
Also for family members, I'll declare and decree over their lives things that they need 
07:30
either from heaven or that they're involved in working on this earth, you know, for the 
07:37
Father. 
07:38
I wanted to ask you a question about, you know, there's a scripture that says resist 
07:42
the devil, it's right in there, agree with God and there was that phrase, agree with 
07:48
God, there's so many things we could agree with God and I had something happen to me 
07:51
the other day and I'll give you an example, it's like I'm praying for this person that's 
07:56
in need so I said Lord, and this is not the exact one but it's kind of close to Lord 
08:00
and I know He's like your beloved Son, this one I'm praying that I have in my heart and 
08:07
I know you and Him are friends and I agree with you that you would never, ever cause 
08:16
harm to Him and I know you and I agree on this and I know that if anyone feels empathy 
08:21
for what he's going through, it would be you and I just want you to know I agree with you 
08:27
and that was kind of like a non-prayer prayer because I was explaining the need, He knew 
08:33
the need I was talking about but I was explaining it in agreement, what are your thoughts about 
08:38
something like that? 
08:40
I think for sure that would be a conversation, you know, God does take the time to even meet 
08:49
even myself about things that people are going through and things to let them know that I 
08:54
care about, He cares about, things like that so there are other types of conversation that 
08:59
you wouldn't necessarily specifically call prayer and I think that's because we show 
09:05
that we love people, we really care about people and our empathy goes along with them 
09:10
and whatever they're going through and the Father absolutely adores and loves people 
09:16
who, you know, it's not His plan to put us through things no matter what it looks like 
09:20
sometimes especially these last couple years that He is delighted to see the heart of people 
09:26
that care and I think it's so important for us to have kindness and care about people, 
09:31
you know, sometimes we get so caught up in our own world or our own life, we forget sometimes 
09:36
there are others out there who do need a kind word, an encouraging word, maybe a letter 
09:41
written to them or something letting them know someone is here with you, we've got your 
09:45
back, you know, we care about you so certainly there's all different kinds of conversation 
09:50
you could have in any way that some people may say well I didn't even think of that 
09:55
as prayer but anytime we love people it's going to touch the heart of the Father. 
10:00
Wow, yeah, you know our old school thinking for lack of a better description our old school 
10:04
thinking would be they would say and there's nothing wrong with this but they'd say what 
10:09
did you do in your quiet time or did you have your quiet time because if you don't put in 
10:14
time and I understand that very much but it kind of came off as a legalistic thing from 
10:19
time to time if someone would say did you have your quiet time it's a little bit freeing 
10:26
to me to have you say even if you're showing kindness even if you're talking to the Lord 
10:32
I was trying to figure out who, remind, be reminded who was this famous person of prayer 
10:37
that said I have hardly ever prayed for more than five minutes maybe he said fifteen minutes 
10:43
I don't know it's fine it was like either five or fifteen so I'll say five I've never 
10:48
prayed longer than five minutes but I've never gotten more than five minutes without 
10:51
praying it was something like that it was probably fifteen can let me ask you so some 
10:58
people have been taught now there's the scripture this is you know we're supposed to give him 
11:05
our our petitions with thanksgiving let your let your petitions or prayers be known to 
11:09
God in the in the prayer of thanksgiving all that so are there people who do who you would 
11:16
say get too much into petition and not enough in other things what would you say how would 
11:24
you exhort someone to pray I like do some people say Lord I need this and Lord help 
11:28
me with that or help my family is it too much is too much petition I think it depends on 
11:36
the person himself I guess most people would would would some people just gonna ask for 
11:42
I guess whatever they're having issues with or whatever they're thinking about or wondering 
11:46
if something will work some people can't kind of not sure about making up their minds I 
11:51
think and so sometimes they may ask more than other people would but I just I love people 
11:58
who declare declare and decree us that you really are serious about getting something 
12:03
done for God and making sure that petitions petitions are being heard maybe not even 
12:07
just your petitions it might be others petitions you know they're going to something like we 
12:11
were kind of just talking about a minute ago I don't think God ever gets tired of hearing 
12:16
anybody's petitions at all if you ask me personally I don't think you know I totally was asking 
12:22
that so I so yeah I totally was so if that if that if too much is you're not worried 
12:28
about too many petitions then oh no I don't think so no no no sometimes you wish people 
12:35
would ask more well that's true too doesn't he says you have not because you ask not 
12:40
your life be that side of that okay so all right well I'm gonna ask you a question from 
12:46
Benny age 12 so he says are the skill levels of all people the same in heaven like are 
12:54
they all the same strong they're just as strong they're just as fast speed he seems to be 
13:00
asking about athletic by the question he mentioned strength and speed is everybody the same or 
13:06
some stronger and some faster I don't think everybody is the same at all I think everybody 
13:12
is still at different levels you know if you pursue something of course you're gonna know 
13:16
more than someone who never had before you do have the ability to learn new skills all 
13:21
the time in heaven or improve the skills that you have in heaven but no I don't think everybody 
13:26
is at the same level that's good to hear yeah in fact that the way you answer boring to say 
13:32
why bother to go to something if everybody is the same right well that's true oh I lost 
13:39
I was gonna ask a follow-up but I lost it okay Jack age nine okay he he wants to know can 
13:45
I transform into things in heaven like an animal or a character he wants to know if he can 
13:51
transform it I assume this is like when they're playing around or something there are places 
13:57
in heaven they can go that is for a play area that yes you can actually change you can be 
14:03
smaller can be larger I think that you can become a cartoon in certain areas and then 
14:10
you play out cartoons with your friends you actually are in the cartoon so he's absolutely 
14:16
right and I you said in certain places are there because it sounds like a what would 
14:22
be a term it sounds like a fun zone or a fun village or or something there are places that 
14:28
usually in the amusement park there's a lot of things going on similar to that they have 
14:32
all kinds of things that you can do you can travel different ways like in bubbles you can 
14:38
go up to different places where is it the play places in the sky I know it sounds crazy 
14:44
but it's heaven yeah yeah it's very different and when you go there you expect some of those 
14:49
things to happen well I gotta ask you when a lady wrote to me I didn't respond to her 
14:53
today because I didn't know how to respond because I don't have an answer for everybody's 
14:57
question but she wrote she's very nice about it but she says but I'm quite certain there's 
15:02
no cotton candy in heaven so apparently she heard that you had said there was cotton candy 
15:07
in heaven and I might my thing would have been if I'd written there what what would 
15:11
prevent God from giving a delicious cotton candy that would be nothing yeah so I'm talking 
15:18
to people about the funness the giddiness the laughter the hilarity of God because we 
15:24
got the holy thing we've been taught I don't know we don't have it down but we've been 
15:29
taught the holy side we have not been taught the fun side I mean what would you like to 
15:35
tell people to say there for the first time I would say the same thing that the father 
15:40
said to me if he didn't make fun places in heaven he'd be in trouble with all those kids 
15:44
coming home I mean that's a perfect like a little child the Bible is clear about that 
15:49
you come with the heart of a child because you're going to have adventures you're going 
15:54
to have fun and the father wants you to have that why wouldn't he he is your father so 
16:00
of course he planned different things to do even adventures for you to do things to learn 
16:06
different places to go to learn them you can visit rodeos you already know about the amusement 
16:11
park there's so many places in heaven you go even beautiful places out outside parks 
16:17
all kinds of things dinosaur park you know people get up get off on that but you know 
16:22
you're not God and I can tell you when he is a father a loving father he's going to give 
16:27
everything he can do bless his children and that's why he's he wants you to expect it 
16:33
yes why what do you think if you do with all these millions of children coming home to 
16:37
heaven that's really really good and you know the the the thing about it is not only millions 
16:43
maybe there's even billions because from the beginning of time billions well because from 
16:48
the beginning of time children have been have lost their lives when they were little you 
16:54
know I have never asked you this question but I want to ask you this question there were 
17:00
people that perished in the flood and some among those cats surely there would have been 
17:07
children throughout whatever the earth was in those days when when those children perish 
17:14
in the flood and they were almost babies or very very young children do you expect to 
17:19
see those children in heaven one day of course I do absolutely I would they were innocent 
17:26
children why would they not go to heaven the father's been adamant about that from the 
17:31
from the very beginning he would talk to me about that I expected all children to go to 
17:35
heaven yeah they didn't do anything wrong right they do have an opportunity to receive 
17:40
Christ in heaven if they want to and they'll actually come to his throne and bring him 
17:44
flowers and say they receive him they don't necessarily have to do that to be in heaven 
17:50
but they want to do it well it wouldn't that almost by default if they went to heaven wouldn't 
17:56
they I can't imagine someone saying as a child no I don't want to receive Christ right 
18:03
anybody they love him they so fall in love yeah so I think it's such a blessing for the 
18:09
father to allow them to do that so they do have they have a big event where they're invited 
18:14
to sit on usually on the throne of the father and then Jesus will come and he will present 
18:22
himself there and Jesus and he will ask Jesus to be received as his savior okay good good 
18:29
good good okay say that we've got three children's questions today say love my granddaughter 
18:35
my granddaughter's name is say that but that's what he said they may say pronounce a seal 
18:39
that but say that or see the age eight is asking cat are there singing squirrels and 
18:46
talking flowers in heaven that she's eight years old she wants another singing squirrels 
18:51
and talking flowers I have seen both while I was in heaven so I can adamantly tell you 
18:57
absolutely yes the flowers have faces yes they sing home meadows sing sometimes and 
19:04
yes squirrels do not just squirrels most of the creatures are most of the what you would 
19:09
call an animal especially all your pets they all talk they talk and then there is some 
19:15
there's a whole group of squirrels that I know and I don't know why and I haven't laughed 
19:19
out for the so many times I don't care people love it there are a group of squirrels that 
19:23
actually are called greeters GR TERS and when someone comes home to heaven they will actually 
19:31
go in this group and they will actually sing and dance for the people welcoming them to 
19:35
heaven I can imagine some maybe some older type stuffy person and here they are opening 
19:45
the door and here's this group of squirrels ready to sing and dance they have to stop 
19:48
having pain I'm not kidding the Holy Spirit does does make sure it all happens and so 
19:53
if there's something you don't like you'll change when you get there that's you know 
19:58
that's actually the mouthful right there and he said because I know but you know what because 
20:04
when I if you had the further okay I'm 67 for the first 50 years of my life I could 
20:11
never have received most of that that you're saying because I would have I don't know what 
20:15
I would have thought would be wrong with that I was just taught that heaven is holy and 
20:20
we're going to worship him and no I would have said no we're probably not going to 
20:24
just sit on the cloud but I didn't have a replacement for that activity I just didn't 
20:29
believe it I had someone wrote I saw it written and someone said there won't be the reason 
20:34
we know that there won't be this is a kind of a quote the reason we know there won't 
20:38
be amusement parks and heaven that there are none is because the elements it's because 
20:43
that's on earth and the elements on the earth will be burned up with fervent heat so therefore 
20:48
we know amusement parks won't be in heaven they were there first before the earth was 
20:54
even made about time or what's going on earth are you kidding it's on the earth because 
21:02
it is in heaven see I want you to say that because I knew that was your answer because 
21:07
I've come to learn that and it makes sense it's logical you know everything about the 
21:14
river of life well we're on the earth so why did they burn I mean the thing about is when 
21:20
I saw that I thought well that would mean if you followed that logic then that would 
21:24
mean since we have mansions on the earth and that earth is going to burn up there can be 
21:29
no mansions in heaven and since we have roads on the earth to drive vehicles there can be 
21:35
no roads or vehicles of any kind in heaven and you pretty soon you you have God with 
21:40
his hands up say what can I do you you've made all these things illegal for me to have 
21:46
in heaven it's kind of crazy all right well that's good news cat I'm glad you're here 
21:51
to bring the good news all right I like this question K I don't know how old but she says 
21:55
does God have any particular reason reason when he sends twins triplets or whatever to 
22:03
be born does he have a reason I'm not quite sure what she means I don't know that he has 
22:07
a reason other than he just he loves seeing all three of them I guess or both of them 
22:12
or whatever but I don't know of any certain reason that he would send since he sends those 
22:17
from heaven and he tells them this is your assignment which we you know we don't know 
22:22
now but he he gives an assignment if he's gonna send triplets he would probably does 
22:27
this make sense he would probably get these three children together and say you're gonna 
22:31
be triplets in about a minute from now what does he he tells them about their life is 
22:38
going to be and then he sends them or what I think there's a whole lot of stuff that 
22:44
goes on with all that there are times sometimes he'll actually mention it to people before 
22:50
they before they're born you know while they're still living in him in him he'll let them 
22:55
know the their purpose even he'll let them know sometimes who he's chosen for them all 
23:01
kinds of things go on so they'll be really hard to say but he does share with them most 
23:06
of the time not necessarily whenever when they'll be born but that they will be born 
23:11
together as a family sometimes he does do that okay all right now Matt is asking this 
23:19
this is it sounds like my kind of questions I would be asking you says do people look 
23:23
back on their earthly life fondly from heaven so they've gone to heaven do they look back 
23:30
and think of you know I you could say not like the good old days because they're in 
23:35
the good old days now in heaven but do they look back and say remember when we did this 
23:40
to their friend remember when we went to the creek and we all went so visit that kind of 
23:44
fond memories from heaven I think sometimes that they can kind of remember being with 
23:51
certain people maybe not younger maybe a little older they do I think depending on how close 
23:58
also that you got to the Lord he himself may actually show you oh really oh yeah yeah he'll 
24:05
show you he's shown me different people he's shown me different people that I knew before 
24:10
I came to the earth and I've seen myself sitting in his hand quite a few times explaining to 
24:16
me some of the things I would be doing of course I didn't remember them until much later on 
24:24
so sometimes he does do that but it really depends on the relationship you pursue with 
24:28
him especially the Lord that he will share things with you from your past past meaning 
24:35
before time yeah okay BT BT before time BT BT alright here is okay I don't know how specifically 
24:50
the answer you'd answer this but I'll throw you the question Sarah is asking in light 
24:55
of all the exposures coming from those caught up in sex trafficking how do we pray for all 
25:00
the victims being delivered in this horrendous experience so I don't know how would you tell 
25:06
them to pray for the victims that are being delivered is that that's what their question 
25:10
is well there is something they can do if they knew about it and that was the losing 
25:14
of their soul oh you can you can because God has not disordained it that way but he created 
25:23
that way and it was a soul checkup it's all about your soul the keys to the kingdom which 
25:30
you bind others will be bound in heaven which you loose and it will be loose in heaven meaning 
25:35
if let's say it was a horrible encounter like we're talking about something like that and 
25:40
then someone they met who was adapted being a soul doctor they could share with them if 
25:47
they lose those things and named him by name and then they lose them out of their soul 
25:51
and Jesus name Jesus will come and take them like they were never there and I teach that 
25:57
actually haven't done it well but I actually would teach that to different leaders of different 
26:01
groups that want to do that especially for young people who are rescued from drugs and 
26:06
those things like that and they cried it they were so rejoiced because they said it would 
26:10
take them a year to work with a group or a person and in this way in three minutes they 
26:16
have loose everything in their soul that ever was there that the devil put there and I you 
26:24
know let's camp there for a minute we've got about ten minutes left here but let's see 
26:31
we're going to keep it to 40 minutes or so today so someone is rescued and if you could 
26:38
see their soul and I don't know as a seer if you can see that cap but but let's say 
26:42
that you just know okay so you see their soul and let's say it's full what do you see because 
26:47
that was one of the questions what do you see first of all it depends on which person or 
26:50
type of person you're talking about I see all kinds of things I can see people who have 
26:55
gone to suffering I can see people who have been abused if someone is abused they'll have 
27:01
like you know you've heard people say we're gonna tie the knot these are all about relationships 
27:07
this is not like the twisted rope hanging out of you somewhere I'm not saying that this 
27:11
sort of right you knew that they had some kind of negative relationship in their life 
27:17
somewhere because that's what I see therefore I know they need healing for that and in the 
27:23
past I would just pray and declare over them now I actually will go up to them and talk 
27:27
to them and I'll teach them how they can be free from that in Jesus name the God never 
27:33
intended you to go through those things that was not his purpose there's a devil in this 
27:36
world I hate everybody and whatever you can steal from your destiny the point of the devil 
27:42
to mess with people in that is he wants to steal their destiny and that's one of the 
27:48
ways that he does it is by the abuse no matter what kind of abuse that is that they have 
27:53
to go through but I remember the the time that the father showed up and showed up in 
27:59
my room he said I'm going to show you and he said I will show you he said after I show 
28:04
you this people will know how in minutes to lose everything out of their soul and they'll 
28:09
never suffer from it again wow this will help every single believer accelerate their life 
28:15
into victory because I don't have someone you have three months three years ten years 
28:20
trying to get healed from stuff that was done to them wrongfully he said if they follow 
28:25
these instructions it's simply the keys to the kingdom which everybody doesn't always 
28:31
understand none of those different ways people can use those keys to the kingdom he said 
28:35
but I'm talking about what you lose on earth you lose from heaven you lose from heaven 
28:40
so what you lose from your soul that was done to you on earth that was wrong heaven will 
28:46
come and lose it from your soul completely and it will be like it never existed if you 
28:53
want to bind the things of god and then we were growing up we were always hot to bind 
28:56
the devil yeah are you uh there's something much better than binding that it's binding 
29:02
the love of god the life of god the plans of god the will of god his joy his celebration 
29:08
his expectation you can choose with your will to bind those things to your soul and no one 
29:14
can ever take them away from you and you will feel completely different so these are things 
29:20
taught to me by the father and I remember it was out it was ours earth time because I remember 
29:27
glancing at my clock and then he took me and he would be taking me back and forth showing 
29:32
me things on the earth and showing me how people got healed it was really uh quite a drawn-up process 
29:38
and I have helped so many people and we actually help people become soul doctors that's what god 
29:44
calls me a soul doctor I heard you use that a minute ago I hadn't heard that term before but in 
29:49
other words it it would be like you don't have to become a licensed uh professional counselor 
29:54
you can become a soul doctor you're right practice what god says took me into the future and I 
30:01
saw down the hallways of businesses athletic places um it didn't matter where it was churches 
30:08
churches and I would see a doorway that said soul doctrine it had a little sign up outside and people 
30:14
would go in the air to get like sort of like counseling or healing or being made whole when 
30:19
they're sold it was quite fascinating so yes there are things that you can do to help one another 
30:25
how to be free from all that garbage and I mean the list was like so long and it didn't matter 
30:31
what it was that the people had wanted to lose from their soul if they were involved in it if their 
30:35
family was involved in it if situations that happened to them every one of those could be 
30:41
lose from your soul drugs you know all kinds of all kinds of things you would choose to lose them 
30:47
from your soul can use uh I felt to ask you this while you were talking because you were talking 
30:53
about a person could lose it from their own soul by by doing what you've taught them to do so this 
31:00
is what this is kind of the yucky question so there's women watching right now who have been 
31:06
raped and they never got delivered from the trauma of that rape or the or the horrible memories of 
31:12
it men too because a man can be raped because he has a child okay how would you walk a woman 
31:19
right through what would she say right now in her prayer time how would she use her words to 
31:24
to be her own soul doctor if I could put that right I would just say to her that God actually 
31:32
I think even better than that is I should tell you a real situation that happened okay okay 
31:37
um one of the first times I ever got to use that I had just been with a father maybe weeks later 
31:43
I was in New Jersey I was invited by a pastor and his wife and her two sons and he went in the 
31:51
grocery store to get some things from my room your snacks and stuff and she said I've got it 
31:55
you were sent here for me this is a real story you were sent here for me and I know in the next 
32:00
couple minutes you can help me be free because I knew that the Lord would help me get free she said 
32:05
I have been been through some of the worst torments of um violence violent torments night and day 
32:12
before I was married three times and and to the wrong same person not the same person same kind 
32:17
of person and she said I can't stand it anymore I thought God I've got to be free of this I don't 
32:22
want the nightmares I don't want the torments my kids were present with some of these happened 
32:27
and so they've gone through these same things what can we do to be free right now 
32:32
and in three minutes I told her do you know what the word says about binding and losing 
32:38
she said well binding and losing you know you mean yes I said yes that what you choose to lose 
32:45
from your soul that was done to you will be loosed from heaven itself heaven will come down pull it 
32:52
out of your soul completely and it will be like you never experienced it before she said show me 
33:00
right now my husband's still in there show me now right now and so I let her through it you know 
33:05
um and she she gave her name she said uh father in Jesus name I'm choosing to lose from my soul 
33:10
all the violent activities the violent things I've been that I was hurt with that I had to 
33:16
stand and see that my kids had to stand and see I'm fed up with it I'm tired of the devil 
33:21
abusing me and I'm not going through this life anymore so I choose with my own will to lose it 
33:26
in Jesus name right now forever and ever amen and then this light came on her face 
33:35
really I have never ever seen and this light came I mean I was overwhelmed 
33:42
I mean I knew it would work she sat there and she started crying a laugh and she goes 
33:47
she said some minute she goes it's gone I mean it's gone I mean in three minutes it's gone 
33:54
it's literally gone it's like I never had it before I I can't even remember some of the 
34:00
actions she goes I I've got to do this with my two boys before you even go back can you please 
34:05
do the same thing with them they were like the like 10 and uh 15 something like that or 17 something 
34:11
like that I said of course of course she said all I can do is laugh now before I couldn't even 
34:18
stand to think about going to bed at night her husband knows that was sort of goes what's wrong 
34:21
she goes I'm the happiest person in the world wow she worked and so yeah the third night 
34:29
she brought them and I led them to the same thing and I saw her 10 years later she said do you know 
34:34
what that stuff has never come back you're still filled with joy because after that I taught her 
34:41
how to bind the joy the Lord God's love his his his presence you know his purposes for your life 
34:47
his celebration and she said we're still filled with that stuff she said I am so grateful and you 
34:53
should I've helped so many people through that out of their life it is really really that's 
35:01
and they have lose they have people have lose some drug addiction alcohol all kinds of things 
35:07
some things they're like even witchcraft they have lose that from their soul and and because they 
35:13
were repentant first and then they lose it from the soul so I have to say one of the great and 
35:18
the father said this may be one of the greatest things I ever show you and he was right so he 
35:24
calls me soul doctor all the time I love that term too I this first time I heard you use it but wow 
35:29
that's so powerful yeah I mean his body can people can be sick in their body and still be happy 
35:36
if you're sick in your soul you have no life at all 
35:39
wow this may be the most this is the most important thing we did today and we've even 
35:48
like kids we've let kids do that too that have been abused but the teenager place in Orlando 
35:56
that camp that they have to go to for a year they have me come down and I taught every single one 
36:02
of the leaders and the teachers how to do that and he said they'd never been the same again 
36:07
and now instead of having all those weeks and months to trust the person who used to be with 
36:13
that person it takes a few minutes and they're free wow wow cat that is simply amazing and I've 
36:23
heard you talk on this a lot this was especially poignant if I guess you know uh because people 
36:30
you know I've heard it and I I've done lots and lots and lots of self you know losing yeah I feel 
36:36
like I got it at a new level today of understanding even though I heard these words before I feel 
36:41
like it went even deeper this time so personally I think I've received benefit from this but I 
36:46
know that people watching this is very important I'm sure there will be many many many people 
36:51
Steve they will never be the same again after this broadcast we are going to print mini booklets we 
36:58
actually are going to print mini booklets m-i-n-i mini booklets that people can order in bunches and 
37:04
stuff like that they can even hand out to people and then eventually we'll probably print a book 
37:11
and give the whole story about how the father came how he taught me all the places he took me 
37:17
and my daughter finally came to the door I think it had been almost four hours I had locked myself 
37:22

38:30
of anything or God wants me to have something you call me grow up and make sure I get it and so uh 
38:36
she called me one time and I think this is one of the times when she was going through stuff she 
38:40
goes I've I've had someone call me on the phone wanting to commit suicide because the rotten 
38:45
boyfriend that's what she called him broke up with her and ditched her and she said she was so 
38:50

39:02
before would you mind if I call my friend to get her on the phone and you lead her through that 
39:08
because I don't want to see her take her life and I said you know I well so she did I told her 
39:14
about Jesus Christ and she said she knew that she had knew who the Lord was I said did you know he 
39:19

40:13

40:26
matter when it is he gives it to me to say I will put it on there there's all kinds of videos 
40:32

40:49

40:54
yourself by helping people you don't have to be a brilliant you know you don't have to know 
40:59
everything there is to know it's your heart for love for want of caring with people and it is also 
41:05
the only place in the in the cosmos that you can give online there is no other place there's no other 
41:13
no other website that where you can go to do that we did that on purpose because people would try to 
41:19

41:23
