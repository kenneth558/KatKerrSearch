Happy Wednesday, August 17, 2022. 
01:38
Welcome to the broadcast. 
01:40
It's going to be a great show today. 
01:42
We have Kat Kerr as always. 
01:44
It's going to be right an hour show starting now. 
01:48
She's got some other things she needs to do. 
01:50
This is the day before Eric Trump comes. 
01:54
So Eric Trump will be here tomorrow. 
01:56
Do not miss this. 
01:58
Be sure and text your friends. 
02:00
Call your friends and let them know. 
02:02
We've got some great questions for Eric. 
02:04
It's going to be great. 
02:06
Oh, by the way, yes. 
02:08
Thank you, Julie. 
02:10
It is 8 a.m. tomorrow. 
02:12
I would have forgotten that. 
02:14
It's 8 a.m. Pacific time. 
02:16
If you're on the East Coast, it will be 11. 
02:18
It's 8 a.m. in the morning. 
02:20
That's when we could get him. 
02:22
We're happy to do that. 
02:24
We did that one other time with General Flynn. 
02:26
It is 8 o'clock in the morning Pacific time. 
02:28
So there you have it. 
02:30
I'm just making sure I'm not missing any notes here. 
02:32
Before we bring Kat on, 
02:34
let's bring Mike and Lori Sally on. 
02:36
Let's talk about the wells. 
02:38
They are spearheading the whole thing, 
02:40
the whole project. 
02:42
I can't wait to hear all about it. 
02:44
So Mike and Lori Sally, take it away. 
02:46
Yeah, go ahead, Lori. 
02:48
We are so excited to update you 
02:50
specifically about the water wells 
02:52
in Uganda. 
02:54
I think one of your shows you shared about 
02:56
that we had had 300 
02:58
salvations. Well, now it's up 
03:00
to over 800 people 
03:02
who have given their lives to Jesus 
03:04
because of these water wells. 
03:06
I was just in shock. 
03:08
Who knew that Jesus, we know he can turn 
03:10
water into wine, but who knew 
03:12
he was going to make these water wells 
03:14
and share 
03:16
the gospel in such an impactful way. 
03:18
People just be... 
03:20
I had always hoped 
03:22
that maybe a person 
03:24
or two would come to Jesus 
03:26
because of this, but I had no 
03:28
idea that this would be 
03:30
an evangelism tool where 
03:32
hundreds and hundreds, 
03:34
and we just think we're just getting started. 
03:36
We're just getting started. We're now doing a well 
03:38
a week. Every week, one well. 
03:40
So, wow. 
03:42
So we're up to 
03:44
47 new wells 
03:46
that Elijah Streams has provided. 47. 
03:48
I was looking 
03:50
at the big organization that does work in Uganda 
03:52
and all of last year 
03:54
and then all they do is water. 
03:56
All they do. And they did 42 
03:58
water projects, not even wells 
04:00
in the entire year. 
04:02
Really? Yeah. 
04:04
It's incredible the pace 
04:06
and the excitement of the people 
04:08
and I was surprised as well 
04:10
as how many people are coming to know Jesus 
04:12
because of this. It's crazy. 
04:14
It's not normal, actually. 
04:16
It's something God's doing. 
04:18
The anointing is all over this project 
04:20
and just the investment 
04:22
that people are making. It's incredible. 
04:24
I wanted to share one of the stories. 
04:26
So I was asking my team, like, tell me 
04:28
what does it look like? I mean, how is this happening? 
04:30
How are they sharing the gospel? 
04:32
Because, normally, I mean, 
04:34
pastors are out there sharing all the time 
04:36
and in this one particular area, 
04:38
so Elijah Streams, 
04:40
we are drilling wells 
04:42
in different parts of Uganda, 
04:44
not all in the same exact spot. 
04:46
So it's in different areas. 
04:48
One area that is really, really dry, 
04:50
it's a drought area 
04:52
and so it's kind of like 
04:54
the forgotten people. It's drought. 
04:56
They don't have a lot of government 
04:58
assistance. They don't have many 
05:00
organizations that are coming there to help 
05:02
and so what they've been doing 
05:04
is as the 
05:06
water company is coming out 
05:08
with their equipment, 
05:10
they're renting a 
05:12
speaker and hooking it up 
05:14
to a car and they're 
05:16
driving through the village 
05:18
and they're kind of announcing, 
05:20
hey, we want you to know what Jesus is doing. 
05:22
There's people 
05:24
that love Jesus, 
05:26
that are responding to him 
05:28
and they care about you and he cares about you 
05:30
and they want you to know about him 
05:32
and so then they start sharing the gospel 
05:34
and then right behind them, not very far, 
05:36
there's these huge, 
05:38
massive trucks that have 
05:40
these huge drilling 
05:42
implements and things 
05:44
and my team is telling me that 
05:46
not only are the water wells 
05:48
an amazing thing, but the fact that 
05:50
we're using this equipment, 
05:52
the technology 
05:54
that we're using to drill these wells 
05:56
is abnormal for them because normally 
05:58
when people come and drill a well, they do it by hand 
06:00
and we're thankful for those 
06:02
that are able to do that, but it's 
06:04
not as efficient because you can't go as deep, 
06:06
it's actually dangerous to do it like 
06:08
that, but people are in awe 
06:10
and imagine if it's not every day 
06:12
you see massive trucks coming 
06:14
in, you know, whenever 
06:16
they're in these villages, when strangers 
06:18
come, everybody stops what they're 
06:20
doing and they run 
06:22
and they want to know what's going on 
06:24
so they're using that first 
06:26
introduction of here's why 
06:28
we're doing this and then they're watching 
06:30
the process the entire time and then 
06:32
when they hit water, 
06:34
then when they hit water, they do a big 
06:36
commissioning and they gather 
06:38
everybody together 
06:40
and that's when their hearts are 
06:42
touched and they were telling me this 
06:44
story about this one woman, she's 
06:46
71 years old and to me 
06:48
when I hear 71, that doesn't seem 
06:50
that old because I'm, you know, I'm in my 
06:52
50s so 70 doesn't seem like it's that old 
06:54
but in Uganda that is old 
06:56
the life expectancy isn't that long, we know 
06:58
Jesus can do it 120 
07:00
years more than that, but 71 
07:02
she's considered an elder in her 
07:04
community and my team is telling 
07:06
me that she has 
07:08
zero faith, normally in Uganda 
07:10
you find people that are either, they 
07:12
adopt something, whether they're really born again 
07:14
or not and they say born again, we say Christians 
07:16
in the states but they always say born again 
07:18
and that means you're really born again 
07:20
she didn't 
07:22
believe in anything or she didn't 
07:24
really ascribe to any particular thing, she must 
07:26
have believed in a higher being because 
07:28
she testified that 
07:30
she used to say to 
07:32
whatever higher being she was talking to 
07:34
if somebody would come and solve 
07:36
this water crisis because 
07:38
I've been suffering, my parents were suffering 
07:40
my children are suffering, now my 
07:42
grandchildren are suffering 
07:44
and then whenever we came in 
07:46
and drilled this water 
07:48
and she saw the water coming 
07:50
she just started yelling 
07:52
God is alive, God is alive 
07:54
God is alive 
07:56
that's amazing 
07:58
she was so excited 
08:00
she truly was like 
08:02
the woman at the well because she 
08:04
then gave her life to Jesus 
08:06
people followed suit, they 
08:08
followed her, they thought if she 
08:10
believes in Jesus, I want the same Jesus 
08:12
and it was remarkable 
08:14
so Steve, over 
08:16
800 people 
08:18
I can't 
08:20
I mean I do but it's like 
08:22
I mean 
08:24
I thought maybe a person 
08:26
or two would come to the Lord because of these 
08:28
wells, I had, I never 
08:30
saw this coming, not even close 
08:32
and we're just getting started 
08:34
one well a week 
08:36
it'll probably increase 
08:38
unless you run out of land to drill wells 
08:40
I don't think we'll run out of land 
08:42
there's a lot of people who contact us all the time 
08:44
really? 
08:46
oh yeah, all the time 
08:48
tell me about that for a minute 
08:50
do other people call and say bring a well here 
08:52
or what? I get emails 
08:54
every week from people that hear about 
08:56
what's going on with Elijah's streams 
08:58
and how we're providing this water 
09:00
can you do one for me 
09:02
here's somebody I know in this village that needs help 
09:04
here's a school that needs help 
09:06
I don't think we've gotten close 
09:08
to tapping out the potential yet 
09:10
and so it's pretty exciting 
09:12
just let those that are watching know 
09:14
it's not as easy as 
09:16
just people contacting and saying hey I need 
09:18
a water well here because we're trying 
09:20
to work with reputable well drillers 
09:22
that we can 
09:24
make sure that we're going to go deep enough 
09:26
and the water is going to be sustainable 
09:28
because you hear stories of water wells 
09:30
that were drilled by 
09:32
different organizations and 
09:34
maybe they're drilling it and go deep enough 
09:36
and then it ends up running dry and that's what 
09:38
we don't want that to happen so 
09:40
we're trying to do it through relations 
09:42
I know you brought a video 
09:44
your daughter Caitlin made this video 
09:46
so let's watch that video 
09:48
about it's kind of the latest 
09:50
I laughed because 
09:52
he said we're emptying hell 
09:54
and we're populating hell 
09:56
but you can populate 
09:58
but we understand what he means he said 
10:00
we're doing damage big 
10:02
time to hell I mean we are literally 
10:04
coming against 
10:06
hell so let's watch that 
10:08
video 
10:36
this year 2022 
10:38
the recharge plants have been started 
10:40
so your denerasty 
10:42
is not only providing clean water 
10:44
but is emptying hell 
10:46
and populating heaven 
10:48
by souls coming to the kingdom 
10:50
and we talk about your Elijah's things 
10:52
so everyone prays for you 
10:54
and God bless you so 
10:56
very much 
10:58
Mike and Lorde Salle 
11:00
this is amazing before the launch 
11:02
of this power hall 
11:04
Moscow has been preached 
11:06
and about 15 people 
11:08
have accepted in Christ 
11:10
as Lord and Savior 
11:12
and even land 
11:14
has been donated 
11:16
to start a church 
11:18
in this place 
11:20
this is a testimony this is amazing 
11:22
these are 15 souls 
11:24
they have come to the kingdom of God today 
11:26
because of the donation 
11:28
of the power hall 
11:30
thank you very much 
11:42
it's so exciting 
11:44
he's like a kid isn't he 
11:46
well I'm like a kid 
11:48
you know I'm sitting here 
11:50
you guys are the same thing 
11:52
look what's going on 
11:54
I mean I can't believe it 
11:56
I do believe it but 
11:58
we are above and beyond 
12:00
anything I think any of us 
12:02
expected to happen 
12:04
wait to see what God is doing 
12:06
for sure 
12:08
well thank you both 
12:10
for coming I see Kat is now here 
12:12
so blessings to you both 
12:14
I appreciate it Mike and Lorde 
12:16
you're working with us very strongly 
12:18
to look into water situations 
12:20
that we will be talking about 
12:22
very very soon here in the states 
12:24
you are here and we're looking at 
12:26
a lot of different things related to the water 
12:28
so we'll be reporting that 
12:30
and a lot of people don't know 
12:32
we're helping a lot of other people 
12:34
even not related to the water 
12:36
but everyone who sows into this ministry 
12:38
receives a reward 
12:40
from him 
12:42
I mean 
12:44
without you know he says 
12:46
even if you give so much as a cup of cold water 
12:48
to one of these you will not lose your reward 
12:50
can you imagine the rewards 
12:52
God's passing out in heaven and on earth 
12:54
thank you to all of our viewers 
12:56
we appreciate it very much 
12:58
so thank you Mike and Lorde 
13:00
we'll see you soon and we'll bring on Kat 
13:02
bless you guys 
13:04
okay so without further ado 
13:06
let's do Wednesdays with Kat and Steve 
13:08
music 
13:24
and there she is hey Kat 
13:26
how are you 
13:28
I'm great thank you 
13:30
so good to have you back 
13:32
I got my Disneyland tie on 
13:34
and tell people why it's 
13:36
okay to still love Disneyland 
13:38
even though we hear some of these bad things 
13:40
you know 
13:42
I always look at the roots 
13:44
of something or the foundation 
13:46
of something 
13:48
and well 
13:50
we can even look at the throne of God 
13:52
Satan has taken many things 
13:54
that are actually some of the father's images 
13:56
the way he operates 
13:58
and he is 
14:00
on the earth polluted them 
14:02
and made them not good 
14:04
but that doesn't mean it's okay 
14:06
to partake of Satan stuff 
14:08
I'm just making an example 
14:10
Walt Disney was 
14:12
put on the earth by God 
14:14
at the time he was put on here 
14:16
and he was put here to create fun 
14:18
in family entertainment 
14:20
that's why people think well he doesn't care about entertainment 
14:22
well they have it in heaven people 
14:24
movies in heaven is all kinds of 
14:26
roller coasters because God knows 
14:28
we need fun 
14:30
and heaven I say is a good bit fun 
14:32
it is holy 
14:34
is pure there's nothing defiling 
14:36
there's no profanity 
14:38
there's no wickedness anywhere in heaven 
14:40
not in anything to create or make there 
14:42
but Walt had this passion 
14:44
in his heart to make a place 
14:46
that families could come and bring their children 
14:48
because even in those days 
14:50
there was a lot of craziness going on 
14:52
in the 60s 
14:54
and things weren't turning in the best 
14:56
direction in that time 
14:58
and so many things were going on that were not good 
15:00
he was determined 
15:02
and he really fought hard 
15:04
well in Orlando especially to get the land 
15:06
for Disney World 
15:08
but the reason he created that in those characters 
15:10
was so we could have something to laugh at 
15:12
and have fun 
15:14
and he is not happy himself right now 
15:16
with stuff that's going on 
15:18
but it is going to change 
15:20
and the father has adamantly told me 
15:22
it's going to change 
15:24
so a lot of maybe people might end up 
15:26
being removed and have this replaced there 
15:28
because I know when Walt was on the earth 
15:30
he was adamant about keeping it 
15:32
at a level 
15:34
that what was produced 
15:36
and the content that was produced 
15:38
not just at that time but for years to come 
15:40
could be enjoyed by family, by children 
15:42
and know that they were going to see something safe 
15:44
and when Disney World was open 
15:46
I actually went to the park here in Florida 
15:48
the first year they were open 
15:50
it was so many masses 
15:52
of people were coming 
15:54
to enjoy 
15:56
and talking about Disney 
15:58
I always appreciated 
16:00
was he always showed 
16:02
in his movies or any of the other things he created 
16:04
you knew the difference between 
16:06
good and evil 
16:08
and every time good would be the victor 
16:10
in the movies and any of the sets he made 
16:12
and he made sure 
16:14
that you knew that this was evil 
16:16
and it was dark and it was not good 
16:18
and yet this was filled with life and light 
16:20
and so I loved it 
16:22
the heroes always saved the day 
16:24
and it overcame 
16:26
every evil obstacle 
16:28
or thing that was in any of the movies 
16:30
or things he produced 
16:32
and so I always appreciated that with Walt 
16:34
and if he was here today that's exactly 
16:36
what would still be happening 
16:38
instead of compromise 
16:40
and darkness invading parts of that 
16:42
there are going to be some 
16:44
covert activities going on in there 
16:46
and no one's going to know anything about it 
16:48
except God himself 
16:50
but things are about to start changing 
16:52
in Disneyland 
16:54
and in Disney World 
16:56
and I don't know if that means something 
16:58
might close for a while or things are being changed 
17:00
or things there's going to be so many things 
17:02
accelerated in these days 
17:04
where darkness is going to be pushed back 
17:06
and that doesn't mean 
17:08
it might close completely 
17:10
but what it'll mean is darkness will be pushed out 
17:12
of places and out of 
17:14
entertainment especially 
17:16
and those who make wicked 
17:18
movies will bomb and they'll lose their shirt 
17:20
if they keep doing it 
17:22
when this whole thing shifts 
17:24
so I do 
17:26
appreciate Walt and all that he created 
17:28
for families 
17:30
if you ever go to either one of those places 
17:32
you can see his own personal comments 
17:34
on the walls in the place 
17:36
and he was so appreciated 
17:38
the people who helped to build the place 
17:40
and the ones who work there now 
17:42
his own comments about how he feels about them 
17:44
he appreciates 
17:46
all of their efforts to help everyone 
17:48
have the time to make it safe 
17:50
and he called them a team 
17:52
he never took 
17:54
direct credit for everything 
17:56
he always gave credit to everyone 
17:58
who was a part of what he did 
18:00
which I also admired in him 
18:02
that he considered everybody involved 
18:04
and he wasn't just the only one that was doing anything 
18:06
and then of course we know 
18:08
there's other people involved in that place now 
18:10
that is not Walt's plans 
18:12
or his ideas 
18:14
some of them that are being put out there now 
18:16
and even in the new things that are being made 
18:18
there's a whole entire different content 
18:20
in it 
18:22
that most believers or even good moral people 
18:24
would not appreciate 
18:26
but just wait and see 
18:28
that will also change 
18:30
I'm glad you see your Donald Duck 
18:32
it's such a special place 
18:34
they opened the doors 
18:36
the year I was born 
18:38
1955 
18:40
I met my wife across the street from Disneyland 
18:42
at the convention center 
18:44
on our honeymoon 
18:46
it's just a real special place 
18:48
and yeah 
18:50
there'll be some bad apples that'll get 
18:52
gone and it's interesting to hear what you just said 
18:54
but 
18:56
some people think well then 
18:58
this must be an evil place 
19:00
don't think that Walt Disney's 
19:02
DNA is still in that thing 
19:04
I remember hearing a story that 
19:06
that 
19:08
he and his brother Roy eventually ran the place 
19:10
after he passed 
19:12
but Roy didn't want to spend the money 
19:14
he didn't want to put gold on the top 
19:16
of the castle 
19:18
there's a point or something 
19:20
and so Walt waited until he was 
19:22
got a vacation or something and he went up there 
19:24
and had the people put gold up there 
19:26
I mean I assume 
19:28
it was gold paint but anyway 
19:30
he spent the money 
19:32
he wanted top notch 
19:34
anyway so fun 
19:36
listen I know we have to stop 
19:38
at the top of the hour because of things 
19:40
that people have to do 
19:42
but anything else you want to share before we get 
19:44
into questions 
19:46
I was 
19:48
thinking of something just a minute ago 
19:50
I did want to say 
19:52
one more thing about Disney World 
19:54
I think when you're prayed up when you go there 
19:56
you may have opportunities to 
19:58
minister to people 
20:00
I'm not saying everybody there is bad 
20:02
or wicked 
20:04
some stuff going on or being controlled 
20:06
by certain people who are not 
20:08
very good people 
20:10
and I'm not going to name names or anything 
20:12
I'm just saying keep it in your prayers 
20:14
I know Walt is declaring from heaven over it 
20:16
absolutely 
20:18
and that is something God gave him 
20:20
to create 
20:22
and he was very pleased with it 
20:24
he's not so pleased now 
20:26
but it's going to change 
20:28
I just want to encourage people to make sure 
20:30
and no matter where you go 
20:32
this is just for parents of young children 
20:34
make sure you always keep your kids with you 
20:36
make sure you see them 
20:38
and know who they're with 
20:40
please don't just drop them off at some 
20:42
friends house that you don't even know 
20:44
the friends or the family 
20:46
I would do that anyway 
20:48
I always was like that anyway 
20:50
I was always very careful with my children 
20:52
who babysat them 
20:54
but if we went to a big place we made sure 
20:56
we made rules to go in there 
20:58
to make sure we all knew where everybody was 
21:00
if a child was always with 
21:02
an adult that went with us 
21:04
and these days right now 
21:06
with all the stuff going on 
21:08
that would be a good tip 
21:10
for everybody 
21:12
really really really good 
21:14
alright well I have questions for you 
21:16
a whole list of questions here 
21:18
so let me just start with the first one 
21:20
Nathaniel asks 
21:22
and I hadn't heard of this before 
21:24
but here he goes 
21:26
he says I've heard that there are angels 
21:28
that stand at the four corners of our home 
21:30
is this true 
21:32
or are the angels all over our home 
21:34
in and out so that's his question 
21:36
I think it depends on 
21:38
where you put them 
21:40
where you post them 
21:42
you are allowed to say 
21:44
to the angels who are sent 
21:46
to protect you all the time 
21:48
you and your family 
21:50
they're sentries 
21:52
and they're posted here by your home 
21:54
and they pretty much stay around your home 
21:56
you have others that leave and go with you 
21:58
when you go places 
22:00
and I just tell them I'm going to post a sentry 
22:02
at each corner of my home 
22:04
I'm going to post so many over the home 
22:06
and even down the road 
22:08
and they actually go there and that's what they do 
22:10
they watch for anything of darkness coming 
22:12
they pull down strongholds 
22:14
they shred platforms 
22:16
trying to control us 
22:18
spirits of wickedness or whatever 
22:20
of darkness that want to control us 
22:22
or take things from us 
22:24
so they do both 
22:26
they will even march around 
22:28
on your property and watch it all the time 
22:30
or you can post them as sentries 
22:32
in certain places and if you have a second place 
22:34
you can also post sentries there 
22:36
and that is their number one job 
22:38
which will protect that area that they're assigned to 
22:40
that's really good 
22:42
you know I live on acreage 
22:44
that's not all my acreage 
22:46
there's actually a few hundred acres 
22:48
it belongs to the neighbors 
22:50
but in order to keep the dare out 
22:52
I'm involved inside the fence 
22:54
so they put a fence around it 
22:56
I didn't realize this about sentries 
22:58
this is the first time I've heard you say that 
23:00
that I can recall 
23:02
but I felt I was supposed to post sentries 
23:04
and I used that word 
23:06
at every post on the fence 
23:08
around all the property 
23:10
my neighbors as well 
23:12
I said if anyone gets anywhere near us 
23:14
to try to do harm 
23:16
I want them to see these sentries as 
23:18
and I said 
23:20
let them think they're police officers 
23:22
let them whatever 
23:24
if they try to do harm 
23:26
so I don't know what you think about that 
23:28
well you can actually 
23:30
also tell them to expose anyone 
23:32
who's coming, why they're coming 
23:34
and they actually can stop them from coming 
23:36
they'll actually stop them 
23:38
they'll actually interfere with someone trying to 
23:40
come in on the property 
23:42
and that might be appearing them 
23:44
that might be them saying something 
23:46
and even if they can't see them 
23:48
they would hear that 
23:50
so that's what sentries do 
23:52
is keep things away from you 
23:54
and to make sure that your life 
23:56
and your property is safe 
23:58
so you did the right thing by posting sentries 
24:00
that's really good 
24:02
I got really serious one day 
24:04
because there had been 
24:06
evidence of an invasion 
24:08
and I thought I'm not having this 
24:10
I went to town 
24:12
I took off after that 
24:14
alright Star is asking this question 
24:16
she says some of us 
24:18
write letters to God 
24:20
just simply write things down 
24:22
to Him, to God 
24:24
does the Father receive those letters 
24:26
and if He does how does He receive them 
24:30
there's several different ways that can happen 
24:32
I would encourage you if you wrote one 
24:34
read it out loud to Him 
24:36
you can do that when you're just by yourself 
24:38
in your prayer time or just in the time 
24:40
when you're walking or just doing something 
24:42
you can actually read it to Him 
24:44
say Father I have written this letter to you 
24:46
and read it to Him 
24:48
and it's going to hear you 
24:50
read that letter 
24:52
and they probably record it 
24:54
it's probably recorded in heaven 
24:56
they do a lot of recording there's angels 
24:58
that's what they do and they're sent for that 
25:00
they actually record things 
25:02
there's couriers, there's scribes 
25:04
who write things down 
25:06
or else they write things down and you say 
25:08
or they bring messages from heaven 
25:10
that are written 
25:12
I've had both of those happen to me before 
25:14
but absolutely 
25:16
I'm just standing in a spot and just say 
25:18
to your family member 
25:20
I love you, I just want you to know I haven't forgotten you 
25:22
I'm excited about one day being there with you 
25:24
then He'll make sure they hear that 
25:26
people think everything's so far away 
25:28
but especially the Father, the Son of the Holy Spirit 
25:30
if you wanted to really say something to them 
25:32
He loves, by the way 
25:34
writing that thing down 
25:36
is an MO 
25:38
it's a motive operations of the Father 
25:40
He does have 
25:42
we know He has the lamest book of life 
25:44
we know that He has a book of remembrance 
25:46
He actually has many and they're real books 
25:48
they're huge books and He does actually 
25:50
write in them, He likes to write things out 
25:52
Christ would rather say it 
25:56
but the Father writes things down 
25:58
you know He wrote a book about your life 
26:00
before you were even born 
26:02
so I would say you writing things down 
26:04
maybe a good thing would be to get a journal 
26:06
and if you think of something 
26:08
each day to say something to Him 
26:10
then you write down the date and what you wanted 
26:12
to say to Him and make sure He hears that 
26:14
and the other thing you can do with that journal 
26:16
is when He begins to answer you 
26:18
it may be 
26:20
that still small voice inside 
26:22
but you know it's Him answering because He's answering 
26:24
what you just said to Him 
26:26
so that way you can have a two-way 
26:28
conversation and you can record it 
26:30
in a journal and then you can enjoy 
26:32
looking at it later on 
26:34
or maybe leave that for your children one day 
26:36
and they might be surprised if that's said to you 
26:38
or what you said to Him 
26:40
so authorship 
26:42
is a really big thing in heaven 
26:44
everyone has written a book 
26:46
that represents God or heaven 
26:48
or just something really fun 
26:50
but decent they're already on 
26:52
library shelves and your books are already 
26:54
in heaven 
26:56
do you mean everyone's 
26:58
written a book whether they've written it here 
27:00
or not what do you mean by that 
27:02
you said everyone 
27:04
some people still write books in heaven 
27:06
do you 
27:08
but are you saying people that 
27:10
don't write here are actually 
27:12
in effect authoring 
27:14
a book there I'm not quite sure what you're saying 
27:16
what I'm saying is those who 
27:18
have authored a book here 
27:20
those books 
27:22
I saw my own books 
27:24
in a library in heaven 
27:26
so I do know and I was told 
27:28
those who become authors is so 
27:30
important because even when 
27:32
you're gone that book 
27:34
remains here and those words will still 
27:36
be read by people and it may be 
27:38
something spiritual 
27:40
or it could be something just 
27:42
a help book or just something 
27:44
funny that's really decent and people 
27:46
love to read and there's still people 
27:48
who read books at all so you can go get them out of the library 
27:50
or you can just request 
27:52
to have one yourself there in heaven 
27:54
and you have a place for a library in your own 
27:56
mansion so people still 
27:58
still love to read 
28:00
well I thought it was cool when 
28:02
Bill Johnson had my book 
28:04
in his library if my book is in heaven 
28:06
that's way cooler 
28:08
yeah that's very 
28:10
very cool okay let me 
28:12
come back for a moment to 
28:14
this just popped into my head 
28:16
I think I'm supposed to share it like so it's almost 
28:18
15 years ago I didn't know you 
28:20
yet I hadn't heard about either 
28:22
sentries or hosts 
28:24
but I was a praying man 
28:26
and my oldest daughter 
28:28
got in trouble she gave her 
28:30
phone number to a guy 
28:32
in the market 
28:34
and I was furious not at her 
28:36
but that this would happen 
28:38
that he would have it and he started calling 
28:40
and I 
28:42
ripped into the spirit realm 
28:44
and I prayed every prayer 
28:46
every kind of emotion 
28:48
about I wanted God to take 
28:50
it take notice 
28:52
and take action and 
28:54
protect her does God 
28:56
pay attention to the 
28:58
the amount 
29:00
to me there was faith behind that emotion 
29:02
because I knew God would act 
29:04
does God pay attention to our 
29:06
how do I say this 
29:08
angry faith if I can put it that way 
29:10
angry against the devil is what I mean 
29:12
I would say that's called 
29:14
passionate 
29:16
you're fierce against what the enemy is doing 
29:18
of course the fathers can hear you 
29:20
I'm absolutely sure 
29:22
many times he's going to answer that prayer 
29:24
and it may not be the way you think it will 
29:26
happen but it will happen 
29:28
and I've also seen that 
29:30
but you know passionate people 
29:32
God those people who have a passion 
29:34
and you're expressing what you're 
29:36
feeling and what you're thinking 
29:38
especially if it's something that lines up with 
29:40
what God wants and he speaks 
29:42
in this word about protecting and guarding 
29:44
your words and 
29:46
keeping certain people away 
29:48
from you because he doesn't want 
29:50
your family life infiltrated 
29:52
by the enemy 
29:54
or a thing that the enemy could use 
29:56
against you so absolutely 
29:58
especially the words of a parent 
30:00
for the child he's absolutely going to 
30:02
pay attention to that 
30:04
that's kind of like you hear about 
30:06
mama bear I became papa bear 
30:08
I can't 
30:10
remember any time in all of my 
30:12
life I prayed that intensely 
30:14
for my daughter but I 
30:16
felt there was an urgency 
30:18
so I let it rip 
30:20
alright 
30:22
Margaret asked is God 
30:24
the father 
30:26
and or heaven 
30:28
going through time with us 
30:30
on the earth even though the father 
30:32
can move back and forth in and out of time 
30:34
is there a sense of past 
30:36
present and future 
30:38
to Jesus Holy Spirit and the people 
30:40
in heaven so I think 
30:42
I understand where they're coming from do they 
30:44
get a sense of time 
30:46
because we're in time 
30:48
I'm quite sure heaven 
30:50
is very much aware of what's going on 
30:52
in any time 
30:54
actually 
30:56
the father's omnipresent 
30:58
he knows exactly what's going on 
31:00
where's going on and everything so he 
31:02
he has to be aware of what's going on 
31:04
so he can send help 
31:06
or send words or scribes 
31:08
or couriers for whatever 
31:10
purpose so yes he is very 
31:12
much aware even though 
31:14
he's not held by time 
31:16
or bound by time and doesn't 
31:18
operate like the way we 
31:20
operate here in time 
31:22
we have hours we're awake and hours we're sleep 
31:24
they don't sleep in heaven they don't have to 
31:26
but he's still very much aware of what's going on 
31:28
and all over the earth at different times 
31:30
on the earth so yes 
31:32
he's like he's present all the time 
31:34
no matter where we are what's going on 
31:36
and of course he can still go into 
31:38
the past and see things he can go into 
31:40
the future and see things the Bible says 
31:42
he's been from the beginning 
31:44
there would be time 
31:46
from the beginning to the end 
31:48
there is a beginning of time 
31:50
that was right when he 
31:52
first made the earth the end of time 
31:54
is when he wraps it all up and then he makes 
31:56
the new earth and then we're just 
31:58
in eternity we'll be in eternity 
32:00
but during this time 
32:02
I said time during 
32:04
this seasons of our life 
32:06
where time is very much 
32:08
involved with us with heaven 
32:10
then they are seeing things 
32:12
all the time as it's going 
32:14
by but he also knows 
32:16
the end of things at the same time 
32:18
so it's like 
32:20
if we're 
32:22
agonizing in prayer for something to happen 
32:24
that we want or think we need 
32:26
or we do need 
32:28
and there is a sense where God will 
32:30
say 
32:32
it's not time yet for that 
32:34
he'll know that it's 
32:36
three months in the future so he does 
32:38
operate within 
32:40
that framework he knows that this is 
32:42
for three months from now 
32:44
that kind of thing 
32:46
he already knows that he already knows 
32:48
when things are going to happen 
32:50
and even what's going to happen 
32:52
even though people have wills of their own 
32:54
he's already actually been through all of time 
32:56
he's seen all of time already 
32:58
but right now as we're speaking 
33:00
he is watching and he's listening 
33:02
so he can 
33:04
be anywhere at the same time 
33:06
that's one of the great things about him 
33:08
so he's very much involved in our lives 
33:10
at the same time 
33:12
and even does know 
33:14
what that end looks like 
33:16
and I've already told people 
33:18
that he actually did show me 
33:20
when the end of time would be 
33:22
and it's not really a date 
33:24
it's an event 
33:26
and I've learned that about him 
33:28
most of the things he plans 
33:30
and things for on the earth 
33:32
he goes by those events that he has planned 
33:34
and those are things that will happen 
33:36
in the earth 
33:38
that he has planned are going to happen 
33:40
but he did tell me one time 
33:42
he said there will be a day that will come 
33:44
when time will be no more 
33:46
because I won't need time 
33:48
and you won't need time 
33:50
on the earth on the new earth 
33:52
we won't have a clock 
33:54
we won't have things like that going on 
33:56
we will be living forever 
33:58
and we will also plan things by events 
34:00
at that time on the new earth 
34:02
but when everything ends 
34:04
is when time will be no more 
34:06
because he doesn't need 
34:08
time on this earth 
34:10
the reason he needs time now 
34:12
is because he's sending those little spirits 
34:14
from him, that's where everybody came from 
34:16
you lived in him 
34:18
but this is what he said 
34:20
time will be no more 
34:22
when I have sent the last one from myself 
34:24
I won't need time 
34:26
that's good 
34:28
I have a question about time 
34:30
now that we're on the subject 
34:32
Manuel Johnson talks about 
34:34
he's been transported 
34:36
in the future and the past 
34:38
so have you 
34:40
well God took him in the past 
34:42
he transported him in the past 
34:44
he showed him what happened 
34:46
he was there 
34:48
and it brought healing to his soul 
34:50
because God showed him 
34:52
this and that 
34:54
I don't know the whole story 
34:56
because I'm probably not doing it justice 
34:58
but great healing came to him 
35:00
by God taking him back in time 
35:02
does God 
35:04
do that sometimes 
35:06
does he see 
35:08
a need to bring someone back 
35:10
in time 
35:12
I think that he probably does 
35:14
because I know several other people 
35:16
who have encounters like that 
35:18
and 
35:20
I have been taken back in time quite a few times 
35:22
it was all related 
35:24
to things that happened in the Word of God 
35:26
or the way he made heaven 
35:28
the way he made the earth 
35:30
it was always related to revelation 
35:32
when he takes me back in time 
35:34
like he showed me his son on the cross 
35:36
and what happened when he had his spirit leave 
35:38
he took me back 
35:40
and I saw paradise or Abraham's bosom 
35:42
while he was there with the thief 
35:44
I saw him 
35:46
also when he was in hell 
35:48
approached the gates of hell 
35:50
and they were taking him and I saw what happened on the third day 
35:52
I was taken back 
35:54
back in the book of Acts 
35:56
when the Holy Spirit came and invaded 
35:58
in the upper room 
36:00
I mean there's many times he's taken me back 
36:02
I was taken back to the tomb 
36:04
the very day 
36:06
that he came out of that tomb 
36:08
I was taken that day back in time 
36:10
and I actually felt myself traveling 
36:12
it was the one time I felt myself traveling through time 
36:14
and I told people 
36:16
it was like on Star Trek or Star Wars 
36:18
when you go warp speed 
36:20
and those like shoot past you 
36:22
it is exactly like that 
36:24
I know they probably got that idea 
36:26
from the idea zone in heaven 
36:28
about how it looks like when you travel 
36:30
but it actually did 
36:32
and I actually could feel myself moving 
36:34
whenever we got to the part of time 
36:36
God wanted me to see 
36:38
we stopped and my feet just touched the ground 
36:40
crazy 
36:42
and it's like a portal open 
36:44
and I was there 
36:46
I was literally there in that time 
36:48
and I saw Mary go into the tomb 
36:50
looking for him 
36:52
and she saw the person in the garden 
36:54
and she came out and she thought he was the gardener 
36:56
because Christ was actually standing 
36:58
in the flowerbed smelling 
37:00
the flowers 
37:02
when these things happen 
37:04
both that and all the other 
37:06
back in time 
37:08
to be very very clear 
37:10
you went 
37:12
in that time 
37:14
this wasn't a vision 
37:16
a 3D experience 
37:18
you actually were there during the time 
37:20
it actually 
37:22
I was actually there 
37:24
I was wide awake 
37:26
I don't sleep long enough to dream 
37:28
I almost never dream 
37:30
and I have sometimes 
37:32
visions but this is called 
37:34
an encounter 
37:36
an encounter is you are actually 
37:38
there 
37:40
he's not showing me a film 
37:42
my feet touched the ground 
37:44
outside the tomb 
37:46
I saw the stone had been rolled away 
37:48
it was actually quite a ways down thing 
37:50
I also saw Christ standing 
37:52
he has a back turn to 
37:54
where the tomb was 
37:56
and he was literally looking at the flowers 
37:58
because he loves flowers 
38:00
and he had just been through 3 days of you know what 
38:02
and so when he came out of there 
38:04
after thanking his father 
38:06
for all that he had done for him 
38:08
he wanted to be in the midst of the flowers 
38:10
and I actually say 
38:12
Mary surmised 
38:14
or thought he was the gardener 
38:16
and she spoke to him 
38:18
she said her name 
38:20
she knew instantly when she heard him speak 
38:22
that it was him and then he turned around 
38:24
and of course she saw him then 
38:26
and I saw that 
38:28
in person, in that time 
38:30
that's how it happens people 
38:32
and instead of bashing people 
38:34
saying why not ask God to give you an encounter 
38:36
and show you something powerful 
38:38
I've been taking it up many many times 
38:40
for me and I didn't take myself 
38:42
I have to make it clear 
38:44
I didn't take myself 
38:46
that God had purpose for me 
38:48
and he'd already told me we're going to take you back 
38:50
in time, forward in time 
38:52
we're going to give you revelation on the word 
38:54
revelation on the times you're in 
38:56
and show you things to come 
38:58
and if you remember in Revelation 4 
39:00
he actually said that to John 
39:02
I will show you things to come 
39:04
and so that's one of the things that God does 
39:06
with his prophets 
39:08
and so I was literally there 
39:10
in person remember the feeling of the ground 
39:12
the smell of the flowers 
39:14
everything about that place 
39:16
amazing 
39:18
Bobby Connor tells a story 
39:20
about going to the crucifixion 
39:22
not a vision 
39:24
not a 3D idea 
39:26
he was actually there and he said 
39:28
the smells 
39:30
the sights, the sounds 
39:32
you know 
39:34
have you been to the crucifixion as well? 
39:38
I saw a part of the crucifixion 
39:40
it was more what I heard him saying 
39:42
and 
39:44
they were of course 
39:46
very upset that he had died 
39:48
but we know that he actually 
39:50
the thing about Christ was 
39:52
he was such a powerful being 
39:54
he had to lose his soul 
39:56
from his body 
39:58
he actually had to tell it to leave 
40:00
he knew he had to die 
40:02
and so 
40:04
they probably were wondering why in the world hasn't that guy died 
40:06
they even put the sword inside and everything 
40:08
but he finally knew that it was time 
40:10
so he just lost his soul 
40:12
from his body 
40:14
and his spirit man left his body 
40:16
and then of course he was there 
40:18
his body remained on the cross until they took it down 
40:20
they were wrapping it 
40:22
the women were crying 
40:24
John was 
40:26
but John remembered also 
40:28
the words Christ said that he would rise again 
40:30
and so it was a very powerful thing 
40:32
people in the city 
40:34
people I could hear crying 
40:36
in the whole area there 
40:38
that he had died 
40:40
because they loved him so much 
40:42
he had helped so many people 
40:44
and did so many miracles 
40:46
they said you couldn't even put him in a book 
40:48
there were so many people count the miracles 
40:50
it says if the books were written 
40:52
of all the things he did 
40:54
the books would go around the world 
40:56
like the planet people 
40:58
so he was non-stop 
41:00
all the time doing his work 
41:02
that God gave him to do 
41:04
and so it was an emotional time 
41:06
but of course I already knew 
41:08
that he was going to raise from the dead 
41:10
but I had visited that place 
41:12
and then of course 
41:14
I was taken back 
41:16
when he came out of the tomb 
41:18
and then I was taken back 
41:20
when he was down in hell 
41:22
and then I was taken back 
41:24
I was taken back in time when he actually 
41:26
was sent into heaven 
41:28
and one of the angels had this urn with his blood 
41:30
because he had to pour that out on the mercy seat in heaven 
41:32
and so he showed me these things 
41:34
and he showed me the reality 
41:36
of the word of God 
41:38
it was so powerful 
41:40
but yes I have encounters 
41:42
he clearly comes and takes me 
41:44
just takes me 
41:46
like in a second and it doesn't matter where I am 
41:48
really and I gave him permission 
41:50
so it might be better if you say I give you permission 
41:52
to take me whenever you want to 
41:54
or speak to me whenever you want to 
41:56
that encourages him to do it actually 
41:58
and I don't even say that to him 
42:00
when he told me this is what we're going to have you do 
42:02
commission on the earth as a revelator 
42:04
this is what you're going to do and I said I'd give you permission 
42:06
whenever you want to 
42:08
and I guess while we're talking about 
42:10
time okay now you got me 
42:12
I have heard 
42:14
you and others talk about 
42:16
okay he said 
42:18
to the thief that was saved 
42:20
that became saved 
42:22
he said I'm telling you this day 
42:24
today you will be with me 
42:26
in paradise he didn't say in hell 
42:28
he said in paradise 
42:30
I have not heard anyone say 
42:32
during those three days 
42:34
what did he do 
42:36
in paradise 
42:38
no one's ever really related that 
42:40
to me at least 
42:42
well the first thing he did was preach the gospel to all of them 
42:46
it said he 
42:48
it said that he took captivity 
42:50
captive 
42:52
the captivity that was 
42:54
it was called Abraham's wisdom and paradise 
42:56
it is the same place 
42:58
where the dead 
43:00
we died if you were faithful and knew God 
43:02
and believed in God himself 
43:04
this is before the Messiah came 
43:06
God counted that your faith 
43:08
as being you know 
43:10
you were just and you were faithful 
43:12
so he didn't send them to hell 
43:14
they couldn't ascend to heaven though 
43:16
because Christ hadn't gone back to heaven 
43:18
pour out the blood except of course we know Elijah 
43:20
and Enoch literally were taken to heaven 
43:22
in their bodies and they're still there in the physical bodies 
43:24
I believe that they were glorified 
43:26
when he took them up to heaven already 
43:28
because they didn't have to die 
43:30
and that was the Father's choice to do that 
43:32
but 
43:34
but it is quite a thing 
43:36
for God to trust you to do things 
43:38
and share things for him 
43:40
but yes 
43:42
but that's his choice to take me 
43:44
I don't take myself 
43:46
but he actually entered into paradise 
43:48
because he had to keep his word 
43:50
to the thief 
43:52
thank you Holy Spirit said the XT 
43:54
he had to keep his word 
43:56
and he didn't say I'll see you tomorrow 
43:58
he said this day 
44:00
that day 
44:02
that day 
44:04
and so when he died 
44:06
they actually 
44:08
I think he died before the thieves 
44:10
didn't they have to come break their legs so they would die 
44:12
I think so because they had to break the legs 
44:14
and all that with the thieves 
44:16
so Christ descended into paradise 
44:18
paradise 
44:20
was not a place with rocks 
44:22
and you think well it's in the earth 
44:24
there's a bunch of rocks sitting around 
44:26
it was a city 
44:28
it was a beautiful city God made 
44:30
faithful 
44:32
and that's where his friends he called 
44:34
Abraham you know that was his friend 
44:36
many others of 
44:38
back in the Old Testament were friends of God 
44:40
because they chose to be friends 
44:42
of God and he didn't send them to hell 
44:44
they still had to 
44:46
they had to descend though 
44:48
when you believe in Christ now 
44:50
and you die you don't descend at all 
44:52
you ascend 
44:54
into heaven that's where he does the big difference 
44:56
because Christ has been there 
44:58
he made the way back 
45:00
he cleansed it he put the blood 
45:02
on the altar showing that he had 
45:04
died for everyone's sins 
45:06
and so that changed everything about 
45:08
for those who died that believed in Christ it changed 
45:10
some things happen that change 
45:12
everything and so 
45:14
yes he did go down there he was talking 
45:16
to Abraham he was talking to Joseph 
45:18
who raised him 
45:20
he was talking to all those people 
45:22
the faith of David all of those 
45:24
were in paradise and at one 
45:26
point they all exited 
45:28
and left paradise 
45:30
is empty now there's nothing there it's 
45:32
still there people actually 
45:34
asked me would Satan take it over he doesn't 
45:36
have the ability to take 
45:38
paradise over that's like 
45:40
a holy place that God made 
45:42
for those who loved him and believed in him 
45:44
and no hell can't take 
45:46
paradise and use it people 
45:48
he's never going to get paradise 
45:50
so he would have taken 
45:52
Joseph the one who was sold 
45:54
in Egypt 
45:56
he would have taken David 
45:58
Solomon and he would have preached 
46:00
the gospel and said this is what 
46:02
it means to be saved 
46:04
this is what I had to do that 
46:06
kind of thing he would have told the whole story 
46:08
he literally changed the gospel as if 
46:10
you tell people 
46:12
that Jesus Christ gave his life 
46:14
that he gave his life so 
46:16
that we might have a way to go back 
46:18
to heaven where we all came from 
46:20
there had to be a prize 
46:22
paid there had to be a sacrifice made 
46:24
and he actually told all of them 
46:26
they had like a gathering and he 
46:28
just preached the gospel to everybody there 
46:30
and everyone there received 
46:32
him as their Messiah 
46:34
they had to receive him as 
46:36
their Messiah because that's what 
46:38
makes it possible for you to go 
46:40
you know to go into heaven 
46:42
and so he did he preached the gospel 
46:44
he said he preached the gospel 
46:46
and so then he took captivity 
46:48
he captivated them 
46:50
with his love and his sacrifice 
46:52
for all for all those 
46:54
who choose him and so they then 
46:56
eventually they did 
46:58
exit Abraham's bosom 
47:00
or paradise 
47:02
and they are all now in heaven 
47:04
they don't use that anymore 
47:06
it's not used but it is still there 
47:08
it had golden buildings 
47:10
it actually had a river 
47:12
now these are spiritual places 
47:14
because you're there in your spiritual body 
47:16
I will explain to people the difference 
47:18
of being in the flesh and being in the spirit 
47:20
you have a spiritual body 
47:22
and it looks like you but it looks a lot better 
47:24
you look young you're full of energy 
47:26
and life and so 
47:28
when you died you entered into this 
47:30
spiritual round place that was paradise 
47:32
or if you were wicked 
47:34
there's a great gulf that separates those places 
47:36
I think the people 
47:38
in paradise can see the gates of hell 
47:40
and they know hell if they come up 
47:42
to the gates can see 
47:44
like it's like 
47:46
I can't think of what you call it 
47:48
a balcony they see like this big 
47:50
balcony that they can see in a far 
47:52
distance because remember the dream 
47:54
that the wicked man had 
47:56
and he wanted the beggar to bring a drop 
47:58
of water and put it on his tongue 
48:00
burning in hell that dream 
48:02
was real that was real 
48:04
and that's a good way to explain 
48:06
you read that dream and see what happened 
48:08
there was a hell he was burning in hell 
48:10
and he was telling God please send 
48:12
someone to 
48:14
earth to tell them about this place 
48:16
it's horrible I don't want my family to come 
48:18
here and of course God's answer 
48:20
to him was it wouldn't matter who came 
48:22
they're wicked in their heart and they 
48:24
don't want it 
48:26
and he said so that but he would not send 
48:28
Lazarus who was a beggar 
48:30
who was a beggar on the earth and he was 
48:32
they could see that he's eating 
48:34
he knew they were eating there's like 
48:36
a king's table a feast set there 
48:38
you still eat in your spiritual body 
48:40
people in heaven and these 
48:42
people in paradise were eating they had 
48:44
buildings that they stayed in 
48:46
they had a beautiful river they even had a 
48:48
sky because it was a spiritual 
48:50
place oh wow okay 
48:52
of the year he wouldn't take his 
48:54
friends who actually believed 
48:56
in him and lived right 
48:58
he wouldn't send them to place 
49:00
it was a dark money place here you 
49:02
are in the middle of the earth sitting next to the lava 
49:04
that wasn't going to happen 
49:06
God made this place beautiful 
49:08
and it and it was beautiful 
49:10
let me ask this one last question because 
49:12
I know we have to stop at the top of the hour 
49:14
there was a great earthquake 
49:16
when Jesus was crucified 
49:18
and graves were open what have you 
49:20
seen if anything 
49:22
as far as that have you seen 
49:24
that event 
49:26
graves open the earthquake I know 
49:28
it didn't happen I know that the 
49:30
earthquake was shook and graves 
49:32
open and people saw 
49:34
I'm trying to remember I don't know if they gave a number 
49:36
or something but it was quite a few 
49:38
it was quite a few hundred I believe 
49:40
they were actually noted 
49:42
it was noted and written somewhere I don't know 
49:44
maybe Josephus or somebody wrote that down 
49:46
but it does mention in the Bible that 
49:48
they had an earthquake and the graves were 
49:50
opened and they saw people walk it was just 
49:52
another testimony that that was 
49:54
the son of God I mean a lot of people 
49:56
began to believe that was the son of God 
49:58
cross that was the son of God 
50:00
because he knows that couldn't have happened any other way 
50:02
so that really did happen 
50:04
people came up out of the graves and they walked around 
50:06
it was fascinating 
50:08
it was fascinating 
50:10
but you know it's interesting because 
50:12
you know it shows integrity 
50:14
on your part because you're not making it up 
50:16
if God didn't show you 
50:18
you're not saying God showed me 
50:20
you're saying I didn't see people walking out 
50:22
of the grave 
50:24
people walking out of the graves when there was 
50:26
an earthquake so that to me 
50:28
that adds credibility to you 
50:30
because you could make something out of it 
50:32
I wasn't taking and showing those people walking 
50:34
but I do know that did happen 
50:36
I do know that did happen 
50:38
they still talk about it in heaven sometimes 
50:40
wow I'd love to see a video of that 
50:42
and I guess in heaven we get to see 
50:44
replays that we want right 
50:46
if we want to see what that looks like 
50:48
absolutely can see replays 
50:50
awesome I like 
50:52
those are the kind of re-runs I want to see 
50:54
that if you will 
50:56
pray for the people 
50:58
before we go and just 
51:00
bless them if you will 
51:02
Father I thank you for this 
51:04
beautiful day I thank you for your 
51:06
holy son our king 
51:08
of kings I thank you for 
51:10
Holy Spirit who can be 
51:12
our best friend but is still God 
51:14
he was sent to come alongside 
51:16
us and then when we choose to invite 
51:18
him to indwell us he actually 
51:20
moves on the inside of us and then 
51:22
he'll never stop talking to us 
51:24
but I thank you for that 
51:26
that you are very much involved in our lives 
51:28
and you do care for everyone 
51:30
and I 
51:32
pray Father that people 
51:34
have to understand they need to understand 
51:36
that when they have 
51:38
someone who belongs to Jesus Christ 
51:40
and they receive Jesus Christ 
51:42
when they move to heaven it is 
51:44
a good thing 
51:46
it is a good thing for them 
51:48
that's why they celebrate in heaven 
51:50
they don't weep and cry when someone comes home 
51:52
they celebrate 
51:54
because God loves it when one of his children 
51:56
come home one of his sons or his daughters 
51:58
they come home to heaven they actually have 
52:00
a huge celebration rewards are given 
52:02
from the throne at that time and then 
52:04
all their family and friends go to see 
52:06
this person's mansion and then they get 
52:08
undone by how beautiful and amazing 
52:10
or adventurous even 
52:12
these mansions are so powerful 
52:14
thank you Father for thinking of us in the 
52:16
past now in this time 
52:18
and in the future you know where we are 
52:20
you know that we love you 
52:22
I thank you in these days 
52:24
set a table 
52:26
and the presence of everyone's enemies 
52:28
that would be the left 
52:30
that would be the liberals 
52:32
all those evil people colluding 
52:34
and flaming together to take over 
52:36
this world which makes me laugh 
52:38
ha ha ha 
52:40
because this earth was 
52:42
made by you and your son 
52:44
and it says the earth and the focus 
52:46
now belongs to Jesus Christ 
52:48
the earth is your footstool 
52:50
because 
52:52
you're ever watching us 
52:54
thank you for intervening in lives 
52:56
people have lost things like 
52:58
their property or their 
53:00
money is running low I thank you 
53:02
right now you take out 
53:04
of your own stock 
53:06
and you give to those people 
53:08
Father because they're trusting you 
53:10
they're believing you and they're 
53:12
staying excited I thank you 
53:14
for showing yourself strong on their path 
53:16
in these days right now 
53:18
in Jesus name 
53:20
so be it 
53:22
and everyone said 
53:24
amen and amen 
53:26
I just want to encourage people to go to 
53:28
revealingheaven.com 
53:30

53:36

53:58

54:00

54:26

54:28

01:00
You 
01:31
Welcome to Elijah streams. It happens to be Tuesday, August 16, but we're recording this for a week from Wednesday 
01:42
So whatever that date is someone can put that on the screen for me. I forgot to look that up, but August this is for August 24 
01:52
Even though we're recording it on August 16. So we're on with cat. It's going to be good. So if anything she says happens to be 
02:02
Historically incorrect because more things have happened. You'll understand why so it's going to be a great show 
02:08
There's no I have no other announcement. So let's 
02:12
If you all are ready, I'm ready. So let's watch Wednesdays with cat and Steve. Here we go 
02:32
Well, hello, I don't know which to say happy Wednesday. I can't say that because it's not 
02:42
How are you doing cat you just I'm doing great. That's always gonna be my answer 
02:48
You got your you were just telling me got a brand new scarf and shirt. Is that we were saying I have everything new. Okay, the jacket which is really cool 
02:58
You can't see. There you go. You can see powers really beautifully engraved. I just got that yesterday in the shirt which I would have worn on the platform 
03:08
And my scarf and yeah I was going to the salon today and the Holy Spirit said you were in that brand new black shirt looks really nice and you wear the new jacket and I'm thinking 
03:18
I think it could get wet. You never know when you're going to go to salon was going to happen. He said no, go ahead and wear it. Not telling me why and I'm sitting in there in the chair at the salon and she's almost done with me 
03:30
When I get it when I get a call and say did you remember that you had to record something with Steve Schultz? 
03:38
No, I didn't but now I know why he told me to wear this. I walked in the door literally walked in the door and just sat in the chair so Holy Spirit needs to be your best friend. Let me tell you he'll let you know all kinds of things you wouldn't expect that he would 
03:51
And so here I am today and that's very cool. You know lately Darin and I have been practicing that every not I was I was about to say every once in a while very often now all of a sudden I'll remember something 
04:07
We went to bed and it gets cold in a certain part of our house even though it's summer and she went to bed and she and she said I think I might have left the heater on that little portable heater so she went out there and she said the Holy Spirit keeps telling me stuff but it's not like a voice 
04:25
necessarily she just all of a sudden she thinks about inside that's what yeah exactly so I keep saying thank you thank you Holy Spirit thank you, you know, I think him today. 
04:38
That's awesome. So, so it's I would encourage people when you suddenly remember something and it was important, say thank you Holy Spirit right. Yes, absolutely say thank you. 
04:51
You're so so good and he likes gratitude I found that out so. Yes, he does that that that will intensify the actual friendship one if you're thanking him all the time. 
05:03
Oh yeah, I do thank him all the time I think him the father of something I think I think I think them I think the Trinity. 
05:11
Sometimes it's the father of the Lord, most of the time the Holy Spirit is when he talks to me about every day stuff, or even reminds me of things and like I can't lose anything no matter what I can't find. 
05:23
He either shows me where it's at literally a picture of where it's at, or it just comes back. It just comes back. What do you mean it comes back what do you mean. 
05:33
If I found if I've misplaced something really important and I really need it. And I've looked a little bit for it. Well there's something I always say you all need to just learn this. 
05:44
If I can't find something I always say these words, and they always work. It's not the word is what you're saying. And I say Holy Spirit you know where everything is it was ever made that is made right now and never will be made. 
05:59
Please show me where and I say what it is where it is now. And in that moment he literally shows me like a vision of where it's sitting laying or even underneath something. He does it immediately and I say thank you so much for showing me where that is. 
06:14
Because I give him an opportunity to do something for me by saying that. 
06:19
So that's asking you have not because you asked not so I'm literally asking him. But first I'm telling them who I tell him who he is. And what he does know he knows everything that was ever made. 
06:30
No matter where it is in time he knows he knows what's made right now and he knows what's going to be made in the whole. 
06:37
The best person to ask first before you run around an hour looking say that first and just say I ask you to show to me right now. And he'll either show me or someone will yell I found whatever. 
06:50
Oh wow. 
06:52
But it's like it's something that's very quickly done immediately when I when I honor him for who he is and then I ask. 
06:58
I think that's that's one of the meanings where it says in the scriptures before you call I will answer. It's like he knows you're about to call he knows your words are forming and he already starts forming this picture. 
07:13
Lord show me that years ago and I and so when I ask him something I don't try to wait for a long time I try to listen to what the very first thought because before I call him he's going to answer so that's very very cool so awesome. 
07:29
Well you've got some thought maybe a few thoughts on your heart for when people will watch this so share that before we get into questions if you want to. 
07:39
I do actually. My husband was driving me to the salon and you know the traffic's backed up like crazy everywhere around here. They're building a few new things so the streets are backed up. 
07:51
And also if it's the time like when school lets out there's always going to be traffic somewhere in this city. And so we had a lot of time in line we were sitting in line in the traffic but I never complain when that happened. 
08:03
And so the father starts speaking to me immediately and then he took me from. I wasn't in the truck. I was taken to this place and shown something he wants me to share so I'm going to share it with everybody first time ever like just happened to me maybe an hour ago or so. 
08:21
He took me he caught me up and put me on this long winding road I didn't even know where I was at and in front of me was where I had been he said I want you to see where you've come from he said I'm going to show you a journey. 
08:35
And so I saw this long road in front of me and then all the way up where these red streaks he said that's the blood of Christ that never leaves you all the way up to my feet they came and then he said now you may turn and see where you're headed. 
08:50
And when I turned I saw still some more road because this is my journey remember I saw more road in front of me but it got more and more transparent and then I could see shortly in the distance the city of God which would be the throne room or all the beauty and splendor is 
09:07
in heaven I saw that and he said everyone who belongs to me needs to know that this is your destination he was saying not just mine everyone is a believer that is your destination this is what he said to me. 
09:21
Everyone should love one another now because I actually say the world will know you by your love for each other stop fighting. 
09:29
Stop arguing stop picking on each other stop saying things aren't even true about each other. He said you spend your time loving. So when you reach that destination, there will be an even greater celebration that you chose to love on another and be a testimony to who I am. 
09:47
And I was so undone because the splendor that looked just like the city of God that's what I call heaven city in heaven. It was like the city of God I saw all the time I could see streets of gold I could see the glorious buildings 
10:03
that were in the air they're not even on the ground I clearly knew where that was but that's what he was saying. Anyone who's a believer that's our destination we're all going to the same place. Okay this is what else he said your body may die but that's not you. 
10:20
That's part of your covering. He said your spirit man and your soul never dies so all those if you recently had someone passed to heaven I've had three really good friends recently like even in the last week somebody met passed on to heaven. 
10:35
And you know she was like in her fifties and yet she was not just ready her mansion was done and she went and I was celebrating I always celebrate when somebody goes to heaven so I have that I understand that is our home we will go there until he makes the 
10:51
way we were but this is our destination we're on a journey together that's what he's trying to say to me he was very adamant this is a journey you're doing together where you've been and then where you're going your destiny where you're going your destination is all the same destination. 
11:06
But what you do now matters it doesn't matter and having a matters how we treat each other matters if you if you know accomplish the mission he has given you but honestly part of our mission is to care about each other the Bible says to. 
11:21
You know to consider those are the household of faith or God first that means we should consider our fellow Christian members first we need to help them we need to honor them bless them and that is our goal that and let the world know us by our love how big of a deal 
11:39
that because right now I don't think they think the body of Christ or Christians are known because of our love for each other but it's going to happen and I will say this Jesus won't come back several years many years away actually before that happens but he's not coming back until we are loving one another 
11:57
because the Bible says the world will know us by our love for each other is one of the signs that that you know that we're getting close to him coming so we have some work left to do so people just forgive people just let it go loose out of your soul somebody wrong you 
12:11
and just love them anyway and the other thing you're doing is you're piercing Satan he does not want you to forgive people and love one he doesn't want us to love one another if we keep fighting whenever they even know who we are how can you operate in the power of God and 
12:27
speak for him on his behalf if you're trashing people who are the household of faith so this is a good time for you to just say I'm sorry father from this day forward I'm going to I'm going to do the very best I can and ask for more grace and get filled with your love 
12:43
and let this world see me love other believers and so that was the encounter I just have literally speaking to me I was gone in the second I was right back in the seat of the truck well of course I told my husband what just happened and he goes oh that's awesome 
12:59
he's not a man of many words but he was thought he thought it was a great thing and I said I'm supposed to share that I'm supposed to share that the next time not remembering even at that moment that it would be just a couple hours from them when I would do that so that is a word from the father 
13:15
if we are supposed to love one another care about each other help one another don't pick people's you know even if you don't have maybe you don't have a vision for what you're doing right now you don't pick other people's visions apart that's okay 
13:29
somebody happy and can I ask you a question so almost everyone has people that are I guess we would say they're in the body of Christ but they are so different than what we are there even some of them are off base 
13:49
but we know they accepted Christ but and then some are detractors and some are almost enemies and yet and yet they serve the Lord and what happens when we decide to just in our heart I guess it happens in our heart first just decide you know what I'm going to love them 
14:09
whether they ever know this or not I'm going to choose to love them what does something happen in the spirit when we do that. 
14:15
Yes, but I have to have to make clear what what what you're saying I understand what you're saying you make a decision with your soul, because your natural emotions aren't going to do it. 
14:27
You can even say, I make a choice with my will, no matter how you're feeling about it, you can actually do that that's actually something that is possible. 
14:37
You don't have to feel it for you don't have to feel it then you don't have to feel you don't have to feel you do not have to feel it. 
14:44
You're making what you declare and decree shall be established unto you and it is going to happen. 
14:52
I've had to do that several times actually, depending on what people had said have done done done to me or said to me. 
14:58
I say I choose as an act of my will to forgive them and my emotions certainly in that moment of time probably don't want that but you overrode your emotions. 
15:09
That's not like you're not being you that's using a part of you maybe you didn't use very often. 
15:14
Your will is the most powerful part of you. 
15:17
It's what it's what you display. 
15:19
I mean, know your will is what you choose to do your soul is your mind what you think about your will what you actually choose. 
15:27
And my husband has always said what you choose to do you will do. 
15:31
That's his famous quote. 
15:33
And he's very right about that so why not choose with your will the way the father decided to make it and say I choose as an act of my will not my emotions to forgive and say their name. 
15:45
And guess what the father he will write that down and he will immediately start working on the heart of the other person because you have forgiven them. 
15:54
That actually gives the father and Holy Spirit freedom to pursue that person for them to change no matter they're probably you're probably not the only one they're doing things to. 
16:04
If people are in fear or if they're in pain or if they're angry it makes them lash out I'm not giving an excuse for them I'm just telling you that's how it operates in your soul. 
16:15
As a man think it then his soul. 
16:17
So are you that's the heart of your being your soul. 
16:21
I had I had a situation. 
16:24
I don't know if I ever brought this up but there was a guy who went home to be with the Lord years and years ago. 
16:30
Okay so this is nothing current years and years ago but before he did that he tried really hard to destroy this ministry that I mean so it was a long time ago but it was this ministry. 
16:42
And I think or I feel like or I think I, I tried to forgive him okay I don't know which words to put, and I went to, you know, I had been really really sick many people know I was bed ridden my pastor. 
16:57
At that time thought maybe I was, I was depressed while I wasn't, but he said I want you to go to counseling so in deference to him I went to counseling for a few times. 
17:07
And I told this counselor a woman counselor and I told her about this guy that tried to destroy us because she was digging deep for anything that might be bothering me. 
17:18
And I said this happened this happened this happened and the guy's book was on her shelf so I knew she knew who he was. 
17:26
And so she said I want you to go up these stairs see yourself going up these stairs and open the door and it's the Lord, and you and him are going up there together, you're walking side by side up these areas. 
17:41
And I want you to tell the Lord what you think about him. 
17:47
You can imagine that was kind of, and all of a sudden now these emotions are coming up and all of a sudden I'm balling. And I said, it was like the Lord said what do you think about and he named the name and all of a sudden tears are just flowing. 
18:00
And I said he did the best he knew how to do he served you with, and that was sort of a combination cat of soul and emotion all mixed in there because I choose. 
18:12
I chose to do that talk about forgiving someone after they're gone, after it's too late to say it to them. 
18:21
You can. Well, number one, I do want to say the person who passed on. 
18:26
Yeah, they're immediately sorry for everything ever said or did you it just is a part of what happens. 
18:33
So when you die and step out of this body and your spirit man steps out, you know immediately what you did that, even if we're seeing, let's say I'm not saying murder or stuff like that. 
18:44
Maybe you were rude, maybe you were harsh to people, maybe you did something wrong against them. 
18:49
You know, immediately at that moment you're flooded with the life of God and you go, wow, I should have said I was sorry, you know, I should have said I was sorry for them what I did was wrong. 
19:00
I should have told them one day they feel still in need to tell you that. 
19:04
So they're basically at that moment saying they were sorry or repenting for doing it, even though you never heard it. 
19:10
Yeah, there is absolute forgiveness or actually a recompense for when at the moment someone dies and he's in heaven right now can't wait to see you and hug you when you get to heaven and say man, I should have been better to you. 
19:22
And you're probably saying these words, it doesn't matter anymore. But it would feel I can imagine it feeling good, really, really good to hear it. 
19:33
And also at the same time saying it doesn't matter anymore, you know, all at the same time all mixed in the same time you're really you're kind of happy. 
19:41
Yeah, they did it. They did understand. 
19:44
No, you can't you can't try to hide from truth when you're in the presence when you're in the presence there's no there's no hiding from what is true, you know what is true. 
19:54
And especially leaders in the body of Christ have a double accountability might as well bring this in your double accountability is leaders in the body of Christ and I'm sure the Lord may have something to say to you when you get in heaven he won't keep you from heaven. 
20:09
But I'm sure he may have something to say to you because the word does say that you'll be held calm for every wasteful word. It actually says that in the Bible. 
20:17
Can you clarify that you said that the other day in heaven, huh? 
20:21
You said that last time we were on the program about someone else you said he'll have something to say. 
20:27
Yeah. 
20:28
Can you postulate or even relate what type of thing he might say to someone like that? What do you mean he'll have something to say? 
20:38
I think that is done at a special appearance. I'm not saying that is necessarily done when you first arrive in heaven. 
20:44
Okay. 
20:45
Unless it was a special case, as was the case I saw the other day. 
20:51
Most of the time you'll be in heaven and you're rejoicing you're celebrating you're so happy the presence so powerful, but the more the presence begins to just invade your soul. 
21:02
You kind of know I probably should have handled this better. You don't feel guilty. There's no guilt. There is no guilt in heaven. 
21:09
Even when you come before the judgment seat of Christ and he will say things to you like, you know, I did ask you to do this. 
21:16
Like he asked, let's say he asked you to be a preacher. You decided to be a rodeo. Whatever. I'm just making a crazy. 
21:22
Yeah. 
21:23
And he did great at being in the rodeo, but you didn't ever pick up the call that he's dad. 
21:29
He will mention that to you. You'll have a conversation that doesn't mean he's going to kick you out or anything. 
21:34
But because in the Bible it says you'll be held accountable. 
21:38
So don't use waste wasteful words would be like bashing people being unkind to people saying rude remarks. 
21:45
And you're you're a believer, but you're still doing this stuff up into the day you go. 
21:50
You will realize, yeah, man, I should have not done that because truth begins to invade you. And when you kind of hear from that truth or you ignore that truth, 
22:00
that doesn't mean you won't go to heaven. That just means you are going to have a time to be talked to. 
22:06
Well, you know, I'll just end with this because I know you have the first question about something else or anything else to say. 
22:13
But I've talked about my father many times and he was in fact, he's with the Lord. He was in fact a major serial child abuser. 
22:24
He was OK. Then he got his heart right. And I know he's with the Lord. You said he's felt really good when I talked about he's with the Lord. 
22:32
You said that makes him happy when he hears that. So that was a major, major, major, major sin or set of sins or years of sin. 
22:41
So talk about the talking to that he might receive one day. I mean, how does that work? What would he say to my dad? 
22:51
Because he already knew he was wrong. 
22:53
I'm not even talking about actual sin. I'm not even talking about sin. 
22:58
Oh, that was sin. No, that was sin. His repentance of all that wiped it away. 
23:05
Oh, OK. So he's not talking about that. 
23:08
And he's not up there thinking about that anymore. He's thinking about how much he loves you and he's excited for you. 
23:13
And he knows that you're doing great things for God. 
23:16
Now, what I'm talking about are people who are like, even though they're believers, it's not really a sin to be rude. 
23:22
It's not nice. But those are wasteful words you're speaking. They are not necessary and you shouldn't be speaking on those things. 
23:29
He will talk to you. He will. He will talk to you about that, those kind of things. 
23:33
Sin is forgotten into the sea. No, there's no more remembrance of that. 
23:39
Like, no matter who's out there, if you sin and you're repented, don't bring that up to the Father again. 
23:44
If you're repented, he won't remember it. He won't remember it. 
23:48
But after you've been born again and repented, maybe you sin later, repent again, please. 
23:54
The God is not into freely sin at all. He is not in agreement with you to freely sin when you're a believer. 
24:00
That's not any kind of testimony or witness for him. 
24:03
And you just don't want to do it because people can see you acting like that and they'll think, why should I get saved? 
24:09
You act just like me. If you're sinning, if you have a lifestyle of sin, that's not a good thing at all. 
24:16
But what I'm talking about is just people's attitudes and the way they treat people. 
24:20
Those things, he will probably say something to them about because it does say, 
24:25
you will be held accountable for every wasteful word, words that shouldn't have been spoken, that were not necessary, 
24:30
that maybe hurt people or, you know, interfere with things in their life. 
24:35
Those kind of things. Because he said that in the word, he will talk to you about those things. 
24:39
But you're sin. 
24:41
I always thought, I guess I'm wrong on my thinking. 
24:45
I always thought those wasteful words and things you're speaking against people were, in fact, sins. 
24:52
Really? 
24:56
Wasteful is not sinful. There's a clear definition here. 
25:00
No, sins, the sins, the sins that you did in the earth, you have to repent, 
25:05
even if it's at the moment you die and Christ comes to you and says something. 
25:10
At that moment, you would have to say, I do truly repent because of the keys of hell, death and the grave. 
25:16
But the wasteful words have nothing to do with you getting into heaven or not. 
25:20
It's the attitude you have. It's maybe the witness that you're being. 
25:24
It won't keep you from being in heaven, but you could have probably had a lot more or done more for him 
25:29
because if you had treated somebody different. 
25:31
He's clearly saying that even when you're born again, watch how you treat people, how you handle people. 
25:38
He doesn't want people getting crushed or falsely or wrongfully accused. 
25:42
He wants that to not happen from a believer because you're actually messing with the testimony of what a believer is. 
25:49
Let's say sinners know you and they see you acting or mistreating people. 
25:53
They're like, why should I bother? You're almost interfering in more than just that. 
25:57
So those wasteful words that you shredded people with your mouth, that's not a sin. 
26:02
That's just a wasteful words that should not have been done. 
26:05
It's a waste of time to speak them. 
26:07
In other words, those he will hold you accountable. 
26:10
That doesn't mean you're going to be kicked out of heaven and he will let you know what that means when you get there. 
26:15
So no, he's not talking about sins. That doesn't mean sin. 
26:19
That's amazing. 
26:21
Well, what else do you have before we get into questions? 
26:24
Any other thing about current events or anything like that? 
26:28
I'm just excited about all the fraud exposure that's coming forth, which I'm sure everybody else is also. 
26:35
The legitimate many has meant other people coming forward to testify against the left who were a part of that. 
26:42
And I'm telling people to be the biggest, probably the biggest exposure ever in the history of the earth. 
26:48
Because of the exposure will be so deep and so wide and so complete. 
26:53
That everyone is doing anything to try to take over the world to stop our lives, steal what we have, 
26:59
or just stop the word of God from going forth. 
27:02
Anything that has an evil agenda on the left or the liberals, whatever they're doing, 
27:07
they are all going to be exposed and justice is going to be brought against them. 
27:13
And that's why I keep telling them that are doing that you better go. 
27:17
You better go be a witness and testify against what they're doing, 
27:20
because the day is going to come when the window will close and they won't need people's witness. 
27:25
They'll have so many witnesses that have been proven to be right that will legally cause legal action to take forth, 
27:31
come forth, whether it's from heaven or from the earth, 
27:34
but they're going to be exposed. 
27:37
And so that's just happened again. 
27:39
There are eyewitnesses that have come forth from all places. 
27:42
I may as well tell you because it's all over the place. 
27:44
It's FBI agents. 
27:46
I'm not saying to them to went into Mar-Lago or I can't even say the name. 
27:51
Trump's home to steal things or mess up things, which was what their agenda was. 
27:57
I don't know about them. 
27:58
I'm talking about ones who were a part of that and are no longer a part of that. 
28:02
They have got some of them who've come forward and are testifying, literally testifying, 
28:07
which God said on November the 4th, 2020, it would happen. 
28:11
So those things are beginning to happen and more and more people, 
28:15
you're not going to hear about it until it all breaks loose. 
28:18
And they have to say those famous words that the 2020 election was stolen. 
28:24
And it will be said on regular news and they won't want to say it because of the testimony and the witness and the evidence. 
28:30
They are going to have to say that people. 
28:32
And I can tell you those things are starting to come in. 
28:35
They're compiling up against the left and the liberals. 
28:38
I'm not doing it. 
28:39
It's happening because God said it would happen. 
28:42
And we just, they just had some more come forward and do that. 
28:44
So I'm always excited when truth is being told because it helps people. 
28:49
The truth makes you free. 
28:53
Are there people cat-like news anchors that we would recognize? 
28:59
Many of them who were told, you will not report. 
29:02
You will not say this because you will not say it was stolen that, 
29:07
that are going to come forward and say, they told me I couldn't talk about it. 
29:12
And commentators who wanted to tell the truth and they'll say they were, 
29:16
they told me I was not allowed to, well, that kind of thing all over the place. 
29:21
Definitely. 
29:22
Well, we're going to have all kinds of from every area from the business arena and the medical arena. 
29:27
I mean, everywhere from the financial arena, the media arena, 
29:32
there are going to be some from every one of those different areas because that's how far reaching the lie is and the deception is. 
29:39
And therefore people will come from each one of those arenas and they will testify because probably most likely they're not working. 
29:47
I mean, I didn't be working at those places right now because they were threatened with death. 
29:51
Most likely that that seems to be like, well, if we can't badger them or force them, then we'll just tell them we'll kill them. 
30:00
And I mean, again, this is truth. 
30:02
What I'm speaking is the truth that has already happened. 
30:05
And if they can't get these people who are in these positions to go along with them, they just take them, they just take them out. 
30:11
They threaten them. 
30:13
Truly they do. 
30:14
And some people won't talk about it because they're afraid for their own life. 
30:17
But there's going to come a time when they realize if they don't come forward and say something, this thing is going to come to an end where the people believe it or is or not. 
30:24
And you can't, no one can stop it from happening. 
30:26
It is coming to an end. 
30:28
And that whole foundation has already started crumbling under those people of the left and the liberals. 
30:34
It's already crumbling and they know it's crumbling. 
30:37
That's why they're being desperate, like, you know, raiding Trump's home and other things and saying, what else can we find or make up or lie about that will keep this thing going because it's failing. 
30:46
And it's failing big. 
30:48
So I just spoke the truth again. 
30:50
There are all these people from all those arenas and some people who are very high up in them, which is the testimony they really need. 
30:57
They need them to come forward and say that there's going to be a big witness protection program somewhere. 
31:03
But I can tell you right now it is going to happen. 
31:06
And so some of that just happened the other day and it's already being spread everywhere and it's true. 
31:11
They have had some come forward to that want to testify on behalf of what is right. 
31:17
So good. So good. 
31:19
I love it. I love it. Okay. 
31:21
Anything else before questions? 
31:25
I don't think anything else right now. 
31:27
I do have a question here that we can kind of start with. 
31:30
Yeah, start with that one. That'd be good. 
31:33
This is I love getting I love getting and let me tell you, I get so much mail. 
31:38
It's wonderfully outrageous. 
31:41
It takes me weeks and sometimes even months to go. 
31:44
If it's sent to me for me personally, I do go through it and look at it. 
31:48
And I do pray for a lot of people at that time. 
31:50
If it's something that's urgent, I will pray for them. 
31:53
But this little child who's nine years old, I'm just going to say her name is Andrea. 
31:58
And I'm not saying anything else about where it came from or what. 
32:02
Since God is making a new heaven and a new earth. And if you didn't know that, guess what he's going to. 
32:08
And the word does say that he is. 
32:10
So she is correct. 
32:12
Do you know what he's going to do with the moon? 
32:18
And I just love these children's questions. 
32:21
You know, they don't they don't hold anything back when they want to know something. 
32:24
They just ask what people think about what they say. 
32:28
Well, I'll tell you, Andrea, you can probably have it in your own yard on the new earth. 
32:32
I am quite sure the father can make you one. 
32:35
And so you will not miss the moon. 
32:37
And you know, he did make the sun and the moon. 
32:40
He made them himself. 
32:41
It says so in the Bible. 
32:42
Now, when he originally in the beginning, Genesis one, one in the beginning, 
32:47
when he made the earth, he lit it with his glory. 
32:50
There was no sun or moon lighting this earth when he made it the first time. 
32:55
And then in verse two, something has happened because he made it the first time and it was finished. 
33:00
It was done. 
33:01
He was done with the first time he made it. 
33:03
In verse two, it says that darkness is on the face of the deep and the water is covering the whole earth. 
33:09
Well, he didn't make it that way. 
33:11
He would have never made it that way. 
33:13
He made it the way it should have been. 
33:15
But then Saint was kicked out of heaven, fell to earth. 
33:18
He began to make the earth a wilderness. 
33:19
It says that in Jeremiah. 
33:21
And so God turned the light out. 
33:23
It also says that. 
33:24
He turned out the light. 
33:25
He took his glory off the earth and he broke the water vapor shield around the earth, 
33:30
which brought mist on it because it never rained in the very beginning. 
33:33
You need to know that too. 
33:34
Even scientists know that. 
33:36
And so it flooded the whole earth and then he made it darkness come upon it because he took the light out. 
33:41
So here's the earth sitting in verse two, right? 
33:44
It says he made it in verse one in the beginning. 
33:47
He made that means made means done, made the heavens and the earth. 
33:52
And then in the second verse, it's a mess. 
33:55
There's, there's, there's water covering the sky. 
33:58
That's the firmament. 
33:59
And it says in the Bible that he took the water off the firmament. 
34:02
He took it off of the land and began to redo the earth. 
34:06
It says that clear in the Bible. 
34:08
So then when he began to redo it in verse two, he starts that and he even says what he does. 
34:13
Okay. 
34:14
He replenishes the plans and brings them back. 
34:17
He puts the sun in the sky to light the day and the moon at night to light the night. 
34:22
It didn't say that in one one. 
34:24
And people go, well, how could this be millions of years people between verse one one, right? 
34:29
And Genesis one, two, there are millions of years. 
34:32
Oh, that's the first time I've heard you put it. 
34:35
No, there really is because it, there was no kind of time on the earth, right? 
34:40
The sun and the moon counted the days and the nights. 
34:44
When he started redoing the earth, replenishing is the correct word. 
34:48
The Holy Spirit just told me, we began to replenish the earth. 
34:51
Well, you can't read something. 
34:53
If you didn't do it before modeling your home unless you built it before. 
34:58
So you need to look at the words that are spoken unless people have written a new Bible and wiped them out and then just forget about it. 
35:04
Find one that isn't. 
35:06
It has not been changed. 
35:08
But so he made the earth in the beginning and it was done. 
35:11
It was finished. 
35:12
Beautiful. And it had a water vapor shield. 
35:15
He put around the whole earth that brought mist onto the trees, the flowers, but the light of God came from everyone who goes to heaven gets to see this. 
35:24
They go to this place and he lets you see him making the heavens and the earth light of God came from the ground and it would hit this water vapor mist. 
35:35
And part of that was part of what the rainbow. 
35:38
But the sky back then in Genesis one, one was a peachy pink. 
35:43
It wasn't blue because the sun wasn't present. 
35:46
They created that needed that to make the sky blue. 
35:51
So in verse two, it all changes when he takes the water off of the firmament. 
35:55
That's the sky. 
35:56
It takes the water off the land and starts to be replenished the earth replenish that the creatures, the plant life. 
36:03
I probably didn't say it in the right order, but he did. Then we know eventually on day 16, he made man. 
36:08
But that's this was a whole different sky. 
36:11
Same earth foundation. 
36:13
Everything sound glow was there, but he was replenishing it so man could live on the earth. 
36:20
Okay, so they could live there. 
36:22
And then he put the sun in the sky and it brought life by the day and then the moon at night. 
36:28
And it even says that so you could see at night. 
36:31
And so now we have the sun and the moon. 
36:34
The sky is beautiful blue normally in the daytime. 
36:37
And then the sky at night is dark and except the light from the stars and the sun. 
36:42
I mean, the moon, you can see it clearly. 
36:44
But my answer to Andrea's, I'm quite sure that he would be happy to make you a moon to be over your mansion or in your mansion. 
36:53
That's how cool God is. 
36:55
I could clearly see him doing that for you, Andrea. 
37:00
Very cool. 
37:01
Hey, on and creation, I've been asked this before. 
37:04
I don't, don't recall if I've asked you people have asked many times on the seven days of creation, were they 24 hour days? 
37:14
Yes. 
37:16
That's what I thought, but I wanted to double check. 
37:19
Because the Bible says it was today in the night. 
37:23
And then it was another day. 
37:25
It actually says that it says evening in morning, right? 
37:28
Evening in morning. 
37:30
24 hour day. 
37:31
Yeah. 
37:32
Six. 
37:33
Because he's God. 
37:34
That's why he spoke it. 
37:36
The word stepped out and made all of it. 
37:38
They could do it. 
37:40
They could do that as fast as they wanted to do it. 
37:43
That's why if you send an angel on assignment, like, like the, the heavens army, you send an assignment, they're back in five minutes. 
37:51
They've already dealt with what it was that you prayed about. 
37:54
And because, because there is no time. 
37:57
There's no day, no night. 
37:59
There is no time. 
38:00
There's no calendars. 
38:01
So when you send them or you pray for something, they go do it instantly. 
38:05
And then they come back for another appointment. 
38:07
I've seen that happen in heaven because I've been to Michael's headquarters. 
38:10
This is a free, free stuff now. 
38:12
I've been there and Michael's headquarters when they were sent on the mission. 
38:15
And it seemed like, you know, they were back. 
38:17
They went and dealt with it in the spirit realm. 
38:19
And then they came back for the next set of orders. 
38:22
That's amazing. 
38:23
Now you said it's in the scriptures that God turned the lights out. 
38:27
Can you tell which one that is? 
38:29
I'm not familiar. 
38:31
People read the whole book and find it. 
38:33
You're not going to. 
38:35
He won't let me. 
38:37
Okay. 
38:38
People to find them themselves. 
38:40
Steve, church and they listen to their pastor say stuff, but they don't. 
38:45
Most of them don't even go check it out. 
38:47
I admire people that search out the word to find things and see what it says about truth. 
38:52
Well, I do have some. 
38:54
He lets me quote, like he lets me cope. 
38:56
The first John 227 to let you know that you have a weapon in you. 
39:00
You never use most of them. 
39:02
And that's called, you know, the anointing. 
39:04
Yeah. 
39:05
It says in the Bible in first John 227, when you receive Jesus Christ and become a Christian, 
39:11
you get a deposit of the anointing. 
39:14
What is that? 
39:15
The anointing that destroys the yoke of darkness. 
39:18
You get a deposit of it and it says, it lives in you. 
39:21
I carry the anointing. 
39:23
I release the anointing. 
39:24
The anointing grows so much that it's like a big cloud outside of me. 
39:28
And if I walk into a place that begins to affect people, that's what Peter did. 
39:32
That's what Paul did. 
39:33
They said Peter's shadow healed people. 
39:35
It was the cloud of anointing coming from him because he did get a deposit when he got Christ. 
39:40
Christ puts a deposit of the anointing in you and it never leaves you. 
39:44
But the more you give it out, the more you get back. 
39:47
It's almost like a bank account. 
39:49
It's like an investment account. 
39:50
When you release the anointing, it grows. 
39:54
So that's what you're supposed to do. 
39:55
You've never done that. 
39:56
Make sure you start releasing it into what? 
39:58
Go in the restaurant. 
39:59
You drink out of a cup. 
40:00
You say, I release the anointing. 
40:01
It'll never leave that cup. 
40:02
The next person, it never leaves that cup. 
40:07
No, never. 
40:08
Not through the dishwasher. 
40:10
No, it's not because it's a spiritual thing. 
40:15
It comes from you, release the anointing. 
40:18
It goes in that cup. 
40:20
Every restaurant I ever eat at, I release it in the table. 
40:23
I release it in the seats. 
40:24
And so there's John. 
40:25
We've seen some people sit down in places and they jump back up. 
40:30
They're like, I don't know what that was because it would be God. 
40:33
Maybe they're not, maybe they're not, maybe they don't know the Lord. 
40:36
Maybe they're doing wicked things. 
40:37
They sit in that chair full of anointing. 
40:39
They all have to jump up and go find another place to sit down. 
40:42
So if you anoint the seat, let's say the seat in the table. 
40:47
For the rest of the time that that table exists, 
40:53
people will sit down in the anointing. 
40:55
And that's not just cat curd. 
40:57
That's anyone. 
40:58
Any believer that when you got born again, go read 1st John. 
41:03
I'll say it slow. 
41:04
1st John 2 27. 
41:07
You have it because you got born again. 
41:10
Jesus Christ literally takes a deposit of the anointing that destroys the 
41:15
yoke of darkness and he says, he puts it in you and it lives there to buy 
41:19
there. 
41:20
That means it's there. 
41:21
It's up to you to release it wherever you go, whatever you touch. 
41:24
I have my phone up here before I send the text. 
41:26
I type in, I put my hand on this, they're releasing anointing. 
41:29
When they touch that and read that text, it comes out and you get. 
41:33
Wow. 
41:34
Oh, we actually released it in the tires of our car and I see fire 
41:38
tracks because the anointing looks like fire. 
41:42
It looks like that. 
41:44
In the spirit. 
41:45
It looks like fire. 
41:46
And so when we drive our car, you see fire tracks and everybody who passes 
41:51
over those tracks, the anointing will begin to penetrate their car. 
41:56
You don't know how supernatural you are. 
41:58
There are so many things we don't know as believers unless we are told that. 
42:03
And the Bible says, I have not seen or you're hearing or entered in the heart 
42:06
or mind of man, but God has prepared for those that love him. 
42:09
Well, one of the things he's already prepared is the anointing you're 
42:12
carrying. 
42:13
We have testimonies from people that their brother couldn't stand them. 
42:16
He lost his job and they wanted to help him. 
42:19
And the one guy, the brother had the good, the brother that was living 
42:23
right had these cowboy boots that this other brother wanted all the time. 
42:27
And they went to my meeting and heard me say these words. 
42:31
And when they went home, they anointed the cowboy boots, released the 
42:35
anointing in them, both of them. 
42:37
And they called the brother said, why don't you come have dinner? 
42:40
And they said, we really want to pray with you. 
42:43
He lost his big landscape business and now he was really needing. 
42:46
He said, well, I guess I'll come. 
42:48
And he asked, can I mow your lawn to get some money? 
42:51
And they said, yeah, sure. 
42:52
So when he went to leave, they said, you've always liked these boots. 
42:54
Would you like them? 
42:56
And he goes, yes, I want those boots. 
42:58
Well, these are anointed boots people from them. 
43:01
They carried the brother and his sister while that they carried 
43:05
they put in those boots. 
43:07
A couple of days later, he called and goes, I don't know why I've been mad at you. 
43:11
Wow. 
43:13
Why am I mad? 
43:14
I care about you. 
43:15
I just thank you for these boots. 
43:16
And by the way, I just got a brand new contract. 
43:20
I got a whole new contract to do all these condos now. 
43:23
And now I've got money again. 
43:25
I want to thank you so much for blessing me. 
43:28
It didn't happen until it gave him the boots. 
43:32
He put them on and the anointing began to penetrate now. 
43:35
And do you have to be in person to lay your hands on for that to work? 
43:39
Can you send the anointing from a distance? 
43:42
That would be rare. 
43:43
That'd be rare. 
43:44
Okay. 
43:45
You can send them something. 
43:47
You can send them a card in the mail. 
43:49
Okay. 
43:50
I released the anointing and you mail it. 
43:54
And when they open it or touch it, they don't even go. 
43:57
So Kat, if I put the anointing on an envelope, 
44:03
really prayed for it, the anointing to be released on an envelope. 
44:07
It goes to the person and the person says, 
44:10
writes on it, refused, returned to center, but they held it. 
44:14
They touched it. 
44:15
That's all it takes, Steve. 
44:17
That's clever. 
44:19
I will leave places go. 
44:21
We'll say it's too late, everybody. 
44:24
And this is the best part. 
44:26
Any of those people have been watching me bashing me. 
44:29
It's too late. 
44:30
You already have the anointing in you because I put it in everything 
44:35
as we're doing these things. 
44:36
We annoy all of our stuff and put it in it. 
44:39
And you can anoint your computer before you send emails. 
44:42
And the email, when they look at that email, they open it, it goes in them. 
44:47
Even, even if you, even if they look at it for a second and said, 
44:51
I don't want to read this, but they see it. 
44:53
That's it. 
44:55
Wow. 
44:56
Okay. 
44:57
Let's ask one question about sending the host. 
45:01
Sometimes I think, well, I've really done my job. 
45:05
I've spent 20, 30 minutes sending the host all over the place. 
45:09
I'm still in bed. 
45:10
I'm doing it while I'm still in bed. 
45:12
And I've sent them everywhere and I've given them assignment. 
45:16
I think, well, I'm done for the day, but you're saying five minutes later, 
45:20
they're back. 
45:22
I always give them one more before I go to sleep because you know, 
45:25
that's seven a.m. I'm up 20 hours a day. 
45:27
So they've been getting instruction out at three a.m. 
45:29
I, I like to go outside. 
45:31
I just like to go outside. 
45:33
I don't have to, but I want to be near where they're at. 
45:36
So I go outside with my staff and every time I, 
45:39
I give them an order to command to go somewhere, 
45:42
which I'm allowed to do because Christ was, you know, 
45:45
we know he was the Lord of hosts. 
45:46
He commanded the army to things he did. 
45:48
We can do too. 
45:49
I'm not going to go through all that, but I do. 
45:51
And I'll take my staff and I hit it on the ground and I'll just say, 
45:54
I'm not going to be it. 
45:55
Go host, make toast. 
45:57
That means they're going after the dark, 
45:59
the spiritual darkness to pull it down, 
46:01
to shred platforms and they will do it. 
46:04
And you may not find out to get to heaven one day, 
46:06
but when you do that, you are having an impact somewhere. 
46:10
But back to the anointing thing for just a minute. 
46:13
When I used to speak, 
46:14
we had a whole meetings that were nothing but to teach people to, 
46:18
they knew now that according to the word, 
46:21
the anointing was in them. 
46:23
And I was like, right here in the core of your being, 
46:25
I'd had people stand up and say, okay, 
46:27
now you know you have it. 
46:28
Lay your hand on there and ask Holy Spirit to stir it up. 
46:31
And we would actually have them do that. 
46:33
And then I always had, I always did something so they could see 
46:38
that it actually did something. 
46:39
And then I would say lay hands on the person next to you and say, 
46:43
I released the anointing in Jesus name and people were falling out. 
46:46
They started laughing. 
46:48
The room was getting so full. 
46:50
I could feel the waves of anointing coming from everybody. 
46:52
And I finally would say, stop, stop, stop, stop. 
46:55
I can't stand up anymore. 
46:58
So I didn't have them. 
47:00
I actually trained them how to use it. 
47:03
And people used to go while they would, 
47:05
they would go and anoint the reservoir of the city, 
47:08
like stick their hand as close as they could to it in it. 
47:11
And they did things like they would go to the pizza restaurant. 
47:14
They worked in, 
47:15
they would touch every pan in the restaurant, 
47:17
the ovens in the restaurant, the pizza place. 
47:19
And we see anointing, which everybody who got a pizza made on that pan 
47:23
got the anointing. 
47:25
My goodness. 
47:27
Forever because it doesn't leave. 
47:29
It doesn't ever leave because it's a spiritual thing. 
47:32
It's a spiritual thing. 
47:34
Unbelievable. 
47:36
You can be doing all kinds of things. 
47:39
Yeah. 
47:40
I'm re-fired up. 
47:42
Okay. 
47:43
It's like our secret weapon. 
47:45
It totally is. 
47:46
Understand the word that clearly says it lives in you. 
47:49
What do you think? 
47:50
What did you ever think you were going to do with it? 
47:52
Yeah. 
47:53
What people, what did you think? 
47:55
It says the anointing breaks or destroys the yoke of darkness. 
47:59
That's the anointing you carry. 
48:02
And no matter where you walk, you can release it through your feet. 
48:04
I walk through the store, release it everywhere in the store. 
48:07
Every garment I ever look at on the rack, I will touch and go, 
48:10
I'll release the anointing, the anointing, the anointing. 
48:12
Everyone who buys those clothes will have that anointing on them. 
48:15
Goodness, goodness, goodness. 
48:17
You can be busy all the time, people, just for the anointing. 
48:20
I'm going to get busier all the time. 
48:22
I see myself getting very busy. 
48:24
Okay. 
48:25
I, I told this lady, no, well, I would ask this, 
48:28
but it's way too long to read. 
48:30
So I'm going to summarize what she's saying. 
48:32
She's totally into everything you're teaching even today. 
48:35
I'm sure. 
48:36
But her husband began to be. 
48:39
A detractor. 
48:40
Then he went from a detractor to. 
48:42
He didn't like it. Then he went from that to. 
48:45
To being biased against it. Then he went, 
48:47
then he became a cynic. 
48:48
Then he became a mocker. 
48:50
Now he is a hardcore mocker of everything she's doing. 
48:54
And it's hurting her marriage. 
48:56
And she's supposed, she feels like she's supposed to submit to him. 
49:00
What does she do? 
49:02
That depends on how bad it's getting. 
49:04
I can tell you right now. 
49:06
God, God, God, God, God, God, God. 
49:09
And then how bad it's getting. I can tell you right now. 
49:12
God never said, he never said, 
49:15
we had to submit to the abuse of our husband. 
49:19
It's just physical abuse. 
49:21
It hasn't been physical. 
49:22
I think she would have told me, 
49:23
but it's really verbal wickedness. 
49:26
I can tell you what she can start doing. 
49:28
You need to start laying your hands on everything he's got. 
49:30
Let me see. 
49:33
Go to his closet. 
49:34
Release the anointing and all of his clothes. 
49:36
Make sure all of his shoes gets the anointing. 
49:38
You will probably see a change 
49:40
because that anointing destroys the yoke of darkness. 
49:43
He literally has a yoke on him right now. 
49:46
And when you keep going and you get darker and darker, 
49:50
it's because you know what he's doing. 
49:52
He's feeding his own soul with what he doesn't like. 
49:55
And if he keeps feeding his soul, 
49:57
that's all that's going to be in the layers of his soul. 
49:59
And as a man think it's in his soul or his heart, 
50:02
that's how he's going to be. 
50:04
That's the biggest issue. 
50:06
He's saying all that. 
50:08
It's like people watching the fake news. 
50:11
They would start out great. 
50:12
They wouldn't like it. 
50:13
Then they'd be listening and they'd be like, 
50:14
well, you know that sounds plausible. 
50:15
Well, you know what? 
50:16
I don't like the other side. 
50:17
And now they hate him and they don't even know 
50:19
why they hate what's right 
50:21
because their soul is filled with the lies and deception, 
50:25
the hate that those people who are spewing it out, 
50:28
it's going in whoever's watching it. 
50:30
The anointing can pass into people listening, 
50:34
but the bad stuff can pass into you. 
50:37
Also, if you keep listening, 
50:39
it says to guard your heart. 
50:41
That is your soul. 
50:43
For out of that soul will flow the way you live your life. 
50:46
That's what the issues of life is. 
50:48
Your whole life will change by what you're listening to. 
50:51
And it can even be your own words 
50:53
trashing something all the time, 
50:55
which is what he's doing. 
50:57
So he's speaking against what God has put on the earth 
51:00
and even in you. 
51:02
So you need to come against that stuff. 
51:05
You need to maybe send the host against those spirits 
51:08
of wickedness and lies and deception 
51:10
to pull that stronghold off of him, number one. 
51:13
But make sure you're releasing the anointing. 
51:15
It's the best thing you can use. 
51:16
It's the number one thing we're given. 
51:18
Even at the day we got born again, 
51:22
you got that anointing. 
51:24
That's one of the powerful things he gave you. 
51:26
It's there. 
51:27
He said it's there. 
51:28
It destroys the yoke. 
51:29
So that should destroy the yoke that's now on him. 
51:32
And you say, I'm praying and declaring 
51:35
that that yoke of darkness will be destroyed 
51:37
off of my husband. 
51:38
It can be free to love and free to live 
51:41
and free to hear God. 
51:42
And that's releasing anointing in the food he eats, 
51:45
like in the whole refrigerator 
51:47
and everything. 
51:48
Anointing in his closet, 
51:50
everything he's clothing he wears will have the anointing. 
51:52
You are so getting him consumed with that anointing. 
51:57
And eventually there is going to have, 
51:59
something's going to happen. 
52:00
And you will see it when it happens. 
52:02
That's a good thing. 
52:04
I don't think it was this woman, 
52:06
but there was another woman who said, 
52:08
my husband has finally forbidden me to watch Kat on the air. 
52:13
What am I supposed to do? 
52:15
Any? 
52:16
The same thing I'm telling the other woman to do. 
52:19
Same thing. 
52:20
Same thing. 
52:21
The anointing destroys any yoke of darkness. 
52:25
It doesn't matter what it is. 
52:27
It destroys it. 
52:29
I know we say that the anointing breaks the yoke, 
52:32
but actually the real word, 
52:33
that real word that says breaks, 
52:35
it actually means destroys. 
52:37
So it destroys all those yokes of darkness, 
52:40
whether it's hate, 
52:41
if it's deception, 
52:43
if it's lies, 
52:45
if it's an anger or unbelief, 
52:48
those are yokes. 
52:50
And that anointing was given to us so that it would break it, 
52:53
especially in our own family. 
52:55
It has a great impact on that. 
52:57
And I even tell people, 
52:58
if you're still hugging family members, 
53:00
you can say quietly when you hug them, 
53:02
I release the anointing so they don't hear it said, 
53:05
but say it. 
53:06
But I'm telling you what, 
53:08
if they live in your home, 
53:09
you have every opportunity to lay on their bed, 
53:11
put it on their pillow, 
53:12
put it in their bed, 
53:13
put it in their clothes, 
53:14
put it in the food. 
53:15
There is going to be a major reaction to the anointing 
53:19
that's breaking and beginning to destroy that yoke 
53:21
that's on that person. 
53:23
We have seen it over and over the testimonies we have, 
53:26
and just because I used to train people to do that, 
53:29
it was the first thing he had me teach. 
53:31
Besides the fact, 
53:32
I talked about heaven all the time. 
53:34
Everything he said is you will teach him how to use the anointing. 
53:37
It is a weapon, 
53:39
and they get it the day they're born again. 
53:42
So when we hug our loved ones, 
53:44
anyone that's running from the Lord, 
53:48
I'll use those words with me, 
53:50
hug them. 
53:51
We just say, 
53:52
under our breath, 
53:53
I release the anointing. 
53:54
Yeah. 
53:55
And then make sure if they're going to eat dinner at your house, 
53:57
make sure you release it in the food they're eating, 
53:59
and the plates, 
54:00
you know, 
54:01
go lay your hands on all the plates in your cabinets 
54:03
and the cups and everything. 
54:04
It sounds wild, 
54:05
but it really does work. 
54:08
It works. 
54:09
Amazing. 
54:10
Amazing. 
54:11
I'm excited. 
54:13
All right. 
54:14
All right. 
54:15
This sounds like Malachi, 
54:17
Milachi, whatever. 
54:18
Can you explain what the kingdom of God is? 
54:22
For example, 
54:23
Matthew 633 says, 
54:25
seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, 
54:28
and all these things shall be added to you. 
54:30
That's her question. 
54:32
The kingdom is the same thing Christ talked about. 
54:35
He talked about a spiritual kingdom. 
54:38
That's he, 
54:39
when he talked about the gospel of the kingdom, 
54:41
that is a spiritual kingdom. 
54:43
That is a real kingdom that operates in the spirit realm. 
54:47
You're not going to walk up to a castle here that says, 
54:50
it's not a flesh and blood thing. 
54:53
It is the spiritual thing. 
54:55
And the kingdom of heaven, of course, 
54:58
is part of that spiritual kingdom. 
55:00
But on the years you operate in it, 
55:02
by doing one of the things I just told you, 
55:04
that is a weapon. 
55:05
Clearly it is a spiritual weapon. 
55:07
And yet it says what it does. 
55:09
It clearly says in the Bible, it destroys the oath. 
55:12
You have that weapon. 
55:13
You can't see it or touch it, 
55:15
but it's in you. 
55:16
And when you begin to release it, 
55:18
it actually impacts that spirit realm. 
55:21
And you're operating in the kingdom. 
55:24
When you do that, 
55:25
because you're using a spiritual weapon it gave you, 
55:28
when you speak truth to people 
55:30
to break off deception to them, 
55:32
you're operating in the kingdom. 
55:33
Every time you pray, 
55:34
you're operating in the kingdom. 
55:35
When you declare you're operating in the kingdom, 
55:37
when you help people, 
55:38
you're operating in that kingdom that Christ talked about, 
55:41
that it was so valuable that you give up whatever you can 
55:44
to get that kingdom. 
55:45
It is a spiritual kingdom. 
55:48
When you get to heaven, 
55:49
you have the full understanding of that. 
55:51
But the weapons he gives us now here, 
55:53
it says our weapons of warfare people. 
55:56
Remember what warfare is? 
55:58
It's when you come against something. 
56:00
You fight against the darkness and the evil. 
56:02
And you think, 
56:03
I can't do anything. 
56:04
I'm just a little human being. 
56:05
Oh yes, you can if you're born again, 
56:07
because you will now, 
56:08
a new creation means you now have supernatural abilities in you. 
56:13
You have supernatural weapons to use in the spirit realm, 
56:16
that you will really mess up the devil's plans. 
56:19
You're going to mess them up. 
56:21
So that kingdom he talks about is, 
56:23
he said, you cannot see it with your human eyes. 
56:26
But it's there because you're here. 
56:28
You have a spirit man. 
56:30
You can operate through your spirit using these weapons. 
56:33
And you can do wonderful, powerful things against the enemy, 
56:36
which is one of our, 
56:38
one of the things that we're called to do as a believer. 
56:40
That's what we're called to do. 
56:42
We rule and reign with Christ when we use those weapons. 
56:45
There are spiritual weapons against the spiritual darkness. 
56:48
Spiritual darkness is always against every evil, wicked, human flesh person. 
56:54
They're wicked because they're listening to the evil spiritual realm, 
56:59
the evil spiritual beings, 
57:01
which you have power over all the power of the enemy. 
57:05
Our enemy is Satan. 
57:07
So any demons disembodied spirits, 
57:10
I can go through this whole long list about that for three years. 
57:13
I did nothing but preach about the darkness out there and how to come against it. 
57:18
I did that for a long time. 
57:20
And so it's in me. 
57:21
I do it automatically. 
57:22
But you as a believer are powerfully and wonderfully made. 
57:26
That's what the scripture says. 
57:28
He didn't leave you without help. 
57:30
Number one, the Holy Spirit is here to help you all the time. 
57:33
Christ will never leave you. 
57:35
When you invited him in, he actually does step in. 
57:38
He's in there. 
57:40
He's there to help you, to help guide you with the Holy Spirit. 
57:43
But he gave you weapons, people. 
57:45
The word of God, not the one with half the verses scripted out. 
57:49
Okay. 
57:50
I'm not talking about the one that wiped out the truth 
57:52
and they want to put their interpretation in there. 
57:54
I'm not talking about that. 
57:55
And let me tell you that's happening a lot everywhere. 
57:57
And make sure you get a Bible that has all the verses in it. 
57:59
Yeah. 
58:00
And not things. 
58:01
Some are removing chapters because they don't like what it says. 
58:06
They want to make everything okay for everybody, 
58:09
no matter how wicked or evil we are. 
58:11
Hey, that's the agenda of the left. 
58:13
Doesn't it sound like that? 
58:14
Totally is. 
58:15
They want everyone to accept evil and wickedness. 
58:17
That's why they're spreading it. 
58:19
That's why they will never make anything good 
58:22
because there's no good in them. 
58:25
They can't even think that way. 
58:27
All they can think is destroy, take, steal, crush. 
58:31
That's what they're all thinking. 
58:32
That's what that whole agenda is for them. 
58:35
And yet Christ came to bring you life and life more abundantly. 
58:40
So we're supposed to have abundant life with Christ. 
58:43
Regardless of what else is going on around us. 
58:45
And maybe if you start using the anointing for what it is, 
58:49
it is a weapon to come against the spirit of the darkness. 
58:52
You will begin to see things shift even for you. 
58:55
So good. 
58:56
He didn't owe us without his blood, the most powerful thing ever in all time. 
59:00
The only thing that wipe away your sins and give you entrance into heaven. 
59:04
Satan hates it. 
59:06
The word of God, the word spoken, the word written is so powerful in the spirit. 
59:11
Satan hates that too. 
59:13
He doesn't like the light of God in you, but he can't stop it from coming. 
59:17
The greater relationship you create with Christ, 
59:20
the more light you have in you. 
59:23
It says one time at one time, even the night will be light round about you. 
59:28
That's you going outside at night and seeing a light coming from yourself. 
59:32
It is going to happen in the manifest of sons and daughters. 
59:35
I won't just read the word. 
59:37
I actually believe it and I live it. 
59:39
I live that word. 
59:41
People who don't understand that have never lived or understood even what it was. 
59:44
Why is it written in there? 
59:46
It's not just a nice story. 
59:48
A bad thing that happened. 
59:50
It is an agenda of God to let you see yourself as a new creation. 
59:56
You get part of his DNA in you. 
59:58
You get a stone of fire that gives light to your spirit man in you. 
01:00:02
And you get born again. 
01:00:03
You get a deposit of the anointing. 
01:00:05
You are so full of God right now as a believer, but you have no understanding. 
01:00:10
Right. 
01:00:11
That. 
01:00:12
Yeah. 
01:00:13
Let me ask this. 
01:00:14
Okay. 
01:00:15
We just read seek first the kingdom of God. 
01:00:18
And then with that or. 
01:00:21
Okay. 
01:00:22
Put that aside for a moment, not aside, but let's change the subject where. 
01:00:27
God came to you and said in 20, I think it was 2012. 
01:00:32
You said the kingdom age has begun. 
01:00:35
What's the difference between seeking first the kingdom of God. 
01:00:38
And now suddenly living in the kingdom age. 
01:00:41
There's a very big difference because the word talk is about when things will 
01:00:45
actually happen. 
01:00:46
Things that will come that will bring change. 
01:00:49
It changed a lot. 
01:00:51
Okay. 
01:00:52
When John the Baptist started saying, okay, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
01:00:56
Yeah. 
01:00:57
He understood. 
01:00:58
He probably was one of the few people that actually understood. 
01:01:01
He knew heaven was about 10 days. 
01:01:03
He knew the Messiah was coming. 
01:01:05
He knew that he would die for the sins. 
01:01:07
He knew these things. 
01:01:09
And that change started when Christ was born, when he was sent from heaven to 
01:01:15
earth and planted in the womb of Mary by Holy spirit. 
01:01:19
That did happen. 
01:01:21
That happened. 
01:01:22
Things begin to change when she began to achieve. 
01:01:25
He was being birthed, not birthed, but he was being, you know, growing inside of 
01:01:29
her. 
01:01:30
Angels would come and tell her things. 
01:01:32
She knew things were going to change. 
01:01:34
She knew they would be different. 
01:01:36
When Christ born, things really began to change even rapidly, more rapidly. 
01:01:40
And at that time, Satan knew somebody had come. 
01:01:43
That's why he tried to find out from the, you know, from the wise kings. 
01:01:47
He questioned the wicked king and questioned them. 
01:01:50
But Christ was hidden and hidden and hidden, even sent to Egypt for a while because he 
01:01:55
was bringing change to this world by who he was. 
01:01:58
And then when he began to minister, then openly people began to see how things changed when 
01:02:06
he was around. 
01:02:07
And it was so powerful that he gave his life for us. 
01:02:10
When he gave his life for us, he made a way back to the place we came from. 
01:02:15
We all came from heaven. 
01:02:17
We lived in the Father. 
01:02:19
He is our Father. 
01:02:20
We are His offspring. 
01:02:21
The Bible says that the real change to happen once Christ was on this earth, it began to 
01:02:26
demonstrate and manifest the power of God. 
01:02:29
He stopped the storms. 
01:02:31
He walked on water. 
01:02:32
He increased time or he slowed time down. 
01:02:35
He created food. 
01:02:36
He made regular water into heaven's wine. 
01:02:39
You saw one miracle after another. 
01:02:41
One miracle after another began to happen. 
01:02:44
They haven't stopped happening. 
01:02:46
As the days grow closer, where the kingdom, the kingdom age would be brought to this earth, 
01:02:54
we would know more and more about it. 
01:02:56
That's part of my job is to let people know what is this kingdom? 
01:03:00
What is this kingdom? 
01:03:01
Why is the kingdom age here? 
01:03:03
So you can operate in it fully, understanding who you are, what the weapons he gave you, 
01:03:09
that would bring hope for people's lives, help for people's lives, that they would see 
01:03:14
people walking the earth that didn't sin on purpose, that could hear the word of God and 
01:03:20
demonstrate his power throughout the earth. 
01:03:22
That was the purpose of the kingdom age and it did start in 2012. 
01:03:27
All the way up to that, being a seer and understanding the prophetic, I felt something stronger and 
01:03:33
stronger coming and a lot of people announced what came in 2010 or 2010. 
01:03:41
I think that's the right way to say it. 
01:03:44
They could feel it coming closer and closer, but until the day came, and we literally in time, 
01:03:49
in time, if you were a seer, we stepped from a threshold of time into a time we've never had before. 
01:03:56
And that is when the manifested sons and daughters would be seen in the earth. 
01:04:00
That's why the earth was interveiled for us to stand up and start demonstrating who he is. 
01:04:05
The miraculous, like that people would be raised when the dead that were created. 
01:04:09
I mean, miraculous things will happen in this kingdom age, because God is going to demonstrate 
01:04:14
that he really exists. 
01:04:15
He's going to erase the great area that says there is no God. 
01:04:19
Many things are happening in this kingdom age. 
01:04:21
And the kingdom will remain up until the time when Christ is seated on the throne in Jerusalem, 
01:04:28
even after the tribulation, which is a few years, people, a few years, and then Satan will be 
01:04:35
sitting on the bottom of the pit. Christ will sit on a throne in Jerusalem as king of this world. 
01:04:42
And some people won't even put that in the Bible. 
01:04:45
That's what I said. Make sure you're looking at the right Bible. 
01:04:47
They say that these things have already happened. 
01:04:49
None of these things have happened except the kingdom ages come. 
01:04:53
People begin to speak to the weather like Christ did, and it will obey. 
01:04:57
Things that we say will begin to happen because we serve Christ and we live here for him. 
01:05:03
If you had been... 
01:05:08
Well, I was going to say, Kat, if you had been the only person and the first person who ever said that, 
01:05:14
I thought, well, Kat's going to be off here because that's not like anything I've ever heard. 
01:05:20
But years before I met you, my spiritual father, Wade Taylor, said in 2012, when it was 2012, 
01:05:28
he told me the kingdom ages come. He was 88 years old when he passed a couple of years after that. 
01:05:34
And I thought, what is he talking about? 
01:05:36
And then I later found out that Arthur Burke had said the same thing. 
01:05:40
Also, he's gotten to be with the Lord. 
01:05:42
So when you said it, that's the voice of two or three witnesses have absolutely agreed that 2012 this thing happened. 
01:05:51
I don't know why he picked out that year. 
01:05:54
I mean, Obama was in office. I mean, what did he pick that year? 
01:05:58
But I don't know what you... 
01:06:00
He loves to pick years when adversity is there. 
01:06:04
And I'll tell you why. People will actually listen because they need help and hope. 
01:06:11
Yeah. 
01:06:12
And he knew all this stuff was going to happen. 
01:06:14
He knew it, but he has got to fully expose the evil. 
01:06:18
It's not just about the devil having a heyday taken over. 
01:06:21
God is letting them on purpose expose how evil and wickedness operates. 
01:06:26
Well, socialism really does to you, but communism really does so people can see for themselves. 
01:06:31
It's not good. 
01:06:33
That doesn't mean he's doing it to hurt anybody. 
01:06:35
He's not doing that on purpose, but he has to have a time when the evil is exposed. 
01:06:40
It will be crushed and it will be pushed back because in these glorious years coming on the earth, 
01:06:46
it will be like a whole new earth, not a whole new earth, but a whole new thing happening on the earth. 
01:06:52
And favor will be given to believers. 
01:06:54
And there's people out there that wouldn't even believe me. 
01:06:56
Well, that doesn't matter. 
01:06:57
Maybe you'll be in heaven. Don't have to be concerned with it. 
01:06:59
I didn't mean that. 
01:07:00
Anyway, you cannot stop the plans of God. 
01:07:05
They couldn't stop Christ from coming. 
01:07:07
They couldn't stop the Holy Spirit from coming. 
01:07:09
They couldn't stop it from raising from the dead people. 
01:07:11
They could not stop Jesus from going in hell and wasting it. 
01:07:14
No one can stop what's going to happen this time. 
01:07:17
God's timeline. 
01:07:19
He has a timeline and the events. 
01:07:23
They're not dates. 
01:07:25
I walked up there. 
01:07:26
I didn't see one day to solve events. 
01:07:27
I saw these events happening on the earth. 
01:07:30
He didn't let me see to the end. 
01:07:33
I saw things that weren't happened. 
01:07:35
Hasn't happened yet. 
01:07:37
In heaven, you talked about, excuse me, and described that God has an event calendar. 
01:07:43
Not a date calendar, this event. 
01:07:45
But on earth, there's actually dates connected to it. 
01:07:49
We just don't know what those dates are going to be. 
01:07:51
We never know it. 
01:07:52
And when we think we've guessed it, 
01:07:54
we're almost always wrong from what I've seen. 
01:07:57
Yeah, that's what I don't ever guess. 
01:07:59
Yeah. 
01:08:00
Guessing is like wasted energy. 
01:08:02
So. 
01:08:03
You have to believe that God, you have to trust him. 
01:08:06
You have to trust him. 
01:08:08
You know, trust is very important. 
01:08:10
If you, if you, you begin to believe something, 
01:08:13
you go from believing to trusting, 
01:08:16
you actually put forth actions where you're trusting God for something. 
01:08:19
So you believe and then you begin to trust him, but there comes a day. 
01:08:23
And when you step from trust and you step into faith, 
01:08:27
you are never the same again. 
01:08:30
Never. 
01:08:31
And I had believed in God for so many years and trusted him probably for several decades. 
01:08:37
And then at one point I felt a shift in me and I said, 
01:08:42
what has happened? 
01:08:44
And a prophet literally truth called me on the phone who lives in South Carolina 
01:08:50
and said, the father had me call you to say these words. 
01:08:53
This day you have stepped into faith. 
01:08:56
Wow. 
01:08:57
Can you try to put into words. 
01:09:03
What that feels like to go from trust into faith? 
01:09:07
Cause we thought, I always thought trust was one of the ultimate things, 
01:09:11
but you're describing faith as like the next step up. 
01:09:15
If you will, what, what, what does that feel like? 
01:09:18
And if you can even think of an example, so people could go, 
01:09:22
oh, that's what I'm striving for or contending for or believing for. 
01:09:27
You want to, you want to step into faith because faith, 
01:09:31
it makes it feel the most amazing feeling you're everything. 
01:09:35
I felt such freedom, like freedom came. 
01:09:39
Freedom because I had been obeying God and I've been obeying him and everything. 
01:09:43
You asked me, I obeyed it. 
01:09:45
No matter how silly it was or why would you ask, 
01:09:47
I don't even ask him why he does anything. 
01:09:49
I, that's called trusting. 
01:09:51
When you get to trust and God says, do this and you know it's him and you do it 
01:09:55
and how amazing your life will be for that moment. 
01:09:58
But when you step into faith, everything he says after that, 
01:10:03
you were already living it on the inside. 
01:10:07
It's like there's not even one ounce of doubt. 
01:10:10
It leaves you, doubt leaves you. 
01:10:12
Doubt can't even get in you. 
01:10:14
None of the stuff that left the saying, it can't penetrate me because I'm a living in faith. 
01:10:20
I've stepped into faith. 
01:10:22
So no matter what anyone says to try to stop me from saying anything, it's not going to work. 
01:10:26
When you get to the place where you're there and God says you're there, 
01:10:31
then no matter what he says, you know that you know that you know it's happening. 
01:10:36
It is happening because you have stepped from trusting. 
01:10:40
You stepped into faith. 
01:10:42
It's an actual place that you step into. 
01:10:45
And from that moment, your faith gets so huge. 
01:10:48
It's like it's unstoppable. 
01:10:51
Not that I must have a month, but whatever God says to me or shows me, 
01:10:55
I know that I know that I know this is happening. 
01:10:58
So when you know that, you know that, you know, 
01:11:01
is living in me, it's not somewhere up here. 
01:11:03
I'm trying to find it as an example. 
01:11:06
When you know that, you know that, you know that, you know, Trump is coming back. 
01:11:11
There's no, you've moved beyond trust to faith. 
01:11:15
It's so real that no one could talk you out of it. 
01:11:18
No, they can't talk me out of it because I know it's going to happen. 
01:11:22
It is absolutely going to happen people. It's going to happen. 
01:11:25
And the great thing is you, you're standing in that faith. 
01:11:29
You know it's going to happen. 
01:11:31
Nobody can try to take it is something they can't take away from you. 
01:11:35
It isn't just something you hurt when you're in faith. 
01:11:39
You already know it's going to happen. 
01:11:41
You know it, but I'm not out there blasting people wrongfully using people. 
01:11:47
I'm not using, you know, nasty words or hurt people. 
01:11:50
I'm just not doing it. 
01:11:51
I'm going to stay right where God has me. 
01:11:54
So my words have power. 
01:11:56
They have power for hope, for blessing, for greatness. 
01:12:00
They have power in them. 
01:12:01
Part of that power is the faith that I'm in now. 
01:12:04
But anyone who is a believer can go after that. 
01:12:08
This is nothing I'm doing as hell from you. 
01:12:10
It depends on what you want. 
01:12:12
What do you want from him? 
01:12:13
Do you want to know him more? 
01:12:15
You want more of him? 
01:12:16
You want more of his presence? 
01:12:17
More of his words? 
01:12:18
You have to pursue them. 
01:12:20
Yeah. 
01:12:21
Do you want to get blessed? 
01:12:22
Well, then bless other people because you probably won't get anything without blessing. 
01:12:26
Blessing is like a seed where there's money, where there's actual health. 
01:12:29
Do you help people with things or help give revelation to them? 
01:12:33
Or maybe you're just helping them do something they really need to do. 
01:12:36
That always does something to the heart of God. 
01:12:40
So if you want to be blessed, you will have to bless first because then you're trusting God. 
01:12:46
You're not doing it to get something. 
01:12:48
Right. 
01:12:49
You truly want to bless. 
01:12:51
Yeah. 
01:12:52
I love to bless people. 
01:12:54
I love to help people. 
01:12:56
It's like, it's a part of me now. 
01:12:58
And when that faith becomes a part of you and he says it, and I know people who have already 
01:13:03
gotten there, they know that he's saying what he's saying is going to happen. 
01:13:07
That's why Hank won't change what he's saying. 
01:13:10
He knows, he knows, he knows he's already in faith for that. 
01:13:13
God said it. 
01:13:14
He showed us that he knows it's going to happen. 
01:13:17
Yeah, when you go, when you went from trust to faith, now that you're in faith, it sounds 
01:13:28
very, very powerful. 
01:13:31
Will that faith grow? 
01:13:33
Will it get more? 
01:13:34
Or is it? 
01:13:35
It does. 
01:13:36
It does. 
01:13:37
It grows and grows and like the kingdom always, always, always grows. 
01:13:42
Right. 
01:13:43
It'll never stop growing. 
01:13:44
It increases. 
01:13:46
You're going to increase in every way because it says he desires above all things. 
01:13:52
Right. 
01:13:53
That you be in health. 
01:13:55
By the way, that's living in health. 
01:13:58
Right. 
01:13:59
He wants you to prosper. 
01:14:00
Number one, above all things, he wants you to prosper. 
01:14:03
Prosper doesn't just mean money. 
01:14:05
It means the way you're living, the things you're saying, the impact you're having on 
01:14:10
people, that that's prospering in all your ways. 
01:14:14
You're prospering. 
01:14:15
That means with your relationships, with what you're doing, if you own a business, what 
01:14:19
you're doing in the church or what you're doing to help other people, there's always 
01:14:23
going to be increased. 
01:14:25
That's prospering. 
01:14:26
That's an action of life itself. 
01:14:28
That's not just here's some money. 
01:14:31
He wants you to be in that place. 
01:14:33
And then even as you will prosper, even as your soul prospers, right? 
01:14:40
Right. 
01:14:41
He also wants you to prosper and live in health. 
01:14:45
BE means a way of life. 
01:14:48
Christ became poor that we might be rich. 
01:14:51
That's his plan. 
01:14:52
Poverty is not the father's plan. 
01:14:55
Okay. 
01:14:56
So it says even as your soul prospers, you will then live in health and you will prosper. 
01:15:04
Your soul has to prosper. 
01:15:07
So if you're feeling your soul with bad news or bad words that you're speaking, or you 
01:15:12
don't even like yourself, your soul can't prosper. 
01:15:15
We can't do those other two things. 
01:15:17
Your soul has to prosper in order for you to prosper and live in health. 
01:15:22
It has to prosper. 
01:15:23
It prospers by reading the word, speaking the word, saying God's promises, saying what 
01:15:29
God is wanting to do right now, not the left, not what your friend is saying, if it's not 
01:15:34
aligning with God, the more your soul prospers, the more life it puts out, not just gets in. 
01:15:42
The more you will prosper in all your ways and you will begin to live in health. 
01:15:48
That is called divine health. 
01:15:51
Let's use this as the last question since I've done two shows today. 
01:15:54
So I'm going to cut it a bit shorter, but I'm in health, but I'm tired. 
01:16:03
So a person, and I can put myself in this, but I don't really suffer a lot from this, 
01:16:12
but I suffer some from this, where people will say, well, I don't like myself. 
01:16:17
I don't like the way I look. 
01:16:19
I don't like the way I, how much I weigh. 
01:16:23
I don't like the way, you can just list and listen to this, but you just said, if you 
01:16:28
don't like yourself, I don't consider myself a person that doesn't like myself. 
01:16:33
But I don't like certain things about myself. 
01:16:37
Talk to people and myself. 
01:16:40
How do you move that needle from, I don't really like what I see in the mirror. 
01:16:47
I don't really like what God did to make me, how he made me, to, to, to liking yourself 
01:16:54
so that you can prosper. 
01:16:55
Talk about that. 
01:16:56
I'll tell you right now, that's why you can't prosper because what is the whole thing goes 
01:17:03
back to as a man thinker in his heart. 
01:17:09
When he says that word heart, he's not talking about your human flesh beating heart. 
01:17:13
He's talking about your soul. 
01:17:14
Here's your soul. 
01:17:15
Right? 
01:17:16
This is your soul. 
01:17:17
Here's your soul right here. 
01:17:19
It's like this. 
01:17:20
There's a beautiful column with etchings and writings on it. 
01:17:23
That is your will. 
01:17:24
And on top of that is your spiritual mind, your mind, your will, and your emotions are 
01:17:29
all the layers of you, that's how you're made, and those emotions, and whatever you put in 
01:17:36
those layers, words you said about yourself, the more you feel what was the things you 
01:17:42
don't like, it's not going to change. 
01:17:45
It can't change because what are you feeding your soul? 
01:17:49
You're feeding negative things that you don't like about yourself. 
01:17:52
You don't like how you live. 
01:17:53
You don't like the way you look. 
01:17:54
You don't like what's happening to you. 
01:17:57
That's why that can't be changed. 
01:18:00
If you don't like who you are, stop saying the things about you you don't like and say, 
01:18:06
this may not be perfect when I look in the mirror, but God is going to perfect it. 
01:18:10
And I'm going to love the way I look, however way he wants me to look. 
01:18:14
I'm going to love what he does with me. 
01:18:16
I'm going to love what he says to me. 
01:18:18
My souls begin to prosper this day because I'm no longer beating it up. 
01:18:22
And I won't listen to people that beat it up because the other reason why you can't 
01:18:26
prosper is everyone around you saying negative things to you. 
01:18:29
You were just made that way. 
01:18:30
That's just the way. 
01:18:31
That's your destiny. 
01:18:32
You can't change that. 
01:18:33
You lose those words out of you. 
01:18:35
You cannot keep them in your soul. 
01:18:37
Not even words you said. 
01:18:38
You cannot keep them in your soul because that's what you will become. 
01:18:43
You will become what you were saying you think you are. 
01:18:48
And I have done this with so many people. 
01:18:50
It's almost not ridiculous, but it happens the same way every time. 
01:18:55
You have to say, I repeat for saying all those negative words about me. 
01:18:59
I lose everywhere those words from my soul, from my mind, my will, my emotions. 
01:19:03
I will not allow them to remain in Jesus' name. 
01:19:06
And then you say, I choose my will to like myself. 
01:19:11
I choose with my will to be blessed and to bless God for making me this way. 
01:19:15
I choose my will to be excited for whatever he has for me. 
01:19:20
You are then feeding power to your soul to change, causing your own soul. 
01:19:28
You don't need a whole world out there to do it. 
01:19:30
You don't even need a profit to do it. 
01:19:32
You watch over your own soul. 
01:19:35
You are the keeper and watcher of your own soul. 
01:19:37
You are. 
01:19:38
And the way you talk and the way you think, the things you choose to go watch. 
01:19:43
What are you watching? 
01:19:44
You watching murders? 
01:19:45
Are you watching things that are horrible? 
01:19:47
Are you watching profanity? 
01:19:49
Are you watching witchcraft? 
01:19:50
Because guess what? 
01:19:51
You're feeding your soul. 
01:19:52
You're feeding your soul profanity, witchcraft, and violence. 
01:19:55
Do you think that your soul is going to prosper? 
01:19:59
You need to take a whole, you need to look at a soul checkup, you need a soul checkup 
01:20:03
people. 
01:20:04
You need to see, what am I watching on a regular basis? 
01:20:06
What words are coming out of my mouth, okay? 
01:20:09
What have I looked at? 
01:20:10
What have I read? 
01:20:11
Is it negative? 
01:20:12
Is it bad? 
01:20:13
Is it wicked? 
01:20:14
Get rid of it, people. 
01:20:16
Because if you want your soul to prosper, and then you will prosper and live in health, 
01:20:21
you better be. 
01:20:22
That's what it says to guard it. 
01:20:23
You're guarding it. 
01:20:25
You don't let garbage in, and you don't put garbage out. 
01:20:28
Garbage comes out of your mouth, it goes in your own soul. 
01:20:31
Every time you blast someone, that goes in your own soul. 
01:20:34
You can't stop it. 
01:20:35
It's just the way we remain. 
01:20:37
Your soul, and what you put in it is what you will become, and no one on this earth is 
01:20:44
going to change that. 
01:20:45
You can change who you are. 
01:20:49
If you don't like the way you look, if you don't like the way of what's happening, if 
01:20:52
you're upset about everything else, you're feeding your soul those words. 
01:20:56
If you want that soul to begin to prosper and the light of God to grow in it, and you actually 
01:21:00
get happy, then start saying positive things. 
01:21:03
I'm not talking about positive, I'm thinking, you really be positive about things. 
01:21:08
Maybe you had a friend that you liked, but they always end up by saying something nasty 
01:21:11
to you. 
01:21:12
I lost all those words that were spoken against me, that were nasty, that were harmful, that 
01:21:16
were bashing. 
01:21:17
I lost everyone, no matter where they came from. 
01:21:19
If I listened to it or somebody said it, I lost everyone in the mind of your soul, Jesus 
01:21:23
comes and goes, and it's like they were never there. 
01:21:27
Yes, they're going to start to feel different. 
01:21:30
Then you begin to thank God. 
01:21:31
I thank you, God, for my life. 
01:21:33
I thank you for letting me be born this time. 
01:21:35
Thank you for letting me be great for you. 
01:21:37
Thank you for bringing happiness to me. 
01:21:40
Show me, Holy Spirit, what to say, and when to say it. 
01:21:44
I give you permission to remind me to say things that are positive. 
01:21:51
Then you are on the road for your soul to actually prosper. 
01:21:55
God can give you more, do more with you, and use you more, because He wants you to go up 
01:22:02
to a person, they go, oh, this is horrible, what's going on today. 
01:22:05
Now, these are not my own words. 
01:22:07
It's bad. 
01:22:08
Do you think that we're all going to go down a hole somewhere? 
01:22:10
Do you think I'd walk away in the store if someone said that to me? 
01:22:13
There is no way that's happening, because I'm not keeping their words in my soul. 
01:22:17
I say, well, let me explain to you something. 
01:22:19
There is a God, and He's alive, and I know Him. 
01:22:21
He's got great plans for this service, and this wicked stuff you see going on is all 
01:22:24
being exposed. 
01:22:25
He's going to move His hand, things are going to be going to happen, and you're going to 
01:22:29
be so happy with your life. 
01:22:31
So stop saying the words you just said. 
01:22:33
If I were right in front of Him, I choose to lose all the negative words, I plant positive 
01:22:38
words. 
01:22:39
I believe in the life of God, the presence of God. 
01:22:41
I know He's got great plans for us. 
01:22:43
I know these are powerful days coming on the earth, and they're watching you in the grocery 
01:22:47
store. 
01:22:48
That's good. 
01:22:51
Man, that felt good. 
01:22:55
That was so strong. 
01:22:56
Do you really believe that I said yes, and why don't you? 
01:22:59
I don't just listen to this negative garbage. 
01:23:06
It comes from hell, and sometimes I'll go, the words you just spoke, hell told you those 
01:23:11
words. 
01:23:12
If you're feeling bad, you don't like yourself, you're believing those words, and if you get 
01:23:16
stronger, you're actually repeating those words. 
01:23:19
So stop marketing hell. 
01:23:20
Why not market heaven? 
01:23:22
And that is my... 
01:23:23
Oh, God. 
01:23:24
Well, you know, this is one of those episodes that people, including myself, need to listen 
01:23:31
to more than once, two or three times. 
01:23:33
There's so much meat. 
01:23:35
You can bring hope in your day-to-day life, no matter where you go or who you see. 
01:23:40
You can bring hope by saying what is truth, and God does care, and He is doing something. 
01:23:46
You may not see enough, but you're going to see this happen, and I'll even tell people, 
01:23:50
you remember this day, when I told you things would be changed and they would be great, 
01:23:55
and you will be celebrating in the street when God brings in what He's doing this time, 
01:24:00
because He has judged the evil, and then I'll walk away, say something, people, say something 
01:24:09
that brings hope in life to people. 
01:24:11
They hear enough death and garbage everywhere. 
01:24:15
It's so good, so good, so, so, so, so good. 
01:24:18
Well, can't talk about revealing heaven.com and your other website before we close. 
01:24:23
Yeah, I do have two websites. 
01:24:26
I really didn't name either one of them, but you know, the father tells me what to say, 
01:24:30
and I always obey. 
01:24:31
He named my book, Revealing Heaven, so we made our first website, revealingheaven.com, 
01:24:37
and we have a lot of products there. 
01:24:39
We actually got some new things in already that will be taken with us to Nebraska. 
01:24:43
I'm excited about it. 
01:24:44
We have some new things that represent heaven, and that's another part of my job to reveal 
01:24:49
and create heaven on this earth, so that's what you find, revealingheaven.com, and catcur.com. 
01:24:55
That is a spiritual platform that doesn't listen to any negative or evil or wickedness. 
01:25:01
It gives you all kinds of revelation in there. 
01:25:05
We have videos you can watch. 
01:25:07
You can see interviews done by people who ask me certain questions that are really great. 
01:25:12
We have a gallery of things what they look like in the spirit realm, like I think you 
01:25:17
can see what an aquamanchen looks like that I saw in heaven. 
01:25:20
You can see how even in the transportation looks like in the spirit realm. 
01:25:25
You ride on beams of light, travel on paths of light. 
01:25:28
That's what Christ did when he stepped into the spirit realm and walked through the bodies 
01:25:33
of the people. 
01:25:34
When they were going to throw him off that cliff, he said he passed through the people. 
01:25:41
He didn't say he passed around. 
01:25:43
He took one little sidestep into the spirit realm, spirit realm supersedes this physical 
01:25:48
realm, and he passed right through the people and they never saw him. 
01:25:52
You see kinds of things like that in there. 
01:25:56
There's also all kinds of decorations and things that can train you to let you know 
01:25:59
things in a greater way. 
01:26:01
There's testimonies on catcur.com, and it's the only way to give to me online. 
01:26:08
No other person's Facebook or whatever is out there. 
01:26:12
I don't ask people to give me money in any of the videos, not on YouTube or Facebook. 
01:26:17
I'm not going to do that, but people will take my stuff. 
01:26:20
They say, well, you need to give money to this missionary camp. 
01:26:23
That's not going to be great to the pocketbook people. 
01:26:26
Other people asking me to get your money, and I'm not doing it. 
01:26:30
You have to ask to go to catcur.com, click on the treasury if you want to be a part of 
01:26:35
helping to support Heaven's plan to bring Heaven to Earth. 
01:26:39
So good. 
01:26:40
Cat, we love you. 
01:26:41
Love you. 
01:26:42
Love you. 
01:26:43
Thank you so much. 
01:26:44
Would you go ahead and pray for the people as we close out? 
01:26:47
I know you've got great declarations, so go for it. 
01:26:52
Yeah, Father, I thank you for this day, this glorious, beautiful day that you have made. 
01:26:57
A day for things to be great for us on the earth. 
01:27:00
A day for us to know you more, to hear you clear, Father. 
01:27:04
This is a wonderful day, and you have purposed this day. 
01:27:08
Satan doesn't own this day. 
01:27:09
His people don't own this day, even the person sitting in the highest seat of the land. 
01:27:14
That's stolen. 
01:27:15
But Father, we know what's going to happen to those people, and I thank you for your 
01:27:18
plan for all of that to happen. 
01:27:20
But right now, Father, I just impart the life of God, the presence of God, His will, His 
01:27:27
way. 
01:27:28
I evict all evil, every evil spirit. 
01:27:31
Get out of everyone listening to this broadcast right now in Jesus' name. 
01:27:36
I thank you for showing us how to rule and reign with Christ's Son, who actually the 
01:27:40
entire earth belongs to. 
01:27:43
If I serve, I will not serve another. 
01:27:46
There's nothing darkness in me. 
01:27:47
There's no evil in me. 
01:27:48
There's light, there's love, there's the power of the living God. 
01:27:51
Thank you, Father, for showing them and giving them a taste of you so they will run after 
01:27:58
you. 
01:28:00
Your Son died on that cross because you asked Him to pay a price, and He did. 
01:28:06
Our lives for all eternity will be great. 
01:28:08
They will be excited. 
01:28:09
There will be so many amazing things to do with you, and I'm looking forward to eternity. 
01:28:15
Right now, I'm on this earth, and I'm not going anywhere until you say I go. 
01:28:20
Father, I hope they know you that well, and can think of you that powerfully, that they 
01:28:27
know who they are in Christ. 
01:28:29
Christ in you is the hope of glory, and God is powerful. 
01:28:36
He's represented with the light of God, and the power of God, and it will cover this earth 
01:28:41
like the waters cover the sea one day. 
01:28:44
I hope you're carrying it. 
01:28:46
In Jesus' name I pray, amen. 
01:28:49
Amen. 
01:28:50
Amen. 
01:28:51
Amen. 
01:28:52
Amen. 
01:28:53
Thank you so much, Cat. 
01:28:54
You are a dear friend, and you and I just become better friends all the time. 
01:28:58
I appreciate you very much. 
01:29:01
I'd say keep the faith that you already are. 
01:29:04
I got it. 
01:29:06
So God bless you. 
01:29:08
Give our love to your staff. 
01:29:11
To the rest of you, we will see you again tomorrow at 11 a.m. of Pacific Standard Time. 
01:29:16
See you all later. 
01:29:17
How dreamy said we love her too. 
01:29:19
We sure will. 
01:29:20
Bye-bye.

01:30
happy Wednesday everyone August 31 2022 our apologies were much later than normal 
01:39
but we will recover it'll be so good it'll be worth worth the way pardon I still have a cough I got 
01:44
one cough drop left right here well we may do that I don't know how this cough comes and goes but 
01:49
it does but anyway I wanted to say to the group to the to our viewers as you many of you know we're 
01:55
off of YouTube right now we got notified either this morning or last night whenever whatever that 
02:02
happened so they decided one of our guests said something and that's strike two and and the notice 
02:10
I looked at today said one more strike and you're removed from the channel so we're trying not to 
02:15
do that but anyway we're not on YouTube today and I think I heard that it will be two weeks someone 
02:19
can mention that in my chat if it if it's two weeks but anyway we're off right now we're going to 
02:27
and yes it's two weeks at least it says so we will be emailing you daily to let you know that 
02:33
we're reminding you that we're not on YouTube so please please forward or text or email as many 
02:42
of your friends as you can and say they're here but they're on rumble only because of all of this 
02:48
junk that's going on you say it in those words or any other words but we are continuing to be 
02:56
flexible and flow with what happens so that if this goes down we have that right now we are on 
03:04
rumble we are on Facebook and we're on Elijah list calm so we try to be careful we're talking code 
03:12
today we don't have to be careful at all because we're not on YouTube so they're gonna probably 
03:19
in my personal opinion people will never forget all the times they were kicked off I doubt that 
03:24
YouTube will last but I'm not saying that as a prophetic voice but you know we're all looking 
03:30
for alternatives you know maybe when this gets over and they got new leadership maybe it won't 
03:35
matter anymore so all right let's show I want to to keep before you new ads that we're developing 
03:44
that shows the the wells the freshwater wells we're digging in Uganda we're over 50 freshwater wells 
03:51
we're digging a new freshwater well every five days there's been 300 salvations at last report 
03:57
which means there's more now and there've been eight church plants so this is because of your 
04:02
generous generous generous donations and as I've said before a significant portion of what you 
04:09
donate to this ministry not only keeps us going but we feel called by the Lord to to tide if you 
04:16
will that money into many freshwater wells it's a lot more than a tithe but God has blessed us 
04:23
for doing that so we've got a quick promo on that so without further delay let's go ahead and play 
04:29
that Emily 
04:59
you 
05:59
Thank you again so much for your donations to support this, these wells. 
06:08
The Lord thanks you. 
06:09
I can say by the Spirit, the Lord is thanking you. 
06:13
Great rewards, he says in the scriptures, even if you give so much as a simple cup of 
06:18
cold water to one of these, you will surely not lose your reward. 
06:22
So that's what the Lord said, not us. 
06:25
So thank you for doing that. 
06:28
I truly believe that the Lord has shown me that when you get to heaven one day, when 
06:32
it's your time to go, there will be little children, maybe hundreds of them will come 
06:37
up to you and say, thank you because of you. 
06:40
We had fresh water and because of fresh water, I received the Lord. 
06:43
So thank you. 
06:44
So that's an amazing thing. 
06:45
We really, really, really appreciate your giving. 
06:48
So thank you so much. 
06:50
We are in an intense time. 
06:52
We have about eight weeks, nine weeks maybe for the election. 
06:58
There are, this is not prophetic, but there are some people that say, are we even going 
07:02
to have an election because things are getting intense? 
07:05
I believe, I hope there will be an election if there is and when there is, be sure that 
07:10
you overwhelm the system by voting, but many of you, more of you voting than they expect 
07:17
to vote. 
07:18
You need to overwhelm the system because they can't recover from that. 
07:21
Greg Phillips was, of 2000 mules was on and last week or the week before and said, that's 
07:28
the way to do it. 
07:29
You got to overwhelm the system. 
07:30
So anyway, between now and then make sure the deep state is going to try and prevent 
07:36
this election. 
07:37
We know that that's what they want to do because they know they're going to lose if we get, 
07:40
if the election goes through, be sure your gas is full, keep your tank topped off, keep 
07:46
your groceries of non perishables. 
07:49
Don't just fill up your refrigerator because what if the power goes out? 
07:52
So make sure you have non perishable, we even have powdered milk sitting in there and canned 
07:57
goods and cereal non perishable things that you can open the can and make sure you have 
08:03
a can opener too. 
08:04
Because a lot of people have those electric can openers, which may or may not work if 
08:08
they do something serious. 
08:09
I'm not prophesying that I'm just saying make sure your pantry is as full as you're able 
08:14
to do it and extra for others if you're able to do that. 
08:17
So I just wanted to tell you that we are, these are not going to be a normal eight weeks 
08:22
between now and then the deep state does not like you and me and believers and conservatives. 
08:30
In fact, they, you've heard several of our guests say they basically want something like 
08:35
nine out of 10 or they want to bring the population down to 500 million, which is, which is the 
08:42
population is what that's what the population. 
08:45
I looked up what was the population at the time of Christ coincidentally it was 500 million. 
08:50
That's what they want to bring 7.5 billion down to is 500 million, which is, which means 
08:56
that it's their desire and we've said this on the air. 
08:58
This is not some shocking new thing. 
09:00
It's their desire to depopulate the earth now they're not going to succeed. 
09:05
We're going to bring Patricia Katker sorry on in just a moment and she has seen into 
09:11
the future. 
09:12
They are not going to succeed at that. 
09:14
And so we want you to know that, but we do know that they're going to want to try. 
09:18
So make sure your gas is full and you're in your pantries just full as you're able to 
09:22
do it. 
09:23
You have extra water, anything that you think you might need. 
09:26
If you can't go to the store for two weeks or three weeks, have it have a good supply 
09:32
there. 
09:33
All right. 
09:34
I think that's all for today. 
09:37
Thank you again for your support and let's bring in Katker. 
09:40
So it's Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. 
09:42
So here we go. 
10:00
Well good morning Kat or I guess you should say it for you. 
10:03
It's good afternoon in it back into Florida, right? 
10:06
Yes I am in Florida and I guess it's afternoon. 
10:12
One said that your clock was off today or something. 
10:15
It was all three of the clocks and it's not my job to replace batteries. 
10:21
Okay. 
10:22
I do sweep and clean the floors and clean up stuff and I mean, I do do that kind of thing 
10:26
a lot, but I don't put batteries in the clock. 
10:29
So none of them were right and they were one was an hour and a half off home was an hour 
10:34
off and one was like two hours late. 
10:37
And so none of them helped me and I have something to say and so yeah, go for it. 
10:46
Go for it Kat. 
10:48
The father wants you to know that you should fear never, not ever, never in this day. 
10:53
He didn't give anyone a spirit of fear in case you wonder if you have fear that's not 
10:58
from him. 
10:59
So there's number one point number one if you're in fear, I'm not saying maybe you're 
11:03
a little concerned about things, I'm thinking if you're in real fear, that is not God. 
11:07
God's not putting fear in you. 
11:09
He's not going to say fearful things to you. 
11:11
He made you powerful. 
11:12
Right. 
11:13
He gave us a spirit of a sound mind. 
11:17
Remember that right power, love and a second gave it to us. 
11:20
That's what he put in you when he made you. 
11:22
So therefore he told me to take authority over. 
11:24
So right now father take authority over all fear, no matter who's experiencing it, no 
11:29
matter where it is in this world. 
11:31
I cancel you, I evict you from everybody's home, from their soul in Jesus name and I impart 
11:38
the life of God, the love of God, the power of God, the will, his way in Jesus name, celebration, 
11:47
expectation of what you're going to do father, not what the devil has planned, who's the 
11:53
Lord of the Flies by the way, just remember that Jesus Lord of hosts, Saint Lord of Flies 
11:58
says about all the wills that he has, so we thank you this day father that fear is evicted, 
12:03
joy and celebration, which is what you talk about, it's okay to be practical, but don't 
12:09
ever let fear interfere in your life in Jesus name, amen, amen, amen, and don't take all 
12:17
the toilet paper, don't take all the toilet paper, I've been, I've been collecting it. 
12:23
We've been collecting it for a few months on, I mean, we have that much, but you know, 
12:28
we collect it while they had plenty, because I don't want to run on the TP. 
12:32
Yeah, it was a good plan, collect it while there's plenty. 
12:35
Isn't it amazing, what did we do in this world on the earth before we had toilet paper? 
12:41
You know, it wasn't that many years ago they invented that, they actually invented toilet 
12:45
paper. 
12:46
I don't want to think about it. 
12:48
Paul Harvey had a story where there was this train full of certain, it wasn't cut up, it 
12:56
was rolls or something, and it didn't make its destination, something went wrong, or 
13:00
the guy went bankrupt or something, and someone had the idea to cut these up into smaller 
13:06
rolls or something like that, and it became toilet paper, he said, let's make it toilet, 
13:11
yeah, it was something like that. 
13:12
I've tried to find that article or that audio by Paul Harvey, because you know, no one told 
13:18
the story like Paul Harvey, you know, and he goes, and now you know the rest of the 
13:24
story, you know, yes, and putting it into everybody will know the rest of the story. 
13:29
Yeah. 
13:30
Yeah. 
13:31
Now you don't see Kat, we know that the deep state hates us. 
13:36
We know that they don't, that they would like to depopulate, but what has God showed 
13:41
you is going to actually happen? 
13:44
There will be no gross massacres, there will be no mass killings or dying, nodded on this 
13:53
time. 
13:54
God sent, if you think about from the Father's point of view, he sent people to the earth 
13:59
that he needs here right now, he needs this many people, all the ones who are here now, 
14:03
he sent here specifically, he timed your birth on the earth, he needs you, and in these days 
14:09
coming months and years coming, there will be so much activity for the body of Christ 
14:14
to do, even good moral people to do, new inventions, he's still sending them people, so if it 
14:21
wouldn't be half wiped out, that wouldn't be possible, which is why, by the way, I want 
14:25
to say something, it isn't that they hate us people, it's that they're very afraid of 
14:32
us. 
14:33
Oh, wow. 
14:34
Quite a small correction in there, the Father says, Satan doesn't hate you, he is afraid 
14:40
of you. 
14:41
Wow. 
14:42
Wow. 
14:43
Satan is the doormat, we are not a doormat, we were given power and authority, he was 
14:49
not given power and authority. 
14:51
We have legions of angels, more of the hosts ever than there is a demonic, they fire out 
14:59
number them, they're bigger than them, and they're ready to do things in this time on 
15:04
our behalf, so more than ever before the activity, what you will see is activity of the host 
15:09
of heaven in this world, individually doing things for people, even in groups of people, 
15:15
you'll see a risk is being done that would not have happened in any other way, God is 
15:19
about to show off his power, Satan will not get his chance, now you need to understand 
15:25
God has a timeline, I've seen the timeline, we're not near the end, we're near the end 
15:33
of the way we will be operating because we'll be in authority, in power, we'll have the 
15:37
great positions, we'll have the inventions, that's what is planned for our lives by the 
15:41
one who made you, not the one who would like to wipe you out, the reason why he wants to 
15:46
kill, steal all of your stories, he's afraid, he knows this is not his time people, he knows 
15:53
he's trying to make a rush to take it early, and guess what, do you think the God of all 
15:58
creation is going to let the Lord of the Flies take over right now? 
16:03
I think he's about to get a lot of insect bites himself, let me tell you right now, 
16:09
what is going to happen is God's plan, not even man's plan, not wicked man's plan, not 
16:15
hell's plan, okay, I don't care what their plan is, it always fails, so don't let fear 
16:21
be the one thing that controls you, because Satan's really good at that, he knows how 
16:26
to use fear, if he can get you to think about all the negative all the time, then you probably 
16:31
will dwell on that, you're not supposed to, he's supposed to walk in power and authority, 
16:34
he's supposed to rule with Jesus Christ, I haven't seen that openly happening in many 
16:39
places, but it's going to be, to the point the Father said, that the world will want 
16:46
you as a friend or to know you because you're a believer, that is how different it's going 
16:51
to be if you want to see your future, that's your future, not running around afraid you'll 
16:56
starve to death, Satan's wicked armies will come to get you and drag you away, that is 
17:02
not, this is not the end, this is not the time of the perilous times, this is not the 
17:07
tribulation people, it's hundreds of years away, and I don't mind saying that because 
17:12
guess what, I'll still be here saying that and you'll be enjoying heaven, so you need 
17:16
to understand, you say God's will, God's way, God's will not mine, but his, because when 
17:24
you live his will his way, you'll have celebration, anticipation, expectation of greatness in 
17:31
you, you were sent here to be great, not to watch the parade go by, we're supposed to 
17:39
be leaders, we're supposed to be the ones people look up to for answers from heaven, 
17:45
and man's mindset and man's head knowledge cannot come up or equal revelation from the 
17:51
one who made us, he knows every thought of everybody, he knows where every wicked person 
17:57
is, every evil camp, every hidden thing, there's nothing hidden from him, but he's 
18:02
going to expose all of it, and then justice is coming, he is not changing what he's saying, 
18:08
if you're tired of listening, don't listen, go sit with the Lord of the Flies and get 
18:13
a big fly swatter. 
18:14
Cap, do you still believe that while the deep state, especially these last few weeks before 
18:20
the election, I'm probably going to try a lot of things, do you still believe we need 
18:23
to get our popcorn out and our cake out and enjoy the show, is this a time to enjoy the 
18:29
show? 
18:30
You know I'm still enjoying the show, I will live the way the Father talks to me about, 
18:36
you have a choice, I'm not going to make you take what he says, but it's so easy and simple 
18:41
to take what you see with your human eyes, when you don't have just human eyes and you 
18:47
see the spirit realm, you understand, they are scrambling, to hang on to anything they 
18:52
can hang on to, and that would be the spiritual wickedness and the physical wickedness. 
18:59
They know, some of them already know, this whole thing is going to fail, they know it's 
19:03
going to fail. 
19:04
They're not saying that to their own groups, but they're very afraid, because it hasn't 
19:09
turned out the way they planned, because this is, this earth is the Lord and the fullness 
19:14
thereof, it's His. 
19:17
He gets to say what happens, we need to agree with Him. 
19:21
I'm not ignoring evil, I just don't participate in it, and when you continually repeat all 
19:29
of the stuff going on, I'm saying all day long, someone says what do you think about 
19:33
what's going on, you should say I think God has a plan, I think He's in charge and I'm 
19:37
on His side, because when you keep repeating what the devil wants you to repeat, you're 
19:42
marketing health plans, make you afraid, make you weak, strip the hope away from you, the 
19:49
joy away from you, you don't want to lose your joy, that's why the celebrate thing comes 
19:54
in. 
19:55
I can tell you I'm sure that Noah, it's a good thing none of you are Noah, you wouldn't 
20:00
have never lasted 120 years and this thing won't take 120 years, but who won in the end? 
20:07
I can tell you this, the Father has a plan for you, not just your children, your grandchildren, 
20:13
your great great great great great great great great grandchildren, He has a plan for you 
20:17
if you're alive and breathing, He has a plan for you, and that is to market what heaven 
20:23
is, be a testimony of what heaven is, demonstrate the power of the living God in this earth, 
20:31
not waiting for months to go by, you have authority right now, open your front door, 
20:38
kick out the devil, kick out every word, sound, image, thought, frequency of hell, if you've 
20:43
been watching the fake news, there's no wonder you're having issues, why not make news for 
20:50
God and say what He's doing in this world, setting it up for the greatest days this world 
20:56
will ever see until Christ sits on the throne and Jerusalem and yes, He is going to do that 
21:01
one day. 
21:03
There are people whose families and friends, close family and friends are really on their 
21:09
case, I have a few of those myself. 
21:13
Mine gave up. 
21:14
They gave up. 
21:15
Okay, I was going to ask you about that, so how do I ask this question? 
21:21
Is God going to in a sense vindicate, you know, vengeance is mine and all that, we don't 
21:26
want vengeance on our loved ones and family, but justice comes and redemption comes, is 
21:31
God going to redeem, vindicate whatever word we might choose, those who have held strong 
21:39
towards. 
21:40
I will say what is word, it's in power. 
21:42
Okay. 
21:43
He's going to empower those with authority and dominion who have stood and not stepped 
21:50
back. 
21:51
They will be some of the greatest leaders in this world, people will look up to them 
21:55
because they'll know all the time, don't stop saying what God has said, you don't stop 
21:59
saying it, because He is looking to see who's saying and what they're saying. 
22:04
Okay, He doesn't have to convince me to do it. 
22:07
I've seen Him in person and heard Him in person and I've seen the future. 
22:11
I know what the future is going to be, regardless of what the devil's trying to do, he's trying 
22:15
to do his great big takeover right now. 
22:18
He already knows it's going to fail, but he's going to take as many as he can get and he 
22:22
does that by crushing your dreams, by stealing your destiny. 
22:26
Your destiny is still waiting for you. 
22:31
You have to say yes to that, no to the devil, open your front door and he did anything of 
22:36
hell out or wicked man evicted out of your home, make a habitation for heaven and heaven 
22:41
in the presence of God will flood your home all the time. 
22:45
You have a choice, you have a choice, you can follow the Lord of Hosts or Lord of the 
22:51
Flies. 
22:52
By the way, you really mean that, of course the devil can be evicted through your walls, 
22:57
but you really mean open your door and let him out. 
22:59
If you mean that. 
23:02
That way if people come in and told you all the bad stuff going on or they have predicted, 
23:07
I won't even call it, I won't even say that they prophesied it. 
23:11
A true prophecy comes from God, not man's mind, by the way. 
23:16
It's words God spoke. 
23:17
He spoke them. 
23:19
He spoke them to somebody and said, you say this, you will say this. 
23:22
He's not going to tell somebody to say something that's against what he's been saying. 
23:28
Something that's fear getting in, they let control get in, like you said, have talked 
23:33
about Steve, people trying to pressure you. 
23:35
No one does that to me now because they know what they're going to get. 
23:39
Hands laid out on them. 
23:40
That's what they're going to get. 
23:41
Maybe not in the way they want to. 
23:42
But I will tell you this, I'm not backing up. 
23:45
I'm not backing up one single word that the Father has told me to say. 
23:49
One single thing I have been shown, guess what's going to happen? 
23:53
What God wants. 
23:55
What His plan is and what people don't see because they don't really know Him like they 
24:01
should know Him. 
24:02
They can know Him. 
24:03
Let's change it. 
24:04
They can know Him. 
24:05
The more you know Him, you understand how He works. 
24:08
He is mysterious. 
24:09
He's never going to do it man's way. 
24:10
He doesn't necessarily have to make you understand. 
24:12
He just says, this is going to happen and then He does it. 
24:15
That's good. 
24:16
That's good. 
24:17
The gospel of the Prophet is different than just the prophetic. 
24:20
I love the prophetic that people can see and hear and say things. 
24:23
It's an office, it's a place you sit in and you have authority in. 
24:29
So I cannot say what man is saying. 
24:31
I cannot agree with what they're saying. 
24:33
I'm not going to agree if it's against what God has said because in the end, Steve, who 
24:38
do you think will be celebrating the most? 
24:40
Oh yeah. 
24:41
Oh yeah. 
24:42
I think you know John- 
24:43
Well, I guess what everyone else will be celebrating right along with them and they 
24:47
will enjoy the victory that's about to happen for us. 
24:49
I have no problem keeping some extra graham crackers in your closet if you want it. 
24:55
That's perfectly fine to do that and this day and age, it might not be a bad idea to 
24:58
have a few extra things around, but I do know God's not going to let anybody starve or die 
25:03
from starvation. 
25:04
He's not going to allow that. 
25:05
Okay. 
25:06
Johnny Enlo says a thing. 
25:07
He said it many, many times, so it's not one off thing, but he said it for a couple 
25:12
years now. 
25:13
He said, God had told him we are about to be safe from things we don't even know we 
25:18
need to be saved from. 
25:20
Is that a perspective you have? 
25:22
In other words, there's things that if we knew how horrific it was that God was about 
25:27
to save us from, maybe we'd even look at things differently. 
25:31
What are your thoughts about that? 
25:32
I know some of those things. 
25:34
Okay. 
25:35
Things it's hard to even say. 
25:36
But the key word is this, saved from them. 
25:39
Yeah, exactly. 
25:40
So God's plan is not to wipe us all out when he has built generations on purpose, generations 
25:49
like I'm seventh generation of really God doing things the way he wants to. 
25:54
He's been building generations with people who believe and will believe what he says. 
25:59
He's been building them. 
26:00
He's not going to, why wouldn't he let them be wiped out Steve, that doesn't even, that 
26:03
doesn't make sense. 
26:04
Okay. 
26:05
Right. 
26:06
Exactly. 
26:07
He's not going to do it. 
26:08
He's not going to get wiped out, this will not be a communist country, no matter what 
26:11
they say. 
26:13
They don't rule this country. 
26:15
No one sitting in the left or the hidden or the evil or the wicked or the White House 
26:21
or the Pentagon, anywhere else, they don't rule this country. 
26:25
We the people are in charge of this country and we will have what we say will happen. 
26:32
We will have it. 
26:33
I'm not talking about the darkness. 
26:35
What we say, justice, liberty and freedom, that is who we are, right in this moment that 
26:41
you're breathing, you're still free. 
26:44
God's not going to let that all be taken away from us, no matter how many lies they put 
26:48
out, no matter how many pictures they show people and they've not created one good thing. 
26:54
Don't expect them to do it. 
26:56
Don't expect them not to try to steal, cheat and lie again, but it won't help them at all 
27:03
because God is going to do what he's going to do and they will be brought to justice. 
27:07
I will not stop saying that. 
27:09
I will not stop saying that because that is what is going to happen. 
27:13
I trust him. 
27:15
If you know how important it was to trust God, when you begin to trust him, you begin 
27:18
to actually believe him. 
27:20
When you begin to believe him this season, you will step into a level of faith you never 
27:24
thought you could have. 
27:25
Wow. 
27:26
And after that, you are given a spirit of faith, a high level of faith and no one will 
27:32
be able to convince you that what God has said won't happen. 
27:36
They won't be able to. 
27:37
There's no way they can because you're living and walking in the spirit and not in your 
27:43
flesh head thinking and assuming and expecting what man has said will happen. 
27:50
They're wrong. 
27:52
If someone is afraid and they're struggling and they're having a hard time believing that 
27:58
and you said, if you will believe God, does that, in order to get there, does someone 
28:05
say, I don't feel it. 
28:08
It's hard to see it, but as an act of my will, I choose to believe. 
28:12
Is that how they do that? 
28:13
Absolutely. 
28:14
Because you know what you put in your soul is what you are. 
28:18
As a man thinking in his heart, your soul is at the heart or core of your being. 
28:23
It is a position. 
28:24
When he talks about the heart, he's not talking about this human beating heart, which side 
28:29
is that? 
28:30
I don't know. 
28:31
Whatever side is tongue beating. 
28:32
He isn't talking about your flesh heart when he says, as a man think it in his heart. 
28:37
He's talking about a position, very core heart of your being is your soul. 
28:44
Your soul is in the center of your being. 
28:46
Your mind, your will and your emotions, you know, that's what the devil is going after. 
28:51
Because even if he doesn't really have to do anything except control that, control what 
28:55
you believe, control what you say, control what you watch, control where you go. 
29:00
That's what he wants to do. 
29:02
We let him do it. 
29:03
Well, I stopped doing that a long time ago. 
29:05
Okay. 
29:06
I'm letting the spirit of God share with me and show me and encourage me. 
29:11
It says encourage one another. 
29:13
So if you keep sharing what the left is doing or planning or their absolute stupidity of 
29:19
who they think they are, they can't run at McDonald's, let alone this country. 
29:26
They don't know anything. 
29:27
They only know what Satan is putting in their soul, what wicked, evil people above them 
29:32
who are there controlling and some of them are about to die. 
29:35
So just get ready for that. 
29:36
Yeah. 
29:37
Wait a minute. 
29:38
Some are about to die. 
29:40
Yeah. 
29:41
Okay. 
29:42
So you did repeat it. 
29:43
So who are the some that are about to die? 
29:46
Just to be clear. 
29:47
Because you said it. 
29:48
Okay. 
29:50
This is like an Ananias and Sapphira time is what you're saying some is and I think a 
29:55
lot of order crossed over the line of living or dying. 
29:58
It's too late for them. 
29:59
What about what, because we, you know, when we think of Ananias and Sapphira, because 
30:04
I'm the one that use that, we think of people in the body of Christ. 
30:07
Are there people in the body of Christ who are about to leave this earth because they 
30:12
have chosen to not walk with them? 
30:15
I do know some are leaving the earth because their time is over. 
30:18
Okay. 
30:19
So don't confuse that. 
30:20
Yeah. 
30:21
You know, a great leader of God who died, I was not talking about, I said the wicked, 
30:25
evil people. 
30:26
Okay. 
30:27
The wicked evil who are trying to control all this stuff. 
30:30
Some of them. 
30:31
Okay. 
30:32
You may not even know who they are, but you will find out. 
30:35
You may not know who they are. 
30:36
Some of them are about to die. 
30:39
Yeah. 
30:40
I saw on the news. 
30:43
By the way, I could recommend this, there's a site called Citizen Free Press. 
30:48
It's kind of like a new dredge. 
30:49
It's conservative. 
30:50
And on that same day, I think it was yesterday, it could have been the day before, but I think 
30:54
it was yesterday, two different celebrities at the age of 32 suddenly died. 
30:59
Now, someone could say, well, that was the Vax, I don't know, but God is in control 
31:05
of life and death. 
31:06
And it was weird on the exact same day. 
31:09
And we don't know by looking at that, was it the Vax? 
31:12
Did they, uh, did they cross the red line with God? 
31:17
You know, you know, I don't know what to think about that kind of thing. 
31:19
I also don't want people, I don't want like believers and other people thinking maybe they 
31:23
crossed the line. 
31:26
You didn't cross the line people. 
31:27
He's talking about the wicked evil and some of them are hidden with evil who are actually 
31:32
the ones controlling. 
31:33
Cause I can tell you the ones in the White House aren't really running things. 
31:39
Not the real stuff. 
31:40
They're not really running it. 
31:41
They're being told what to say and told what to do by very wicked evil people. 
31:46
Some of those people, and that will affect them because then they won't have them telling 
31:51
them what to do. 
31:52
So you'll see a major thing happening in the White House, uh, probably confusion, probably 
31:58
a lot of confusion, more than normal confusion and other things began to like, it may even 
32:03
be quiet for a while because they, some of them won't know what to do now that the, the 
32:06
ones who thought they were going to take over everything, some of them are going to die. 
32:10
It's just going to happen. 
32:11
Like I said, I won't let them out. 
32:12
I won't allow them to remain on the earth. 
32:15
That is, those are his words. 
32:17
Some will die. 
32:18
I will not allow them to remain on the earth. 
32:19
So those are the ones that I'm talking about. 
32:21
I'm not talking about people in the body of Christ who maybe are messing around or something 
32:25
like that. 
32:26
I'm not talking about them. 
32:27
These are wicked evil people, more wicked than the ones in the White House. 
32:32
Are you in, I wanted to ask you about that. 
32:34
Cause that was interesting what you just said, cause we know that there's people in the basement 
32:38
as it were, or on the, on the earpiece as it were, or in literal, are you saying that 
32:44
the people that are giving the orders to the fake people in the White House, are you saying 
32:50
the people that are carrying out the orders are in a sense less wicked than the people 
32:56
that are giving them orders? 
32:58
I have to say that they are because they are, I know you will think that they, I'm not, 
33:05
I'm not cutting any of them slack and I'm not going to minimize any of the evil wickedness 
33:09
they did, but there are sort of what you were talking about earlier. 
33:13
There are more wicked people who may not even be in this country, but they're about to die. 
33:19
Some are going to die and it won't be expected and it will bring confusion. 
33:23
That's what happens in the enemy's camp when, and guess what? 
33:26
Satan doesn't even care if they die, he probably killed them and then he'll take them to hell 
33:30
and torture them more than anyone else is what he does. 
33:32
So you don't get anything. 
33:34
You gain no prize in hell when you're wicked and evil people, you get no prize, none. 
33:40
There's no prize in hell for anybody. 
33:43
And so if you, if that's who you're planning to be a part of or you are a part of it, you 
33:47
better get out of that really quick because it's telling you justice has already been 
33:51
sent, it's already been sent here. 
33:54
A gavel has already been stopped and no one's going to stop what God is about to do at all. 
34:02
And some of that, starting of it will be some, a couple, I'm not saying a lot, I don't expect 
34:06
50 people to die, but there will be a couple that will die that will shock people. 
34:11
Wow. 
34:12
And maybe that shock factor that it's like who would have ever thought that might be 
34:17
a clue that that's one of those that were removed. 
34:19
It probably may not be anybody you even have heard about, not generally like living here 
34:26
and doing stuff here because most of those people who are in this country are the ones 
34:31
who are allowing to be used, paid to be used, or do it because they love evil. 
34:37
There's people who are over this, I'm sure Robin knows about that, that are, that are 
34:42
even more wicked and evil than the ones who are in the White House. 
34:45
The ones in the White House don't have a lot of brain. 
34:48
I'm just being honest, okay. 
34:50
And their normal brain thinking of a normal human being who's been through the 12th grade 
34:54
wouldn't be trying to do the stuff that they're doing because you're not going to run anything. 
34:59
You're going to run the end of the ground, which by the way is what they want to happen. 
35:03
They want to run the country into the ground, people. 
35:05
If you voted for them, repent for voting for them, God's going to do anything against you. 
35:12
You thought you were doing the right thing because of the whichever side you thought 
35:16
you were on. 
35:17
I'm on God's side, people. 
35:18
That's the right amount of righteousness, righteousness, justice, liberty, and freedom. 
35:23
That's the side I'm on. 
35:25
And at this moment, it happens to be the right. 
35:28
Yeah. 
35:29
Yeah. 
35:30
It's not that the right is so righteous. 
35:31
It's not that the Republicans are that much more righteous than the Democrats as a whole, 
35:35
but there was a more correct stance against abortion to name the big one, to name the 
35:43
one. 
35:44
Well, I think also a lot of those people did want our country to succeed. 
35:47
Yeah. 
35:48
I mean, they may have attitudes and they may not always be thinking the right thing, but 
35:53
generally most of that side is not going to go ahead and go along with the evil at all. 
36:00
They don't like it. 
36:01
They don't want nothing to do with it. 
36:02
And even major businesses, not talking about, you know, the media and all that, major well-known 
36:08
businesses don't like what's happening because they don't want to lose their business. 
36:12
Right. 
36:13
They don't want to. 
36:14
And even some of those who've remained silent, are you there? 
36:16
The thing you're going to start saying, some who remain silent are about to start speaking 
36:21
up. 
36:22
And are there, have you seen is what got showing you people that were, how do I just ask the 
36:28
question that were, let's say just two years ago, hard core left and they believed everything 
36:36
that was being told to them about the Democratic and the liberal establishment, whatever, who 
36:42
God has been slowly but surely softening. 
36:46
Have you seen some of that? 
36:48
I think it's bringing clarity to their mind about their own life and future is probably 
36:52
what he's been doing. 
36:54
The Holy Spirit can speak to anybody, even if he can speak to people who aren't believers, 
36:58
it doesn't mean he'll live in them, but he certainly can say things to them. 
37:02
Good. 
37:03
And their own angels can say things to them, you know, in their mind, stuff like this, you 
37:07
need to get out of this. 
37:08
This is not going to end well. 
37:10
This is wrong. 
37:11
I think he probably says something. 
37:12
This all is wrong. 
37:13
I'm sure he says that a lot to them, but you're right, Steve. 
37:16
There are people who are secular people and they have decided to change what they're thinking 
37:22
because just themselves looking at their own situation, not really participating in anything, 
37:28
are going to start speaking against what's going on because it's horrible government. 
37:33
It's no government at all. 
37:34
Okay. 
37:35
It's just control. 
37:36
And that's what they want to do is control. 
37:38
They're not even thinking they're happy and they're on the wicked, the wicked in the White 
37:40
House. 
37:41
Let's just say that you're thinking how much money they've gotten, how much control they 
37:44
have, and they're really excited that this whole thing's paying off for them. 
37:48
What they don't know is they're sinking themselves deeper in a pit than they ever knew would 
37:53
happen because those who are controlling don't care about them. 
38:00
And when, if they ever went the way they wanted it to, they would be taken out too. 
38:05
So evil doesn't love anybody. 
38:08
They hate, they kill, steal and destroy. 
38:10
That's what their plan is. 
38:12
That's why that's what looks like it's happening in the White House is because their mind is 
38:16
so seared right now. 
38:17
They can't see what's right, but they themselves can't figure out why isn't this getting better? 
38:21
I mean, literally, as stupid as the things are that they put out there, they can't figure 
38:26
out why, why they're making that happen. 
38:28
They don't think it's them. 
38:30
And it is them because this wasn't happening until that happened. 
38:33
Yeah. 
38:34
Can't live on this. 
38:35
And some people keep saying what God said, he is at his limit, he's at his limit. 
38:40
God does have a limit, people, you remember he did things in the past when he reached, 
38:45
when he was done with the evil and the day thereof, it was dealt with severely. 
38:50
And so I would say, you know, you yourself though, what you can do is give hope to people 
38:55
anywhere in the store, what people talking about, what's going on, it's all going to 
38:59
end wrong. 
39:00
We're all going to hell in a handbasket. 
39:01
It was going to hell in a handbasket, be a big handbasket will be the wicked and evil. 
39:06
Yeah. 
39:07
And I know, I can see it, that there are people that are on that side that will call 
39:13
the wrong side, for lack of a better word, they, they hated Christians, they hated conservative 
39:18
values, they hated anti-abortion, they were pro-choice, and I see some of them watching 
39:25
right now, and they're now waking up, they're going, what have I done? 
39:30
But now look what I've done, how do I get out of this now that I've made my bed, you 
39:36
know, the expression, you've made your bed, now you've got to lie on it. 
39:39
What would you say to some of those people who are waking up and then going, what have 
39:42
I done? 
39:43
What would you say to them? 
39:44
I would say you need to repent to God. 
39:45
Okay. 
39:46
I mean, you repent to Jesus Christ, you know, if you ever belong to Him, the things that 
39:52
are going on now, they are not Him, this is not His plan, He comes to bring a life and 
39:57
life more abundantly, where do you see abundant life? 
40:00
Have you produced abundant life, are they talking about having abundant life? 
40:04
I'm talking about the government, the illegitimate government, okay? 
40:08
No, because they don't care what happens to anybody, they're going to use and control, 
40:12
use and control, until there's no more use and control, and if you have voted for them, 
40:17
or you're still siding with them, or you're helping to promote them, I would really seriously 
40:21
ask you to just repent for all the stuff you've been involved with, to lose all the evil wickedness 
40:26
out of your soul, repent to God, and tell Him you want to be with Him on His side, you 
40:30
want Jesus Christ as your savior, and joy will flood your soul, and guess what, your 
40:34
eyes will be fully open to the darkness trying to take over not just this country, but the 
40:41
whole world, and that won't happen until the perilous times come, and the perilous times, 
40:48
this is not the perilous times, I know people think it is, but it's not. 
40:51
I've seen some of the perilous times, I've seen some of the tribulation, I've seen some 
40:56
of Christ sitting on the throne in Jerusalem, I've seen part of the millennial, whether 
40:59
you like that word or not, the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ, which by the way the 
41:02
Father said, you're not going to stop that from happening either, so stop taking it 
41:05
out of the Bible. 
41:07
Let me, let me, you know, Kat, you know me, I don't ever interrupt in the middle of the 
41:11
show to, to pray, or almost never, because I've got, you know, we're, we're getting through 
41:17
it, but I feel led right now, there's people watching, and they're going, what have I done, 
41:21
I voted the wrong, I'm looking around, it's all falling apart, I voted for this, I wish 
41:26
I knew how to repent, could you pray for those people right now, because there's a bunch 
41:31
of them, and they're going, all I just, just need is someone pray and tell me how to get 
41:36
out of this. 
41:37
Yeah, like I said, the first thing that I would do is lead you in a prayer of repentance, 
41:44
because when you've done wrong, and when you side with absolute evil, and I tell you, even 
41:51
probably 13-year-olds, 10-year-olds know that what's being said is wrong, I mean, children 
41:56
know it's wrong, and when you have the heart of a child, there's no evil in them, there's 
42:01
nothing that, that you know that, that they've had, been taken care of, they've been loved 
42:05
their whole life, but they can look around, they listen to anything on the news, they 
42:09
know that there's a mess going on, and they know that darkness, they know what evil is, 
42:14
my grandkids know what evil is, okay, they're young, but they know what it is, and so if 
42:18
you're finally gonna wake up, because I know God is shaking some people right now to wake 
42:22
you up, okay, he doesn't want you to lose what he's got planned for you, he doesn't 
42:26
want you to miss your destiny, Satan wants to steal and crush your destiny, so right 
42:31
now we say, I say, we would just say this together, Father, I choose with my will, to 
42:39
repent of all evil, to repent of being involved in voting for evil, to repent in being involved 
42:47
in voting for evil, I change my heart this day, I change my heart to say, and choose 
42:53
with my will, and choose with my will, to receive Jesus Christ as my savior, to receive 
42:59
Jesus Christ as my savior, I receive his will, I receive his will, his way, his way, I want 
43:06
his plans for this country, I want his plans for this country, and for my life, and for 
43:11
my life, I evict all evil and wickedness, all wicked and evil and deceiving words, they 
43:22
were spoken over the fake news, they were spoken over the fake news, or the illegitimate 
43:27
person sitting in the White House, or the illegitimate person sitting in the White 
43:31
House, I will lose all of them for my soul, I will live according to the Word of God, 
43:39
I invite Christ 
43:44
to abide in me 
43:46
i want to hear his voice 
43:47
i want to hear His voice 
43:49
i want to walk in the Spirit 
43:50
not to walk in the Spirit 
43:52
and not the flesh 
43:53
and not the flesh 
43:54
I choose to bind to my soul 
43:57
I choose to bind to my soul 
43:59
the love of God 
44:00
the presence of God 
44:02
the presence of God 
44:04
the life of God 
44:05
the life of God 
44:07
His will 
44:08
his will, his way, his expectation, his expectation of greatness, of greatness, and righteousness, 
44:18
and righteousness to be in this earth, to be in this earth, in Jesus name, in Jesus name, this day, 
44:26
this day, I step into a new place, I step into a new place, and I step out of the darkness, 
44:32
I step out of the darkness, I now serve the Most High God, I now serve the Most High God, I will not 
44:39
serve another, I will not serve another, amen, amen, very, very powerful, a lot of people got 
44:47
touched, a lot of people, wow, so yeah, hey, you know what, some of you watching, be sure you send 
44:53
this program to friends of yours, because there's some people that they're like right on the edge, 
44:57
and they just, you know, that you've seen them beginning to waffle about what they have believed, 
45:02
send this broadcast to them, forward it to them, or give them the link either way to do that, so 
45:08
that'd be awesome, awesome, well, you know, we have time for a few questions, anything else you 
45:13
want to say before we do that? Well, I do have a question to answer that someone has given me 
45:18
some time ago, I didn't get to answer it, they asked me, what role does Melchizedek play in our 
45:26
lives? Okay. Well, Melchizedek is a real being, he's not a human who died and moved to heaven, 
45:34
and the Bible says Melchizedek has no father, no mother, no beginning or end, which means he has 
45:41
always been with the father, and actually, Melchizedek is the father's personal high priest, 
45:49
Jesus Christ is our personal high priest, but the father is, he has Melchizedek who is sent to 
45:55
the earth on different assignments, at one point he was the king of Salem, he's one who received 
46:00
tithes, you know, when the tithes were being paid for the first time, he was on the earth, 
46:04
he received the tithes, Melchizedek has flesh, he's always had flesh, there's a whole tribe of 
46:11
angels made after the order of Melchizedek, which means they had flesh put on them, 
46:17
probably before we were born, I love the way the father says though, about any of the angelic 
46:23
tribes or the host army, he said, yes, they were made before we came, but we existed before they 
46:30
were made, because we lived in him, and so that's who Melchizedek is, and I know, is that a storm 
46:38
warning, Jen? Okay, I take power over all the part of the enemy trying to control this storm 
46:43
overhead of us right now, and I command the host to have them get up there and shred that storm, 
46:48
I refuse and review all strong winds, there'll be no tornadoes in this area, no flooding in 
46:54
this area, I'm over the weather, now under the weather, and I say, get out of this city in Jesus 
47:00
name, you will bring rain and nourishing rain, no lightning strikes, keep it in the sky, and get 
47:07
out of here in Jesus name, amen. Praise God, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, so again, 
47:13
I don't know if I did, did you have a little, I can't remember if we interrupted your flow with that, 
47:18
did you, did we get it? Melchizedek, yeah, a lot of people, they assumed that he was like one of 
47:25
Adam's sons, or they say that he was someone else who died that lived on the earth, but clearly the 
47:30
word doesn't say that, they can't figure out who he is, there are some of the living creatures 
47:36
have always, always been with the father, he didn't make them one day because he thought about it was 
47:42
a good thing, they've just always been with him, there's no way really to get people to understand 
47:46
the father has always existed, he carries time inside of him, and so that's why he's the only 
47:52
one that knows when Christ will return, nobody knows with the father, because he carries time, 
47:57
he didn't appear somewhere in time, so he's always assisted the living creatures have, the 24 elders 
48:03
have always existed, they're spiritual beings that serve him in heaven and all around heaven, 
48:08
they're not people, they're not the 12 tribes of Israel, they're not the 12 apostles, I've seen 
48:13
Peter Paul, I've seen John in heaven, they're not sitting there with a crown around the throne of God, 
48:20
so those are spiritual beings, of course Melchizedek would also be there, and people just picture 
48:25
nothing ever existed, there was a time when nothing existed, that's not true, before time was, the 
48:31
father was, the word was, which is Jesus Christ, holy spirit has always existed, but along with 
48:38
them would be Melchizedek, the 24 elders, the seven spirits of God, which are also seven 
48:44
personal spirits that serve the father, so that's a little bit of understanding and revelation for 
48:50
you for this question about Melchizedek, so he's always been, he was sent to the earth on assignment, 
48:56
and so anyway, I think that was the most important one, so if you have some questions you can go ahead. 
49:02
Yeah, okay, so yeah, we're going into questions about heaven or important truth, so Daniel is a 
49:09
six-year-old, he wants to know do we pray in heaven, I think he means either if we died and went now, 
49:16
or later on when it all goes, when we're all in heaven, do people pray or do we pray in heaven 
49:23
when we, when we go? I know one place that they, that they do make decorations and pray, it talks 
49:29
about the, this talks about in the Bible the souls under the altar of God, who pray and declare 
49:35
before the throne, and I always pictured like an altar, like you know, if you were to do into a 
49:41
traditional charismatic church or probably even other churches, they always had an altar down front 
49:46
that was maybe six inches off the floor, and people go down there to repent and do other things, 
49:50
they serve communion there, but that's not the way it is in the throne, the throne is a whole 
49:56
structure, you can actually walk underneath the throne of God, and really massive altar, 
50:02
many people go under there and they declare over their families, they also say things to God, 
50:07
not that they can't go up to a stone and say it, but sometimes they just want to do it personally 
50:11
or whatever, so that that's one example that yes, there are people who declare and who do pray in 
50:17
heaven for things going on on the earth, you know, and usually though, it's in the throne room and 
50:22
there's this huge room underneath the throne of God, the throne is high and lifted up, so nobody's 
50:28
mushed down or flattened down, so yeah, there's places in heaven, they'll go to the portal, 
50:33
which has been made, they're all over heaven, people go there to watch their family's lives, 
50:36
they can celebrate with them and different things in their life, they go there every year on your 
50:42
birthday and sing happy birthday to you, they don't miss you getting born again, they don't miss 
50:46
anything important like your weddings, your babies being born, people go to these places and they 
50:51
will declare blessings over you, they'll declare things over your life from heaven, so they don't 
50:57
ever stop thinking about us here on the earth. And when you say they declare that, that's kind of 
51:03
the same thing as prayer, right? It is prayer, except they know what's going to happen. They know 
51:08
it's going to happen. What about that, you know, you talked about under the throne, there is that 
51:12
scripture that says they were under the throne, it almost seems like it uses the word martyr in it, 
51:18
and they say to the Lord, how long till you, and I think they say, Kat, you know this better than 
51:24
90, how long till you avenge our blood, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, what's the deal with that, 
51:30
since there's no time in heaven, why are they in heaven saying how long till you get this 
51:36
I think you're not talking about like a date or a time, I'm talking, they're talking about like a 
51:40
season. There is going to be a season where a lot of that will happen, things that were done to certain 
51:46
groups of people and stuff like that, there will be a retribution brought for those people, because 
51:51
he wouldn't have made that place for them to go and declare that. So there are several different 
51:56
rooms underneath his throne, it's just, it's huge, I can't even explain or give it a measurement, 
52:02
but there are different people down there or groups of people down there, and there are, 
52:05
there are some of the martyrs, I'm not saying every martyr, there are some of the martyrs who 
52:09
really want for the father to redeem their life on the earth by bringing justice for what happened 
52:16
to them, and I'm sure that he will bring justice whenever he is, whenever he does that, it will 
52:22
happen, and it may be more towards the end than now, but he's not having them down there just 
52:28
saying that for no reason, is it hard to say it, he's going to let them say it, so I'm glad that 
52:35
he's going in the throne and that you see visibly when you go in there, but then there's some 
52:39
underneath the throne of God, where people are declaring, it says if you declare and decree a 
52:44
thing, it shall be established, doesn't it? A decree and a declaration is that you have a face 
52:52
to believe it's going to happen, it's something I will do. I was in Paris years ago and we stood 
52:57
underneath the Eiffel Tower, and the Eiffel Tower goes forever and ever, but you can walk 
53:03
underneath it because there's the post, so is that kind of what you mean? In other words, 
53:08
the Lord is high and lifted up, sort of like you might say the Eiffel Tower is way up there, 
53:13
but you can still stand underneath it and see its legs or its foundations, is it kind of like that 
53:20
when you say it's under the throne? Well, let's just say the throne is 80 feet high, 
53:27
I'm not saying it is, it is very high and lifted up because if there's not just steps, 
53:33
there's like there's steps, then there's columns, then there's a platform, then there's steps, 
53:58
that they can go up to the throne, but these are actually more private places, I don't think people 
54:04
see it underneath the steps and you can actually see the people, there's places where they go just 
54:08
to talk to God and pray and declare things, but there's people sitting on the steps sometimes, 
54:16
usually gifts on the steps, like people will leave flowers, Christ loves flowers, 
54:20
I didn't know that, sometimes you'll see desserts, because Christ loves green 
54:28
that's good, you know that's helpful because you know you think of the throne is high and 
54:33
lifted up and there's you know there's training fields of temple and all these different things, 
54:36
but you're saying, oh there's thunder and lightning in the throne room, trust me, 
54:39
people run to get struck by that lightning, it's like a myth, there's a lot of love, 
54:44
so there is all of that that talks about in the Bible, the living creatures are as high as the 
54:50
throne, I mean they're really really big and they have eyes in the front of their bodies and their 
54:55
heads everywhere, and they're always declaring over the over those, over those Father, Son, Holy 
55:02
Spirit, you know in heaven, obviously you're perfectly healthy, emotionally, spiritually, 
55:08
physically, no pain and all that, and yet, because I've thought about this many many times, 
55:14
if there's something that God gives you to drink from the throne, from the rivers of life, from the 
55:21
throne, the water that comes from under, however that goes, it seems like it would be hard to be 
55:27
edified more because you're perfectly edified, how, what would you describe as, have you been 
55:33
there and felt the feeling as it goes into war, how is it that that feeling is better than when 
55:39
you're already perfect? Well, it depends on, there's so much activity in the throne, depending on 
55:43
when you, when you're there, I mean you could be caught up maybe five times in your lifetime and 
55:47
see the throne will be there, but there's so much other activity, sometimes the river of life flows 
55:53
from him sitting on the throne, it comes all the way down the steps, people actually will lay on 
55:58
the steps and drink that, and then sometimes he'll open throughout the whole throne room and be like 
56:03
it runs through the whole throne room, then out into the city streets, depending on whatever he, 
56:09
whatever his purpose is for that, but I've been there seeing people actually drinking it as it's 
56:14
life, it's just, it's just, it's, it's, I can't explain it, it's like the greatest love you ever 
56:20
felt in your life and you just can't ever get enough of him, that's why Christ said, Christ loved 
56:27
his father so much, he was so happy when he got to leave hell and you know, came up and he was 
56:32
glorified and appeared back before his father, he was so happy when he was joined back to his father, 
56:38
but, but people who go there are undone, there's just so many things going on, but his presence 
56:43
is everywhere, but when you're there with him, is that you either watch a concert or you're in it, 
56:48
it's the same thing in the throne room, it's greater, the greater or the even the experience 
56:54
of it is greater when you're there in person, then just maybe seeing it from where your mansion is 
57:00
or being around heaven, but you're never away from his presence, but when you're there, a lot of 
57:05
people do, I keep watching the angels, I got to stop them. Well, you know, I was going to ask you 
57:09
that, Kat, because I thought you're watching, so I was about to ask you, what are you watching, 
57:14
because I've never seen you look up while you're describing it and you just can't watch it. There's 
57:18
an over top of me right now. Wow, because it was very clear to anyone watching that you were 
57:24
watching something, and so, what else can you say about what you're watching? I'm just watching, 
57:30
I'm watching part of the activity at the throne right now, and people are laying on the steps 
57:36
and the river pours over them, in them, through them, a lot of people just want to drink it, 
57:42
and it just makes you fall in love even more with the Father, and people love to be in the throne, 
57:48
and then the celebration, and you hear the voice of the living creatures in the whole stone room 
57:54
shakes, it shakes, and the seraphim dipping down out of the glory cloud, there actually is a real 
58:00
glory cloud that stays permanently around the throne, a little bit above the throne, 
58:05
and the seraphim live there, they live in that glory cloud, and they've been with him so long 
58:11
that their hair, long hair looks like blue fire, and just watching them dipping down over the throne, 
58:17
declaring over the Father and over the Son, it's amazing, I don't feel sorry for anyone who goes 
58:25
to heaven, I'm rejoicing with them, I'm celebrating with them, and don't ever feel like you've lost 
58:32
your family members if you belong to Christ, you will never lose them, they moved to heaven for a 
58:37
while, and then you will all be back together again one day, and all the things that happened to them 
58:43
in heaven, they'll be sharing them with you, they'll take you places to see in heaven, I just had 
58:48
someone just say to me, I know that my sister's up there, and I know that she's making a list of 
58:54
places to take me, and they had not even been to heaven, I said you're absolutely right, that's 
58:59
exactly what they're doing, they're not up there enjoying their life while everyone's suffering 
59:04
down here either, they know, all of heaven knows what is about to happen down here on this earth, 
59:10
they know the glory is going to engulf this earth, that people will actually carry it and 
59:14
release it everywhere around the world, they know the baptism in fire is going to be happening, 
59:18
they know that this earth for quite a while will be so filled with God, that's why there will be 
59:24
such a mass, the mass harvest at the end will be so huge, because of the glory, the love, the life 
59:30
of God, we will as manifested sons and daughters actually demonstrate the power of the living God 
59:37
to the people of this earth, either by rescuing things or changing things or commanding things 
59:42
that he tells us to say, you'll see it with your eyes, you'll literally see heaven activity with 
59:47
your eyes on this earth, and that's what's being set up, he's going to remove a lot of the evil 
59:53
on purpose, so justice is going to happen, there's no man greater than God, no devil more powerful 
01:00:01
than God that can stop any of that from happening, so I'm just celebrating my life all the time, 
01:00:08
I know I have expectancy in my heart, I don't have fear in my heart at all, I know who holds me 
01:00:14
in his hand, I know what his plans are and you can know too, because these are great days you're 
01:00:20
ending into, your children, your grandchildren, your great great great great great great grandchildren 
01:00:25
know they're probably adding up those years, don't try to, I don't ever try to add up the years, 
01:00:29
okay, I know God's going to do what's on his timeline, I know the greatness that's being 
01:00:34
sent to the earth, the babies being born right now are some of the greatest, the greatest 
01:00:38
prophets on the earth, some of the greatest apostles on the earth, the healings are going 
01:00:43
to be so miraculous that begin to happen, that's something else that's going to start happening, 
01:00:47
miraculous healings, regardless of what's going on around, the Bible says God sets 
01:00:53
a table that's his presence, his power, his joy, and his supply, even in the presence of darkness 
01:01:01
he's going to do that on purpose, I think that also is about to start happening. 
01:01:06
I need, I want to ask you, you said something a minute ago, I do not want that to pass because 
01:01:10
I think people would want to want you to say, this is what I meant by what I just said, 
01:01:14
you said a minute ago that they aren't, I may not quote this exactly, you said they're not 
01:01:21
out there enjoying their life while you're suffering on earth, what are you trying to 
01:01:25
communicate? I shouldn't explain to some people who don't really know God, they don't know Christ, 
01:01:31
they think he doesn't care, they don't care, and they don't see what's happening, that they want 
01:01:37
to happen, they want things to happen right now, I understand that's how you feel, but when God has 
01:01:43
a plan, if he's going to expose evil it's going to be done in this time, this would be the greatest 
01:01:48
exposure of evil on the years until the perilous times start happening and they're probably close, 
01:01:54
I can't even say a year, I know I've been taking 150 years in the future and guess what, 
01:01:59
there have been no perilous times of tribulation at that time. But our loved ones are in heaven 
01:02:04
enjoying their life, they're enjoying their life, and they're decreeing and everything, 
01:02:10
even while we are suffering. They're decreeing and declaring for God to intervene on your behalf, 
01:02:16
that you will not miss your destiny, a lot of them are after saying God, I declare they will not 
01:02:21
miss your destiny, they'll fulfill what you sent them for, that my heart is for them, that I'm up 
01:02:27
here declaring over them, I have expectancy for what you're about to do in the earth, this is them 
01:02:32
speaking to the Father about their loved ones on earth. Okay, good, good, good, I want to make 
01:02:38
sure we clear that. All right, Audrey asked, has Kat Siener interacted with John the Baptist, 
01:02:44
what is his appearance now on earth, he wore clothes made of camels here, also any idea what 
01:02:51
John the Baptist does in heaven? John the Baptist is sharing things that happened when he was on 
01:02:57
the earth, but with revelation of what happened in the spirit realm, everyone who goes to heaven, 
01:03:04
you will go and see what was going on around your life that God was doing, the things he was doing 
01:03:10
behind the scenes, the things that he did that you didn't know about, and even the apostles and 
01:03:16
the disciples all got to see that about their life, some every now and then would see angels or 
01:03:20
something like that, but their whole life lived out on this earth, when they tell their stories now, 
01:03:26
they can include, but God did this, God was doing this, and it just makes it even greater, 
01:03:32
more personal for them to share, so all those people are sharing the experiences and things that 
01:03:38
happen on the earth, but with revelation about them, that's what they're doing. And John the 
01:03:43
Baptist, his, as far as- Not wearing camels here, people. He's not wearing camels, and as far as we 
01:03:49
know, as far as we're told, his only gift was teaching and declaring, but does he, I mean, 
01:03:56
would John, even someone like John the Baptist have a hobby, a fun thing that he would do, would even 
01:04:02
he have a gift that would be different than declaring? I'm sure he probably would, it probably 
01:04:08
was something to do with the nature, maybe, because, you know, he was kept in the wilderness, 
01:04:13
isn't always being just desert, I'm sure there was maybe forest or something around him, and he 
01:04:20
loved that kind of thing, I know he didn't have a lot of time, he actually didn't hear God a lot, 
01:04:24
he had him on the back side of the desert, he would share with him things that would happen, 
01:04:29
and I can tell you this, those who told or shared, if they shared a lot in their life on the earth, 
01:04:35
they're going to share more things that they found out when they got to heaven, like I was just saying, 
01:04:39
but John is not wearing camel hair, okay, you don't wish he'd taken a bath five times, 
01:04:44
but when he was down on the earth, he was not the neatest person, I'm sure he was clean in 
01:04:49
all the other ways, but the camel hair he wore, because he had such revelation given to him, 
01:04:56
there was ways God would humble prophets, he was a prophet, Jesus called him a prophet, 
01:05:02
he also is Christ, he says, you know, he's his cousin, they hang out a lot, I see John the Baptist 
01:05:08
a lot with Christ, they were cousins on the earth, and I think he also liked sweets, 
01:05:13
I know that sounds wild, but he ate locust and honey, he loved honey, Christ loved honey, he ate it 
01:05:19
all the time, and it says in the Bible that he did like it, so I just see them a lot together 
01:05:26
in heaven, because they were related on the earth, and I can tell you this, John is not wearing camel 
01:05:31
hair, and the camel hair he wore was inside out, if you have never pet a camel, if you go to Israel, 
01:05:39
if there's a hand over there, ask him, can you touch the camel, and run your hand across that hair, 
01:05:44
man, I'm telling you, it's like little mini spikes, he wore that against his skin, 
01:05:50
it was to keep him humble, that's why he did it, it was to remind him who he was, and who God was, 
01:05:57
and you know, there was things God did to the prophets, so they wouldn't think of themselves 
01:06:03
above measure, mine is pink hair, I'll just tell you right now, I was not a pink hair person, 
01:06:10
I forget it's pink, I right now can't see my hair, and that was to separate me and make me, 
01:06:16
God wants people to notice me, okay, he wanted people to notice John Baptist, 
01:06:20
when it was his time to speak, he wanted him to look different, be different, and sound different, 
01:06:25
and I had to experience the same thing, although today it's pink hair instead of camel hair, 
01:06:30
I'm very grateful. So good, so good, I'm trying to decide which of these, because we're running out 
01:06:36
of time, so this person's saying, what do the evangelists do in heaven since their duty on 
01:06:41
earth was so winning, obviously there's no soul winning, do evangelists just have their own 
01:06:47
individual gifts, is that the point? I think some of them did, and well we know, we know that Paul 
01:06:53
did, Paul had great gifts, he worked with fabrics, he made beautiful things out of fabrics, it was 
01:06:59
a gift, and it was how he supported his ministries, how he supported himself, and people came from 
01:07:04
everywhere to buy those things, I'm sure he made robes, and scarves, and all kinds of things, 
01:07:10
beautiful things with fabrics, it does mention that in the Bible, and I'm sure when when he gets 
01:07:16
time, he probably still does, still does that, but I think that was Paul. 
01:07:22
Yeah, there you go, the best of the best. The Holy Spirit's like, excuse me, 
01:07:30
but we all know that God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest he had to put hair on, so 
01:07:38
yeah, I just love Holy Spirit though, he has no problem, you know, correcting me in the middle 
01:07:44
of everything, Paul worked with fabrics, and he did that, and he was very good at that, Paul, 
01:07:50
I'll tell you what, I see Paul quite often, he's always in the gardens, outside the throne room, 
01:07:56
there's beautiful gardens, and people come there to see him, they want to know what did you feel 
01:08:01
like when this happened, what did you think when this happened, see, is people asking questions 
01:08:06
more than anything else, and people, and of course they're going to share, so they share, 
01:08:10
they still share a lot, but they have things they like to do, some of them like to work with, some 
01:08:15
some of them like to cook or bake, some of them like to make things with their hands, 
01:08:19
I know that there were other of the disciples like Peter is still fishing, that was his gift, 
01:08:26
he fished, he fished before he became a disciple, and he fishes now in heaven, 
01:08:30
people can go fishing with him, my husband said he's going to be his new best friend just in 
01:08:34
case you wondered, and this has to be catch and release, right, this has to be catch and release 
01:08:39
because unless you get caught, unless you get, because you said they play tag or something, 
01:08:46
I don't know how you worded that, yeah, they do, and well you know I already said the creatures 
01:08:52
all talk to you, and that is no different with the fish you're trying to catch or the bull 
01:08:57
you're trying to ride in the rodeos, and someone will probably slam me for that, get over it when 
01:09:01
you get there, you want to ride one, and I'll forgive you for it, but but the creatures all talk, 
01:09:07
they have a voice, they talk to your pets, they'll talk to you a lot, I love that, it will be nice, 
01:09:12
and we just sent our mama cat went home to heaven the other day, oh wow, yeah, and this is 
01:09:17
just not strange, but just like God, my mom has a pet dog out in Arizona where she would visit 
01:09:25
her mom to her mom went home to heaven, her brother went home to heaven, but she has a pet dog out 
01:09:30
there, the same day that the mama cat went to heaven, her dog in Arizona went to heaven, 
01:09:38
oh my goodness, yeah that's not a coincidence is it, it's not a coincidence, it's not, it's not, 
01:09:44
and for anyone that's new, of course I think our poor family, we had lots and lots and lots of pets, 
01:09:52
a horse, two miniature donkeys, four dogs at one point, but a zillion's a cat, so 
01:09:58
those animals will be dispersed among family members I'm thinking, but every single pet 
01:10:07
is in heaven, and we all, there are pets right, yes, you have a big enough place for them to be 
01:10:15
in though, it's good that we're going to need acreage for that, so you'll need, you do get 
01:10:20
acreage, trust me you can have acreage, but by this time they've already made, by this time 
01:10:24
Steve they've already made friends, so they'll probably bring their friends over too, oh that'd 
01:10:28
be good, grandkids and pets, people go, you know what, they think of just nuts the way I top it, 
01:10:35
you know what, God is holy and powerful and so captivating, to be in front of the power that 
01:10:43
he carries and see him demonstrate it, but the love he has, he is love, I know Christ is love, 
01:10:50
I know that, but so is the father, you have to see that he is number one, a father with lots of 
01:10:57
children, when you come home to heaven, you come home, let's say you're married, you don't go home 
01:11:03
as husband and wife, you go home as god's son and god's daughter, you get your own mansion, it can be 
01:11:08
right next to each other, there's no problem with visiting or anything, but he, he is a father, 
01:11:13
is going to provide a place for you, and he made fun places on purpose because if you picture yourself 
01:11:21
as a dad, and let's say you have four kids, if you didn't have some way for them to have fun, you would 
01:11:26
really be. Now cat just froze on my screen folks, is it frozen on anyone else's screen? 
01:11:39
I'm listening to my staff, it's frozen on my screen, yes it's frozen, do you want to try and 
01:11:46
boot her out and have her come back? Well that was a new, we don't, that doesn't usually happen 
01:11:51
with cat, so could be the storm there, yeah they could be having a storm, so we'll see if we get 
01:11:57
her back, it's kind of at the end, if you guys are willing, want to just dismiss her, that's okay too 
01:12:02
because we're kind of at the time, if you say go ahead and, and Steve will say goodbye, just kind of 
01:12:07
let me know what to do, if anyone wants to tell me what to do. Texting chins, yeah you know I was 
01:12:17
talked about my own, my daughter had a cat, Ebony, he's a black cat, he was a black cat and he got 
01:12:24
sicker and sicker, and I was dying at the time, I was under 100 pounds, some of you have heard me 
01:12:29
tell that story, it was very near death and she was dying, and I didn't, it's not that I sat there 
01:12:35
thinking I'm dying, I knew I was very very sick and they hadn't figured out what's wrong with me, 
01:12:39
now, it'd be nice to have closer to that, under 100 pounds, but I, I remember talking to Ebony and 
01:12:47
I'd say someday, because I knew she was not going to be here really, so I was laying on the couch, 
01:12:52
sick sick, everyone's gone, Ebony's on the chair and I said someday in heaven, you and I, we're 
01:12:58
going to talk, oh their internet went out, he says they will try one more time, but I said someday 
01:13:06
you and I are going to have a conversation about all of all this, and I felt like honestly that 
01:13:11
I was communicating with Ebony a boy cat, he was a beautiful cat, but you know, because as he got 
01:13:18
sick and sicker, he couldn't clean himself, so he then became a beautiful dirty cat, but you know, 
01:13:25
it'll be fun to see what happened to Ebony and try and talk with him and say, do you remember that? 
01:13:32
That's what I think I see myself saying is to the pets, I'll say, do you remember when, if God 
01:13:37
gives me that memory, so, but we had so many cats, we were cat people and so now we've had a lot of 
01:13:43
dogs, so, well, you know what guys, it's 10 44, it went long and if they're still trying, I think 
01:13:50
probably this is a good time to dismiss it, it was a great, great show, we got good, good answers, 
01:13:55
so I'm going to go ahead and say to the people, thank you so much for the show, tomorrow we 
01:14:01
have Patel Patriot, who talked a lot about devolution, not evolution, but devolution, 
01:14:08
which has to do with the president redistributing authority to those people beneath him, 
01:14:17
so that the continuity of government can continue, he will talk about devolution and 
01:14:24
anything else God's put on his heart, he was great, this will be our second time, he's very, 
01:14:28
very popular on the internet, especially among patriots, so we remember that, so Patel Patriot 
01:14:33
will be tomorrow, it will be very, very, very good, so be sure and tell your friends, we will be, 
01:14:39
until further notice, we'll be on rumble only and when I say rumble only, I mean rumble and Facebook 
01:14:45
and theeligialist.com, just not YouTube, so with that, have a great day everyone, God bless you 
01:14:51
and we will see you again tomorrow, same time, bye bye. 
01:15:21
you

01:30
Well, happy Wednesday, September 7. 
01:34
We're recording this on Tuesday, September 6. 
01:38
So not to confuse you with the date is off behind us. 
01:42
I'm just changing a couple of things 
01:44
so this doesn't blink on us. 
01:46
Anyway, welcome to the broadcast. 
01:47
This is our second show today 
01:48
because we're recording this on Tuesday for Wednesday. 
01:51
So it's gonna be a great show with Kat. 
01:54
We just had a good one with Johnny, 
01:55
which you will have seen by the time you see this. 
01:57
But anyway, I just had a really neat time talking 
02:01
with Kat's mom. 
02:02
We need to have her. 
02:04
I can't remember her first name, 
02:05
but we're gonna have her on with Kat one of these times 
02:07
and get some of that wisdom from her. 
02:09
But anyway, without further delay, 
02:11
let's go ahead and watch Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. 
02:14
So here we go. 
02:15
There she is. 
02:32
There's our lady. 
02:33
Your mom said the pink lady has arrived. 
02:36
So I just had a really nice chat 
02:40
with your mom sitting in your chair. 
02:41
So that was a delight. 
02:43
I haven't seen her since the cruise. 
02:44
We were on, I think so. 
02:46
Well, it's been a while. 
02:47
Yeah, it's been a while. 
02:48
So tell us about the clothes you're wearing. 
02:50
Cause you said there's something special 
02:52
about what you're wearing. 
02:53
Well, this shirt right here, we have our own women. 
02:57
We have a women's group and a men's group. 
02:59
The women's group is called Wonder Women, 
03:02
Doing Signs and Wonders. 
03:04
Awesome. 
03:05
And this is actually, this is the logo we made for it. 
03:08
It looks crooked on the camera, I don't know why, 
03:10
but it's not crooked. 
03:11
Anyway, it's a W and it's got purple and silver in it. 
03:15
But that's what it says. 
03:16
It says right here, Wonder Women, 
03:18
Doing Signs and Wonders. 
03:20
And there's some of the most powerful meetings we have. 
03:22
We probably have close to 800 women, 
03:24
maybe a thousand women come from all over the world. 
03:27
I think 30 countries came the last time. 
03:30
And I'm telling you what, 
03:32
they had no problem ruling, sending the host or anything. 
03:35
It's a really powerful event when we have it. 
03:38
The men is called the Dread Champions 
03:40
because hell will dread them. 
03:42
I love that. 
03:43
Hey, can women order that shirt? 
03:45
Is that for sale on your site? 
03:47
I would say it will be very soon. 
03:50
I'm just kind of showing you, 
03:51
this is the one that we had the last time that we, 
03:54
you know, we didn't have a Wonder Women meeting. 
03:55
It's been two years, 
03:56
but we're going to have a Heaven's invitation, 
03:59
which is our premier annual event we have. 
04:02
And we are going to have Wonder Women, a separate meeting. 
04:05
I don't have dates for those yet, 
04:07
but we'll get them as soon as we can. 
04:09
But yes, this is the symbol. 
04:11
We have a different color, 
04:12
some of the different colors and everything in it. 
04:14
But the women have a powerful time when they do come. 
04:18
And then the men, 
04:18
we actually bring a prophet over from England, 
04:22
who speaks with my husband. 
04:24
And they said, I still speak. 
04:26
I still speak, people still want me to speak. 
04:28
So I still speak to all the men, 
04:30
but my husband and Nick, 
04:33
they have powerful, I forgot what they call it. 
04:38
Respiratory or what? 
04:39
Workshops. 
04:40
Okay. 
04:41
Two, two-hour workshops during that event. 
04:44
And then my son-in-law opens for me, 
04:47
that would be Ben, the megamarked canvas 
04:49
that God calls a couple very fierce against the darkness. 
04:53
He opens my meeting every time I speak at the men's meeting, 
04:57
but then I finish it off. 
04:58
So you're going to get a lot, man, when we, 
05:01
you should be getting an email soon, 
05:04
because we're finally, 
05:05
now that we're moving though, 
05:06
we'll probably wait until the office moves to do that. 
05:08
So we're really going to get all of our emails started. 
05:10
We've already designed one for Wonder Women, 
05:12
one for Dread Champions, one for the host. 
05:16
We're going to have the Guardian Zone, 
05:18
and we're going to have a spirit force. 
05:20
I think spirit force, we may already have that one. 
05:22
So we are going to really go into high gear. 
05:24
Once we get into our offices, probably this year, 
05:27
or maybe the first part of next year, 
05:30
everyone else would say this year, please. 
05:32
Yeah. 
05:33
Wonder Women logo. 
05:35
And usually what we do, because when the daughters of God 
05:39
meet, he wants them to enjoy themselves too. 
05:41
We have powerful, a powerful event. 
05:43
We have activation, we have training, 
05:46
but we also do something fun. 
05:48
We actually, we actually get one of these, 
05:51
a lot, like a human size, big camera things, 
05:55
and we go, I'll take pictures together. 
05:57
And I know that may not mean much to some of you, 
05:59
but it's really a memory of the power of God 
06:03
and the life of God that you experienced at our meetings. 
06:05
And so we do that, and everybody 
06:06
has one to take home with them. 
06:08
It's really an awesome time. 
06:10
We have a luncheon too, so I can't wait to have that again. 
06:13
But right now, I'm heading to Colorado. 
06:15
You know, tomorrow, I'll be in Colorado. 
06:17
And then after that, I'll be, of course, in Nebraska. 
06:21
Are those venues full, or can people still 
06:24
come to the one in Colorado? 
06:25
I think the one in Colorado is totally full, 
06:28
except Saturday and Sunday. 
06:30
It's a women's event. 
06:31
It's their women's meeting. 
06:33
It's activation, not activation. 
06:37
Jen, what is the name of the event? 
06:38
Gateway on Mount Zion. 
06:40
What, again? 
06:41
Gateway. 
06:41
Gateway on Mount Zion. 
06:43
I'm so focused on even going. 
06:45
Gateway on Mount Zion is in Golden, Colorado, 
06:48
mile high in the sky. 
06:50
The women's thing is full. 
06:51
That's at Copper Mountain. 
06:53
But Saturday night, this Saturday night, and this Sunday, 
06:57
this Sunday morning, they're having, 
06:58
I will be speaking, both meetings in Colorado 
07:02
at that place in Golden, Colorado. 
07:05
There's a sanctuary where they got burnt. 
07:07
Oh, my goodness. 
07:09
But they have a huge tent outside. 
07:11
So it'll be outside. 
07:12
It's probably going to be in the 50s at night, 
07:13
so that might be enjoyable for everybody. 
07:16
This Saturday night, I'll be speaking there and this Sunday, 
07:19
and that is still open to people to come. 
07:21
Nebraska, I think they still have some seats left. 
07:25
It holds 9,000 people. 
07:28
I'm sure that they opened the heavenlies with Hank Kooniman. 
07:32
Wow. 
07:33
The event. 
07:34
I think they definitely still have some seats there. 
07:36
And I don't think it costs anything to come, 
07:38
but you have to register. 
07:39
So definitely go on Lord of Host and register for that event. 
07:43
That would be the 15th, I think, right, Jen? 
07:46
Is it 15? 
07:47
Yes. 
07:49
His mission is called Lord of Host Church, right? 
07:53
And he's in the- 
07:54
Lord of Host Church, yes. 
07:55
And he is in Omaha. 
07:57
Omaha, Nebraska. 
07:58
A couple miles down the street is the Mid-America Center, 
08:01
which is where they're holding it, it's being held there. 
08:04
And it's going to be huge. 
08:06
It's the 15th. 
08:08
15, 16, 17, 18. 
08:11
Is that it? 
08:12
Well, the conference is the 15th, 16th, and 17th. 
08:15
And they're going to have Flashpoint Live there. 
08:17
They'll have Flashpoint Live on Thursday, I think, right? 
08:21
And then even Rod Parsley's coming to be one 
08:24
of the keynote speakers. 
08:25
Wow. 
08:26
He definitely does not believe us. 
08:28
The end right now, he's a powerful, 
08:30
live integrity man of God. 
08:32
And guess what? 
08:33
Well, King Christmas, I think, will speak that day also. 
08:36
And Phil Driscoll is coming to play his trumpet. 
08:40
Oh, man, I love that trumpet. 
08:42
He is amazing. 
08:43
I listened to him play live one time. 
08:47
Yes. 
08:48
And it's the only time, listen to this, 
08:50
it's the only time that I've ever listened to music 
08:53
when only the music, without words, obviously, 
08:58
all of a sudden, tears are streaming down. 
09:00
And it was like, it just completely overcame me. 
09:04
Heaven shows up. 
09:05
I know, I know he has family here. 
09:08
And I know them really well. 
09:09
And I'm telling you that man has never stopped for years. 
09:13
He's so powerful in the spirit. 
09:15
But he'll be playing, I know, for Rod Parsley's meeting, 
09:18
and maybe the one before that, he'll be playing, 
09:20
I think, that's Friday, Friday night. 
09:24
Saturday will be Brenda Kahneman. 
09:26
And then me, I'm speaking, Robin Bullock is speaking. 
09:29
And then Hank Kahneman speaking. 
09:31
Oh, my goodness. 
09:33
It's going to be a powerful time. 
09:35
That's amazing. 
09:36
And people can still get into that, you think. 
09:39
Yes, I'm pretty sure they can. 
09:40
And then Sunday is just their church, 
09:42
but I think they're holding their church there, I think. 
09:44
I'm not sure. 
09:45
But I think Sammy Rodriguez is going 
09:48
to be doing Sunday service. 
09:50
And man, he's going to knock it out of the bar, I can tell you. 
09:52
So it's going to be a very God, very, very prophet-oriented 
09:56
things from God with those powerful prophets 
09:59
all being together. 
10:00
And as far as you know, Kat, is he streaming that live 
10:03
as well, do you know? 
10:05
Will people be able to watch it online? 
10:06
I think you can sign up for the streaming, 
10:09
but you can check that out on Lord of Host in Omaha, 
10:13
Nebraska, that's his website, I think. 
10:16
But as of today, they have some seats left in the auditorium. 
10:21
Like I said, it holds 9,000 people. 
10:23
We're bringing 17 members just so we 
10:25
can have our products table. 
10:27
Geez, wow. 
10:30
There'll be so many people coming. 
10:32
And so I'm excited about what God's going to say. 
10:34
It is going to be life-changing. 
10:37
Well, I hope I know you guys will have it on tape. 
10:39
If there's something that ends up being recorded, 
10:41
maybe we can play a clip or something next time around there. 
10:44
I think that same weekend, I'm going 
10:45
to be reawaken America with Clay Clark and all of those. 
10:48
A lot of people, it's like a combination of they're 
10:52
all conservative, they're all patriots, 
10:54
but some are saved, some are not saved. 
10:57
And so there's a lot of evangelism 
10:59
that goes where Robin Bullock was there last time he didn't 
11:03
speak, but Amanda Grace goes every single time virtually. 
11:08
So this will be my second time at the reawaken. 
11:10
It's quite a patriot event. 
11:12
So that'll be fun. 
11:14
That's up in the Spokane area. 
11:16
I think it's very inspiring. 
11:17
I'm telling you, people, there are things 
11:20
that are going to be happening in this country. 
11:22
And I'm sure that you're going to find out some of that 
11:24
at that meeting, the men that Steve will be at. 
11:27
I know you'll hear a lot of that, too, 
11:29
where we're going to be, because I know the heart of Hank 
11:32
Kahneman and Robin Bullock has told me 
11:34
on what God is doing right now. 
11:37
And I know that's what their event with the Patriots 
11:39
is going to be just like that. 
11:40
But from the patriot point of view, 
11:43
this country wouldn't be anything without the Patriots. 
11:46
The Patriots stood in the beginning for this country, 
11:49
the freedom, and they're still standing 
11:51
for the freedom of this country. 
11:53
So awesome. It was an exciting time to be alive, 
11:55
and it really, really is exciting. 
11:58
Well, listen, while we're talking about jump off and share 
12:01
anything else you want to share, we'll 
12:03
have questions about heaven and things, 
12:04
but anything you want to share before we do that. 
12:07
We only have an hour today, because this is my second show. 
12:10
My in-laws are going to walk through the door, 
12:12
or my in-laws, so they'll be fun. 
12:15
The two boys are very rambunctious, so they'll come in. 
12:18
And so at that point, we may not be able to hear each other, 
12:21
so anyway, anything else that's on your heart 
12:25
about what's going on? 
12:28
I just know last night in the nighttime, 
12:30
I kept hearing the father saying to me 
12:33
that something was going to happen very soon. 
12:36
And normally, he doesn't speak to me like at night 
12:40
when I'm already in my bed, but I was still awake. 
12:44
And so I guess he decided to take advantage of that. 
12:47
I just saw him moving his hand over this country. 
12:50
Really? 
12:51
He didn't let me see what he was doing, 
12:52
but he was doing something. 
12:53
I'll tell you, I know that he said on purpose when I hit 
12:57
the gavel that last week, the gavel when it was hit, 
13:01
he said, justice was released then, 
13:02
and certain things are going to start 
13:04
happening very powerfully around this nation, 
13:07
and even overseas, that regards this country. 
13:10
And yes, he does love this world, 
13:12
and he has a lot of plans for this world, 
13:14
and his plans count, not the devil's plans. 
13:17
And we are going to see so much exposure. 
13:20
I know that's going to start happening. 
13:21
Like I already had said, there's going 
13:23
to be a couple of people die that are doing wicked evil stuff. 
13:27
I don't know who those people are. 
13:29
I do know that they will actually drop dead. 
13:31
And when that happens, you're going 
13:32
to know something significant is about to happen. 
13:34
How about that for a sign? 
13:36
That I want them to die, but these are God's plans. 
13:39
This is his world. 
13:40
He has plans for it. 
13:41
He's not allowing evil to take over, 
13:43
in case you wondered. 
13:44
He's not allowing it to happen. 
13:47
So all the things that have been said, 
13:49
this is what it's going to be. 
13:50
This is a new norm. 
13:51
No, it's not. 
13:53
Hell's trying to make it their new norm. 
13:54
They don't get a voice. 
13:56
They don't have a voice. 
13:57
They don't have authority. 
13:58
They don't have permission. 
13:58
They have nothing. 
14:00
They don't have anything to stand on. 
14:01
And even their foundation is crumbling. 
14:03
They've already been building. 
14:04
It's done cheaply. 
14:06
It's done with no intelligence whatsoever involved in it. 
14:09
You should know that by the reports coming up 
14:11
from Washington DC. 
14:13
I can just say, our lives are in God's hands. 
14:16
Our lives are going to be great, powerful, and amazing. 
14:20
That's what God has plans for all of us. 
14:23
So any of these events you can make it to, 
14:26
just make sure you stay tuned into Holy Spirit, 
14:28
if you can hear him. 
14:30
And if you don't have him, 
14:31
you should invite him inside of you, 
14:32
because let me tell you, 
14:33
he'll talk to you out here, 
14:34
or he'll talk to you in here. 
14:36
And then he never stops talking to me. 
14:38
So he's like coming into, 
14:41
I don't call them days of horror, 
14:43
or terror, or loss of everything. 
14:45
That's not going to happen. 
14:46
This is not the tribulation, people. 
14:49
The devil gets a couple of years for that, 
14:51
and it's not right now. 
14:52
And he knows it. 
14:53
And I tell you, I got a text saying 
14:55
that the left is threatening, 
14:57
saying that we should all be scared. 
14:59
I think they are the ones who should be scared, 
15:02
because the God of heaven and earth 
15:03
knows exactly what's going on, 
15:05
and he's going to do what he wants to in this time. 
15:08
So start thanking him for that. 
15:10
Yeah, I heard a major ministry got kicked off 
15:14
completely off of YouTube, 
15:15
and they keep trying to take more of us out. 
15:17
We have two strikes against us, 
15:19
but I don't have a lot of fear. 
15:20
We're on rumble. 
15:22
We may or may not be on YouTube for long. 
15:25
I think they're gunning for most of us, 
15:27
but their time is coming. 
15:28
Whoever's doing this stuff. 
15:30
They're afraid. 
15:32
Yeah, they're freaking out. 
15:34
They think if they don't get rid of us, 
15:35
the plan will fail. 
15:37
But God's not going anywhere, people. 
15:40
And he's the one in charge. 
15:42
And we all know he holds the air we breathe. 
15:45
Yeah, he does. 
15:45
And he should not have fear anywhere in you. 
15:47
I almost wore a shirt that said, 
15:49
don't let fear interfere, 
15:51
which is something Holy Spirit is always having me tell people. 
15:54
Do not let fear interfere in your life. 
15:56
Don't forget that. 
15:58
These are days of wonder and splendor 
16:00
and God's power in this earth. 
16:02
Well, and I think you were the first one that I heard. 
16:05
It was 2012, I believe, when God said, 
16:10
talk with you about let the show begin, 
16:12
was it 2012? 
16:14
It was pretty close to 2012. 
16:15
I think it may have been a little bit before that, 
16:17
because it's when the first elections were starting. 
16:23
The first elections that was won, actually won, 
16:26
and he got his seat. 
16:28
But I do know, let the show begin, 
16:31
was God knowing all this was going to happen. 
16:33
It was said before these days were in, 
16:35
it was before 2019, 2018, 17, God actually had me say, 
16:40
let the show begin, and guess what? 
16:42
He was talking about his show, not the evil show. 
16:46
Yeah, and back then we knew nothing. 
16:48
I remember you were, when you first said that, 
16:50
none of this stuff had happened yet. 
16:52
The selection hadn't been stolen, nothing had happened. 
16:55
It was just like, I just thought onward and upward. 
16:58
Well, it is onward and upward with God, it always is, 
17:01
but we didn't know what we would have to endure, 
17:05
if for lack of a better word for it. 
17:07
We didn't know this whole COVID thing. 
17:09
So God knew what they were up to. 
17:12
He did, he knew before they ever did it. 
17:14
Nothing is hidden, it says in the Bible, 
17:16
nothing is hidden from him. 
17:18
Yeah. 
17:19
And even those who believe he is not, 
17:21
will find out he is. 
17:25
Yeah, these are amazing times. 
17:27
So my wife just walked in and said, hi. 
17:30
She's got a haircut, so she's- 
17:31
Hi. 
17:32
Hi, Noreen. 
17:35
She can't hear you, but she's smiling, so anyway, 
17:37
she just came back because she's got her hair done. 
17:39
She probably didn't like that I had her come on the camera. 
17:42
Yeah, but she's just sweetie. 
17:44
We like to see her though. 
17:45
Yeah, we do like to see her. 
17:47
So, well, let's see, where do we go? 
17:50
Anything else you wanna say before we get into questions? 
17:52
I've got a whole couple of pages of that. 
17:55
I just, I have one, a little boy sent me some time ago. 
17:58
Oh, okay, all right. 
17:59
And I know it's something you have. 
18:01
So, but something very important, 
18:03
a lot of parents don't understand operations 
18:06
of the spirit realm and what certain images mean 
18:08
or even certain movies have things in them. 
18:12
I wanna encourage people to never have your child 
18:14
watch something that has witchcraft in it. 
18:16
Okay, wow, yeah. 
18:18
We know some things are fantasies 
18:20
and some are not fantasies, witches are not fantasies. 
18:23
It's something that's real. 
18:25
They spoke against it in the Bible, 
18:27
said have nothing to do with the necromancer. 
18:29
That is a witchcraft. 
18:31
And they have different levels in that whole area of, 
18:35
there's warlocks, there's wizards. 
18:38
These are dark images. 
18:39
These are dark beings that represent hell. 
18:42
And they've been around since the angels tried to, 
18:45
you know, take over earth when the watcher angels fell 
18:48
and they introduced human sacrifice during that time. 
18:51
This is a long before you were here. 
18:54
And so the dark arts have been around a long time, 
18:56
but there is no good witches. 
18:58
Just so you know, no good witches, 
18:59
no wizards, no warlocks that are good. 
19:02
They're all very evil and wicked. 
19:04
And they do all kinds of horrible things. 
19:07
And so this little boy was serious. 
19:08
He's 10. 
19:09
And he said, he says, I worked for his grandfather. 
19:14
He's the first little boy ties to me. 
19:16
I thought that was awesome. 
19:17
So we get the question, 
19:18
do you think the Habba is good to watch? 
19:22
And Jack, I won't answer that quite clearly. 
19:26
It has, is it wizardry? 
19:28
It has wizardry in it. 
19:30
Now they're showing good wizardry, bad wizardry. 
19:32
There is no such thing. 
19:34
There is no good witchcraft, no good wizard. 
19:38
There isn't, not even the Wizard of Oz. 
19:40
That was a fake, okay? 
19:41
But there's no good witchcraft, no good wizard, 
19:43
no good warlock. 
19:44
They are all evil beings. 
19:46
And I happen to know in that movie, The Hobbit, 
19:48
they have one. 
19:50
So I would say no. 
19:51
I told my grandchildren, no, don't watch that. 
19:53
I told my own children, every younger do not watch that. 
19:56
Why? 
19:57
Because it plants images in your soul as a child 
20:01
to accept the fact that they are good. 
20:03
Yeah. 
20:04
They need to be doing good acts, but they are not good. 
20:06
That's not a good title, 
20:07
or it's not a good position to have. 
20:09
No witchcraft, no wizardry, no warlock, 
20:12
should be on your list to read about or watch. 
20:15
So that's my answer, Jack. 
20:16
Be wise in the spirit. 
20:19
And make sure that you understand what God is against. 
20:22
He knows what is evil and what is not. 
20:26
And like a superhero, that doesn't mean they're evil, okay? 
20:28
But if they have a witch involved, a wizard involved, 
20:31
even though they're doing good things, 
20:33
which is not the truth, do not watch them. 
20:36
So there you go, Jack. 
20:37
Well, yeah, and you know, as a kid, 
20:39
we all watched The Wizard of Oz. 
20:41
I don't know if you did, but we watched it. 
20:43
And there was the white witch, and she was the good witch. 
20:46
And then there was the wicked witch of the East or something. 
20:49
And we always knew that witches weren't good, 
20:52
but at least for the movie's sake, we thought, 
20:55
well, she's nice, she's sweet. 
20:57
The Wizard of Oz, that character was not a real one. 
21:00
He was a carnival man who got caught up 
21:02
and taken to the Land of Oz. 
21:04
That's not like a bad place. 
21:07
But showing people even way back then 
21:10
that there were good witches and bad witches, 
21:14
that part was not real because the witches are always bad. 
21:19
And they know it, they do know it. 
21:22
And so for that reason, I won't even watch that again, 
21:25
not because of the guy who is the carnival guy 
21:28
who gets caught away in the balloon, the air balloon, 
21:31
but because it has as good witch, bad witch. 
21:34
And I'm telling you, that's gonna come to the earth. 
21:36
There'll be a whole group of them saying, look, we're good. 
21:39
You know why? 
21:40
Because the truth is that there is a guy who will be known 
21:42
and nobody will believe the lie, there is no God. 
21:44
That's what's happening right now. 
21:46
God's gonna expose all the darkness and the gray area. 
21:49
There's a gray area that says there is no God. 
21:52
That's gonna be erased. 
21:53
And he told me that himself. 
21:55
People on this earth will know there is a God 
21:57
and they don't want him or there is a God 
21:59
and they're gonna worship him. 
22:01
And he's gonna erase that lie. 
22:02
So they're gonna have to come up with something new 
22:04
to deceive people. 
22:05
And one of the things they will use 
22:07
is that there's good witches 
22:08
and they will on purpose show themselves healing people. 
22:12
All Satan has to do is remove the sickness 
22:15
off of those people because this is his plan 
22:17
to believe the lie that they are good and they are not good. 
22:22
Yeah, so good, it reminds me of anything occultic. 
22:26
I had what I would consider a divine appointment. 
22:29
I was 30 years old at the time because, or 35 
22:32
because I remember where I lived in Texas. 
22:33
I met a Toys R Us shopping for our kids. 
22:36
They were pretty young back then. 
22:38
And I'm just looking at the aisle and some light. 
22:40
He's like a 10 year old boy, eight to 10. 
22:43
And I clearly didn't work there. 
22:45
I wasn't, didn't have a uniform on. 
22:46
And he says, excuse me, sir. 
22:49
And I said, yeah, what can I do for you? 
22:51
And he goes, I'm looking at this Ouija board. 
22:53
Is this okay? 
22:55
Is this okay? 
22:56
And I said, I said, no, that is not a good thing. 
22:59
I don't even remember what I said, 
23:01
but I said him straight that this was of the dark side 
23:04
and the devil. 
23:04
And he goes, thank you for telling. 
23:06
I mean, can you imagine where that boy might've been heading 
23:09
had God not set that, that divine appointment? 
23:12
When that came out, everybody was pushing it more 
23:14
so you can contact the dead. 
23:16
I mean, this is what they were saying. 
23:18
You can contact the spiritual realm. 
23:20
They didn't mean to make it sound evil. 
23:23
And yeah, I happen to know when people would use those 
23:26
back in the day, when I was growing up, 
23:28
that demons would appear to people and then it would, 
23:31
and I'm not gonna say anything that would make kids 
23:33
want to go get one because you're welcoming 
23:35
and opening yourself up to the darkness. 
23:38
That represents evil all the way. 
23:41
There's nothing good about it. 
23:42
It's something you need to get rid of. 
23:44
If it was in your house, 
23:45
clean your house, open the door 
23:46
and kick out all those evil spirits. 
23:48
Because that is one of the main things 
23:50
that they use to fool children or young people 
23:53
to see something exciting happen. 
23:55
But you don't want to be involved 
23:57
or participate with the darkness. 
23:58
It is not a good thing. 
24:01
Yeah, that was amazing. 
24:02
Follow that one. 
24:03
I'll never forget that. 
24:05
I think, because you pray for divine appointments 
24:08
and this and that, but you're just walking 
24:10
in the toy store and this boy knew something was off 
24:13
about that game and he must've had money in his pocket 
24:18
and he wanted that. 
24:19
He thought to ask, you know, 
24:21
I'd love to know meet that boy in heaven one day 
24:23
and say, what happened after that? 
24:25
You know, you know, when we walked away, he said. 
24:28
All right, well, speaking of kids, 
24:29
I've got a four year old that wants to know, 
24:32
her name is Reagan, his or her. 
24:34
I think it says Reagan. 
24:35
I can't tell if that's a boy or a girl. 
24:37
It says, are there parks with swings in heaven? 
24:40
That's what he or she wants to know. 
24:42
Are there parks with swings? 
24:46
Yes, and when Jen gets her book published, 
24:48
I'm going to have her up her answering questions too, 
24:50
because God has shown her heaven in cartoon form. 
24:54
She's writing books about all the encounters I hadn't 
24:57
had in heaven, but on a child's level. 
25:00
And Jen knows that there's parks in heaven there are. 
25:03
There's all kinds of fun things for children to do 
25:06
and be a part of, but yes, there's parks, 
25:08
like parks you never saw before. 
25:10
They have huge slides coming down out of the sky, 
25:13
like little slides that kids slide on. 
25:15
I think that's probably where the carousel, 
25:17
there's a carousel that has living animals on it. 
25:21
I'm getting ahead of now, Jensen, 
25:22
you're telling me about my book. 
25:24
These animals are like, I'm not kidding. 
25:28
Sharks, unicorns, bears, baby dinosaurs. 
25:36
This carousel is huge, but there's not a pole 
25:38
going up through them. 
25:40
They're just standing on this carousel that's going around 
25:43
and you have the most fun on this carousel in heaven. 
25:47
And so that is part of this park that I saw there. 
25:50
And so it's real exciting. 
25:52
So you're going to love the parks in heaven. 
25:54
They're all over heaven, all different types of them. 
25:57
And so you ask a good question. 
25:58
Is there parks in heaven? 
25:59
Absolutely, yes. 
26:02
Awesome, awesome, awesome. 
26:03
Now this one says, Shannon Ray, I can't tell the age, 
26:07
but she wants to know, is there dancing in heaven 
26:12
and where they use, where they have the use of flags 
26:15
in worship, so flaggers and dancing, I guess, in worship. 
26:20
I have to say, absolutely, yes, 
26:21
I've been to the throne room many times 
26:23
and God loves pageantry, started in heaven. 
26:28
Pageantry started in heaven. 
26:30
They have these huge flags and yes, 
26:31
people actually make them in heaven. 
26:33
That's one of the gifts they have. 
26:34
They make them and they put like lions on them, 
26:38
eagles on them. 
26:40
There's some of the angelic embellished on these flags. 
26:43
And when people run with them in the throne room, 
26:45
they come to life. 
26:46
Like the lions roar off of the flags, okay? 
26:50
I'm talking about like that a lot. 
26:52
Wait, say that again, the lions roar off the flag? 
26:56
Did you just say that? 
26:57
Yeah, the low head will move like this 
26:59
and begin to roar out into the throne room. 
27:01
They can't help it with, you know, 
27:03
there's a father on the throne, 
27:04
there's his son on the throne and they get undone. 
27:07
But yes, that's the difference between heaven 
27:09
and everything is alive in heaven. 
27:11
So this flags and all this beautiful pageantry 
27:14
they have in heaven is something wonderful to see. 
27:17
You can even participate in heaven. 
27:20
And of course they have dancers, 
27:22
they have dancers here on the earth 
27:23
because I'm trying to remember the scripture 
27:26
that I know it's in Psalms. 
27:28
It says that one of the highest levels of worship is dance. 
27:32
It says so. 
27:33
And it says, when they dance and worship, 
27:36
it binds the enemy and fetters of iron. 
27:40
And that is the very scripture 
27:42
that all my daughters lived by. 
27:43
They all are parts of dance come to cushion dance companies. 
27:46
They still do dance, all of them. 
27:49
And it's a very powerful in the spirit 
27:50
and it even does, it does say that scripture 
27:52
so that when you dance and worship, 
27:55
you are binding the enemy that would be Satan 
27:57
and fetters of iron. 
27:59
So good, now you, you're talking about the arts for a minute 
28:03
and I'm trying to remember what you said 
28:05
because you had contrasted this. 
28:08
He said, now and on earth, there's worship 
28:11
other than people do art to the worship. 
28:15
Didn't you contrast that was saying, 
28:17
but in heaven, there's something different 
28:20
about the way that goes down. 
28:22
Do you know what I'm asking? 
28:23
Yes, yes, although totally is, and I was shown this, 
28:27
I was visiting Reading, California, Bethel. 
28:31
I wasn't invited to speak, 
28:32
but I was invited by their intercessors to come 
28:34
and see the healing room they have there. 
28:38
And they had artists, of course, 
28:40
their artists were over on the side 
28:42
and they were playing in worship on the stage. 
28:44
Normally, even at our own meetings, we will do this. 
28:48
We have a powerful worship, 
28:50
but we always invite artists to come, 
28:52
our own artists are there, 
28:53
and they're painting what they're seeing in the spirit 
28:56
during the worship. 
28:59
I've known they've done that several other places too 
29:01
when I've been present at meetings to speak 
29:04
and they'd have artists up there painting in the spirit, 
29:07
what they saw while the people were worshiping. 
29:09
Well, in heaven, it's a little bit different. 
29:11
In heaven, the one who's holding the baton 
29:15
to lead the worshipers is an artist. 
29:20
And they will worship to what the artist is painting. 
29:25
So as the artist is painting, 
29:27
they're painting so that the people like, 
29:30
now if they were on the platform painting now, 
29:32
you and the audience would see the art. 
29:34
That's not in heaven. 
29:36
And heaven is the opposite. 
29:37
The artist is standing with a worship team behind them 
29:40
so they can see what the artist is painting 
29:42
and what they paint. 
29:44
They worship to that. 
29:45
They worship and that's what the music, 
29:48
they're hearing music as the artist is painting, 
29:50
they're hearing sounds and frequencies and instruments. 
29:54
And I told the people at Bethel because I was there 
29:58
and I was watching the artist paint 
30:00
and I saw that going on in the spirit. 
30:03
And I actually told them, they said, 
30:05
if you can tell us something that we haven't heard before 
30:08
that we would be interested in, 
30:10
we'll let you in the room. 
30:11
That's what they said to me. 
30:13
And what I told them was that I said, 
30:14
do you know that when you have artists 
30:16
on the platform painting, 
30:18
the worship team will paint what they're hearing 
30:22
from the art so they let me in right away. 
30:26
And I saw what happening. 
30:27
I said, wow, do you all realize, 
30:29
cause I could see what the artist was painting 
30:31
and went around that side of the stage. 
30:33
When you realize that what they're worshiping 
30:35
and what they're singing is what's on this art 
30:38
coming off this canvas and they got, 
30:40
and then the artist fell out in spirit when I said that. 
30:42
So yeah, so that's one of the ways 
30:45
that things are done differently. 
30:47
They are the ones who lead the worship, 
30:49
the artist with their art creates words, sounds, 
30:54
frequencies and music as they're painting. 
30:57
And that is what they play and sing in heaven. 
31:00
Now you've talked about while we're on the subject, 
31:03
you've talked about, I think there's a scripture 
31:06
that says it'll give you garments of praise 
31:08
for heaviness or something like that. 
31:09
I don't have that memorized. 
31:11
Talk about, cause you've spent a long time 
31:13
since you've mentioned this, 
31:14
what are garments of praise actually in heaven? 
31:18
They really do exist. 
31:20
And we all know that it does talk about them. 
31:22
It talks about them in the Bible. 
31:23
He'll give you garments of praise 
31:25
instead of a spirit of heaviness, 
31:27
I think is what the scripture says. 
31:29
And it's one of the gifts the father gives out himself 
31:32
when you come home to heaven. 
31:34
And people know that I did see Whitney Houston 
31:36
go home to heaven the night before. 
31:38
She's saying in a lounge type area, 
31:42
she's saying with all her soul, yes, Jesus loves me. 
31:46
And when she did, she was receiving Christ 
31:50
the next day she passed away. 
31:53
And I was in another state. 
31:54
I think I was out west on the Western tour. 
31:57
And I was sitting there waiting to speak 
31:58
and I was instantly caught up to heaven. 
32:01
I did not know that she had passed away even. 
32:03
I was caught up to heaven 
32:04
and I was standing near the throne 
32:06
and I saw Whitney Houston up there. 
32:08
And the father was telling her how much you loved her 
32:10
and he thanked her for using her gift on the earth. 
32:13
And he was so pleased that Jesus Christ had her 
32:16
what had walked her up the steps 
32:18
and said, here father, your daughter has come home. 
32:20
I got to see all that. 
32:22
And I don't know what was going on. 
32:24
I know they were worshiping in this meeting 
32:26
that I was gonna be speaking at 
32:27
but I was up in heaven watching this. 
32:29
And the father said to Whitney 
32:31
because you were willing to use the gift I put in you 
32:34
I'm gonna give you one of my own things. 
32:37
One of his own gifts that he had. 
32:39
And he took out this little treasure box. 
32:41
It was the embellishment on it was alive. 
32:44
The colors were moving all over this little treasure box. 
32:48
When he opened it, the color garnet, it was a color. 
32:52
When I saw it come out, it came out like a color 
32:55
and it started squirreling and it became a garnet fabric. 
32:58
And it went all the way around Whitney 
33:00
and became this gown, a beautiful garnet gown. 
33:04
And he said, because daughter, 
33:05
you've been willing to use the gift I put in you. 
33:07
I'm giving you one of my own songs that only I have sung. 
33:14
And Whitney was so undone. 
33:18
She was young, she was beautiful. 
33:19
She's so filled with the light of God. 
33:20
Cause you remember she got saved the night before. 
33:23
And so she had light, the light of God in her 
33:26
and all she did was move her hand 
33:28
and when she moved her hand, 
33:30
the father's song came off of the garment 
33:33
and you heard him singing. 
33:35
Really? 
33:36
His voice? 
33:38
So let me tell you that there's no way 
33:41
you can understand the scope and the beauty 
33:44
and the power of the gifts, 
33:45
the rewards he gives you in heaven. 
33:48
You're going to get rewarded. 
33:49
Okay. If you did things for him, 
33:51
you wouldn't want to stop him. 
33:53
Some people go, well, I don't want any recognition. 
33:54
You don't get a choice 
33:56
because it's him recognizing and honoring 
33:58
what you did on this earth. 
34:00
So everywhere Whitney would go wearing that gown 
34:03
when she chose to wear it. 
34:05
And when she chose to change in her own chambers, 
34:08
it would come off, go back in, I know this later. 
34:10
I found this out later. 
34:11
It went back in the treasure box. 
34:13
Whenever she wanted to wear it, she'd open it 
34:14
and it came out the same way. 
34:16
It would come out with this color, become a fabric weight 
34:18
or she'd walked down the streets of gold. 
34:20
Never she went. 
34:21
People could hear the father singing off of her gown. 
34:24
And the father looked at her and said, 
34:26
this is a garment of praise. 
34:31
Kat, I can hardly contain this. 
34:33
When you said he's thanked 
34:35
because you're willing to use, 
34:36
you were willing to use this gift, 
34:39
was he referring to only the night before that she did that 
34:42
or was he referring to her using her gift 
34:44
during her lifetime? 
34:45
If you even know the answer to that. 
34:47
He meant her using her gift willingly 
34:50
during her lifetime. 
34:51
During her lifetime. 
34:52
Okay, so even when she wasn't saved, she was still, okay. 
34:57
She was using the gift that he put in you. 
35:00
Let me tell you. 
35:01
A lot of people are using the gift God put in them 
35:03
and hopefully they're gonna find that out one day. 
35:06
But he did let her know. 
35:07
She knew God gave her that gift. 
35:10
She knew it. 
35:11
She knew it. 
35:12
And I didn't say she always lived right, 
35:15
but she did create gospel albums with that gift 
35:18
and they're so powerfully, they're anointed 
35:20
that she was anointed to sing and worship. 
35:23
And when God sent her as that little spirit of light 
35:26
and knit her together in her mother's womb 
35:28
at the time of conception, that gift was already in her. 
35:33
When he says, the Bible says, God said, 
35:35
I knit you together in your mother's womb. 
35:38
He's not talking about putting your arms and legs on. 
35:40
We can't make a human spirit people, okay. 
35:43
Our side is creating the flesh side, 
35:46
but there's real no real life in anything 
35:48
until that spirit is attached. 
35:51
Like when God made Adam, when God spoke 
35:54
and the word made Adam and his body was laying there, 
35:57
lifeless, the father leans over 
35:59
because that's where we all came from. 
36:00
We live in him and him, we live, we move, 
36:03
we have our very existence. 
36:05
That's talking about the father and he leans over 
36:08
and breathes from inside himself, Adam's spirit. 
36:12
And he said, he received the spirit of life 
36:15
when he breathed into Adam's nostrils 
36:18
and then Adam became a living soul. 
36:21
That's what the Bible says. 
36:22
He became a living soul because that came from the father. 
36:26
The spirit and the soul came from him. 
36:28
And so that's what he means at the time of conception, 
36:31
that early, when conception takes place, 
36:34
the father sends that little soul, that little spirit and soul 
36:37
and he actually attaches the edit that daughter flesh. 
36:41
And that is when life begins. 
36:44
You know, when you're talking about God gave her that gift, 
36:47
it was a beautiful gift of, you know, 
36:49
she had the gift of music. 
36:50
So God gave her more of the same. 
36:54
There are people that are not singers 
36:57
and they may not even yet be gifted as musicians. 
37:00
And they were usually, let's say, 
37:03
a builder who loves to build, they can't wait to build, 
37:06
they've always built cause they were like the carpenter. 
37:09
Does their gift in heaven relate to that kind of thing? 
37:14
Did they use that kind of gift as well, like building? 
37:17
I think he could still give somebody a garment of praise. 
37:20
It doesn't mean he can't give them one, but for her. 
37:23
For her, that's what he chose for her. 
37:26
And you get more than one gift anyway, but I'm quite sure. 
37:29
I know that the father and the son build our mansion, 
37:33
just so you understand, it says not made by hand. 
37:36
You get a mansion not made by human hands. 
37:38
But there's places all over heaven 
37:40
that people who have a gift to build and design 
37:43
get to be a part of that. 
37:44
They work with Jesus when they get to heaven 
37:46
and build these other places, not mansions, 
37:48
but places to go and enjoy, places to have excitement in, 
37:52
places where people are going to worship in 
37:54
or be together in. 
37:55
And what he would give them probably as an awesome gift 
37:59
would be heavenly blueprints 
38:02
to build something up there in heaven. 
38:05
That makes sense to me. 
38:06
And it sounds like really good news for someone. 
38:09
I mean, I'm not a builder, but I mean, 
38:10
there are people who get up in the morning 
38:12
and can't wait to make something else out of wood, you know? 
38:16
So, all right, well, here's a woman named, 
38:19
well, she goes by the handle cupcake. 
38:23
She says, Kat, if I'm just a mom, 
38:25
wait, the spirits all over me today. 
38:27
I keep, I'm this close to weeping out everything I read. 
38:30
Kat, if I'm just a mom living in New York City, 
38:32
how much authority do I have over strongholds? 
38:35
My street, my neighborhood, my whole city? 
38:38
So that's her question. 
38:40
I will tell you what the word says. 
38:42
When Jesus Christ was talking to his disciples 
38:45
and not just to them, but any believer and Jesus said, 
38:48
I give you power over all the power of the enemy. 
38:52
That should answer your question right there. 
38:55
We are over the darkness, not under the darkness. 
38:58
Satan is the doormat, we are not the doormat. 
39:00
We get the crowns from Christ to rule and reign. 
39:03
He says, you are ruling reign with me now. 
39:05
Now that's in the spirit realm over the darkness. 
39:08
We rule over that. 
39:10
That's Jesus' choice as a believer. 
39:12
If you've been born again, okay? 
39:14
You have deposits of things in your soul 
39:17
that you use to operate in this earth. 
39:19
Most people don't find out about them, 
39:22
although the word clearly talks about them. 
39:24
But Jesus did say, I give you power over all the power 
39:27
of the enemy, you know? 
39:28
And we can assess, they're in there, 
39:31
what you can do, things that you can do. 
39:33
So there's no enemy, there's no spiritual darkness 
39:37
that should have more power than us as a body of Christ, 
39:40
us as a believer in Jesus Christ, who lives in us, 
39:44
Christ lives in us. 
39:46
And the plan of God and of Christ always was 
39:51
for us to take authority and power and authority 
39:53
in this world and change things. 
39:56
By the way, we live our life, the choices we make, 
39:59
the words we speak. 
40:00
It says, what you dare to declare and decree, 
40:03
it will be established under you. 
40:05
So you can declare and decree that the gangs 
40:08
are not taken over your city where you're at, 
40:10
you're not tolerating them anymore. 
40:12
You don't partner with hell in any way whatsoever 
40:15
and begin to evict them from your city, 
40:17
stand in your yard, stand in your house and say that. 
40:20
You're taking the realm you live in 
40:23
and you have every right to do that 
40:24
and it doesn't matter what it is. 
40:26
If it's murders going on, if it's gangs going on, 
40:29
if it's drugs going on, it doesn't matter. 
40:31
You need to take authority all over all the evil 
40:35
and the wicked spirits of darkness 
40:37
that is promoting that and powering these people to do it, 
40:40
you learn to say something against it. 
40:43
Doesn't mean you have to show up at their place, 
40:45
you have authority in the spirit, 
40:47
you can speak from where you are right now 
40:49
against all the evil darkness even going on now. 
40:53
You do not have to receive the words 
40:54
of those who are wicked and evil trying to control you 
40:57
and that means that any time in your life, 
41:00
you don't have to put up with it 
41:02
because Jesus Christ lives in you, 
41:05
he waits for your words. 
41:07
The army of heaven waits for your words. 
41:10
So what are you saying? 
41:11
Are you complaining? 
41:12
Are you, all you're talking about is a darkness. 
41:14
If all you're talking about is the evil and darkness, 
41:16
you're gonna have that all around you. 
41:17
If you don't like it, then evict it from your life, 
41:20
evict it from your home and start declaring what God says, 
41:23
okay? 
41:24
Jesus is the restorer of our souls. 
41:27
He died on the cross, you're washed clean by his blood, 
41:30
you're the power of his blood, his name, his word, 
41:33
his authority that he has given us, that's who you are. 
41:37
You are not weak, you are not forgotten, 
41:41
you were called by God and your birth was timed 
41:44
on the earth for right now to say things 
41:47
and rule against things going on in this world 
41:50
because God is setting things up 
41:53
for the manifest ascends and daughters 
41:55
to rule and reign against the evil in this earth, 
41:59
in the spirit realm where your authority is. 
42:03
So yes, you absolutely have power and authority 
42:06
over all the darkness trying to ruin your life, 
42:09
ruin your family, say something against it 
42:14
and use the word of God if you want to, 
42:16
repeat what Christ has said if you want to, 
42:18
it doesn't change the fact that he said, 
42:21
you will rule in this life with him, 
42:23
he's talking about now and in the time is to come. 
42:28
So yes, people are going to know in this world 
42:30
who knows God, who believes in God 
42:32
and who's operating and walking in the spirit 
42:35
and not the flesh, they're going to know who you are 
42:37
by what's going on in your own life 
42:39
for God is about to do in your life 
42:42
that he's going to demonstrate to this world 
42:44
that you belong to him and you believe him. 
42:47
You know, Kat, it's not lost in me that you declare 
42:51
and decree all the time for your own state, 
42:53
the state of Florida, one of the states 
42:55
that's doing the best in the nation. 
42:57
I mean, that's not lost in me, you know, 
42:59
and you have Ivana Tia lives there, Donna lives there. 
43:02
I was born in Oregon and I'm in Oregon now, 
43:06
but I met Doreen in California, two of our kids, 
43:10
we were married in California, 
43:11
two of our kids were born in California 
43:13
and I love that state and it's so hard to see it going. 
43:16
And I'm thinking to myself, 
43:18
surely there's enough saints in California that are decreeing 
43:22
and yet it seems to be going backwards. 
43:24
Has God shown you anything about California? 
43:27
Well, Steve, you're only going to hear 
43:28
what's happening in the fake news. 
43:30
I mean, all you're going to hear is what the, 
43:32
you're going to only hear what the left is saying people. 
43:34
All right, that's true. 
43:35
He knows another whole side to this world 
43:38
that is not being heard, but they're there. 
43:40
And I promise you, they are taking authority. 
43:43
They are demonstrating, they are demanding things 
43:46
to be changed. 
43:47
They are speaking against the darkness 
43:48
and the evil thereof. 
43:50
They're taking authority over it. 
43:52
Why do you think everything they've tried has failed? 
43:56
Because we are light in this world 
43:59
and they can't take the light out of us. 
44:02
They can't stop God from talking to us. 
44:05
They can't stop it. 
44:06
And I think that's why they are very concerned. 
44:10
And it's all going to be showing up really soon 
44:13
that you do have authority and you do, 
44:16
you can do something about it. 
44:17
You can stop anything going on this wicked. 
44:20
I've not stopped talking against human trafficking, okay? 
44:23
That is horrible. 
44:25
It is a crime against humanity. 
44:27
It's even a crime against God himself 
44:30
because he didn't send people. 
44:31
He didn't send anyone to have that happen to them. 
44:33
There's a real devil in this world. 
44:35
But if you advertise more for him 
44:37
and talk about him more than God, 
44:39
are you going to do anything great for God? 
44:42
Stop advertising and participating with the wrong one 
44:47
and start declaring and declaring what God has said. 
44:51
And tell God, you believe him, 
44:53
you know he knows what's going on. 
44:55
You're on his side. 
44:56
You want to speak his words against the darkness. 
44:59
And let me tell you what, 
45:00
things are going to start changing so quickly. 
45:03
But what's happening right now 
45:05
and what is about to happen 
45:07
is the body of Christ is about to get major accelerated 
45:11
in authority, in dominion, 
45:13
and people are going to know they have it. 
45:16
So good, good, good news. 
45:18
And we can declare over other states, right? 
45:22
You declare over DC. 
45:23
We don't have to just declare our own state. 
45:25
I send a host all over this world. 
45:28
Good, that's good. 
45:30
I know you do. 
45:31
I send way more than- 
45:33
I send them for 24 hours a day for two weeks. 
45:36
That's really good. 
45:38
And they'll shred platforms of evil beings. 
45:41
They'll pull down strongholds. 
45:43
They will literally expose the flesh. 
45:46
Those in the flesh who are evil and wicked 
45:48
are getting exposed every day, 
45:49
but it's going to start majorly happening. 
45:52
That this stuff is going to be shown, 
45:54
that you can't get away with this. 
45:55
This is not God's plan. 
45:57
The earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof. 
45:59
You know the Bible says that. 
46:01
You know you're part of that fullness. 
46:03
You have a light in you that he put in you. 
46:07
You have authority in you. 
46:09
You have the anointing that Christ operated in. 
46:12
First John 2, 27, 
46:13
when you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior, 
46:15
you receive a deposit of the anointing and lives in you. 
46:19
What is the anointing? 
46:20
It destroys the yoke of darkness forever, you send it. 
46:26
That's good news to hear. 
46:30
Have an ice cream after you do it, people. 
46:33
And some chocolate cake. 
46:36
Deborah is asking, 
46:37
are there any distinctions between Jews and Gentiles 
46:41
in heaven? 
46:42
That's an interesting question. 
46:44
I think of course people know your ethnicity. 
46:46
You don't really lose your ethnicity. 
46:49
I mean, if you were born Scottish or Scottish there, 
46:52
you still look Scottish. 
46:53
You know, if you were born Nigerian, 
46:55
you still look Nigerian. 
46:56
You belong to God. 
46:57
If you receive Christ, you're going to go to heaven. 
47:00
So people do know that. 
47:01
They know that about you. 
47:02
They know what you did on the earth for God. 
47:06
That's shown many places all over heaven. 
47:08
So you don't stop being you. 
47:11
You're just a greater you. 
47:13
Do the accents still exist? 
47:15
Like Australians still sound like Australians. 
47:18
Jamaicans sound like Jamaicans and so forth. 
47:20
Yes. 
47:22
And yeah, all the Irish and Scottish accents, 
47:26
they all are still there for eternity. 
47:28
They're all there. 
47:29
The accents are there. 
47:30
There's different languages, 
47:32
but you understand every language spoken in heaven, 
47:34
except one in language. 
47:36
The one language of angels that is their own. 
47:39
They do speak other ones, 
47:41
but there is one that's just their language. 
47:43
And I don't think that we speak that one, 
47:45
but any other ethnicity that's been on the earth, 
47:48
was on the earth. 
47:49
You understand when they speak to you in Scottish 
47:52
or they speak to you in Nigerian, 
47:53
they speak to you in Spanish and you're not Spanish. 
47:56
You know every word they're saying in heaven. 
47:59
Yeah, it wouldn't be hard to hear. 
48:01
So, okay, in this one, Olivia and John just died. 
48:06
This says, please ask Kat, if she knows, 
48:11
if Olivia and John made it to heaven. 
48:14
I haven't been shown that yet, 
48:16
but that doesn't mean she didn't, people. 
48:19
I can tell, if it's okay with you, 
48:21
I'll just tell you that one of our writers, 
48:23
I can't think of her name right now, 
48:25
she's written for Breaking Christian News for years. 
48:27
She's the niece to Olivia and John. 
48:30
Olivia and John was saved. 
48:32
So, my personal testimony, we know Olivia and John 
48:37
is having, even though you haven't seen her, 
48:39
so I'm able to say that. 
48:40
All right, let's see, I haven't pre-read this, 
48:43
so here we go. 
48:45
Don asked, I recently had to put down my 17-year-old dog 
48:49
in the morning of his departure. 
48:50
I was praying for God to give me strength and peace. 
48:54
Trying to get through this stuff today. 
48:55
As I was praying, I saw a group of our pets 
48:57
that had already gone to heaven sitting and waiting 
49:00
and they all had little party hats on. 
49:04
Has Kat ever seen a pets coming home party? 
49:09
Yes, I have. 
49:10
I saw my own pets. 
49:13
I had a Yorkie named Molly and I got to see, 
49:18
she was hanging on with one breath practically, 
49:21
and I think that's when I was on the Western tour, 
49:23
I was going like a six-weeks tour 
49:26
and she was not doing well. 
49:28
She was like 16, 17 years old 
49:30
and I kept thanking God for letting her last 
49:34
until I could come home and say goodbye to her. 
49:36
And he did, he was very faithful, he did keep her 
49:40
and she was not doing really well 
49:42
and I actually dressed her in a little gown, people. 
49:45
It's okay, I loved her. 
49:47
I dressed her in a little hung-going gown 
49:49
and I gave her this beautiful thing when she passed 
49:52
that I would put her in and I had it all prepared 
49:56
and I got to hold her, I got to bathe her 
49:58
and she was on her, she was breathing, 
50:02
but she recognized me, her eyes, she could smell, 
50:05
she could smell, but she knew it was me 
50:07
and she loved me very much and I loved her very much. 
50:10
And finally, I just said to the father, 
50:12
okay, I've said goodbye, please take her 
50:14
so she can go home and it was like she was gone. 
50:17
Like her breath left her, she left her body 
50:21
and I actually have seen her several times in the sky 
50:24
since then, usually when we're sending another pet home, 
50:27
she will actually come for some reason 
50:29
and be here when that pet passes 
50:32
and she goes, they go up to heaven with her. 
50:34
It's amazing the relationship 
50:36
that even pets can create between each other 
50:40
and I did see them preparing for her hung-going party 
50:44
when she got there and her favorite thing to do 
50:47
was chase the mailman to try to get the letters away 
50:50
from him and so at her thing, 
50:53
I know, I know what was happening. 
50:56
I saw her running down the streets to go chasing an angel. 
51:00
I know people think God would not do that. 
51:01
Well, you don't know what you get there, okay? 
51:04
And there was an angel dressed like a postman 
51:06
with his big old wings running and he had this mail. 
51:10
It looked like mail and he was sewn out of his backpack 
51:14
and watching to see if the dog would chase him 
51:16
and boy, she was running down the streets to go after him 
51:18
like, oh, she could get. 
51:20
And she was having the best time 
51:22
and I thought, what better thing to give her? 
51:25
She actually got outside one time, she was an inside dog. 
51:27
She'd bark at the mail slot every day 
51:30
and pull the mail out of the mailman's hand 
51:32
and he would tease her with the mail 
51:33
but she got up one time when we weren't there. 
51:36
I don't know how that happened 
51:37
but she was chasing him all over our yard when we got home 
51:39
and he was throwing her the, you know, 
51:43
the mail, like all the ads and stuff. 
51:45
He was throwing it at her trying to stop her from chasing him. 
51:48
It was funny but to see that the father loved even her enough 
51:52
to plan something special for her. 
51:54
Totally. I've also seen when we all had a dox 
51:57
and it was my daughter's doxen 
51:58
and I did see him being also welcome home into heaven 
52:02
and the dogs and other pets we had 
52:05
where they were waiting for him. 
52:06
So yes, that does happen. 
52:08
And so if you had a pet past recently, 
52:10
number one, they never went by their self. 
52:13
Normally your own personal guardian angel 
52:17
will take your pet's spiritual body to heaven. 
52:21
And they've seen that angel a lot 
52:23
because dogs can see in the spirit. 
52:25
They saw that angel with you. 
52:26
So it wasn't somebody strange. 
52:28
They just gather up your spirit and take them up to heaven. 
52:31
But Molly seems from our side, 
52:34
Molly seems to be the greeter who gets to go with them also. 
52:38
So yes, the pets can do things together in heaven. 
52:43
It's beautiful. 
52:44
And is it your testimony for lack of a better word 
52:47
that dogs and cats can or might see your angels 
52:52
or they simply do? 
52:55
What do they do? 
52:56
They do. 
52:57
And that's why dogs are a part of the things you can't see. 
52:59
It makes sense. 
53:01
I think cats see them too, 
53:02
but dogs respond differently than cats do. 
53:06
Yeah, they do. 
53:07
I think they're really busy with cats 
53:09
since they got nine lives to try to save 
53:10
and not just one maybe. 
53:12
But I do know that pets can definitely acknowledge 
53:16
when angels come in and out of here, 
53:18
when we had our dogs that were here, 
53:21
they would always follow them when they walked. 
53:23
I could see them following them in babies. 
53:26
All babies can see the angels, not just the angels. 
53:30
You're not saying some, you're saying all babies. 
53:32
All babies fresh from heaven can see in the spirit. 
53:38
They can see, and even when my own daughters 
53:41
would have a baby and my daughter would be holding them 
53:44
and the baby would be like looking at me, 
53:46
like this is me here and the baby's looking at me. 
53:49
That baby would go like this. 
53:52
That's hilarious. 
53:54
Every single time they will look at my angels. 
53:57
So I know they're seeing the angels. 
54:00
So yes, your baby can see angels. 
54:02
Now you're describing some hilarious things in heaven. 
54:06
Talk about for a minute, 
54:07
because this is a, in the natural, 
54:12
if someone only listens to the news, 
54:14
this is a painful crisis, 
54:16
horribly yucky time on this face of the earth, 
54:20
and someone would say, 
54:21
well, God would never be up in heaven 
54:23
performing all these hilarious things 
54:25
because there's more important things on the earth 
54:28
that demand his attention. 
54:31
How would you respond to that? 
54:32
I would say God is already responding 
54:35
to the stuff on the earth people. 
54:36
He is setting up and recording every single evil act 
54:40
indeed that's being done, 
54:42
because the gavel's already fallen for justice 
54:45
to come to this nation and this world, 
54:47
but the evil trying to take over. 
54:49
No one's going to escape seeing this. 
54:50
So God is doing stuff on this earth right now. 
54:53
Important things right now for what is coming, 
54:56
which is the days of glory and fire 
54:59
are coming on earth. 
55:00
Those are powerful, amazing things. 
55:02
The manifest of sons and daughters, 
55:04
she's done preparation for hundreds of years already 
55:07
on the earth for this to happen. 
55:09
He knew what was gonna happen. 
55:11
He knew people would be coming home to heaven. 
55:13
He doesn't create evil, 
55:15
but there is right now an evil devil 
55:18
who hates everybody. 
55:20
He even hates his own demons. 
55:22
He hates anybody involved with him, 
55:24
even doing things for him. 
55:26
He loves nobody, 
55:27
but God loves us for the love that you hardly 
55:30
can't understand that he sent his son 
55:32
to make a way back to him. 
55:34
He's not ignoring us on the earth right now, 
55:36
but he's also not going to ignore 
55:39
what's going on in heaven. 
55:41
He's not gonna make somebody have to experience suffering 
55:45
or agony or things that are on the earth right now. 
55:48
This is his ballpark. 
55:50
This is his, he's dealing with this. 
55:52
We're praying who are alive here. 
55:54
We're taking authority right here. 
55:56
That's what our thing is to do right now 
55:57
is to take authority. 
55:58
For those who run their race and run it well 
56:02
are not going home to heaven. 
56:03
He is not going to ignore the fact 
56:05
that he wants to welcome them. 
56:07
He wants them to feel special. 
56:09
He wants them to know how much he loves them. 
56:11
He does both at the same time, 
56:14
deal with it on the earth and loves people in heaven. 
56:18
I was gonna ask you about that because we teach, 
56:22
we've always taught as believers 
56:23
that God is omnipresent, 
56:25
which means he's everywhere at once. 
56:27
So when he says weep with those who weep, 
56:29
rejoice with those who rejoice laugh, 
56:31
he literally does all of those things simultaneously, right? 
56:35
All at the same time. 
56:36
Yes, he does. 
56:37
Someone lost a baby today. 
56:38
He's weeping with them right now. 
56:40
Someone, little kid did something funny in heaven. 
56:43
He's laughing with that. 
56:44
All at the same time. 
56:46
He definitely can be everywhere all at the same time. 
56:49
And by the way, the devil can't. 
56:51
The devil does not have the power. 
56:53
He's not omnipresent. 
56:54
He's not omnipresent. 
56:55
He's not. 
56:57
He is a created being who became very evil and wicked, 
57:01
who wants to use and take away destiny, 
57:04
steal things, kill, steal and destroy 
57:06
is the MO of Satan. 
57:08
The mode of operation for Satan is kill, steal and destroy. 
57:11
God is to bring life and bring it more abundantly. 
57:14
So there's definitely a difference between light 
57:17
and darkness and good and evil. 
57:20
And let me tell you more than ever before, 
57:22
you're seeing that a lot of people have never even witnessed 
57:25
this before in their life, 
57:26
but they're seeing a lot of it right now. 
57:28
And you're definitely me. 
57:29
You will understand what God is doing 
57:31
because it's going to start showing up unexpectedly 
57:35
and suddenly. 
57:36
When God does this suddenly, almost no one's prepared 
57:39
for it, not those believing and hoping for it 
57:41
and not the ones trying to stop it from happening. 
57:44
He is fully aware of everything 
57:46
and knows where everybody is. 
57:47
It's hiding, who's cheating, who's stealing, 
57:49
who's lying, he knows every bit of that. 
57:51
He also knows who is ready to be blessed. 
57:53
Those who are about to reap a harvest for their giving 
57:56
and they're helping and they're praying. 
57:57
Both sides are going to have what they've been. 
58:01
It's seed time and harvest right now, people. 
58:04
The harvest is coming is not the great end time harvest. 
58:08
The harvest is about to come is seed time and harvest, 
58:11
which you've been seeding over these last five, six years 
58:16
on either side, good or evil. 
58:20
You're about to get a harvest of either recompense 
58:25
and justice or blessings and suddenly an empowerment. 
58:30
And both are going to be judged. 
58:32
Both are going to receive the harvest 
58:34
that they've been planting all these years. 
58:36
So the wicked cannot stop or stop from happening 
58:39
what God is going to judge and give justice for. 
58:42
But you also can't stop the blessings 
58:45
and the acceleration in the power of God. 
58:47
That's being given to those who stood firm, 
58:49
who helped, who prayed, who did what was right. 
58:52
Both sides are going to be dealt with, 
58:55
blessed or dealt with with justice. 
58:57
It is going to happen. 
58:59
Oh, good, such good news. 
59:02
You know, we have to stop shorter today 
59:04
just because those little grandsons 
59:06
are going to bust through the door at any moment now. 
59:09
Would you pray for the people 
59:11
or whatever God gives you to pray as we close this out? 
59:14
Yeah, Father, I just speak your life into people right now. 
59:18
I impart life, the love of God, the wisdom of God, 
59:25
His acceleration, His expectation, His celebration 
59:30
for all that is about to happen, 
59:32
that is full of light, love, inventions, 
59:35
all kinds of wonderful things 
59:37
that are coming to this earth right now. 
59:39
He timed you to be here for that. 
59:42
And God, I will speak to the wicked. 
59:45
You are going to receive justice. 
59:48
And you may not like what is about to happen to you, 
59:51
so you better change your mind and get on the right side. 
59:53
If you don't want to experience the judgment, 
59:58
probably imprisonment, maybe even the firing squad, 
01:00:01
I'm just going to tell you right now, 
01:00:03
and this is everywhere, anywhere right now. 
01:00:05
God is getting ready to fulfill both of those things 
01:00:09
in the earth simultaneously. 
01:00:11
And He is going to take this earth 
01:00:14
and turn it into a place He needs it to be. 
01:00:17
The greater glory of God can be seen and known in the earth. 
01:00:21
It says, the knowledge, knowing, understanding of the glory 
01:00:23
will cover the earth like the waters cover the sea. 
01:00:26
Did you know that this earth is covered with two-thirds sea? 
01:00:29
That means two-thirds of the entire earth 
01:00:31
is going to experience the glory of God, 
01:00:33
the fire of God, baptism and fire coming. 
01:00:36
There's no one out there, no human, no demon 
01:00:38
that can stop that from falling on this earth. 
01:00:40
Let me tell you what it is to do. 
01:00:41
It burns all fear out of you. 
01:00:44
It burns all anything that you've been substituting 
01:00:47
something for God for. 
01:00:48
It's going to burn fear out. 
01:00:50
It's going to burn confusion out. 
01:00:51
It's going to burn hate out, anger out. 
01:00:54
It's going to burn out of you when it touches you. 
01:00:57
So no one can stop these. 
01:00:58
These are the things and days of God. 
01:01:01
It's the day of His power. 
01:01:03
It is not the day of His wrath. 
01:01:05
But some people are about the experience 
01:01:07
wrath because of sea, time and harvest. 
01:01:10
And there's no one on this earth that 
01:01:12
can stop that from happening. 
01:01:14
These are the days that God has decided on. 
01:01:17
These are His times on the earth. 
01:01:19
And no one can stop Him from doing so. 
01:01:21
Father, I thank you for helping those. 
01:01:23
God, to know how to take authority, 
01:01:25
to do that, to stand up for what is right, 
01:01:28
to declare and decree the goodness that's coming of God, 
01:01:31
His plans, His will, His way, in Jesus' name, 
01:01:35
and stop advertising the enemy who is a loser, loser, loser. 
01:01:41
I thank you. 
01:01:42
I'm on the winning side. 
01:01:43
God, help them to be on the winning side. 
01:01:45
Send your presence to flood their lives right now. 
01:01:48
The presence of God to flood you right now in Jesus' name. 
01:01:52
And power you, inspire you, encourage you. 
01:01:55
That, Father, is what they need right now. 
01:01:58
I thank you for giving it to them in Jesus' name. 
01:02:02
And we all said amen. 
01:02:04
Amen. 
01:02:05
Cat, tell people real quick. 
01:02:07
You've got two websites, RevealingHeaven.com. 
01:02:09
What can they get there? 
01:02:10
And then you've got catcur.com. 
01:02:12
Talk about those real quick. 
01:02:13
The comments where our store is. 
01:02:15
The Father gave me a corporation 
01:02:18
for one reason, to reveal and create heaven on earth. 
01:02:21
We reveal it through words, through meanings. 
01:02:24
We also reveal it through products. 
01:02:25
Like, I love this cup. 
01:02:27
The Holy Spirit showed me how to create this cup. 
01:02:30
And it says, I don't do demons. 
01:02:35
See that? 
01:02:37
That little lightning bolt right there 
01:02:39
is what Satan was cast out of heaven on. 
01:02:42
And the Holy Spirit said, please, add it to your cup 
01:02:45
so people can enjoy it. 
01:02:46
Every time they know, he was put down. 
01:02:49
He lost his position, his authority, and his power. 
01:02:52
And I can tell you, a lot of that's 
01:02:54
going to start happening again. 
01:02:55
So you can go there for RevealingHeaven.com. 
01:02:57
Our events are on that page also. 
01:03:00
Catcur.com is a place I call the spiritual platform 
01:03:03
for God, the Father, Holy Spirit, and Jesus 
01:03:06
to say whatever they want to say on that place. 
01:03:09
And I'm just going to remind everybody, 
01:03:12
I will never, ever message you, number one. 
01:03:16
I don't know how to message people on Facebook 
01:03:19
or any other form of media. 
01:03:21
I don't do that. 
01:03:22
I'm not going to message you and say, 
01:03:24
please give money to this missionary. 
01:03:26
Please give to this cause. 
01:03:27
That is someone trying to steal your money. 
01:03:31
You will never, ever get a message from me saying that, 
01:03:35
an email saying that, a text saying that. 
01:03:38
I'm not going to do it. 
01:03:40
So you know if that comes. 
01:03:41
That's a fraud and that's a fake trying to take your money. 
01:03:44
Don't send it. 
01:03:45
Don't give them any answer to what they're sending. 
01:03:47
Don't answer their email or their messaging. 
01:03:51
That is not true. 
01:03:53
And also, oh, she said she gave me something. 
01:03:56
What is your public Facebook page called? 
01:03:59
My public Facebook page is called the Catcur. 
01:04:05
The reason for that was when I went 
01:04:07
to make my public Facebook page. 
01:04:10
Catcur was taken. 
01:04:12
And the Holy Spirit said, just put the Catcur. 
01:04:15
And then they'll know what you. 
01:04:17
Well, guess what? 
01:04:17
It was available. 
01:04:19
The Catcur is my public Facebook page. 
01:04:21
It's also what my YouTube channel is called. 
01:04:25
And that will keep you clear. 
01:04:27
If anybody else texts you or uses my picture 
01:04:31
and says they're a different Facebook, 
01:04:33
tell them they're lying. 
01:04:35
And that is not me and pray for those people 
01:04:37
to delete them. 
01:04:42
All right, Cat, good. 
01:04:44
A quick message that tomorrow, well, Thursday. 
01:04:48
This is Tuesday, we're recording Thursday. 
01:04:51
Tomorrow for those watching, Hank Kuhneman will be our guest. 
01:04:54
So we haven't had him on for a long time. 
01:04:56
So we're really, really looking forward to having Hank on. 
01:04:59
We miss him a lot. 
01:05:00
So thank you, Cat. 
01:05:02
God bless you and your team. 
01:05:03
It was so nice to see your mom. 
01:05:04
We're going to have your mom on soon with you. 
01:05:07
And have her give us some pearls of wisdom. 
01:05:09
I miss you a lot. 
01:05:12
So listen, we enjoyed it today. 
01:05:14
It was very great. 
01:05:15
And I am really close to the spirit today. 
01:05:17
I'll tell you what, even reading about pets, 
01:05:20
I'm ready to weep. 
01:05:20
So anyway, thanks again for the day. 
01:05:23
We bless you and have a great day. 
01:05:25
And we will see you all tomorrow. 
01:05:27
God bless you. 
01:05:28
Bye. 
01:05:58

WEDNESDAYS WITH KAT AND STEVE - Episode 114

01:00
Well, welcome to Elijah's Streams. It is Wednesday, February 1, but we are recording this the
01:20
day before, so I'm recording this in the clock behind us. We'll say Tuesday, January 31,
01:24
but you will see this in the morrow on Wednesday, so we're very excited to bring you Kat again today.
01:30
She has a shorter schedule because they're in the middle of a move, so we're going to do 35
01:34
minutes and fast and furious and we'll have a good time. I had to hook myself up today and
01:39
all the things are dragging in. Anyway, hope the dog doesn't bark because I didn't take care of
01:44
that ahead of time, so we'll see how this goes. So pretty short show, but we'll enjoy every minute
01:50
of it, so we're not going to run any spots or any other announcements. Tomorrow, by the way,
01:53
is Robin Bullock, so don't miss that. So you're hearing this on Wednesday, so Thursday will be
01:58
Robin Bullock. So all right, without further delay, it's time for Wednesdays with Kat and Steve. Here we go.
02:04
Hi, Kat. So you're in the middle of a move this week, huh?
02:24
Yes, and we are so excited. I'm really excited.
02:29
Awesome. Well, it's good to see you. We've got questions. We were going to jump right into
02:33
questions today. Anything you wanted to say before we do that?
02:37
I just want to say how much I love everybody and thank you for all the prayers you've given us over
02:43
the years and even for this move, which sometimes seems almost impossible. Here we are moving tonight
02:52
and tomorrow night. So we seriously are moving and we are all very excited. You know, it's a
02:59
beautiful place. We know people there. We're going to meet a lot more people. I know God's
03:03
going to be there too, of course. And so, yeah, we're trying to use our time as wisely as we can
03:11
and our staff is actually going to come tomorrow to help. They have been bugging us forever.
03:16
Please, let us help. Let us help. Yeah, we've got to take that, man. It's more talking than moving,
03:21
but we're all very excited about how God has blessed us. So, yeah. And I feel that you're
03:28
paying on the moving too. You know, you can have fun with friends and everything, but man,
03:35
every time I've ever moved, we moved about something like 17 times in our married life.
03:40
It's crazy. Wow. One time a year for the first half of the year. And then this place we've been
03:45
at for 23 years now. Yeah. Yeah, so amazing. Well, listen, Kat, so you're pretty excited
03:53
about the future still. Are you optimistic about how things are going? I am optimistic about
03:59
everything God has said or told me and still intend to do. So, absolutely, yes, we all are.
04:05
We're all very optimistic. By the way, once again, not intentionally, but we wore them. You got your
04:10
teal on your hat and I got my teal on my tie and you're... Yeah. And that is heaven's color,
04:16
you said, or heaven's favorite color. So, if I'm saying that right. Okay, so Kat, let me just jump
04:22
in and ask you one question that I may have asked you a variant of this from time to time, but
04:27
when people go to heaven, they've died and now they've graduated to heaven and you've said
04:34
people, when they get to heaven, don't start comparing, don't say, how did you die? No,
04:37
how did you die? They don't do that. But do... Would someone show up? Let's say they meet their parents
04:44
and their parents are young like they are. They're everybody's in their 20s and 30s, I guess, looking
04:48
at them. Does that... When they sit down and have coffee or whatever it is you do in heaven,
04:54
do the parents say, well, tell me what happened last time we were there, you didn't even know the
04:59
Lord, what happened? Do they tell that kind of story? And some say... Sometimes they do,
05:04
if something's really on their heart, sure. And nobody minds at all if they ask some questions
05:10
like that. I would have thought, you know, in my P-brain, I would have thought that that would
05:16
be almost a sure thing that everybody would want to hear that story. But you... It sounds a little
05:21
bit like it's more of an exception to the rule. Well, they actually hold meetings already when
05:26
they come. Every time somebody comes new from earth, they always have huge events and everybody
05:32
wants to come so they can hear what's been going on. Oh, okay. It's not gonna be any really good news,
05:37
anything that's changed or maybe major things have happened that they would want to know about.
05:42
That's an automatic, that part is automatic. So everybody will attend me somewhere. And then
05:49
that person will be invited over and over and over again to visit people, speak places.
05:54
And so, yeah, it's very exciting. Okay, very cool. So let's see, I wanted to go with this one.
06:02
This one was... I've had this... Somehow I came across my desk I've had since December.
06:06
It says, okay, I love Kat. I purchased and read her wonderful books. I find them very encouraging.
06:14
I would like to ask her this question. The Bible says, when you try to approach the throne of God
06:19
or God himself, you become very, very fearful. I have not heard Kat talking about the reverential
06:26
fear of the, fear the Bible speaks of when it went in the presence of the great and almighty God.
06:33
So I guess they're asking once you go to be with the Lord or once you visit heaven. I'm not quite
06:40
sure where the reverential fear is that she's wanting to address. What would you say about that?
06:48
I think it would probably depend on what was going on in its own home at the time. Of course,
06:54
I've always, always had such holy reverence and love for the Father, for the Son, for the Holy Spirit
07:02
that never changes. You never, ever get familiar with all that and not any of it. It's just
07:09
overwhelming sometimes, the peace and the love that you experience when you're there.
07:14
And of course, when I go many times, I'm like eight. Yeah, that's what you said.
07:19
Not all viewpoint would be entirely different than most people who are already adults.
07:26
So I think about what kind of fun will I have? Where will we take me? What will we do?
07:30
I love him so much. I'm so excited to be here. So that would be the way that I would look
07:36
at things and he wants me to. He wants me to see him that way. And there's other people who feel
07:42
that way also. Well, yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. But you talked about how
07:50
you've gone as an eight year old and that you usually go as an eight year old. So God sees you
07:56
and you interact, I guess, as an eight year old. And you have said many times that heaven is like
08:02
50 percent worship, serious worshiping the Lord and 50 percent fun. Am I quoting you right? Is that about right?
08:09
I would have to say yes. And he even says sometimes it's 50 percent fun. I'd have to make it fun. You come
08:16
like a child. It makes sense. And so if you tell a story about this, I saw this or I saw that. And
08:27
it makes the children or you at eight years old, when you go, giggle and laugh to see something
08:34
funny, that's something that's in the heart of God to provide. Giggles and laughter and even goofiness
08:42
when you're having fun, right? Yeah, you know, most everyone who comes says you must come like a
08:48
child, right? And he wants us to feel that, you know, you're really all that innocent and excited
08:57
and you know, you're going to have a good time. I mean, he is our father. That's who he is. That
09:01
doesn't take anything away from his sovereignty, you know, his holiness, his power, the life he
09:07
gives people. It doesn't change that. It's just that from my perspective and the way he's always
09:13
taught me, he taught me as his daughter, he taught me as a child. So I see from their perspective.
09:19
Okay, okay, cool. All right, Isaac is age 15. And he's asking this, are the world's wonders in heaven?
09:27
For example, the hanging guards of Babylon, the Colosseum and so on, because we think of the seven
09:32
wonders of the world, he's like, no, are those wonders in heaven? There are wonders, it says
09:40
of course, those wonders in heaven. But I think it is the famous ones that we know, like, no, not
09:47
those. Okay, not those. It would be like, you know, like the Valley of the Valley of the Falls
09:54
would be definitely one the throne room, of course, absolutely the streets of gold, his rainbow. I
10:01
mean, there's so many different things you would want to see the crystal sea, where you can swim
10:06
under the water and breathe and talk and meet all the creatures there. So of course, they do actually
10:11
have their list on quite sure of amazing places. Oh, yeah, the city is there. So there's so many
10:20
things to do, see and learn about people have their favorites once they've been there for a while.
10:24
So I would say, yes, it is sort of like, maybe more than eight. Yeah, well, you know, all right. And
10:31
so if someone said, well, I will always hope that I never could go to see the Grand Canyon, I hope
10:36
that I could see it in heaven. It's not like God needs to give you the Grand Canyon, he's got the
10:41
grand everything. He absolutely has the grand, the grand of everything, you're right. So it's not
10:49
like you missed that anymore. Won't you see what he's got there? Yeah, so good. Okay. Pam is asking
10:55
this, can't you taught us that our level of spiritual authority grows as we mature in Christ?
11:01
Can you tell us what a brand new Christians authority looks like? I don't, I guess,
11:07
I have to interpret what she means. What does it look like? What, what would you say
11:11
a brand new Christians authority like? I think maybe she's asking the moment you're saved and
11:16
you're brand new. Do you walk out and possess certain authority that you didn't have? Or
11:21
what does it look like if you're brand new? I think that no one can really maybe even think
11:28
about that ahead of time. I think you are so undone by the glory that, you know, the glory we create
11:35
for him, the splendors and the wonders that are there. You're so overwhelmed by his goodness
11:42
that he gives us. But I'm brand new believer especially. They're overwhelmed really at what
11:50
has been given to what Christ actually did give you, what you can operate in, how to do that,
11:55
and what difference it would make here in the earth if everybody did. So yeah, there's a lot of
12:00
things that there's so many things that we could talk about and discuss, but always those feelings
12:06
of a new believer realize what has been paid for for them and what it's like to operate.
12:14
There's like nothing is, you know, I don't think as much as I've been excited in all the years
12:20
afterwards, I think the cream of the crop was the first week days and weeks after I encountered God
12:26
and everything. It's hard to find that level of first love very many times. Don't get me wrong.
12:32
I seek it and I do discover major encounters, but you're overwhelmed by that love. Absolutely yes.
12:40
Yeah. I mean the Old Testament when I had the encounter with God 81,
12:45
even the Old Testament screamed grace, grace, grace. I read it and I said,
12:48
there's grace all over this thing and I had only seen bad news and that's them.
12:53
All right. So Jan is asking this, when people first get to meet Jesus in heaven, what is the
12:59
first most common response? Is it a joyful celebration kind of moment or a holy worship
13:05
kind of moment? So what is that? I mean, yeah, so like, go ahead. Yeah, I think most of the time
13:11
it's probably more of a holy thing. You are so undone knowing you're meeting actually the risen
13:19
Savior, the one who gave everything for you. So I have seen most of the people probably would have
13:25
that holy reverential thing that we talked about. Yeah. Unless you're a kid, then you're going to be
13:30
like, yeah, besides yourself excited. Yeah. Well, you know, I, when I picture it for myself, I think,
13:39
I think I'd fall on my knees or I would be, I would feel like falling and I feel like tears
13:45
would come, but they would be tears of absolute unbelievable joy that we made it and he did
13:51
this for me. And are there tears of joy? You know, there are tears of joy. I don't people think you
13:57
never cry again in heaven. At the end of the Bible, it says every tear will be wiped away. You know,
14:03
the former things, you know, more. That's the end of everything when it says, you don't cry,
14:08
but crying for joy, excitement, gratefulness. Yeah, that's, it's a wonderful feeling anyway.
14:16
And you absolutely love it. So yes, people still do that. Cool. Very cool. All right. Reggie's
14:23
asking this, will teams of people work together or collaborate together to create things in heaven
14:29
or on the new earth, like in these say, it's like groups work together on earth now to create or
14:36
will, but we only create individually using our individual gifts and talents. So I guess he's
14:40
likes doing things together as a group. And will we collaborate and do things together? That's
14:45
the answer. We do collaborate and do things together. Of course we do. And you do learn how
14:51
to create, not people, but there's creation lab where you think that's for in heaven. Okay.
14:56
All kinds of things, places that we can make for each other, not talking about like our
15:02
mansions or anything like that, but there we all have a creative ability because of who they are
15:08
and so absolutely people get excited. Yes. And actually people say, well, what do people do?
15:15
There's nothing to do there. You don't have a job or you create stuff. You hold events everywhere
15:22
and everybody wants to be a part of your event. So yes, those things do happen a lot.
15:28
That's good. Good. Okay. I have so many rabbit trails that I want to go to, but I'm going to jump
15:35
to the next question. Elizabeth asks, how do I know if my child goes to heaven? If my child goes
15:41
to heaven in her sleep, I asked this because she has a dear friend and recently that recently moved
15:48
to heaven twice this week. She said she had a dream about them playing together and running.
15:54
I'm not sure if I understand the question. How do I know if my child goes to heaven in her sleep?
16:00
I asked this because she has a dear friend. Oh, she's saying when my child is sleeping,
16:05
did she go to heaven and visit? That's what she's asking. That is a great possibility. Sure. Yeah,
16:10
he takes people while they're sleeping. Okay. So they may, they say, Mom, I had this dream and I
16:16
was playing. Yeah, my green kids have actually had that happen to them quite often. Okay. And
16:22
those five places in heaven, like when they were four years old and they went, they didn't even
16:28
know those places were there. But I mean, they have been that they ride, they rode, I think I
16:32
mentioned before, you would ride lava out of a volcano. Yeah. My grandfather, my dad. Yeah,
16:38
there are some of those giggles, by the way. I love the giggles. Giggles of God. Someone needs to
16:42
write that book because we serve a happy, joyful, funny. By the way, of all the three, Father,
16:52
Son and Holy Spirit. Who's funniest if you could, if you, who's clever with their wit if you, if you
16:59
had. I would have to say there's either Holy Spirit, probably or Jesus. I think Jesus definitely has
17:04
the wit. I think they call Holy, well, I know they call Holy Spirit the drama king. Yeah.
17:10
Right there. He loves a good joke. He really does. He loves like all kinds of drama and exciting
17:19
things going on up there. So I would have to say probably more of those. The father is definitely
17:24
for love. Yeah. Just dad, father, you know, I think Kim Robinson has had multiple trips together.
17:30
She calls him daddy, God. You've had, I'm not asking you to say the names, your private names
17:35
for God, but God has given you different names that you call him. Is that right? Yes, he had.
17:40
That's a real interesting thing. And I've known several others that were like that. They say I've
17:44
called them such and such and it would be something I'd never heard. But God gave, I don't know,
17:49
maybe he gives different people the same ones, but that's pretty special. All right.
17:55
He's just asking, how do you pray when asking God to relocate? How do you pinpoint where God
18:03
wants you? I guess that means to move. I do not want to move to a place out of his will. So he's
18:07
saying, she's saying, how do you pray when you're asking God to relocate you? I mean, I guess you,
18:14
you want to tell him, I guess you want to ask, okay, I don't even know how to interpret that
18:19
more than the question. So yeah. So what's your thoughts on that?
18:26
So I think she wants to move, but she doesn't want to move to the wrong place because God
18:31
didn't tell her to do or something like that. She's, she's going, you know, how do I pray?
18:36
I would say, you know, you want his will done more than anything else and asked him to please
18:41
give him permission to let you know. It's a good way to do that. You get, you get him permission
18:46
to let you know if it's not the place he wants or maybe something different like that. I think
18:51
most of the time, if it's, if it's about him and you've heard him maybe say things like that in
18:58
his will towards you, I think people are so centered on pleasing him and making sure they
19:04
don't step out of what he wants. So they don't mess up their life. I don't think he'd let them mess
19:08
their life up if maybe they did choose something differently, but, but telling him that certainly
19:14
is going to help you stay focused. And for the people that, that are not seers and they don't
19:20
see all the things in the spirit like you do. I mean, can they say, Lord, I think you're telling
19:25
me to go here, but if I'm wrong, would you close the door before I absolutely ask you to do that.
19:32
You absolutely could do that. It's a good idea. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. All right. Shonda,
19:37
Shonda, I must be Shonda. How do you release the anointing when you're on a telephone call?
19:42
How would you do it if they, if they call you and you want to release the anointing? I'm sure
19:47
she's meeting on the other person on the other end. So yeah, I would just hold my phone and I
19:52
would just say it, or I would do it before I call them or he knew that I was going to call their
19:57
number. I would say I released this, the anointing into this phone call when they pick it up, it'll
20:02
go right into them. Okay. Okay. All right. Jill, let's see. This is partially cut off. Let me make
20:09
sure I can read the whole thing. Okay. Jill says, as a seer, when I'm in church, I often see huge
20:16
angels that stand between the first front, front seats and rows in front of the podium where the
20:25
pastor preaches. It is always in the same position no matter what church. The angel is so big that
20:30
his head is outside the roof. I didn't, I didn't notice an angel where we were going to church
20:35
now until the last couple of weeks. Can you speak of what you know about those angels? I guess she's
20:42
wanted to know if, if that's identifiable or something you've seen? I've seen angels 2,000 feet
20:48
high, probably even higher than that in heaven. So just to what every side imagine is there.
20:54
And I don't know that typically it's certain, you know, a tribe of angels or something like that.
21:01
I just know that they do have many different sizes of angels. Do you, this is never a question
21:08
that has never been popped to my head, but if you've seen 2,000 foot angels and you've seen
21:12
angels that are probably roughly your size. Yes. So are massively tall angels by definition
21:20
massively more powerful? Is that what the big means or what would you say? Possibly, but
21:26
maybe possibly not. It's just that God loved making different types of angels or the hosts
21:32
and he practiced well at doing that. Okay. Cool. All right. Cheryl is asking this question.
21:42
She goes, I've heard you speak about how our loved ones in heaven can go to a portal on special
21:46
days for us and sing happy birthday. For example, is the reverse true? My husband went to heaven
21:52
less than two years ago. Can I sing happy birthday to him on his special day and have him hear me
21:58
singing it? I'm sure that you could. I know that I have sung different things like to my father,
22:07
like on Father's Day or something like that. I know that sounds odd, but I do really love my
22:12
dad and a great relationship with him. And yes, and I know for a fact that Father has said you
22:17
can sing what you'd like to them and he'll make sure they hear it. Yeah. Now I've said,
22:23
this is maybe years past, but I've, you know, before I heard that you maybe can speak directly
22:28
in there. They hear it in the spirit realm or something. However, but I've said, Lord, would
22:34
you give my dad this message to tell him like, and I've said, like one time I said, tell my dad,
22:39
I forgive him for those things. I don't even know that if that's appropriate thing because he's in
22:44
bliss. Why would he need to hear that? But that's, that would be my question. What kind of things
22:51
can you send as a messenger or ask God to set an angel and tell your dad, you know, can you say
22:56
something like that? Tell him I forgive him. You mean on earth or in heaven? No, I'm saying,
23:03
you know, he's in heaven now and you know that when he left, he left a mess like that was the case
23:09
with my dad. And if I would have said, tell my dad, I forgive him for those things. I mean,
23:15
that was years past, but what do you think about that? You just say, no, no, don't go there because
23:20
he's already happy. He doesn't need that. I think that I don't think I would mind you saying that
23:27
and all of somebody. I think it would be all right to say that. Even though they wouldn't still have to hear it. Yeah,
23:34
because they already, yeah, I hear you. It's not like his soul needs to be unburdened for what he
23:42
did. So it's just words of love, I think. Yeah. Okay. Dolores is asking this, do regular common
23:50
people from different generations mingle with one another? For example, would an auto executive that
23:56
went to heaven in 2022 mingle with the poor widow from Elijah's days, would they have things of
24:02
interest to talk to? I think anyone who you would meet there would have, there's almost everybody's
24:11
going to have something that they would love to talk to about you to you or with you. And you would
24:17
find it very fascinating. So people still love to have conversations. They like to reason together,
24:22
talk together. They love to share things. I mean, that never stops happening. Not here on earth or
24:27
in heaven. Well, and then is there the sense that throughout eternity or as long as you're on heaven,
24:34
one day, it's everyone's going to be on new earth. But as long as you're in heaven,
24:39
are people making new friends all the time? Or do they kind of establish their friendship
24:44
thing and their friends hang? Oh, they make new friendships all the time, no matter where they
24:50
go. They do. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, Tracy. Oh, this, this does occur to me to ask this question
25:00
because you've talked because we said a minute ago about the portals in heaven. And you know,
25:04
your loved ones can look down on special occasions. Can't with that being possible,
25:10
could someone, this is probably a dorky question, but because someone say, hey,
25:15
they should do her girlfriend from earth and now they're all both in heaven together. And he says,
25:19
come on to the portal. I want to, it's my daughter's birthday. I want to say, I want to see them and
25:24
come and see where my daughter, what my daughter's up to. Could they do something like that? Or is
25:29
it only for personal family? You know what I mean? I think a lot is for family, but I think you could,
25:37
there's people who would push doing anything or talking about anything to anybody if they could
25:42
there. So yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of these questions are questions that you don't, it's not
25:48
like you walk around knowing the answers to all these deep questions, but yeah. Yeah. Okay.
25:57
Tracy's asking this, I'm a worship dancer. Can you elaborate a little more on what
26:02
happens when we minister and dance? And this seems like it's a common question. People want to know
26:07
when I do this on earth, what's it, what's happening? What is it accomplishing is, I think, is what
26:16
she's saying. What happens when I dance? I mean, that could go a bunch of directions. What is the
26:21
Lord doing? What's happening in the spirit realm? I mean, is, would you have any thoughts? Because
26:26
you're a seer. Do you see people dance and then see things happening because of it?
26:30
I see a lot of mostly music. Of course, I do see some dance. And sometimes you dance, you're not
26:38
even on the floor, like in the throne room, they have a lot of dance and pageantry and stuff in
26:43
there going on. It's absolutely beautiful. And of course, there's ways that you collect things
26:50
as you dance. And then it's represented in some other way in heaven, like you create artwork or
26:56
paintings by your dance. Even though it is with dance, not with your paintings, it's just something
27:02
that's created as something to remember that about. Okay. And back for those that are dancing on earth,
27:11
when you've seen people with the pageantry that God loves on the earth and they're waving their
27:15
flags and they're dancing, does it affect the angels around them when they do that? Is something
27:23
being triggered in a good way when they dance? And I think that's what she's trying to get at.
27:29
Do angels respond? Does our blessings drop down that we don't see? What is the dance
27:36
accomplished? Or is it just dance? I know dance is considered a high praise. It even says that it's
27:43
in the Bible. And so yes, even some of the hosts are absolutely amazed and really love the warfare
27:53
that takes place as a dancer. When you dance, like in the spirit about things, so that is definitely
28:00
something that takes place. And all three of my daughters are dancers. They would have to be
28:04
wore in dance in the spirit for people to be healed, for messages to be sent to be received.
28:10
And so I would definitely know whether it's dance, whether it's music. A lot of things are created
28:16
in the spirit. Okay, awesome. Sarah is asking this, are there, you've seen gemstones in heaven,
28:25
and I think I've heard you talk about the crystal sea and stuff. She says, is there gemstone art
28:31
in heaven that resembles stained glass? Have you seen? Absolutely, yes. A lot of people have
28:37
those in their home there. Really? Especially if people were artisans in that. My grandfather
28:45
made stained glass wonders. Okay. He's got some he's made in heaven. Wow, very cool. And I mean,
28:53
you know, it makes me wonder, because you said that guy will put favorite pictures of yours
28:59
that are on earth, or you'll show up at your mansion and there it's hanging. And I'm curious if
29:03
God would do the same thing. Not that you would know the answer to this, but that if you if someone
29:08
made stained glass on earth, they show up and God said, this is one that you made. I really,
29:12
especially loved, I kept it. And here's it. That was that sound like something he might do just
29:17
because that's who he is. I think he probably would. If people gave him any high gifts, he's
29:24
going to love him anyway. Yeah. And even he has some favorite things that he likes, anything
29:29
he may with life with colors, things like that. Whether you're young or not young, he loves people
29:35
when they give him gifts. Cool. All right. Let me see. We're five minutes out here. We got time
29:42
for a few more questions here. George is asking, when some people are dying, they reach out or
29:47
call for their family members who have died before them. They act as though their family members are
29:52
right there in the room with them. Do you know, do they really see their loved ones and do they
29:58
come? I guess they're asking, do their loved ones come to help with their transition to heaven?
30:03
Can you share about that? I mean, I have no idea. I think sometimes they do. I do know for a fact
30:08
that some people have seen their family members, like maybe within a week of passing or something.
30:14
I think it's something that God just does to encourage people. And so I just know that it does
30:19
happen. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Rachel's saying, when we are reunited with our loved ones that are
30:28
already in heaven, to them, will it feel like it's been a long time since they've seen this? Or will
30:33
it only feel like seconds or days since they've seen us? I think it's just seconds. Really? Oh,
30:44
yeah. They don't miss someone being gone 30 years or something like that. All they can think about
30:48
is can't wait to see them again when they see them. And so for them, you've only been gone for a short
30:53
time. Okay. Wow. Okay. And Andrew's asking, when and why were the host, Michael's army created,
31:06
was it after Satan's treason, specifically to deal with him or was it actually before
31:11
Satan's treason? In other words, you've made it very clear that the only reason there's an army
31:16
is not to protect heaven. God doesn't need an army to protect heaven. So when do you know when
31:23
the army was created? Was it after the fall of Satan? I think the army was been around a very
31:31
long time. They even wondered why they were created one time. Really? To fight. Yeah,
31:37
they were there for the enemy, for who became an enemy. So maybe they only understood what
31:44
they were being trained up for when that fall happened. Yeah. They were taught war and they
31:49
had to run maneuvers and do all kinds of stuff like that. Really? And that one was how loose
31:55
for a fallen heaven. They knew who their enemy was. Interesting. All right. Here's another question
32:02
about the Michael, the captain of the warrior angels. Is it Martha's asking, I believe the
32:06
angel Michael is the captain of the warrior angels and Gabriel is the messenger angels.
32:12
Are there other types of angels with specific purposes? I'm guessing there'd be lots of them
32:17
with specific purposes. There are so many, I cannot number them. There's many, many, many, many.
32:25
There's ones who are couriers, of course, the scribes, the Bible talks about them, helper angels
32:31
that help all over heaven doing things like that. Of course, there are the hosts of heaven.
32:35
There's ones who serve in different places and who keep the treasures
32:42
shined up and all kinds of things like that. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It makes sense that he might
32:48
even have thousands of different kinds of angels, right? For categories that we've never even thought
32:53
about. So, yeah. Man, just that's right. Me, A, N, G, S. Does God really cast out your sins into
33:01
the sea of forgetfulness? If you brought up your past, would he not know of it? I think most of the
33:07
time he wouldn't because he does cast it there and he's not going to think about it. I tell people,
33:13
stop reminding him of your sins. He won't know what you're talking about if you've repented.
33:18
Yeah, boy. I could have used that understanding years ago when I kept repending over and over
33:25
and over and over to make sure I got it right. He's probably saying, would you stop repending?
33:32
Okay. Jamelia, lots of interesting names today. Jamelia, have you seen inside of the courtrooms
33:39
in heaven? What's happening in there? What do they look like? Do they look like a courtroom on earth?
33:44
The judge sits on the bench up there high and then there's a defense in both sides?
33:50
I have absolutely been to the courtroom in heaven. Actually, there's more than one.
33:57
I guess outside, not outside of heaven, but in the atmosphere of heaven, it's invisible.
34:05
I know this sounds crazy. You can actually see to it. You can see that it's there.
34:09
Then of course, it's a courtroom that's actually in heaven. Yes, I've seen both. Like anything
34:15
else, God sits as judge. Jesus is our lawyer and Satan gets hauled up there about different
34:23
things sometimes. Other things get harder, but justice does take place in those courtrooms.
34:30
So it does look like a courtroom as we would know it. Well, they have one that looks very
34:34
supernatural. They do have one that looks like what you would call a courtroom, maybe not exactly
34:40
like that. So they're both different than I've seen. Okay. All right. Here's the last question here.
34:47
Natalie is asking, what is your favorite thing about Jesus that you would like to describe?
34:53
What's your favorite thing about? Of course, you'd have thousands of things, but what stands
34:57
out to you? I think his eyes. I think his eyes are so amazing. I never get tired of whenever
35:05
I'm around him. I always want to look at his eyes. They're beautiful, very beautiful. But he also does
35:11
have a, I almost want to say a cynic sense of humor. I mean, he was very bold about the things he
35:18
said on the earth to those who were not doing right. Like one of my favorite ones is, are you
35:25
you're a white and sepulchral school of dead men's bones? Yeah. You thought of the religious hierarchy.
35:30
I think both of those probably, those two things are probably my very favorite thing about it.
35:35
And he holds both of those at the same time. He, you know, he's got that serious side and then the
35:42
clever fun side. Yeah. So good. So good. Well, Kat, that's our time. We need to let you get to
35:49
your moving and rest in between and all of that. So I appreciate it very much. We'll spend more
35:54
time the next time talking about revealing heaven.com, but we're going to revealing the
35:58
heaven.com to see her, to get her books and all that. And there it is. Katcur.com is where you
36:03
can support her. The only place you can support her is online because she doesn't ask for money
36:09
in any other way. A lot of people keep trying to pretend to be her. So all right. Thanks so much,
36:14
Kat. Tomorrow, everybody is Robin Bullock. We're looking very much forward to that. When you see
36:19
Robin Bullock, he almost, I think he always has that pin that you created. It says, I don't do
36:25
demons. He wears that on his coat and everywhere he goes. So it's a, so that that'll be him right
36:31
there after people see this. Yeah. Thank you very much. We love you. Bless you. Have a good time
36:36
with your staffs. We'll see you again soon. Okay. See you later then. Bye.

Happy, I started to say Tuesday because we're recording this on Tuesday. 
01:17
Happy Wednesday for those of you watching this live for you. 
01:21
It is Wednesday, February 8. 
01:23
We're recording this at 3.20 in the afternoon on February 7 to get the sense we're recording 
01:28
Cat. 
01:30
Sometimes her schedule works better for us to record in the afternoon before. 
01:34
Most of the time these days that helps it work out better for everyone. 
01:38
So all right, well, welcome to the broadcast and a quick reminder that we tomorrow's for 
01:42
you tomorrow Thursday is Mel Kay. 
01:45
We haven't had her on for a while and she's going to give us an update on what's going 
01:48
on out there. 
01:49
So I love her very much. 
01:51
She's a great patriot in the patriot movement. 
01:55
She's that all the reawakened American thing. 
01:58
She's an absolute God of fear and she loves us and we love her. 
02:01
So that is Thursday tomorrow for you. 
02:06
We'll ask you some of the latest updates. 
02:08
So we're going to bring in Cat here in just a moment, but before we do that, here's a 
02:12
quick reminder about the wells we're digging. 
02:38
Thank you. 
03:08
I love that music, I like the beat to it too, and plus the whole Irish feeling of it, it's 
03:16
a great, here's a big word juxtaposition with the music and you're seeing the, I don't know 
03:23
whether it's called the bush or whatever you call it in the villages of Uganda, very 
03:29
primitive, poverty-stricken by any standard that we have, and they may not consider themselves 
03:34
poverty-stricken at all, I don't know how that is, and I'll have to learn more about 
03:39
that one day, but they sure need the water, they surely need the water, so we thank you 
03:44
for your help on that. 
03:45
Alright, time to watch for Kat and Steve on Wednesday, so here we go with Kat. 
04:06
Well good afternoon, I guess it is afternoon, it's actually like, we're taping this, so it's 
04:11
like 6.20 in the evening, your time isn't it? 
04:14
I think so. 
04:15
Yeah, you'll have to ask Jen that, I never know what time it is. 
04:18
You went to bed, you went to bed at, usually you go to bed at 6, right, because you're 
04:25
up all night, are you still up all night? 
04:27
I haven't been up since 4am. 
04:29
Oh, you've been up since 4, that's really unlike you, you don't get up that early. 
04:34
Not really, I'm really involved in doing something, you know, than I am. 
04:40
Well good to see you, well we've got some questions, oh I forgot to check with you before 
04:43
the program, if there's anything you had to share before we got into questions. 
04:49
I think Robin shared so much the other day, probably not except that we are still busy 
04:58
moving and we're very excited about it, but I really wanted to give the time since I 
05:03
didn't have a whole hour today to let people ask questions. 
05:06
Okay, alright, the first one is going to come from me, in fact we were talking about that. 
05:11
I won't bless the people though, let me go ahead and blow it up. 
05:17
Okay, are we on? 
05:18
Okay, yeah, so this is from me and so our staff was talking about prayer in one of them, 
05:24
so why don't you ask Kat what it's like for you. 
05:26
I think we asked you one time, in this big recollection we said, what's prayer like 
05:32
for you and I think you said, in the recesses of my memory here, something about yours was 
05:38
more about decrees, but don't let me put words in it, what is prayer like for you? 
05:43
Yeah, well there's many different types of things you can call prayer or that is called 
05:47
prayer even in heaven. 
05:50
Ruling is something, ruling is what's in the spirit realm, it's you taking authority 
05:54
and dominion and by the things that you either say that God is doing because He's told you 
06:02
or things that you have wanted yourself to release into the spirit realm to make a difference 
06:07
in people's lives. 
06:09
The other thing is called declaring and decreeing which a lot of people I've heard, you know 
06:13
what you dare to declare and decree shall be established unto you, that is my number 
06:18
one way I pray because I'm trying to establish usually something very specific, something 
06:25
God had asked me to take authority over, something He's asked me to make decrees about and so 
06:32
that is my favorite way to pray. 
06:33
And I still, another thing is talking to God, just having a language with Him is also 
06:41
partly prayer and I know God had said, you know, you pray all the time because you talk 
06:47
to me all the time, that's what He says to me, that's what the Bible says to me. 
06:50
Oh really? 
06:51
Yeah. 
06:52
He said, you pray all the time because you talk to me all the time, that's really instructive 
06:55
right there. 
06:56
Yes, it is and we should all have that much time and attention to give to Him but absolutely 
07:03
declaring and decreeing is the number one way I pray. 
07:08
Taking authority, taking great authority, having spent time with the Father or the Son, 
07:15
discussing things that they have going on on the earth right now, what is about to happen 
07:20
on the earth, things like that and then He'll say go make decrees over that and so that's 
07:24
what they do, I do a lot of that. 
07:26
Also for family members, I'll declare and decree over their lives things that they need 
07:30
either from heaven or that they're involved in working on this earth, you know, for the 
07:37
Father. 
07:38
I wanted to ask you a question about, you know, there's a scripture that says resist 
07:42
the devil, it's right in there, agree with God and there was that phrase, agree with 
07:48
God, there's so many things we could agree with God and I had something happen to me 
07:51
the other day and I'll give you an example, it's like I'm praying for this person that's 
07:56
in need so I said Lord, and this is not the exact one but it's kind of close to Lord 
08:00
and I know He's like your beloved Son, this one I'm praying that I have in my heart and 
08:07
I know you and Him are friends and I agree with you that you would never, ever cause 
08:16
harm to Him and I know you and I agree on this and I know that if anyone feels empathy 
08:21
for what he's going through, it would be you and I just want you to know I agree with you 
08:27
and that was kind of like a non-prayer prayer because I was explaining the need, He knew 
08:33
the need I was talking about but I was explaining it in agreement, what are your thoughts about 
08:38
something like that? 
08:40
I think for sure that would be a conversation, you know, God does take the time to even meet 
08:49
even myself about things that people are going through and things to let them know that I 
08:54
care about, He cares about, things like that so there are other types of conversation that 
08:59
you wouldn't necessarily specifically call prayer and I think that's because we show 
09:05
that we love people, we really care about people and our empathy goes along with them 
09:10
and whatever they're going through and the Father absolutely adores and loves people 
09:16
who, you know, it's not His plan to put us through things no matter what it looks like 
09:20
sometimes especially these last couple years that He is delighted to see the heart of people 
09:26
that care and I think it's so important for us to have kindness and care about people, 
09:31
you know, sometimes we get so caught up in our own world or our own life, we forget sometimes 
09:36
there are others out there who do need a kind word, an encouraging word, maybe a letter 
09:41
written to them or something letting them know someone is here with you, we've got your 
09:45
back, you know, we care about you so certainly there's all different kinds of conversation 
09:50
you could have in any way that some people may say well I didn't even think of that 
09:55
as prayer but anytime we love people it's going to touch the heart of the Father. 
10:00
Wow, yeah, you know our old school thinking for lack of a better description our old school 
10:04
thinking would be they would say and there's nothing wrong with this but they'd say what 
10:09
did you do in your quiet time or did you have your quiet time because if you don't put in 
10:14
time and I understand that very much but it kind of came off as a legalistic thing from 
10:19
time to time if someone would say did you have your quiet time it's a little bit freeing 
10:26
to me to have you say even if you're showing kindness even if you're talking to the Lord 
10:32
I was trying to figure out who, remind, be reminded who was this famous person of prayer 
10:37
that said I have hardly ever prayed for more than five minutes maybe he said fifteen minutes 
10:43
I don't know it's fine it was like either five or fifteen so I'll say five I've never 
10:48
prayed longer than five minutes but I've never gotten more than five minutes without 
10:51
praying it was something like that it was probably fifteen can let me ask you so some 
10:58
people have been taught now there's the scripture this is you know we're supposed to give him 
11:05
our our petitions with thanksgiving let your let your petitions or prayers be known to 
11:09
God in the in the prayer of thanksgiving all that so are there people who do who you would 
11:16
say get too much into petition and not enough in other things what would you say how would 
11:24
you exhort someone to pray I like do some people say Lord I need this and Lord help 
11:28
me with that or help my family is it too much is too much petition I think it depends on 
11:36
the person himself I guess most people would would would some people just gonna ask for 
11:42
I guess whatever they're having issues with or whatever they're thinking about or wondering 
11:46
if something will work some people can't kind of not sure about making up their minds I 
11:51
think and so sometimes they may ask more than other people would but I just I love people 
11:58
who declare declare and decree us that you really are serious about getting something 
12:03
done for God and making sure that petitions petitions are being heard maybe not even 
12:07
just your petitions it might be others petitions you know they're going to something like we 
12:11
were kind of just talking about a minute ago I don't think God ever gets tired of hearing 
12:16
anybody's petitions at all if you ask me personally I don't think you know I totally was asking 
12:22
that so I so yeah I totally was so if that if that if too much is you're not worried 
12:28
about too many petitions then oh no I don't think so no no no sometimes you wish people 
12:35
would ask more well that's true too doesn't he says you have not because you ask not 
12:40
your life be that side of that okay so all right well I'm gonna ask you a question from 
12:46
Benny age 12 so he says are the skill levels of all people the same in heaven like are 
12:54
they all the same strong they're just as strong they're just as fast speed he seems to be 
13:00
asking about athletic by the question he mentioned strength and speed is everybody the same or 
13:06
some stronger and some faster I don't think everybody is the same at all I think everybody 
13:12
is still at different levels you know if you pursue something of course you're gonna know 
13:16
more than someone who never had before you do have the ability to learn new skills all 
13:21
the time in heaven or improve the skills that you have in heaven but no I don't think everybody 
13:26
is at the same level that's good to hear yeah in fact that the way you answer boring to say 
13:32
why bother to go to something if everybody is the same right well that's true oh I lost 
13:39
I was gonna ask a follow-up but I lost it okay Jack age nine okay he he wants to know can 
13:45
I transform into things in heaven like an animal or a character he wants to know if he can 
13:51
transform it I assume this is like when they're playing around or something there are places 
13:57
in heaven they can go that is for a play area that yes you can actually change you can be 
14:03
smaller can be larger I think that you can become a cartoon in certain areas and then 
14:10
you play out cartoons with your friends you actually are in the cartoon so he's absolutely 
14:16
right and I you said in certain places are there because it sounds like a what would 
14:22
be a term it sounds like a fun zone or a fun village or or something there are places that 
14:28
usually in the amusement park there's a lot of things going on similar to that they have 
14:32
all kinds of things that you can do you can travel different ways like in bubbles you can 
14:38
go up to different places where is it the play places in the sky I know it sounds crazy 
14:44
but it's heaven yeah yeah it's very different and when you go there you expect some of those 
14:49
things to happen well I gotta ask you when a lady wrote to me I didn't respond to her 
14:53
today because I didn't know how to respond because I don't have an answer for everybody's 
14:57
question but she wrote she's very nice about it but she says but I'm quite certain there's 
15:02
no cotton candy in heaven so apparently she heard that you had said there was cotton candy 
15:07
in heaven and I might my thing would have been if I'd written there what what would 
15:11
prevent God from giving a delicious cotton candy that would be nothing yeah so I'm talking 
15:18
to people about the funness the giddiness the laughter the hilarity of God because we 
15:24
got the holy thing we've been taught I don't know we don't have it down but we've been 
15:29
taught the holy side we have not been taught the fun side I mean what would you like to 
15:35
tell people to say there for the first time I would say the same thing that the father 
15:40
said to me if he didn't make fun places in heaven he'd be in trouble with all those kids 
15:44
coming home I mean that's a perfect like a little child the Bible is clear about that 
15:49
you come with the heart of a child because you're going to have adventures you're going 
15:54
to have fun and the father wants you to have that why wouldn't he he is your father so 
16:00
of course he planned different things to do even adventures for you to do things to learn 
16:06
different places to go to learn them you can visit rodeos you already know about the amusement 
16:11
park there's so many places in heaven you go even beautiful places out outside parks 
16:17
all kinds of things dinosaur park you know people get up get off on that but you know 
16:22
you're not God and I can tell you when he is a father a loving father he's going to give 
16:27
everything he can do bless his children and that's why he's he wants you to expect it 
16:33
yes why what do you think if you do with all these millions of children coming home to 
16:37
heaven that's really really good and you know the the the thing about it is not only millions 
16:43
maybe there's even billions because from the beginning of time billions well because from 
16:48
the beginning of time children have been have lost their lives when they were little you 
16:54
know I have never asked you this question but I want to ask you this question there were 
17:00
people that perished in the flood and some among those cats surely there would have been 
17:07
children throughout whatever the earth was in those days when when those children perish 
17:14
in the flood and they were almost babies or very very young children do you expect to 
17:19
see those children in heaven one day of course I do absolutely I would they were innocent 
17:26
children why would they not go to heaven the father's been adamant about that from the 
17:31
from the very beginning he would talk to me about that I expected all children to go to 
17:35
heaven yeah they didn't do anything wrong right they do have an opportunity to receive 
17:40
Christ in heaven if they want to and they'll actually come to his throne and bring him 
17:44
flowers and say they receive him they don't necessarily have to do that to be in heaven 
17:50
but they want to do it well it wouldn't that almost by default if they went to heaven wouldn't 
17:56
they I can't imagine someone saying as a child no I don't want to receive Christ right 
18:03
anybody they love him they so fall in love yeah so I think it's such a blessing for the 
18:09
father to allow them to do that so they do have they have a big event where they're invited 
18:14
to sit on usually on the throne of the father and then Jesus will come and he will present 
18:22
himself there and Jesus and he will ask Jesus to be received as his savior okay good good 
18:29
good good okay say that we've got three children's questions today say love my granddaughter 
18:35
my granddaughter's name is say that but that's what he said they may say pronounce a seal 
18:39
that but say that or see the age eight is asking cat are there singing squirrels and 
18:46
talking flowers in heaven that she's eight years old she wants another singing squirrels 
18:51
and talking flowers I have seen both while I was in heaven so I can adamantly tell you 
18:57
absolutely yes the flowers have faces yes they sing home meadows sing sometimes and 
19:04
yes squirrels do not just squirrels most of the creatures are most of the what you would 
19:09
call an animal especially all your pets they all talk they talk and then there is some 
19:15
there's a whole group of squirrels that I know and I don't know why and I haven't laughed 
19:19
out for the so many times I don't care people love it there are a group of squirrels that 
19:23
actually are called greeters GR TERS and when someone comes home to heaven they will actually 
19:31
go in this group and they will actually sing and dance for the people welcoming them to 
19:35
heaven I can imagine some maybe some older type stuffy person and here they are opening 
19:45
the door and here's this group of squirrels ready to sing and dance they have to stop 
19:48
having pain I'm not kidding the Holy Spirit does does make sure it all happens and so 
19:53
if there's something you don't like you'll change when you get there that's you know 
19:58
that's actually the mouthful right there and he said because I know but you know what because 
20:04
when I if you had the further okay I'm 67 for the first 50 years of my life I could 
20:11
never have received most of that that you're saying because I would have I don't know what 
20:15
I would have thought would be wrong with that I was just taught that heaven is holy and 
20:20
we're going to worship him and no I would have said no we're probably not going to 
20:24
just sit on the cloud but I didn't have a replacement for that activity I just didn't 
20:29
believe it I had someone wrote I saw it written and someone said there won't be the reason 
20:34
we know that there won't be this is a kind of a quote the reason we know there won't 
20:38
be amusement parks and heaven that there are none is because the elements it's because 
20:43
that's on earth and the elements on the earth will be burned up with fervent heat so therefore 
20:48
we know amusement parks won't be in heaven they were there first before the earth was 
20:54
even made about time or what's going on earth are you kidding it's on the earth because 
21:02
it is in heaven see I want you to say that because I knew that was your answer because 
21:07
I've come to learn that and it makes sense it's logical you know everything about the 
21:14
river of life well we're on the earth so why did they burn I mean the thing about is when 
21:20
I saw that I thought well that would mean if you followed that logic then that would 
21:24
mean since we have mansions on the earth and that earth is going to burn up there can be 
21:29
no mansions in heaven and since we have roads on the earth to drive vehicles there can be 
21:35
no roads or vehicles of any kind in heaven and you pretty soon you you have God with 
21:40
his hands up say what can I do you you've made all these things illegal for me to have 
21:46
in heaven it's kind of crazy all right well that's good news cat I'm glad you're here 
21:51
to bring the good news all right I like this question K I don't know how old but she says 
21:55
does God have any particular reason reason when he sends twins triplets or whatever to 
22:03
be born does he have a reason I'm not quite sure what she means I don't know that he has 
22:07
a reason other than he just he loves seeing all three of them I guess or both of them 
22:12
or whatever but I don't know of any certain reason that he would send since he sends those 
22:17
from heaven and he tells them this is your assignment which we you know we don't know 
22:22
now but he he gives an assignment if he's gonna send triplets he would probably does 
22:27
this make sense he would probably get these three children together and say you're gonna 
22:31
be triplets in about a minute from now what does he he tells them about their life is 
22:38
going to be and then he sends them or what I think there's a whole lot of stuff that 
22:44
goes on with all that there are times sometimes he'll actually mention it to people before 
22:50
they before they're born you know while they're still living in him in him he'll let them 
22:55
know the their purpose even he'll let them know sometimes who he's chosen for them all 
23:01
kinds of things go on so they'll be really hard to say but he does share with them most 
23:06
of the time not necessarily whenever when they'll be born but that they will be born 
23:11
together as a family sometimes he does do that okay all right now Matt is asking this 
23:19
this is it sounds like my kind of questions I would be asking you says do people look 
23:23
back on their earthly life fondly from heaven so they've gone to heaven do they look back 
23:30
and think of you know I you could say not like the good old days because they're in 
23:35
the good old days now in heaven but do they look back and say remember when we did this 
23:40
to their friend remember when we went to the creek and we all went so visit that kind of 
23:44
fond memories from heaven I think sometimes that they can kind of remember being with 
23:51
certain people maybe not younger maybe a little older they do I think depending on how close 
23:58
also that you got to the Lord he himself may actually show you oh really oh yeah yeah he'll 
24:05
show you he's shown me different people he's shown me different people that I knew before 
24:10
I came to the earth and I've seen myself sitting in his hand quite a few times explaining to 
24:16
me some of the things I would be doing of course I didn't remember them until much later on 
24:24
so sometimes he does do that but it really depends on the relationship you pursue with 
24:28
him especially the Lord that he will share things with you from your past past meaning 
24:35
before time yeah okay BT BT before time BT BT alright here is okay I don't know how specifically 
24:50
the answer you'd answer this but I'll throw you the question Sarah is asking in light 
24:55
of all the exposures coming from those caught up in sex trafficking how do we pray for all 
25:00
the victims being delivered in this horrendous experience so I don't know how would you tell 
25:06
them to pray for the victims that are being delivered is that that's what their question 
25:10
is well there is something they can do if they knew about it and that was the losing 
25:14
of their soul oh you can you can because God has not disordained it that way but he created 
25:23
that way and it was a soul checkup it's all about your soul the keys to the kingdom which 
25:30
you bind others will be bound in heaven which you loose and it will be loose in heaven meaning 
25:35
if let's say it was a horrible encounter like we're talking about something like that and 
25:40
then someone they met who was adapted being a soul doctor they could share with them if 
25:47
they lose those things and named him by name and then they lose them out of their soul 
25:51
and Jesus name Jesus will come and take them like they were never there and I teach that 
25:57
actually haven't done it well but I actually would teach that to different leaders of different 
26:01
groups that want to do that especially for young people who are rescued from drugs and 
26:06
those things like that and they cried it they were so rejoiced because they said it would 
26:10
take them a year to work with a group or a person and in this way in three minutes they 
26:16
have loose everything in their soul that ever was there that the devil put there and I you 
26:24
know let's camp there for a minute we've got about ten minutes left here but let's see 
26:31
we're going to keep it to 40 minutes or so today so someone is rescued and if you could 
26:38
see their soul and I don't know as a seer if you can see that cap but but let's say 
26:42
that you just know okay so you see their soul and let's say it's full what do you see because 
26:47
that was one of the questions what do you see first of all it depends on which person or 
26:50
type of person you're talking about I see all kinds of things I can see people who have 
26:55
gone to suffering I can see people who have been abused if someone is abused they'll have 
27:01
like you know you've heard people say we're gonna tie the knot these are all about relationships 
27:07
this is not like the twisted rope hanging out of you somewhere I'm not saying that this 
27:11
sort of right you knew that they had some kind of negative relationship in their life 
27:17
somewhere because that's what I see therefore I know they need healing for that and in the 
27:23
past I would just pray and declare over them now I actually will go up to them and talk 
27:27
to them and I'll teach them how they can be free from that in Jesus name the God never 
27:33
intended you to go through those things that was not his purpose there's a devil in this 
27:36
world I hate everybody and whatever you can steal from your destiny the point of the devil 
27:42
to mess with people in that is he wants to steal their destiny and that's one of the 
27:48
ways that he does it is by the abuse no matter what kind of abuse that is that they have 
27:53
to go through but I remember the the time that the father showed up and showed up in 
27:59
my room he said I'm going to show you and he said I will show you he said after I show 
28:04
you this people will know how in minutes to lose everything out of their soul and they'll 
28:09
never suffer from it again wow this will help every single believer accelerate their life 
28:15
into victory because I don't have someone you have three months three years ten years 
28:20
trying to get healed from stuff that was done to them wrongfully he said if they follow 
28:25
these instructions it's simply the keys to the kingdom which everybody doesn't always 
28:31
understand none of those different ways people can use those keys to the kingdom he said 
28:35
but I'm talking about what you lose on earth you lose from heaven you lose from heaven 
28:40
so what you lose from your soul that was done to you on earth that was wrong heaven will 
28:46
come and lose it from your soul completely and it will be like it never existed if you 
28:53
want to bind the things of god and then we were growing up we were always hot to bind 
28:56
the devil yeah are you uh there's something much better than binding that it's binding 
29:02
the love of god the life of god the plans of god the will of god his joy his celebration 
29:08
his expectation you can choose with your will to bind those things to your soul and no one 
29:14
can ever take them away from you and you will feel completely different so these are things 
29:20
taught to me by the father and I remember it was out it was ours earth time because I remember 
29:27
glancing at my clock and then he took me and he would be taking me back and forth showing 
29:32
me things on the earth and showing me how people got healed it was really uh quite a drawn-up process 
29:38
and I have helped so many people and we actually help people become soul doctors that's what god 
29:44
calls me a soul doctor I heard you use that a minute ago I hadn't heard that term before but in 
29:49
other words it it would be like you don't have to become a licensed uh professional counselor 
29:54
you can become a soul doctor you're right practice what god says took me into the future and I 
30:01
saw down the hallways of businesses athletic places um it didn't matter where it was churches 
30:08
churches and I would see a doorway that said soul doctrine it had a little sign up outside and people 
30:14
would go in the air to get like sort of like counseling or healing or being made whole when 
30:19
they're sold it was quite fascinating so yes there are things that you can do to help one another 
30:25
how to be free from all that garbage and I mean the list was like so long and it didn't matter 
30:31
what it was that the people had wanted to lose from their soul if they were involved in it if their 
30:35
family was involved in it if situations that happened to them every one of those could be 
30:41
lose from your soul drugs you know all kinds of all kinds of things you would choose to lose them 
30:47
from your soul can use uh I felt to ask you this while you were talking because you were talking 
30:53
about a person could lose it from their own soul by by doing what you've taught them to do so this 
31:00
is what this is kind of the yucky question so there's women watching right now who have been 
31:06
raped and they never got delivered from the trauma of that rape or the or the horrible memories of 
31:12
it men too because a man can be raped because he has a child okay how would you walk a woman 
31:19
right through what would she say right now in her prayer time how would she use her words to 
31:24
to be her own soul doctor if I could put that right I would just say to her that God actually 
31:32
I think even better than that is I should tell you a real situation that happened okay okay 
31:37
um one of the first times I ever got to use that I had just been with a father maybe weeks later 
31:43
I was in New Jersey I was invited by a pastor and his wife and her two sons and he went in the 
31:51
grocery store to get some things from my room your snacks and stuff and she said I've got it 
31:55
you were sent here for me this is a real story you were sent here for me and I know in the next 
32:00
couple minutes you can help me be free because I knew that the Lord would help me get free she said 
32:05
I have been been through some of the worst torments of um violence violent torments night and day 
32:12
before I was married three times and and to the wrong same person not the same person same kind 
32:17
of person and she said I can't stand it anymore I thought God I've got to be free of this I don't 
32:22
want the nightmares I don't want the torments my kids were present with some of these happened 
32:27
and so they've gone through these same things what can we do to be free right now 
32:32
and in three minutes I told her do you know what the word says about binding and losing 
32:38
she said well binding and losing you know you mean yes I said yes that what you choose to lose 
32:45
from your soul that was done to you will be loosed from heaven itself heaven will come down pull it 
32:52
out of your soul completely and it will be like you never experienced it before she said show me 
33:00
right now my husband's still in there show me now right now and so I let her through it you know 
33:05
um and she she gave her name she said uh father in Jesus name I'm choosing to lose from my soul 
33:10
all the violent activities the violent things I've been that I was hurt with that I had to 
33:16
stand and see that my kids had to stand and see I'm fed up with it I'm tired of the devil 
33:21
abusing me and I'm not going through this life anymore so I choose with my own will to lose it 
33:26
in Jesus name right now forever and ever amen and then this light came on her face 
33:35
really I have never ever seen and this light came I mean I was overwhelmed 
33:42
I mean I knew it would work she sat there and she started crying a laugh and she goes 
33:47
she said some minute she goes it's gone I mean it's gone I mean in three minutes it's gone 
33:54
it's literally gone it's like I never had it before I I can't even remember some of the 
34:00
actions she goes I I've got to do this with my two boys before you even go back can you please 
34:05
do the same thing with them they were like the like 10 and uh 15 something like that or 17 something 
34:11
like that I said of course of course she said all I can do is laugh now before I couldn't even 
34:18
stand to think about going to bed at night her husband knows that was sort of goes what's wrong 
34:21
she goes I'm the happiest person in the world wow she worked and so yeah the third night 
34:29
she brought them and I led them to the same thing and I saw her 10 years later she said do you know 
34:34
what that stuff has never come back you're still filled with joy because after that I taught her 
34:41
how to bind the joy the Lord God's love his his his presence you know his purposes for your life 
34:47
his celebration and she said we're still filled with that stuff she said I am so grateful and you 
34:53
should I've helped so many people through that out of their life it is really really that's 
35:01
and they have lose they have people have lose some drug addiction alcohol all kinds of things 
35:07
some things they're like even witchcraft they have lose that from their soul and and because they 
35:13
were repentant first and then they lose it from the soul so I have to say one of the great and 
35:18
the father said this may be one of the greatest things I ever show you and he was right so he 
35:24
calls me soul doctor all the time I love that term too I this first time I heard you use it but wow 
35:29
that's so powerful yeah I mean his body can people can be sick in their body and still be happy 
35:36
if you're sick in your soul you have no life at all 
35:39
wow this may be the most this is the most important thing we did today and we've even 
35:48
like kids we've let kids do that too that have been abused but the teenager place in Orlando 
35:56
that camp that they have to go to for a year they have me come down and I taught every single one 
36:02
of the leaders and the teachers how to do that and he said they'd never been the same again 
36:07
and now instead of having all those weeks and months to trust the person who used to be with 
36:13
that person it takes a few minutes and they're free wow wow cat that is simply amazing and I've 
36:23
heard you talk on this a lot this was especially poignant if I guess you know uh because people 
36:30
you know I've heard it and I I've done lots and lots and lots of self you know losing yeah I feel 
36:36
like I got it at a new level today of understanding even though I heard these words before I feel 
36:41
like it went even deeper this time so personally I think I've received benefit from this but I 
36:46
know that people watching this is very important I'm sure there will be many many many people 
36:51
Steve they will never be the same again after this broadcast we are going to print mini booklets we 
36:58
actually are going to print mini booklets m-i-n-i mini booklets that people can order in bunches and 
37:04
stuff like that they can even hand out to people and then eventually we'll probably print a book 
37:11
and give the whole story about how the father came how he taught me all the places he took me 
37:17
and my daughter finally came to the door I think it had been almost four hours I had locked myself 
37:22
in my room my older daughter and she goes mom can I please come in I went I've just been with the 
37:28
father she goes can I please come in come down my bed and I showed she was the first one I told 
37:34

37:40
by being a soul doctor wow amazing cat wow cat thank you so much very very very important 
37:47

38:22
God God got so ahold of her and uh she's a smart person she tells me if you know anything or think 
38:30
of anything or God wants me to have something you call me grow up and make sure I get it and so uh 
38:36
she called me one time and I think this is one of the times when she was going through stuff she 
38:40
goes I've I've had someone call me on the phone wanting to commit suicide because the rotten 
38:45
boyfriend that's what she called him broke up with her and ditched her and she said she was so 
38:50
heartbroken she couldn't stand to live and her her friend was right her friend was not a Christian 
38:56

39:02
before would you mind if I call my friend to get her on the phone and you lead her through that 
39:08
because I don't want to see her take her life and I said you know I well so she did I told her 
39:14
about Jesus Christ and she said she knew that she had knew who the Lord was I said did you know he 
39:19
can make you completely whole so you don't need your boyfriend you don't really need that person 
39:25
if somebody loved you they wouldn't have dumped you ditched you and used you like that

40:13

40:54
yourself by helping people you don't have to be a brilliant you know you don't have to know

41:05
the only place in the in the cosmos that you can give online there is no other place there's no other 
41:13
