said that's accountability on their part right hey cat what is that symbol on your the blue it almost looks like a diamond what is that this one right here is a shield it's a shield representing one from heaven this is the host initiative it's about heaven's army working with us in this time and actually god asked me to design a logo and chris who's our media art tech person helped to create this and what it is is it says h i the host initiative the eye is a lightning bolt and on top of the eye itself is an eye of one of the hosts of heaven and behind it is sort of an open portal that's what the blue behind it is so this represents a new time on the earth very cool very very cool well um before we let's you have an announcement you wanted to make about uh this weekend and where are you going to be tell us about that yeah well everybody most people know especially those who had signed up for um the freedom event the freedom uh conference i don't like the conference uh freedom event of what that was supposed to be in murfreesboro tennessee at global fire ministries that was cancelled because they didn't they really did have death threats those death threats have been lifted now because uh obviously hank uh changed his um changed his course so he's not going and jeff will not be there at all and by the way jeff is on the sabbatical i'm just gonna say that much right now and he probably needs it desperately and so does his team because of a lot of stuff they've been going through however i was invited by jan janssen yeah jan because god still wanted a message to go out through there so i will be a special guest speaker this sunday the 25th in murfreesboro tennessee at global fire ministries it's going to be great it's going to be on the times of god which is something god just gave me so you don't want to miss it i'm sure that it will be online if not uh i'm sure we at least will have our our facebook going with that um but just wanted you know global foreign ministers is going to go uh full steam ahead but jeff is going to be taking a sabbatical and he probably should have taken that six months ago if you all didn't know what i'll just say this too when the prophets begin to jump off the wagon the wagon you know that trump's going to be restored um a lot of them started bashing him which we all know is wrong a prophet supposed to speak the words of god they're accountable to god himself um but no one should bash a prophet you know what it says in the bible about not touching his anointed so just let me give you a heads up that's wrong don't bash the prophets hello they're the ones who hear from god and if they're saying something that doesn't line up keep it in your heart and pray for them but uh but i'm not bashing any of them okay they made a decision that's between them and god we're going to see how all this works out in the end but if anybody needs a break it would definitely be jeff and jan and their family and their team so i'm going like uh just as uh so that you'll still hear a word of god that would be powerful from murfreesboro tennessee from global fire ministries so that's my first announcement i want to make again that's this sunday and there'll just be one service 10 a.m sunday and i'm excited about getting to go and so that's my that's it for that but let me tell you what yeah go ahead and talk you ready to hear about the government yeah go go for it yes okay well you should probably watch hannity the hannity show that president trump was actually speaking on the other day he gave a few heads up about him not being invisible anymore he's also working full steam ahead to get the house flipped which we need that to happen if you want to pray about something pray that the house of representatives gets flipped uh back to republican control because we need that okay we need it the senate's almost a shooting but keep praying for that to happen to you and those of you who don't know there are the elections which every four years but there's mid-term elections which are very important that would be 2022 when a lot of this will be voted on replacing the voting for the house of representatives and for the senate there may be a few governorships in there somewhere i'm not certain about that but i do know i do hear down the pipeline but some of the governors are going to be more and more outspoken the republican ones because they have life in their states and you should know that if you're in one of those i'm in one of those in florida it's fully open the state's been fully opened by governor desantis please make sure you're praying for him to have more strength and and no sound wisdom from god he is a strong believer and he wants life for the people here and there's several other states doing the same thing so you all you hear from the uh this so they're still up to their own business they haven't changed their ammo at all i think one day they will really totally regret that because because when the news is controlled thank god there's other sources newsmax and there's a few other sources out there i know a kenneth copeland show a flashpoint and there's several other you don't know about so you know make sure they're telling the truth when you hear them because they will encourage you and empower you to know what really is going on i think trump's going to start doing that himself and make sure you you have checked out is it a 45 office.com is that what trump's new website is i think yeah 45 office.com right right 45 office.com sign up for it you'll get stuff from the president himself that would be president trump and so i just want to encourage you things many things are going on but he's going to be more and more visible which terrifies the left and terrifies hell they don't want his voice to be heard there's a frequency in it and so he's starting to speak about who to vote for in these upcoming um midterm elections which are very important so please focus on that for your prayers and of course for trump himself and his family you're not seeing the end of them trust me god's still saying the same exact thing if you ask me i'm going to keep saying the same words he said he's going to have his way in this time he's going to not just expose the corruption but he's going to deal harshly with it very harshly with it and that's to prepare the way for what is coming in this next time of god which is not the perilous times i know i get tired of saying that but people still think it is and i saw someone that recently asked me that i went absolutely not they're from a time when you won't even be on the earth people most people alive now won't be here when that happens you should rejoice about that so they'll be great it'll get greater and greater and greater and greater in the generations to come that's why this is being done now if you understand how god operated this is what he does he wipes out exposes the evil hello okay did that in heaven exposed it then wiped it out of there right on the earth exposed all the evil with no and then he wiped it out and putting over he belonged he's not going to wipe off the earth this time but he's totally going to deal with the darkness and i know i said eat cake and celebrate yes i'm still eating cake in smaller portions people maybe a cookie would do no i don't know a date and guess what that doesn't matter to me what matters is our god is still here you're praying he's got your prayers they filled the bowls before the altar of his throne and yes i've been having many times since all this started and they're still celebrating so celebrate but keep your prayer focus out there say you may say with your own words even in the atmosphere i refuse to accept any of the lying cheating stealing i'm going to accept any a new fake law made that takes away my constitutional rights i reject it in jesus name your words do something in the atmosphere to shift things so don't think you're powerless you're not powerless as long as you've got a voice and you've got jesus amen very very good by the way this morning it is still dark and i get knocked on the side and i felt like it was an angelic thing waking me up and so i thought okay i'm going to go back to sleeping i thought wait a minute i had reminded myself when i get knocked i'm supposed to look at the clock so i looked at the clock the digital this is 4 45 the president is 4 45 this is april i don't know what it means i'm just telling you i got knocked by an angel look at the clock it's 4 45 so i don't know if the four stands for four or april probably april maybe but four also means you know the number four means god's path that's what it means god's path uh or god's plans that's what the number four means number three means god's approval so he basically said my path is still 45 we know who 45 is yeah absolutely um i'm going to jump by the way i was going to mention that you said it's april 21 of 21 they've got a three for because this is your episode 21 with us on april 21 of 21. now how's that for god in numbers that's awesome okay but i'm going to jump ahead to a question because you just said something and i thought i'm going to tie that to a question that's way down to my list you said trump's coming in and they don't like it they don't like he's got a different vibration and i'm going to ask you the question then you can jump back to talk about i'm going to ask you what did you mean by that trump vibration and this world inner person said there are times when i've come into a thick presence of the lord and it feels like my back entire body are vibrating has this happened even if so why are we vibrating so talk about vibrating and vibrations if they're two different things or whatever that's a new question for you no i can tell you that happens to me off and on when the presence of the lord is so strong i my body will begin to it's like a it's like a super fast shaking uh i mean we'll shake right and then we shake your whole inside shakes that's that's the frequency of god coming into the earth but trump's vibration is increasing you're the first one who i ever said that you by the way that what he's given now is a shaking it's a shaking coming from trump himself since the enemies trying to shake us into fear the words when trump speaks him has that vibration that frequency of of of the spirit of god in them because god is shaking himself he's shaking the earth itself he's starting to shake hell itself is shaking right now they're terrified because you know satan's usually the one who does the shaking thing but god had done a long time ago so he is shaking how the spirits of darkness are beginning to shake i see them all the time like shaking trying to run away and so i can tell you we're getting closer and closer to that time when god himself is going to do something of course it's going to involve trump in it but even the frequency and his voice now has a vibration in it some people begin to feel that when they hear him speak because you know why he is our president and i need to remind you when i'm talking about this the bible says when the wicked are in power you know the people is it's going to be a terrible time people in accuracy all kinds of things happen but when that when the righteous are in power the people rejoice well why aren't you rejoicing because the left has no power i don't mind saying that the left has no power not real power they're taking or trying to steal the power but in the spirit realm they have no power to speak or bring greater evil and they can want to they want to say they want it but but because trump is our president he is in power literally won the election so he's in power for that reason but god put him there and so he is god recognizes him as being in power in our country right now even though he's not that said that officially well he actually has said officially he was the president it's going to shift and when there's a shift there's a shaking first let me tell you but the shaking that's happening in spirit right now isn't hell shaking it's god shaking well that was one of my questions somewhere here you just mentioned it several prophets have been now saying we're in for a bit of a dark time before it gets lighter there'll be words like that or there's going to be riot some riots in the cities um and maybe some people even need to make sure you have preparation for a short period and before it gets good is someone showing you any of that and if so or if not no i'm not about that she's not he's not shown that okay from the very beginning when people said we'd have civil war then they changed some other kind of war we'd have neighborhood wars and god said the people are not going to rise up and have a civil war the war is going to be amongst the left themselves they're going to start fighting themselves and god says it also but i can tell you we are not appointed under wrath and because this is not the day of his wrath that's god's wrath it's not the day of god's wrath that means anyone who rises up trying to do something they're going to get the wrath of god is what's going to happen and i would say anything like that would be uh i don't i don't know if god has never said to me that they need to be prepared for months and months and months of total darkness no food no i think and i think most people think think in the terms of a week or two or something like that that there'd be some intense times you're not getting anything like that i'll tell you where they won't come from they won't come from the republican [Laughter] any of states happens you people need to know if the democrats are in control of the states and there's democratic governors and we all know about newsome and the other one i can't remember his name most of the time the one in the old california that they've tried to get rid of like eight times and he keeps getting around it i can't speak for those states because there has been some violence in those states that has nothing to do with our our own president that has nothing to do with america itself that's not america going into war thus those governors permitting and probably paying for those different groups to come in and do demonstrations of violence and set things on fire why to bring fear to the people that's what that's all about but as far as our whole country that's not going to happen the governors who are in power right now and the republican governors aren't going to tolerate it happening they will stop that from happening they've already had meetings about that and information has already been sent out this kind of covert information i can assure you the only ones who will keep doing it are the ones who are doing it good good good good okay uh we've got various things okay here's a person wanting to know uh when jesus was in heaven he or she stayed he or she saying jesus was in heaven until he was in mary's womb so suddenly he's in mary's womb do you have any knowledge about was he the question is that was he able to communicate with god while he's in the womb during those nine months i guess is the question i know uh quite a bit about how all that happened but um the one thing i want to say now before we get off the track is right side broadcasting is another place you can go to online is that right now let me see uh oh i can't forget to say this this last sunday they had a huge event in florida called storm the bay trumperilla mega first boat parade in tampa florida hundreds of thousands of people flooded the state to celebrate trump and right side broadcasting if you go on and look for it you'll be able to see it and right side broadcasting is the one who's always showing him now when he has any kind of um rallies and stuff like that right side broadcasting we'll be putting that on so don't forget to go there and check it out you'll be blessed beyond measure to see i'm sure trump was and mike lindell yay michael he literally paid for that whole thing to happen and so i want to tell you bless mike glendale go buy his pillow my pillow really a true patriot absolutely okay back to the womb thing what jesus going in from so i obviously at one moment he's in heaven then there's the the seed in mary's womb suddenly i have to let you know it was not a suddenly in heaven okay this was planned our father is the greatest planner of all time he makes claims to be clear i think this person knew that but realized that there was a moment in time when it happened when the plan was put into effect so he's there the plan is about to happen the angel sees mary it says the spirit's going to overshadow you and whom it happens right what do you do and that was actually that was gabriel gabriel uh was present however the holy spirit is the one who brought the his name was the word that was jesus's name in heaven he was called the word the father explained to him if you're going to die for them i have to put flesh on you turn you into a seed and holy spirit will plant you in the womb of mary so holy spirit came in the form of a seed and gabriel was there also so when that happened gabriel got to make the announcement that's why that's why gabriel was there to let mary know how all that happened and i don't know maybe in the beginning i'm sure the father was watching over him and everything but there came a time jesus when he was born he had to be raised up till he came to a time of understanding which was young he was young when he knew he was the son of god but in the womb of mary i believe he was like any other baby in there he had to grow his body had to form uh into the into the the flesh body that god had chosen for him and so i'm sure the father probably saying over him and things like that but as far as communication like speaking to him i don't know that happened until jesus got older when the father literally wanted him to know you are my son you must be about my business this is why i sent you yeah that's good that's good now this person wants to know a different person wants to know jesus is on the man of transfiguration and either the father brings it says it but most this and elijah i'm guessing they were in abraham's wisdom then suddenly are whisked uh for lack of better terrible knowledge they're on the mount with jesus uh and this person's wanting to know what did they talk about if you know and did they do some sort of time travel to understand what was going on what what can you tell me about any details about that event are you talking about when the disciples saw him right yeah right they saw moses and elijah and they're all talking this person wasn't what were they talking about and then she actually he or she asked did they try and travel at that moment i think because there has been teaching i think kim clement suggested this others have suggested that there was a time travel element when moses was on mount sinai and god hit him in the cleft of the rock and there was a suggestion they time traveled into the amount of transfiguration hundreds and hundreds of years in the future what you thought i think that probably could have been a whole different incident um i'm sure of course jesus christ by the way appeared when the monk of transfiguration was they saw him in his glorified body that's what they did so so at one moment he's in his body his human body that you would normally see but when he when christ was glorified when he came out of the tomb there was such a glory on him remember even a few people didn't recognize him at that time so in front of them they saw christ in the glorified body he allowed it probably could have been an open vision he probably could have done an open vision thing where they saw you know they saw them with him up there they saw him it was just evidence to them he was the son of god and that that was right what they were they were thinking at the time in their life i do know this that when moses when god put moses in the cleft of the rock god himself put moses inside him the cleft of the rock was inside god and all of time is con is uh shown in there god's been from the beginning to the end the end of the beginning it's all inside him so when he hit he hid moses in there moses saw time begin he saw the garden of eden he saw adam he saw that he would not have known about any of that and so he said as i pass by when time passes by i said when that's what he's saying i will show you the hinder parts that's the exact oh that's what that means wasn't the hunter parts wasn't god talking about his back the hinder parts were the parts of time that had gone before them he showed moses time before that time and that's how moses knew about adam and eve and all that stuff so that was a whole different encounter that moses had with god that was a brand new encounter when when jesus was shown in his glorified body in the amount of transfiguration he could have totally brought moses and you know right there he could have just put him there with them because you know he is god so there's many different facets i guess one day we're just gonna we're going to not right now eventually write a revelation bible or bible of revelation however you want to call it probably and put all these scriptures in there with with the encounters that happen time travel that happened the spirit realm so people are beginning to understand there's things we don't see or understand that are hidden in the word of god yeah wow okay awesome that's i i never heard that explanation the hindu part means in history basically it was what awesome i always wondered where moses got his revelation about the garden of eden that's what you're saying that's where it happened because he wrote those books okay so um three different people you know we went through this last time but i don't think we kept these names you may have to remind me people this will tell people something about god was king who killed his brother is he in heaven if he knows nicodemus who jesus said you have to be born again again is he in heaven and what about a massive fire who lied to the holy spirit and died are they in heaven if you know now i you need to say them over again because i know okay yeah okay so cain who killed his brother nicodemus and ananias and sapphira i have never seen ananias and sapphira anywhere in heaven i've not seen them at all cain is there because cain did eventually repent cain knew that he had sinned but this is the thing he knew god protected him he knew he would have been killed and this is the thing why did god still want him even on the earth well number one he was still he still was producing children that was in the lineage of um of adam for some time so god wanted him to remain or he would not have marked him so people wouldn't kill him god didn't allow him to be killed that mean he had a time for him to take adam when and not adam when cain died that he went to abraham's bosom so yes he did repent unlike judas who never repented judas is in hell completely and nicodemus i'm almost probably pretty certain that he's so was passionate about god himself about him he most likely is in heaven so the only ones i'm pretty sure are not are in ice and sapphira who lied that was that was life blasting the holy spirit really rejecting knowingly knowing the truth and lying to the face of the those who are in authority lied to them that was not a good thing to do on on god said never is a good thing to do but back then it was like they they were not in heaven i'm not seeing them in him i've seen adam and eve in heaven for sure yeah that that reminds me pull it up um i may have to come back to it someone wrote me a question this morning i'm not sure which one of my notes but they said if somebody's saved and then towards the end of their life they got into idol worship um and then they they didn't give the conclusion they said at the end of the life they started worshiping idols it must be a personal thing are they lost forever is there some chance that that person that accepted christ will still make it but they've lost rewards what what could you say about that i would have more details of the question i would say i'm not god right well none of us are god and that only god knows the heart of a person and uh so there's no explanation about how did they get pulled into that how deep was that was that our artificial thing was that that was like was that could it be in any kind of idol was that like money or gold or was that like in um like idol worship as far as um um you know yeah so i would say if they're a believer and we're pulled off the track for that but never denied jesus christ i would say there's definitely still a really good chance that they're in heaven because at that time of their death christ would probably meet with them if they had a christian family or close close christian friends praying for them that absolutely gave but i can't say there's so many different ways that it could be idol worship okay if it was just like idolized if it's idolizing things like material things that doesn't send you to hell just means you're going to be a weak christian so there's a lot of um leeway and all of that but i would say god this is what he says if i got you if you became born again i have a hook in you okay he puts a hook in you that christ will pursue that even up until the time that you die he's going to pursue that because there's those words you spoke yourself receiving him it says he's married to the backslider so i can just keep giving you scripture all day long he desires that none should perish and if you already gave that declaration that is a powerful powerful thing when you receive christ he doesn't just wipe you off the books because you fall once or twice you get caught into something that's different than giving your whole life and signing a satanic agreement with satan wow yeah by the way back on the anonymous sapphire thing let me let me drill down just a bit on that i've got this question swirly in my brain uh we see it as a momentary event where where almost as if a few minutes before he they decided to talk they did they they decided to lie do you see ananias and sapphira as half having a really character and honesty flaw that was working in them for quite a while for them to be able to do this in other words they didn't make a momentary decision and spending eternity in hell for that or were they really pretenders all along do you have any other insights on i think that is long-standing sin i would have to say that was probably something that they had been um involved in for some time that i think they already had um made their decision before they were asked that even though and they do this definitely and they said the same thing they both had a chance to say separately uh here wrong we've done this neither one of them did it we showed you that right there there was coercion they did it they made an agreement this is what we're going to say infrastructure we're not backing off with this this is what we're saying even though it's a lie and i have to say that's exactly what happened because otherwise one of them could have been moved if they weren't together they had an opportunity to say no we lied about it we lied we should have told the truth they could have at either time having done this separately had the freedom to say we're lying and we're cheating god and they didn't do it they cheated they lied so that was already working in their home an agreement it makes sense that it was yeah because you'd have to get to a point in your life where you're willing to take that chance that i must have kept blessing you no matter what you did so you thought you could get away with it this was inspiring yeah it says okay um now people will look at cat with pink hair multiple visions and trips to heaven and they think every single prayer gets answered for you right away so here's the question does cat have all or most of her prayers answered instantly does she have any prayers that are still in process of being answered what is the longest prayer she has ever prayed and still waiting for the answer i have to say the longest one that i stood and i would have to say i didn't keep saying it i don't i don't once i ask god something if i even ask him it's almost never that i ask him for something not for me it's usually for others that i stand in the gap for and i would have to say i knew that i knew my family was called to do something and i was probably 14 years old um maybe younger than that and my own dad my my physical dad had conversations with me about our family and what would be called into and there'd be signs that would begin to happen and we would see those signs and so we my dad and i prayed together about this we actually stood in the mountains somewhere and like this it was very powerful declaration and prayer and agreement i never dropped it even when my dad went to heaven that didn't change anything that we were standing for i was standing for his intergenerational thing and that was probably close to 40 some years and it and it happened it began to happen the same signs he said what happened would happen and i rejoice in sin so that declaration and decree and agreement that agreement has already happened so i don't usually ask god just brings stuff to me all the time and it's like literally i hear him every day and yes that's because i have a commission that doesn't mean you can't hear him every day if you pursue him for that but he actually came from heaven and said i'm giving you a commission to be taken to heaven when i feel like it that's god to show you things to reveal on the earth i'm going to show you things to come i'm going to take you to the past and show you things how they happen and giving you revelation on the word of god and it was for one reason that they would know him and know that heaven was real so i don't have a lot of things i personally even asked for myself because i'm living in what his plan is and this is a thing i haven't backed up i'm not going to back up i won't change what he's saying to me i'm allowed to say what he says and i'm allowed to tell you what he showed me so i don't have the mix of man in me i don't have man's plans man's thoughts man's assumptions and i don't listen to most anything out there i listen to him and and that's good to have a time to give to him and even though people say stuff if it comes against what he said to you i would not receive it if it's against what god himself said to you and that's where a lot of people think well all these other people are believing this maybe i should believe that no you believe what god said to you so most of my prayers like i've stood for over 40 some years for that to happen never failing to thank him for it which is the key he told me god confirmed it that this was going to happen and i've only thanked him all those years for the promise he gave to us what that's going to do so let me ask you this is me adding to the question so there must be four or five people you could you could think of who you have asked god for their salvation would that be true people that you stood for they've asked for their salvation but you see nothing happen i don't know about that because i see the spirit of god look around the person drawing them and pulling them i have to say it wasn't very long if it was somebody i personally knew that i stood for it wasn't very long before they came to christ and most of these people probably belonged to him and were beginning to wander and i would send the host of podenon strongholds of satan trying to influence that people was the worst thing i did to stop the enemy from continuing to speak to them there's so many things we have the right as a believer to do so those things were pulled down that left them open to hear the spirit of god the body of christ needs to know you need to know who you are and just using the word what it says about your word you speak but then you can't use the same words to you can't bless and curse okay i bless i choose not to curse you bless them don't curse them because then you're powerful the more your words are pure when you speak the more things the quickly the more quicker things happen so i can't equate myself and he won't let me line myself up with how he does with other people because i live a different kind of life myself but i always tell people never give up that is the thing don't step back don't get caught in fear don't get caught in deception because there's a lot of deception going on right now make sure you're staying true to what god said read his word meditate and you know what that means ask him a question if you see something just outwardly say i would like to know what that means and i can tell you whatever i said that to him he would always give me revelation it might be a maybe a couple days later or i would actually hear someone say the very thing i had asked god not knowing and they would say this is what i believe it is i would say to me that's the answer so it's it's keeping your own ears open by not playing darkness is the biggest thing you cannot play with darkness you can't play in the camp of the enemy and expect to hear clearly in your life and the other thing is if you have fear which the enemy uses again you kick fear all i don't care if you have to do it all day kick fear out of your soul get out of your house because that what happens is it begins to stop you from hearing clearly but i can't line myself up he won't let me say well you're doing this but they're not or they're not able to do this because you can do it uh whatever he gives me to do the number two thing i would say is keep your hearing open is to obey obey what god is saying i have to live i live in life you just absolutely now you just intrigued me by because uh again i've known you for seven years i know you as the probably the most obedient person i know and you've been caught up to heaven thousands of times and he walks through your wall a day or two and then give it to you through someone else's voice who's just talking that's what you just said is that is that right it is right because it's usually somebody that i know and i think god is showing me uh anyone can hear if you ask it sincerely and you ask him in believing that he's going to reveal this is about the word of god mostly that i'll say why did this happen i wonder why that happened i'm not even necessarily saying that him i'm just saying it and then maybe a couple days later gem will say well i believe this and this was it this i think this is how this happened her not knowing that i even said that out loud and so but many times he'll use the people close to you if there's strong christians he'll because maybe he's saying that to them at the same time but but mostly he just speaks to me and most of the stuff that i get is what he says to me just like he was speaking to me this morning when i woke up he was speaking to me last night when i went to bed and he was speaking to me for several hours yesterday it's a lifestyle interesting okay this questions i've heard this before so i i think i know your answer but on on the on this earth created actual wine jesus drank actual wine in heaven is their wine and if so what is it like sorry i'm going to interrupt really quick steve you're cutting out everything you're going to keep freezing here a little bit yeah let's see jeff are you coming in yeah so steve i'm going to keep it so yeah i'm going to kick you out really quickly yeah you're breaking up and freezing right but okay i'll come back here okay here we go cat go ahead and just answer that question is there wine in heaven oh there's wine in heaven but there's no alcohol people because nothing can decay you know they use that whole process i believe i don't i don't drink myself but the wine christ drank was heaven's wine at the wedding when he made the water into wine that wasn't earth's wine that was heaven's wine when he spoke it was the first miracle he did was at a wedding and mary knew he could do it because guess what he did it in their home he made their water into wine heaven's wine all the time and in the bible when the people got the wine in the web and he said normally they give the best one the beginning of the wedding that's what the guy who was having the one thing sad to jesus and he said but you have given the best at the end and usually they gave the worst wine they had but this one is the best we've ever had the reason for that is what jesus made was heaven's wine and it was being drunk on earth for the first time so jesus every time he took a cup didn't matter where he was he would just release into it and it would turn it into heaven's wine but there's wine in heaven yes it's filled with the holy spirit okay now jeff my eye because since that was me i can't tell i see on my screen so oh uh can you hear me all right cat oh i can hear you fine yeah there's a little delay on your end steve did everybody hear the answer to the question i think everybody heard and here comes joe i don't see anybody's video but okay what's going on um steve i think it's it's on your end there's a little bit of a so this is what we're gonna do i got a couple of questions picked out as well so steve if you want is there a way you can reset your router i just did before the show okay i i did a whole cold woo yeah so what if i try to get on my hot spot yeah go ahead and try that yeah yes okay let me try and get in my iphone okay okay so i'm gonna kick him out cat i'm gonna ask a question okay i am a huge superman fan like massive okay and yes i know people everybody's saying i look like clark can i don't do it on purpose i just do and i have to wear glasses i'm sorry i'm not apologizing for it i don't apologize okay so my question is i've heard you say this before touch on this i'm going to ask can you fly in heaven yes you can fly you can fly in heaven number one why wouldn't you which is what the holy spirit says to me all the time why wouldn't you fly i mean it's the place of creation it's the life and the power of god is everywhere if plants can sing if you can travel on light in heaven if you can speak and create food and it's on a tray in front of you why wouldn't you be able to fly and there is a park there's an amusement park i was taken to that have evidence that i was taken to that in my book one it really exists they have a place called flyby that's one of the amusement things in heaven in their park and you get taught to fly there and your friends who are in heaven will come to watch you learn to fly because it is hilarious you're not really good in the beginning you're like spinning through the air i mean you actually have places for them to sit and watch you learn but the the point is this christopher reeves who made it to heaven it's what he gets to do in heaven and i hope i just bashed a bunch of liberal uh not liberal but judgmental people keep it to yourself you'll find out when you go though you'll be standing in line with everyone else waiting to learn that sounds amazing what about super strength can you like lift super heavy things well you know nothing really weighs much in heaven it's made out of light but it is substantial like the walls of your mansion and heaven don't try to run through them a portal would open you would run through the portal and the wall of your mansion but it's a real place in your spiritual body in the spiritual world you feel the ground you're walking on you feel the food that you're eating it and so i would imagine since this is one of the best things i've talked about very little they actually have the angel games not kidding at all they actually have what we call the olympics they call the angel games in heaven and the army of heaven put them on on a regular basis when they come back from a lot of warring they get to do the angel games and show how good they are the different supernatural things they do so you'll probably be there watching that yeah oh yeah steve steve hello a little bit people get to witness any you know children leaving did you say aliens did you hear what you said i did not i didn't hear what he said steve okay i'm going to try one placement i'm going to try [Music] he sounds like a computer yeah you sound like your part computer steve now i think he may have said have i been present when people went went to heaven from earth he may have said that i'm not sure can you hear me steve yeah he's like completely frozen why don't you just answer that have you seen that i can and just recently did actually that happens several ways if i am present and somebody passes uh i've been present several times sometimes family members sometimes friends one of the most recent ones is my husband's best friend who he spent time with a lot right before he passed and we were actually in um uh we were in icu in his room and the guy who was there to watch over him until he passed was undone that we came in to see him i came right from an event from the airport to see him because the holy spirit said he's not going to be there long so we go in his room and i began to call our daughters who he's he loved our daughters very much as my husband best friend and they got to say goodbye to him i held the phone up to his ear and they each got to say goodbye and after the second one did that i told this um the intern who was in his room i said he's going to go really quick and he said oh he's going to last all night i said no he's not his own angels are pacing back and forth and i said that means the other angels are going to come because they all go together when they leave and i said they'll rush in the room and take them with this guy's eyes just kept getting bigger and bigger whenever i would talk about you know that type of thing and i said my last daughter we got a hold of her and she got to say goodbye to him on the phone and when we when we hung up our cell phone these eight angels raced in the room and i told the guy the angels have raced in the room here right now he was watching his screen you know his screen that says his heartbeat is still going and they took him and his angel they all went out to the ceiling took his spiritual body and left and all of a sudden that goes and that guy goes i can't believe this he was so shocked when he said he checked he said he is gone i went yeah i told you they came to take him so that's what usually happens so it was quite got it quite like the guy the guy really got undone that that god actually does that so absolutely powerful steve hi hi if you can hear me i'll try and do that one question again and if i go out again i'll just have you wrap things up jeff if i go out again but uh the question that i had that this person had is with the with uh all the children that the lord sends to the earth the father says are in him literally he sends them to the earth throughout our calendar day if you will this person wants to know anyone in heaven see this activity of him sending children do they see children go going anything like that well they may see them leaving him but the way that actually happens is still his holy spirit who's involved in the holy spirit takes a little spirit of life some can be very tiny and if you can see my fingers or not they can be this small they're different sizes we're different sizes here it's their spiritual body and what happens is at the time of conception the father releases into his hand that little spirit of life the holy spirit takes that goes down to the earth into the womb of the mother into her and at the very time of conception the holy spirit knits and attaches that little spirit of life to that dot of flesh that's exactly there's a flash of light when that happens because your little spirit means made out of light so when he attaches it literally to that inside the mother there's a flash of light and that little spirit of life at that time begins to grow in the womb of its mother and i tell people i said that for years and all of a sudden in science they actually discovered themselves that at the time of conception and they can't explain it they actually announced we know now that life begins at conception because at the time of conception when it literally takes place there's a flash of light and we don't know what that is it's that little spirit of life of that person that baby being attached at that very moment on the earth so i think people in heaven already know that's going to happen if they're believing and they're watching their family members praying god i i would we would like to have a child my husband ivan that happened a lot and so they may go before the zone and say father are you going to send them a baby are you going to send them one and sometimes he'll answer them he may say it may be a year or earth year go by or whatever but yes that is my desire to send one to them to raise up to become somebody for him so yeah they kind of know people in heaven already know that this is going to happen on the earth but as far as being present i don't think that happens unless they see when the little one steps out in his hand because i remember myself being in the hand of god and him speaking to me and every now and then somebody will tell me years ago i had these dreams of me sitting in the hand of god as a little tiny being is that true does that happen and i'm always surprised and go yes that's exactly what happens when god would speak to you about your future and he'd hold you there in his hand or he'd sing he'd sing a song to you he has his own songs he sings to us so it is a big event in heaven when he sends them from himself to the earth oh i can't hear you you can hear me now probably you know yeah i didn't switch it on um steve dropped out but i'm going to ask a couple more questions just because i have them here and i think they're really really good okay so uh one person asked if you could explain the scripture from matthew chapter 7 verses 22 and 23 and it says many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in your name cast out demons in your name done many wonders in your name and then i will declare to them i never knew you depart from me you who practice lawlessness so the person's question is how can people walk in these miracles if they don't know jesus because number one it's a gift uh just like anybody who's high up in the fifo ministry they they may enter into i'm not pointing fingers at anybody i know i'm just saying let's say somebody's high up in the ministry five-fold they enter into a secret life of sin and they keep that sin and they think they're allowed to do it because their gift is so great well that's not even that's not god's not going to say that but when he gives us a gift if he gives you a gift let's say of healing a gift of prosperity a gift of truth and hope a gift of evangelism and he puts that gift in you he won't stop that gift from operating he will not stop that gift he says that the irrevocable he won't take it away from you so that gift will keep right on operating and they may even be doing worse than just sinning they could be doing really horrific things and not telling anybody guess what god knows it all and that's why some will get up there and he'll say depart from me i never knew you because they didn't really make a heart to heart conversion number one they took use and abuse of the gift the gift of influence the gift of other things the gift won't stop working and that's why i tell people don't follow somebody because they have great gifts it doesn't say you'll know the people by their gifts it says you will know them by their fruit yeah so if there's people out there and they're they're sleeping with everybody anywhere they feel like it because they they think that they have the right to they're so powerful in their gift and they'll even tell people if they're caught they say well mike i'm so far above everybody my gift wouldn't work my gift would stop working if god thought i was wrong that's not true either because even lucifer had a gift he had a gift to influence he had a gift to uh to be involved in worship and we all know how some satanic worship is or even that how that still influenced in the darkness he didn't take that gift away so people can operate in their gift and they'd be very accurate but if they're lying cheating stealing committing of gross crimes that god speaks about in the bible they're in trouble with god and i would not follow somebody if i knew that if i knew they were picking people up literally and they do sometimes to sleep with during their meetings and it does happen you dump that person you don't listen to that person now make sure this is a true uh and accurate don't don't don't pick up people and say well i think they're bad it's going to be found out anyway so i would say make sure you look at the fruit of the people are they operating in in holiness are there they have their lives that they're accountable are they loving their family are they living according to the word of god they can't step outside god's guidelines where this is sin sin is sin when you sin you're unrighteous okay but that gift that's why the world has gifts that are powerful they don't know god they have a gift to influence have a gift in music they have a gift and all kinds of things but if what they're doing with that gift is evil that doesn't make them okay to listen to or watch yeah and i think also this is something i'm sure you've seen heard this a lot too this scripture specifically i've seen the enemy kind of try to twist it where people almost become afraid they're like what if i serve god my whole life you know i follow the scriptures i serve him faithfully and all of a sudden he just says depart from me i never knew you and it's something that you know when i was in missions i did a lot of like mission schools raising up youth yeah that was something i was very adamant i was like that is a lie a lie from the pit of hell it is yeah it is a lie because if you're doing if you're doing the work of god the enemy will try to the enemy try to bash you and lie to you the whole time if you know that you love jesus christ you know you're doing what he has called us to do to bring the truth to give the message of the kingdom to influence people to know christ and you're helping them feeding them and you're in the trenches doing stuff for god you know what you're going to know you're going to get greatly rewarded in heaven you will have rewards that scripture has nothing to do with those who know that they're for christ and with christ that scripture is about those who are living their life any way they want to and they think because they have a gift and god isn't saying anything he doesn't care and there's been great people at that there's been people that's happened to you and probably only the mercy of god maybe somebody at the last moment before they died got them to give their christ their life back to christ and repent for that stuff but he's not talking that scripture is not about people who know that they belong to christ if you receive jesus christ as your savior and you know in your heart that's true and you're following the course he put you on then you you are going to have a great time in heaven he will not take your name or the lame's book of life okay that doesn't happen even that doesn't happen that easy he wants you to know that he's proud of you he is blessed by your life you have well pleased him that you're reaching out to others sometimes when you have need yourself the greatest thing to do is reach out to help others now the one thing is not your job to do is you can't go make somebody receive christ you share the truth you let them make that decision then you go on to those who who are reaching out back to you but your words are like seeds in the heart of that person so that would not be you people who think they've committed the um pardonable sin have never committed the impartial sin people who commit the unpardonable sin don't care that they've done it okay they don't care they hate god they hate what he has planned if you're concerned about that you definitely have not done that but if you're out there doing things for god especially like in the mission field that god has so loved people and some of the most highly honored people in heaven are intercessors and those who are in missions amen okay so on that this is a great question the final question that segways from this one and it's um basically it's uh can you share about the crowns will receive in heaven what do they look like and are they different or bigger depending on our rewards they're different they're very different from each other and actually every believer in somewhere in your mountain you might mention you have a crown room you literally have a room that is so beautiful and light just shoots out of i've been several people's uh in their crown rooms in heaven i've seen their crown rooms and there's these beautiful like pillows and things that are very ornamented by the by gemstones from god himself he designs these things and they place those crowns on them certain certain of those crowns you get to wear in heaven when you get there when it says we will throw our crowns at his feet that's something that will happen at one time with all of us there but you can actually wear some of those crowns like the crown of life the soul winners crowns they're all different from each other they're not they're not alike at all that's amazing so cool i can't i can't wait to see them you know it's interesting one just a side comment i was thinking about i'm i've i'm somebody who's been blessed with a very big imagination and there are times you know i i'm i doubt dabble in filmmaking and all kinds of stuff but there are some things that come to my mind that i do not know how to describe in words like i'm like i've never seen this before i don't even know how i would materialize this in the world and part of me is wondering and like there's specific things where i'm like i'm wondering if god is showing me glimpses of certain things like you know almost one-upping me he's like yeah you think that was cool he's like check this out you're going to see this in heaven you know he is definitely right now doing that and in the past when people would get though that they were afr they were not i don't want to say fear fear but they were hesitant to share it with others like paul wouldn't do it in the bible okay paul's like i'm not even going to try to tell people what this is like but in these days of greater creativity and invention some of the things you see may be things that actually begin to happen on the earth this is what i have always told people get a journal please people get a journal just go get you a little journal it doesn't have to be anything fancy and write down what you saw if you can if you can draw it draw it if you know what it does write what it does and then date it and don't get rid of that that might be something god's going to send to the earth and then he may give you more about that thing he's done that with me many times and i do know there's greater inventions light is going to be used in many different ways it's going to be used to color our hair it's going to be used to paint on this i should have done that or i should have presented it the thing that will happen once this whole shift happens and the darkness is like wiped and pushed back and creativity invention will explode god's got things he's waiting to release until this whole thing is dealt with the justice comes why would he end things if he's bringing some of the greatest things ever he's not gonna let the evil have it okay but he will give it to the most unexpected people maybe you're not a professor maybe you're not even good like an electronics or a mechanic or something that won't stop god from giving you something so make sure you get a journal i've got many of them i'll draw it i'll draw it you know and write down if you have an ipad or something you can do that on i'm old school so i've got tons of journals like that i've saved over the years of things i saw in heaven or things i knew would be on the earth this is exciting time if you're young you have one of the best futures of people who've ever been on the earth because of the great things that will be happening and being invented amen yeah and i think so you can said a key thing about light and i think that's been the the the key link between all these things that i'm like i don't know how to describe this is crazy all of them had to something to do with light so that's really cool you said that um kat thank you so much thank you for rolling rolling with it as we experience technical difficulties um so uh obviously revealingheaven.com what are some other ways that people can get a hold of you support your ministry buy your books yeah well this i have two
