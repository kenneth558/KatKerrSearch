Transcriptions are mostly auto-generated by YouTube.com and obtainable by anyone on most videos by pausing that video (best while paused), closing the chat "window", if open, selecting "Open transcript" from the elipse (3 dots) menu often found just above the red "SUBSCRIBE" button.  The "Open transcript" option only appears for certain videos and if they've been on YouTube for enough hours, which is why many videos listed here say "No transcription available yet".

How to copy any YouTube transcript into your computer clipboard (tested only in Linux Mint): make sure the YouTube video is paused and any chat "window" associated with it is closed, then open the transcript as described above, then use sliding scroll button as necessary to display the firstmost transcripted line.  Use mouse pointer and button to highlight starting at the very first timestamp.  Continue to highlight all the transcript that is in view PLUS ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A SCROLL EFFECT.  There is no need to force it to scroll with the scroll button nor to scroll to the end.  Once highlighting covers all the transcript that is in view plus some that scrolled into view, the mouse button may be released but be sure the highlighting remains.  Now the scroll button gets used - using the mouse pointer and button pull the sliding scroll button down until the very last line of the transcript shows.  If you've done all this correctly, the highlighting should encompass the last line of transcription.  Copy to clipboard like you would copy anything else.  Paste into desired destination like you would anything else.

There is a need for this type of lookup tool on Kat's reports of heaven because so many questions to Kat Kerr are submitted after she has already answered them at least once.  This channel seeks to compile transcriptions of her publicly published talks about heaven in a way that people with the need can perform word searches to read what she has already spoken relative to their questions.  I will be happy to have this material published through a more legitimate channel if you'll contact me to inform me of that.

-  Auto-generated by YouTube.com ACCURACY IS AT THE MERCY OF YOUTUBE.

-  IN NO WAY CAN YOU ASSUME ALL WORDS SPOKEN ARE BY KAT!!!  THERE ARE SEVERAL SPEAKERS THROUGHOUT THESE VIDEOS.  YOU MUST DOUBLE CHECK WHO SPOKE WHAT BY PULLING UP THE ORIGINAL SOURCE!!!

-  IN MANY CASES HER WORDS ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO REVELATIONS OF HEAVEN BECAUSE THE LORD LED HER TO SHARE OTHERWISE FOR A TIME.

Very often, two adjacent of these videos belong joined together.  Remember this in case you find your search words near the beginning or end of a video.
